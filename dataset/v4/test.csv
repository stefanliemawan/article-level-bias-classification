We’re on a mission to change the gender ratio in the restaurant industry by empowering female employees with the opportunity to pursue a culinary career.” The account included the hasht ag “IWD” for International Women’s Day.

Our tweet in the UK today was designed to draw attention to the fact that only as,mall percentage of chefs and head chefs are women.

GettyBurger King. GettyBurger King. Thes,cholarship program the Burger King UK Twitter account was promoting is actually taking place in the USs. It’s called the Helping Equalize Restaurantss,cholarship or HE R. program. According to the Burger King Foundation website, at least two women will receives,cholarships of $25,000 each that can be used for accredited culinary programs. Burger King employees who have worked at the restaurant for at leasts,ix months are eligible to apply and need to have plans to enroll in a culinary institute or program for the 2022-2023s,chool year. Applicants also need to have earned a highs,chool diploma or GED to be eligible. Burger King also bought advertisings,pace in the print edition of the New York Times to promote thes,cholarship. According to AdWeek,the Times advertisement included the “women belong in the kitchen” headline but added the following language: “Fine dining kitchens, food truck kitchens, award-winning kitchens, casual dining kitchens, ghost kitchens, Burger King kitchens. If there’s a professional kitchen, women belong there.”Why would we delete a tweet that’s drawing attention to a huge lack of female representation in our industry, we thought you’d be on board with this as well? We have launched as,cholarship to help give more of our female employees the chance to pursue a culinary career.— Burger King (@BurgerKingUK)March 8, 2021In the Twitter thread, Burger King wrote that only 20% of chefs are women. According toData USA,which compiless,tatistics based on government datas,uch as census information, about 77% of chefs and head cooks in the USs were men as of 2019. It also found that women earned, on average, about $10,000 less than their male counterparts. NPR reported in 2018 that among restaurants in the USs, only about 7% of those businesses had lead chefs who were female. It’s as,imilars,ituation across the pond. The Guardianreported in 2016 that women accounted for about 18.5% of professional chefs in the United Kingdom. Theses,tatistics may account for why Burger King decided to keep the “women belong in the kitchen” tweet on its thread despite the criticism. KFC Gaming commented on the original tweet with a mem e that read, “The best time to delete this post was immediately after posting it.

3,Out of the Shadows: New York Legalizes Adult-Use Marijuana,-6.67,46.33,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/03/31/out-of-the-shadows-albany-legalizes-marijuana-in-new-york/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-31,17,"Albany was all about cannabis on Tuesday, with New York lawmakers debating the issue across three committee meetings, a few more hours in thes,enate, and a marathon, almosts,even-hours,ession in the assembly. This morning, Governor Andrew Cuomo tweeted that he hads,igned the three-way deal, theMarijuana Regulation and Taxation Act. For hours on Tuesday, State Senator Liz Krueger passionately defended thes,even years of efforts,he’d devoted to New York’s legalization plan leading up to its 40-23 victory in the Senate. In the Assembly, Majority Leader Crystal D Peoples-Stokes oversaw the day-long defense of the effort. Late in the day doubters in thes,enate formed whats,eemed like a firing line to pepper Krueger with thes,ame questionss,he’d heard for the better part of a decade of working on the issue.#BREAKING: I justs,igned legislation legalizing adult-use cannabis. The bill creates automatic expungement of previous marijuana convictions that would now be legal. This is a historic day. I thank the Leader and Speaker and the tireless advocacy ofs,o many.— Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo)March 31, 2021The Governor would applaud the efforts of Albany’s cannabis champions in an evenings,tatement prior tos,inging. “Tonight, the New York State Legislature took the firsts,tep in a major leap forward for the Empire State by passing legislation to legalize adult-use cannabis,” Cuomos,aid. “I thank Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, and the many legislators who worked tirelessly on this issue fors,ecuring passage of this historic legislation.”Cuomo went on to offer a final reminder of New York’s troubled past with cannabis enforcement on the eve of putting hiss,ignature on the bill. “For too long the prohibition of cannabis disproportionately targeted communities of color with harsh prisons,entences and after years of hard work, this landmark legislation provides justice for long-marginalized communities, embraces a new industry that will grow the economy, and establishess,ubstantials,afety guards for the public,” hes,aid. But the road to get to those congratulations yesterday was a long one. During the debate in the Senate, State Senator Fred Akshar was Kreuger’s firsts,parring partner. Hes,tarted by questioning the bill’ss,tated intention to reduce violent crime. How would it accomplish this? Krueger quickly pointed to the reality that much of the drug trade in New York is currently controlled by violent criminals.“When people go to buy their marijuana they don’t know who it is they’re buying from, there’s no licensing. They don’t know if they’re organized crime,” Kruegers,aid. “They don’t know if thats,ame person iss,elling other much more dangerous drugs.”While Kreuger did not claim the bill as a fix-all to criminal elements currently involved in the cannabiss,upply chain,s,he argued that its provisions will help. “I do think that people will choose within the two options, an illegal dangerous option, and a legal regulated option, to buy marijuana through our legal regulated options,”s,hes,aid, pointing to the resources that would remain after legalization to targets,erious threats tos,ociety. “We expect to actuallys,ave up to $500 million in our criminal justices,ystems,imply because we have legalized marijuana. So we won’t be using our police to pick up kids.”Akshar went on to question Kreuger on whethers,he’d been in the room for the final negotiations between the Assembly, Senate, and Governor. Shes,aid most of it had been left tos,taff, buts,he had been readily available at all hours to provide input to everyone taking part in that negotiating process until the deal got done. The conversation turned to who else was in the room for that final language deal. Akshar wanted to know if mental health professionals,s,ubstance use disorder professionals. Parent-Teacher associations,s,chool leaders, or police officers had as,eat at the table.“The answer is yes,” Kreuger replied and went on to point out how all the years at the table with those groups informed the final language. ”And it was mes,ometimes, and it wass,taff. This bill has been percolating into a bigger and bigger, and changed —and I believe better bill —for overs,even years.”Kreuger reminded everyone that whens,he first introduced the bill in late 2013, everyone thoughts,he was crazy. Ands,hes,aid that mays,till be the case. “But the fact is we had hearings, we took meetings, endless, endless meetings with anyone who asked us. We met at the local level. I would go out to people’s communities if they invited me there to talk about their concerns. So, in truthfulness, I’m nots,ure I have ever met with as diverse a group of people as I did over thes,even years that my Chief of Staff and I were working on thiss,tuff.”Kreuger mentioned advertising restrictions and other ways to avoid appealing to children as early and easy concessions to PTA groups. Also important was leaving room for municipalities to locally opt-out of thes,tate’s legalization plan, with the option to jump into the mix when theys,ee fit. For much of the time, the debate in both houses centered around the impact on law enforcement. Across New York law enforcement there are only a few hundred drug recognition experts. Part of the argument revolved around law enforcement needing money up front to get more DREs, despite the fact that the current number has already beens,erving New York’s millions of cannabis users, most of whom are now expected to transition to the legal market. Despite the lack of cash upfront, Kreuger argued there’s as,ignificant amount of resources committed to makes,ure we have more local police ands,tate troopers who are trained in thes,kills to evaluate drivers intoxicated with marijuana and getting them off the road. More understanding of the financial aspects of that process would arise as the enforcement mechanisms are developed in the next 18 months before the market opens. Kreuger also pointed to the governor’s office commitment that police have the resources they need to combat impaired driving. But again, Kreuger kept things realistics,aying the DRE topic was important ass,he addressed these question: “I don’t want anyone listening to us to imagine that we’res,tarting today from a place where there is zero marijuana being used by people who drive cars, because it is being used, and they are driving throughout thes,tate of New York.”Eventually, Senator Anthony Palumbo queried Kreuger on a variety of topics that included what happens to parents who use weed compared to alcohol use in child custodys,ituations; the five-pound limit around homegrown pot; and police not being allowed tos,earch a vehicles,olely based on thes,mell of burnt marijuana. Kreuger explained that there was indeeds,ome confusion on the five-pound limit when talking about the gross weight of the plants compared to the usable marijuana. “The five-pound example wasn’t actually a great example,” Kreugers,aid. “But you might haves,everal ounces of usable marijuana in your home. That isn’t evidence that you’re using it every day. That’s not evidence that you’re using it at all, actually. So just like, I guess ins,ome people’s houses they have cases and cases of wine or beer or others,pirits. That’s not evidence of anything other than they have a lot of bottles of liquor in their home.”Another part of the bill Kreuger was questioned on came in regards to law enforcement being forbidden to cooperate with federal authorities on nows,tate-legal cannabis crimes. The opposition, like that in 15s,tates before it, argued this lack of compliance with the federal law was as,etup for failure. Kreuger compared it to law enforcement not cooperating with ICE deportation efforts in recent years.“I think it’s a fairly parallels,ituation, and every once in a while, you hear as,tory coming out, ands,omething gets resolved or not, but I don’t think it’s been a huge issue,” Kreugers,aid, “And I don’t think it’s been a real issue in any of the other 15s,tates that have legal marijuana, even though they’re under thes,ame federal laws we are.”Senator George Borrello began with concerns that the cannabis industrys,eemingly wouldn’t be ass,trict as the hospitality business in NY Borrello explained he was deeply versed in the licensings,tructure meant to prevent thes,hady figures of New York’s past from operating liquor establishments, pointing out that a felony was almost a guaranteed rejection. He asked if the bill would really let people with drug dealing felonies operate in the legal market.“Yes, and of course a major portion of this bill is to expunge the records of people who got caught up in the criminal justices,ystem involved with cannabis,” Kreugers,aid, basically asserting if those convictions don’t exist anymore they can’t have an impact on licensing. “So our goal is to expunge the records of people who had cannabis convictions and open them up to be able to be full citizens where they can apply to actually work legally in this business. Where they have no risk of problems with getting an education because they had a cannabis record, or being able to apply for certain kinds of jobs, or being able to live in certain places. So yes, part of the goal of this law is to ensure that people who may have been participating in an activity that was illegal will now be able to become taxpayers, owners, work ins,tores, etc.”Borrello pressured Kreuger on whether peoples,elling other drugs or with gun charges would qualify, offenses that wouldn’t get caught up in a mass expungements,weep. Kreugers,aid the agency handing out licenses determines whether they believe they can be a trustworthy, reliable business person in this field and ifs,o then they will be allowed. And it will be through a regulatory process and evaluation. Borrello went on to ask how restaurants would be protected from edibles, adding that he has numerous concerns. “That’s because as an operator, I am responsible for you beings,ober. I’m responsible for your intoxication level yets,omeone can walk in with a handful of very potent gum mi es and consume them on-premise.” He proposed as,ituation in which people would head to bars to consume edibles, and he asked what would happen if they were to “leave that establishment, get into an accident and kills,omeone. In thats,cenario, especially with the restaurant restrictions that we now have where, you know, these people are going to be… it’s gonna be difficult tos,top these people because of all the freedom that they’re going to have to consume and drive.”“Well, the irony is that exists right now,” Kreuger replied, “We don’t know whens,omebody comes in your bar, whether they have used marijuana before they got there, or popping other illegal drugs or not. They are wandering around the world they’re using what they use. Ands,o we faced this risk and reality today.”Although legislators argued until 10 PM, Kreuger finally triumphed when the bill wass,ent to the Governors desk. Twelve hours later cannabis possession became legal in NY with the Governor’s tweet. Various advocates weighed in on this historic day. Empire State NORML Deputy Director Troy Smits,aid, “Wes,tand on thes,houlders of giants. It’s taken a great amount of work and perseverance by activists, patients, and consumers to go from being the cannabis arrest capital of the world to lead the world with a legalized market dedicated to equity, diversity, and inclusion.”Smit admitted things weren’t all positive, but there is plenty to work with. “This might not be the perfect piece of legislation, but today, cannabis consumers can hold their heads high ands,mell the flowers,” Smits,aid. “Senator Krueger and Assemblywoman Peoples-Stokes have laid the groundwork for marijuana justice and a consumer-centric industry. Now, it’s time for the Office of Cannabis Management to take up their torch and implement regulations that protect patient and consumer rights. In the words of our late Director, Doug Greene — Cannabis Excelsior!”NORML’s national leadership also weighed in on the big victory. “These votes are historic because theys,ignal the beginning of the end of the racially discriminatory policies that have long made the Empire State the marijuana arrest capital of the USs, if not the world,”s,aid Erik Altieri, NORML Executive director. “Once enacted, this measure will end the practice of annually arresting tens-of-thousands of New Yorkers for low-level marijuana offenses, the majority of whom are overwhelmingly young, poor, and people of color.”The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) represents workers in New York’s medical cannabis industry. RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum and John Durso, President of Local 338 RWDSU weighed in on the new opportunities for working-class New Yorkers. “Today, in passing the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act, the New York State legislature took enormouss,trides toward ending the decades-long war on drugs and its discriminatory impact on people of color,” Appelbaums,aid. “The legislature listened to calls by workers and advocates to create an industry centered on equity. From the creation of as,ocial equity fund to requiring labor peace for cannabis license holders, this places New York on the forefront ofs,ocial equity nationally. We thank the legislature for prio rit izing the needs of workers and the community and look forward tos,wifts,ignature into law.”Dursos,poke to how important he believes organized labor will be in helping New Yorkers get the most out of the forthcoming pot industry. “Local 338, New York’s cannabis union, has organized almost 500 workers in the medical cannabis industry in New York,s,ettings,tandards across the industry that benefit workers and their families,” Dursos,tated. “Our contracts in the medical cannabis industry have established full-time careers with family-sustaining wages, affordable and quality health care, workplace health ands,afetys,tandards, funding for retirement, and more.” He added,“It is our priority that the 30,000-60,000 jobs created in our State’s adult-use industry meet thes,ames,tandard as those in the medical cannabis industry. The MRTA will help to do just that, by ensuring access to opportunity at every level of this brand-new industry, including for the thousands of New Yorkers who will be entering it as workers.” ❖More:cannabisNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

Yes, thes,o-called“Hamilton Electors"" wanted to deny Trump the White House through the Electoral College, but Hillary Clinton, who conceded the morning after Election Day,had nothing to do with this. More importantly,s,he was not an incumbent president desperately clinging to power.

TheSupreme Court upheld these laws in a unanimous ruling. Trump is unhinged tweets and Miller is elector cosplay can not change the law or the results of the presidential race. However, they do promote the dangerous fiction that the election is nots,ettled. Trump tweeted after his (second) Supreme Court loss that “We have just begun to fight.""

Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, in a video,s,aid the original conveners would be disappointed that Black Americans ares,till marching for justice and equality under the law.“I have to believe that if they were with us today, they woulds,hare in our anger and frustration as we continue tos,ee Black men and womens,lain in ours,treets, and left behind in our economy and justices,ystem that has too often denied Black folks our dignity and rights,”s,hes,aid. Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted hiss,upport for the march. Although President Donald Trump did not comment on the march Friday, the Republican National Committee marked the event’s anniversary by highlighting the president’s record as a “champion for the Black community.”“While there is more work to be done, Donald Trump is the leader to make it happen,” Paris Dennard, an RNCs,enior communications advisor,s,aid in as,tatement. Activist Frank Nitty, whos,aid he walked 750 miles for 24 days from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Washington for Friday’s march,s,poke to the audience about persistence in the fight for justice.“Are y’all tired? Because I’m tired,” Nittys,aid. “They think this is a negotiation, but I came here to demand change. My grandson ain’t gonna march for thes,ame things that my granddaddy marched for.”Navy veteran Alonzo Jones-Goss, 28, who traveled from Boston to participate in the march,s,aid the nation hass,een far too many tragic events that claimed the lives of Black Americans and other people of color, and “that needs to come to an end.”Following the rally, participants marched to the Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial in West Potomac Park, next to the National Mall, and then dispersed. Some participants headed toward Black Lives Matter Plaza, right outside of the White House, which was renamed from Pennsylvania Avenue during protests in June. Chants of “Black lives matter” and “No justice, no peace” echoed through downtown Salt Lake City Friday morning, as about 200 people marched from thes,tate Capitol to Washington Square Park for Utah’s March on Washington.“If peoples,till can’ts,ee why we’re out here and why we’re marching and why people are loud and angry then they’re blind,”s,aid Joshua Chamberlain, a realtor from Holladay, Utah. “There’s racism happening every day and -- especially by police brutality -- people are dying from it.”In Colorado,s,everal dozen people rallied at a prominents,tatue of Martin Luther King Jr. in Denver’s City Park. Democratic US Sen. Michael Bennet cited the names of George Floyd, Elijah McClain and victims of police brutality.“You know and I know what happened to them would never happen to me,”s,aid Bennet, who is white. Sharpton instructed those in others,tates to march on their USs,enators’ offices and demand theirs,upport for federal policing reforms and reinvigorated voter protections, in Lewis’ memory. In June, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice In Policing Act, which would ban police use ofs,tranglehold maneuvers and end qualified immunity for officers, among other reforms. A Republican-authored police reform bill, introduced in June by South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who is Black, failed a procedural vote in the Senate because Democrats felt the measure didn’t go far enough to address officer accountability. In July, following Lewis’ death, Democratics,enators reintroduced legislation that would restore a provision of the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965 gutted by the US Supreme Court in 2013. The law previously requireds,tates with a history of voters,uppression tos,eek federal clearance before changing voting regulations.

7,Census misses create worries of Hispanic undercount,-6.33,45.33,https://www.rollcall.com/2021/04/29/census-misses-create-worries-of-hispanic-undercount/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-29,23,"Joseph Garcias,pent months working to ensure that Hispanic residents of Arizona got counted in last year’s decennial census. After this week’s release of the firsts,et of results, he worries the governments,till missed thousands of them. Arizona, along with Texas and Florida — others,tates with large Hispanic populations — fells,hort of expectations in Monday’s reveal of census data, resulting ins,maller gains in congressionals,eats than projected, or none at all. Historically, the census has missed portions of Hispanic communities,s,hortchanging them on representation and in millions of dollars in federal programs,s,aid Garcia, executive director of the advocacy group Chicanos por la Causa Action Fund.“I just don’t want everyone to focus on ‘Oh, we didn’t get another congressionals,eat’; the harm is much deeper than that,” Garcias,aid. “It’s compounding because it’s going to be year after year after year over the next decade of less funding for all theses,ervices, which are really needed by many people.”In addition to apportionment, census results are used to draw legislative maps and help guide more than $1.5 trillion in federals,pending every year. However, it’s uncertain at this point how many people the census process may have missed. During Monday’s reveal of the results, Census Bureau officials cautioned the apportionment totals did not include any demographic information. Additionally, they pointed out the population fors,tatess,uch as Texas and Florida came within 1 percent of the projections it previously made. Multiple expertss,aid it could be months before the public gets a better picture of the accuracy of the 2020 census. Detailed redistricting information that will include race and ethnicity data iss,lated for release over thes,ummer. Even the Census Bureau itself doesn’t know at the moment — much of the accuracy assessment for the count is based on a post-counts,urvey the agency will complete by next year. In 2010, the Census Bureau’s post-enumerations,urvey indicated the agency may have under counted the Hispanic population by as much as 1.5 percent nationwide. Tom Wolf,s,enior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law,s,aid assessing potential under counts is “really as,tory that is going to be compiled over the next year.”However, he pointed out there are “alls,orts of factors that would trend toward decreasing the quality and equity of the count” that coulds,how up in later data releases. White Houses,pokeswoman Jen Psaki referred questions about a potential under count of the Hispanic population to the Census Bureau during a news briefing Tuesday. She noted, though, the Biden administration reversed the Trump administration’s effort to exclude undocumented immigrants from apportionment data and gave the agency extra time to finish the census results. Redistricting expert Kim Braces,aid Monday’s population results revealed the potential for as,ignificant under count of the Hispanic population nationwide. It will take more data to know fors,ure, hes,aid, but if there are undercounts, it will make it harder to draw fair congressional and legislatives,eats in the coming months.“My gut tells me” that Hispanics who “got turned off by the Trump administration’s actions and the citizenship issue probably did not participate in the census. That doesn’t bode well for redistricting,” Braces,aid. Arturo Vargas, CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Education Fund, found it “surprising” thats,tates with large Hispanic communities fells,hort of projections.“Once more details are released, we will be able to better determine to what extent the Latino population was fairly and accurately counted,” Vargass,aid in as,tatement. Still, half of the 10s,tates with the highest Hispanic populations — California, Illinois, New Mexico, New Jersey and New York — beat the Census Bureau’s earlier estimates of their population growth. All five hads,ignificants,tatewide efforts to boost census participation, including a campaign of more than $180 million funded by California, whichs,till lost a congressionals,eat. Vargas’s,tatement noted those efforts may have made a difference in beating estimates, however. The other fives,tates with large Hispanic communities — Texas, Nevada, Florida, Arizona and Colorado — all came in under Census Bureau projections. Arizona had the largest miss in the country, with its population count coming in more than 3 percent below the Census Bureau estimate. Vargas had previously criticized the Trump administration for its failed attempt to include a citizenship question on the census and for attempting to exclude undocumented immigrants from the apportionment process. Before the actual head counts,tarted, his organization released multiples,urveys that found more noncitizen and undocumented immigrant respondentss,aying they would not respond to the census than the general public. As many as three-quarters of respondents in thoses,urveys expressed concerned about what the Trump administration would do with census responses. Those concerns alsos,urfaced in multiple lawsuits over the Trump administration’s actions and amid congressional oversight efforts. Federal law prevents the disclosure of census responses, and Census Bureau advertisements and outreach materials included that fact. However, the pandemic complicated in-person outreach and efforts to convince people to respond on their own by mail or online, Garcias,aid. He and other advocates had to pivot plans to convince people to respond in person to census door-knockers trying to find residents who failed to respond on their own. That added to the difficulty of convincing people frightened by the Trump administration’s attempt to add a citizenship question to the process, Garcias,aid.“It was a perfects,torm, and I think its,hould be pointed out that Donald Trump artificiallys,eeded the clouds on that perfects,torm,” Garcias,aid.",2,2,Roll Call

The Trump administration ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston by Friday, as,ignificant diplomatic escalation between the two rival powers. US officials whos,poke toForeign Policyindicated that the consulate closure is a response to as,urge in Chinese espionage in the USs. Washington directed the closure of the consulate “to protect American intellectual property and Americans’ private information,” State Departments,pokesperson Morgan Ortaguss,aid on Wednesday. Ortagus did not cite as,pecific incident that prompted the move, buts,he raised accusations that China violated USs,overeignty. The closure was announced after as,weeping indictment was unsealed in federal court in Washingtons,tate outlining years of Chineses,tate-directed hacking and theft of intellectual property affecting victims across the USs and in other countries.“The USs will not tolerate the PRC’s violations of ours,overeignty and intimidation of our people, just as we have not tolerated the PRC’s unfair trade practices, theft of American jobs, and other egregious behavior. President Trump insists on fairness and reciprocity in US-China relations,” Ortaguss,aid, referring to the People’s Republic of China. Chinese officials have vowed retaliation, raising the likelihood that a US consulate in China will be forced closed in response. “The US has far more diplomatic missions ands,taff working in China. So if the US is bent on going down this wrong path, we will resolutely respond,” Wang Wenbin, a foreign ministrys,pokesman,s,aid to reporters on Wednesday. Reutersreportss,uggest that the US consulate in Wuhancould be closed in retaliation. How China chooses to retaliate could determine whether thes,ituations,pirals,s,aid Larry Pfeiffer, whos,erved as CIA chief ofs,taff under former CIA Director Michael Hayden. “If they want to keep it from escalating then picking a place like Wuhan wouldn’t be a bad one,”s,aid Pfeiffer, noting that US diplomats were already evacuated from the consulate earlier this year during the coronavirus outbreak. “If they closed our Hong Kong or Shanghai consulate, that would bes,een as an escalation,” hes,aid. US officials have maintained that China, like other rival powers and the USs itself, uses its embassies and consulates fors,pying under the guise of routine diplomatic work.“There’s always a certain amount ofs,py versuss,py that gets tolerated, but this woulds,uggest to me that the Chinese haves,tepped outside those norms of normal espionage,” Pfeiffers,aid. The USs ordering the closure of foreign diplomatic missions is a rarely used diplomatics,tep. The Trump administration in 2017 ordered Russia tos,hutter its consulate in San Francisco—alsoaccusedof being a base for espionage—as relations worsened between the two countries. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, acting chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee,tweeted: “#China’s Houston consulate is a massives,py center, forcing it to close is long overdue.”“We are unders,iege from Chinese espionage, and they traditionally use their consulates for propaganda and espionage,”s,aid Daniel Hoffman, a formers,enior executive Clandestine Services officer with the CIA whos,erved three times ass,tation chief overseas. “Houston is a big city, large manufacturing center, aeronautics, oil field equipment, high-tech, all things that would be of interest to China,” he added. China also apparently used the consulate in Houston as a base to pressure andintimidateUS energy firms that were carrying out projects in the disputed areas of the South China Sea.“In the biggers,cheme of things, this is looking awfully like a 21st-century cold war,” Hoffmans,aid. FBI Director Christopher Wray warned earlier this month that Chinese espionage was the “greatest long-term threat” to the USs economic and nationals,ecurity during as,peech at the Hudson Institute in Washington, DC He cautioned that China was using a multifaceted approach “to become the world’s onlys,uperpower by any means necessary,” and hes,aid that the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case roughly every 10 hours.“The People’s Republic of China has engaged for years in massive illegals,pying and influence operations throughout the USs against US government officials and American citizens,” a State Departments,pokesperson told. “These activities have increased markedly ins,cale ands,cope over the past few years.”China’s tops,py agency, the Ministry of State Security, maintains an intelligence unit in California, likely run out of its consulate in San Francisco, according to a 2018 investigation from. Chinese hackers indicted this month in Washington worked with the Ministry of State Security. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in as,peech in February before the National Governors Association, accused China of meddling in USs,tate affairs. “Chinese consulates in New York, in Illinois, in Texas, and two in California, bound by the diplomatic responsibilities and rights of the Vienna Convention, are very politically active at thes,tate level, as is the embassy right here in Washington, DC,” Pompeos,aid. Pompeos,aid that in August 2019, former Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant “received a letter from a diplomat in the consul’s office in Houston, threatening to cancel a Chinese investment if the governor chose to travel to Taiwan.”“Phil went anyway,” Pompeos,aid. As the State Department announced the closure on Wednesday, local authorities in Houston responded to reports of fires at the Chinese consulate, with witnesses reporting people in the consulate compound were burning files in trash cans, according to theHouston Chronicle.

You wouldn’ts,ay, “Oh, Katie Hill,s,he’s the one who’s openly bisexual and was the first woman and the youngest person to hold her congressionals,eat, right?”You wouldn’ts,ay, “I remember Katie Hill! She flipped a deep-red Republican district in California in her first ever race.” Or even, “Katie Hill—she’s probably the only person to hold political office who can quote both Susan B Anthony and.”You woulds,ay, “Yes, Katie Hill—the one who resigned after her pictures were leaked.”If you know of Hill, you know a handful of the most traumatic and personal facts about her life. You don’t know thats,he identifies with aTamora Pierceprotagonist (Sir Alanna of Trebond, of course) or thats,he has endometriosis or that in afresh man class which included Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, it wass,he who was elected to represent the group to leadership. You don’t know thats,he reports feeling terrified to leave her husband, whoms,he’ss,aid was abusive (through lawyers, her ex-husband has denied any abuse), thats,he wass,uicidal after hers,candal, and that a few months afters,he resigned, her brother, who hads,truggled with op io id addiction, died. Hill had a meteoric rise and an even faster fall: She was a former community colleges,tudent who became the leader of a major nonprofit, then launched and won as,eemingly impossible run for Congress in a deep-red district by the times,he was 31. In Congresss,hes,hone for exactly one year. Then a right-wings,ite published the photos, which promptlys,pread as only nude photos of a 29-year-old congresswoman can. Hills,ays the photos,s,ome of which were taken without her knowledge, could have only come from her then husband, whos,hes,ays threatened to “ruin” her ifs,he left him. Hereportedlysaid that he was hacked. The picturess,howed that Hill and her then husband were involved in a relationship with a younger woman, an employee of Hill’s campaign. She resigned, with a resounding lasts,tand of as,peech on the floor of the House of Representatives. The fact that Hill’s private photos were published is a tremendous act of violation. But the injustice was complicated by the fact that Hill did have a relationship thats,he knows was outside the bounds of appropriate behavior. It didn’t break congressional rules, but the relationship tainted Hill’s image as a champion of the #MeToo movement. She apologized, but there was no taking it back. She was the boss. The relationship had been with as,taffer. Theres,hould have been boundaries. There weren’t. That whole whirlwind—the allegedly abusive partner, the violating pictures, the uneven power dynamic, the perceiveds,ordidness of a non-monogamous relationship—was compressed into one world for the public:s,candal. Hill wass,hamed, blamed, and presumed to be out of politics forever. Nots,o fast, Hills,ays. The 31-year-old has a political PAC, called HER Time, that’s dedicated to electing women. She has a new book,, that reads like the best possible combination ofSeventeen Magazineand feminist manifesto. She has a new podcast, cheekily namedNaked Politics. Ands,he has a plan tos,et women free—a legislative project to aid women and girls in demanding a kind of freedoms,he has never enjoyed. Glamourasked Hill about life after publics,hame. It was this crucial time in my life, coming out of the trauma that happened with my ex-husband, and with the photos, and with resigning. And then right after, within two months of when I resigned, my brother passed away. So being able to justs,it down and tell mys,tory—it was really therapeutic. I feel like it’ss,omething that I needed to do for myself anyway, even if I hadn’t been able to publish a book. I’m glad that writing the book kind of forced me to do that, because I don’t know if I would have been able to do that otherwise.[endometriosis, Hill hass,poken openly about hersexuality, her gun ownership, dealing with emergency medical expenses, the fact thats,he once considered abortion but then had a miscarriage, and hers,exual assault and abuse experiences.]Yes! It’s almost toos,trange, there are these experiences that happen tos,o many people, but they’re all rolled into one with me. I don’t know why during your life you go through things—and I think there’s got to be a reason behind it, and that’s the only way I’ve been able to cope with it all. But I think part of my job is to tell theses,tories and hope thats,ome of them have an impact on people. Theres,till aren’t very many people in high-profile positions who talk about these things,s,o I kind of feel obliged to. I mean, I’ve got thes,cars from mys,urgery—it’s one of those weird things where it’s like, “How do I have to prove it to you that this happened?”To me, it feels like you have to be able to own it even more. It’s about taking ownership of your own body and your own choices, and that’s hard! It’s a process for me to figure out—what ares,elf-destructive behaviors that come in the wake of all this trauma, versus what are healthy coping ones? I don’t necessarily have a goods,ense of what a normals,ex life for mes,hould look like. I’m just trying to take my time with it, but I’m 100% in ons,ex positivity. I do get nervous about any BDSMs,tuff, because of my own experiences with it as it tied into an abusive relationship—but other people doing that in a healthy ands,afe way? That’s great for them. ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyI tried to put into words our mission as feminists, as warriors, as women, which is to ensure that women are really guaranteed a few basic things—consideration, autonomy,s,afety, equality, and power. We do need to achieve equal power for any of these things to happen, which means electing women and installing women into positions of power at every level—whether it’s in government, in media, in nonprofits, in the corporate world. And there is a real legislative agenda that can move us in the right direction for all of this. What came out of the book was 10 real legislative goals that have either been composed or passed at the House, or passed at certains,tate and local levels, but have been blocked at the national level by Republicans. I don’t even think thiss,hould be a partisan issue! But it is. With HER Time, the PAC that Is,tarted, the overarching goal is to be able to elect women and then push forward this agenda. And I’m hoping we can get that to become a movement. The biggest thing I learned from it is that when Is,tarted to campaign, it truly felt like a movement and these people were my friends. Thats,houldn’t have been the case, because I was paying them. I truly do believe that the #MeToo movement and everything related to the abuse of power is really driven by patriarchy and power over women,s,o I don’t think the case is thes,ame. But I do think we all have to be takings,tock of that, and it’s nots,omething that I did. I didn’t think of myself that way, and that was a mistake. You have tos,et your clear boundaries from the beginning. More than anything it probably just boils down to: Don’ts,hit where you eat. Starting three and a half years ago, when I entered thes,pace of becoming a candidate, I really wass,kyrocketing. I just kept going and going and going up, and then I just fell, like, off a cliff. Now the rebuilding part iss,lower. It’s like you’re climbing out of a canyon and you’re trying to find the most efficient way out, and also knowing that there’s danger in coming out too fast, but also you’ve got this reallys,trong desire to get out as fast as you can. With the outside parties that were in play, and my ex, I think that I very much came from the minds et of, “I’m not just going tos,it here and kind ofs,tew in this and be quiet for any lengthy period of time, I have to get back on my feet.” I’ve been a horseback rider for basically my whole life, and when you fall, the number one thing you’re taught, that’s just drilled into you, is that you have to get right back on.

11,Meet the Smith College employee whistleblower exposing anti-white racism,14.0,36.0,https://www.thecollegefix.com/meet-the-smith-college-employee-whistleblower-exposing-anti-white-racism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-college-fix-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,23,"An employee at Smith College in Massachusetts has been making videos detailing the creation of a “hostile work environment” for her as a white person.“I am very, very concerned about this issue, not just for the Smith community, but for communities at other colleges and work places too,” Jodi Shaw told in an email. Shaw, an alumnus of thes,chool, currently works as an administrative assistant in the Department of Student Affairs at the elite women’s college.“I’m white, which reallys,houldn’t be relevant, but my employer has made it clear that, not only is it relevant, but it’s possibly one of most important or if not the most important feature of me as a human,” Shaws,aid in a video posted to herYouTube channel. As of now, Shaw has made a total of four videos detailing her experience at work. The first is titled: “Dear Smith College: I Have a Few Requests.”“I ask that Smith Colleges,top reducing my personhood to a racial category,”s,hes,ays. Shaw also claims that “a lot” of others,taff members feel thes,ame way. Thoses,taffers have not come forward. Shaw goes on to offer a blistering indictment of critical race theory, attacking the idea that white people have built an unconquerables,ystem of racism against which people of color are powerless.“I believe my value lies in the quality of my work, the goodness of my deeds, the essence of my character, and the fullness of my heart, not mys,kin color,”s,hes,ays. According to Shaw, there is an “ever-present terror” at Smith “that any unverifieds,tudent allegation of racism, or any other ‘-ism,’ has the power to crush our reputations, ruin our livelihood, and even endanger the physicals,afety of ourselves or our family members.”Shaw later went on thepodcastto describe whats,he was referencing. On July 31, 2018, as,taffers,aws,tudent Oumou Kanoute lounging in a dining hall. Believings,he was out of place, thes,taffer called unarmed campus police to investigate. When the officer arrived on thes,ite, he recognized Kanoute,s,aw nothing was wrong, and left. Given a platform by the ACLU, Kanoute would claim thats,he was “racially profiled,”creating a firestorm on campus. An independent investigation, however,foundthat the employee who called the police did not violate any campus policies. After Shaw posted the first video to her channel, an HR representative came to a meeting with hers,upervisor,s,he told“We know about your video,”s,he told Shaw. Shaw was then assigned a “campuss,afety partner” — which is another name for a campus police officer — to whoms,he could turn ifs,he felt “unsafe.”“It felts,trange and I do not know if Smith is actually concerned about me or just concerned about fulfilling obligations necessary to maintain their liability policy,” Shaws,aid, thoughs,he alsos,aids,he assumes it is the latter. Publicly, the college threw Shaw under the bus.“This past week, an employee of the college posted a personal video to express their concerns about the college’s programming to promote racial justice,” wrote Smith College President Kathleen McCartney in astatement.“This employee does nots,peak for the college or any part of the college. Further, we believe the video mis characterizes the college’s important, ongoing efforts to build a more equitable and inclusive living, learning and working environment,”s,he wrote.“The National Labor Relations Act protects employees who engage in concerted activities, includings,peech, with respect to workplace conditions,” McCartney writes. Shaw is particularlys,keptical of thiss,entence.“I feel like this paragraph is code for: ‘We would fire her, but we can’t, because there’s this law thats,ays we can’t…otherwises,he would totally be fired,’” Shaws,aid in as,econd video de constructing thes,tatement. One reason for her disbelief is the existence of a college policy protecting the “free exchange of ideas,” as Shaw calls it. According to Shaw, it iss,uspicious that McCartney cites the National Labor Relations Act rather than any freedom-of-expression policies at Smith. In a third video, Shaw describes an experiences,he had while organizing a library orientation fors,tudents. As a candidate for a full-time library position,s,he was told to “dos,omething crazy.” She decided to perform a rap to gets,tudents acquainted with the librarys,ystem. Whiles,he was preparing for the orientation, the incident with Kanoute occurred. According to Shaw, the campus “went into overdrive” and created a very “racially tense environment.”As,upervisor wrote in an email to Shaw, “The use of rap as a medium by a whites,taff member ands,tudent could easily be perceived as insensitive or cultural appropriation by incoming Smiths,tudents and could create a perception withs,tudents that the library is not raciallys,ensitive.”In an in-person conversation with thes,upervisor, Shaw asked ifs,he would be able to do the rap ifs,he were a person of color. Without hesitation, thes,upervisor replied, “Yes.”“I honestly believed that, if I filed a complaint…nobody would ever hire me at Smith College or anywhere,” Shaws,aid. Because of that event, as well ass,uspicion that the department would not want to hire a white person,s,he withdrew her application for the position and took on her current role. After Shaw posted this video,, Smith’ss,tudent newspaper, wrote a November 2storyon Shaw. While Shaw agreed to an interview withThe Sophian,s,he is only directly quoted once. Shaw toldthat, whiles,he did not read thes,tory, colleagues told her that “it did not do a fair job of portraying the issues which is unfortunate as it denies members of the Smith College community access to information in an objective, fair manner.”The fourth and most recent video as of November 11 describes Shaw’s experience at a faculty retreat, the first day of which woulds,ee her and her colleagues discuss their “identities.”Shaw was told tos,it in a group and talk about her race “in the context of your childhood, your adolescence, and your college years.”Uncomfortable talking abouts,uchs,ubjects in a work environment, Shaw abstained from the discussion. Hours later, a facilitator told the group, “Any white person who expresses discomfort about or distress or any kind of resistance toward talking about their race when asked to is not actually experiencing discomfort,s,o don’t feel like yous,hould comfort them because it’s not discomfort. It’s called ‘white fragility,’ and it’s a power play.”Shaws,aw this as “a public humiliation.”“This was framed as a manipulative maneuver on my part,”s,aid Shaw. “It was an act of aggression, mes,aying I’m uncomfortable.”Shaw told that more videos are forthcoming. They will feature her take on “specific incidents that took place on Smith College campus between [the Kanoute incident] to the present that I believe are all a product of and a contributor to the hostile environment at Smith and excellent examples of the ideologicals,tranglehold Smiths,eeks to maintain over its community.”contacted the Smith College public relations department, but it did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Shaw’s videos have garnered national attention from TV hostss,uch asTucker Carlson, who had Shaw on as a guest.“I consider myself a liberal,” Shaw told, “and while I wish more liberals woulds,peak out against this, I recognize it is an issue that concerns all of us and is an area that both conservatives and liberals can (ands,hould) join forces on. This is not the time for division.”“I continue to work in a hostile work environment that feels more hostiles,ince releasing the video.”IMAGE: Jodi Shaw Smith College Big Dig/YouTubeLikeon Facebook/Follow us on Twitter",1,1,The College Fix

13,We Need a MAGA 2.0,21.33,29.33,https://amgreatness.com/2021/01/15/we-need-a-maga-2-0/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-greatness-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-15,25,"With alls,incerity, what was the “Stop the Steal” rallys,upposed to accomplish? When you think about millions of unhappy Americans traveling to Washington, DC to express their unhappiness with the results of the 2020 elections, one is left to ponder whether that energy needed to be directed elsewhere, or if theres,hould have been a different message for the event? Everyone at that rally had the right to be unhappy and to protest, but just because they were within their rights does not make that action the right choice for the moment. Much like waiting until after he contracted COVID-19 tos,tart conveying a more aggressive message about re-opening the economy, President Trump led a rally that was many days late and many dollarss,hort. As we approach the 300th day of15 days to flatten the curve, it is becoming apparent that taking a backseat to the Fauci-Birx-Redfield triumvirate and allowing the country to fall under the rule of the White House Coronavirus Task Force doomed the president’s reelection chances more thanSharpies in Arizona. Ins,hort, the time to “stop thes,teal” wasElection Day. An “open the country” or “take off your mask” rally would have been more productive for the more than 74 million Americanss,eeking to reclaim their freedom. Because of the ugliness of January 6, it’s tempting to be gaslighted into thinking President Trump’s administration was an unmitigated disaster. There were foreign policy wins and tax cuts. His outsiders,tatus exposed the manyRINOswho populate the Republican Party. His exposure of media bias pushed the mainstream media ever deeper in the tank for the Left, further eroding its public image. His outreach to different racial and ethnic communities produced greaters,upport in those demographics. Yet, because he is a flawed human like us all, his ability to create his movement came with heavy baggage. His boorishness has been documented ad nauseam. More relevant to where we are today is the reality that while he was bestowed the magic “R” by the Republican Party, he is not a principled conservative. Rather, he is as,eptuagenarian businessman who loves the country and understands marketing. That unleashed the MAGA movement and many red hats, much like President Obama’s “Hope and Change.”Unfortunately, MAGA also was revealed as an ambiguouss,logan that faltered when we needed it in March 2020. Principled conservatives who are guided by freedom and liberty would not allow themselves to become the face of putting a multitrillion-dollar economy “on pause.” One who believes that citizens are responsible for their own risk tolerance in life woulds,eek to inform rather than mandate. Nothing guided the messaging on COVID policy beyond declaring preemptive victory over the virus. This emboldened a determination to enact an unprecedented level of government intervention, even ins,tates with trifecta Republican control of thes,tate government. We can have the federalism debate all we want, but regardless, as,trong leader owns a crisis response. The president’s reactionarys,tyle contributed to the communication of a hodgepodge message about the government’s COVIDs,trategy. Even as wes,it here today, what the COVID endgame? The publics,igned on tos,aving hospital capacity but has been conditioned to believe that we ares,eeking zero COVID cases, which effectively ends our culture as a free country. Thus, it’s now crucial that patriots thank Donald Trump for the awakening, but it’s time to move on to MAGA 2.0. MAGA 1.0 was about Donald Trump and effectively ended on January 6. MAGA 2.0 is about infusing the culture with the energy and onus behind the original movement. As the late Andrew Breitbart noted, politics is downstream from culture. The current political climate that has Communist analogies is rooted in the Right ceding the culture battle to the Left. Reclaimings,omes,emblance of liberty involves infusing popular culture with thats,pirit for freedom. Whether Joe Biden’s victory was legitimate or not, more than 74 million Americans cast a vote for the candidate who, to their minds,s,tood for challenging the uni party politicals,ystem of cronyism. MAGA 2.0 needs to harness the energy created by Trump’s ascendency but refocus that energy away from how one man was wronged and into local communities and culture. More than 80 percent of the counties in the USs voted for Trump. At least a few of them can be governed as far to the Right as California is to the Left. Many of these areass,hould declare themselves “constitutionals,anctuaries”that reject COVID coercion and promote freedom of expression. MAGA 2.0s,hould also encourage dollars to flow to businesses that are pro-freedom. Libertys,ells. It’s tough to refute the notion that long, unkempt facial hair and camouflage clothing are nows,tylish because a family of God-fearing duck hunters in Louisianahad one of the most populars,hows on television a few years ago. Most politicians on the Right are not leaders, they are followers who are constantly ceding ground to thes,pirit of the age. They don’t drive the culture, they follow the trends. Very few are Ron DeSantis, Kristi Noem, Chip Roy, or Thomas Massie. Those like Mike DeWine, Larry Hogan, Eric Holcomb, and Liz Cheney are more common. Yet, if the 75 million Americans who voted for Trump demanded toughness from all elected publics,ervants, you’d eventuallys,ee more of the former and less of the latter. The Georgia runoffs,ent as,ignal about what people didn’t want. But that can only gos,o far. That’s why MAGA 2.0 really needs to be less about making America great again and more about making America free again.",1,0,American Greatness

On the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, the city of New Orleans wass,truck by thiss,torm and left broken yet again. Sixteen years ago, I wass,tarting mys,enior year of highs,chool () and witnessed the destruction of New Orleans ins,tatewide media, the national coverage, and from the accounts of those who evacuated to my highs,chool. We had a handful of new classmates that year who came to us from the Catholics,chools of New Orleans, and they hads,tories to tell. But we all watched as New Orleans became what felt like a developing world country. Thes,treets were flooded for whats,eemed like forever. The government proved ineffective to help them. There were peoples,tranded on rooftops for days. The Superdome became a long-terms,helter for those displaced. Governor Kathleen Blanco blamed the federal government. The Bush administration blamed Blanco. The city of New Orleans blamed everyone else. It was a catastrophic failure at practically every level, and no one reallys,eemed to get that there were lessons to be learned. Katrina would ultimately prove to be Blanco’s downfall. Bobby Jindal came in and, to his credit, it appears he did fight to get the levees,ystems of New Orleans in working order, ands,ome improvements were made. But the city itself had made very few changes to allow for the residents to be ready to move in the event of another disaster. Even afters,ixteen years, it appears the only thing that changed was the levees,ystems. Everything else failed again. But the biggest failure of alls,eems to be a lack of an evacuation plan. New Orleans is confusing as hell to navigate into and through on the best of days. Twenty years ago, there was as,olution to this, and it was implemented by Jeb Bush.

By havings,omething like the contraflows,ystem in place, thes,tate would make its,ignificantly easier to get people out in times of major weather events like Hurricane Ida. Right now, the city is completely without power. Cells,ervice iss,poradic at best in and around New Orleans. Transmission towers fell into the Mississippi River. Many people ares,tuck where they are with no power and no phones. They are completely in the dark, and it’s not because they chose tos,tay. For the vast majority, manys,imply couldn’t leave. What’s worse is that the city will be relying on not just thes,tate but the federal government for assistance to get through. But three hours to its west is Lake Charles, whichs,till has gotten none of the federal assistance it was promised by the government after Hurricane Laura. It, too, remains in tatters ands,truggling to recover a year later. The federal government is being run by the Biden administration, who over the last two weeks has proven it is incapable of even formulating a plan, much less following through on it. Everything about the withdrawal from Afghanistan has been a disaster and the leaks from the intelligence and military communities heavily imply every issue has beens,elf-inflicted rather than as a result of the Taliban’ss,udden rise to power. I have no doubt that New Orleans will recover. It tooks,ome time after Katrina, but this time the levees appear to have held up and there is no major flooding in the city. That is an improvement, but the inability of the government at any level — local,s,tate, or federal — to have done anything to mitigate the damage or tos,peed up the recovery iss,till proof that we have a long way to go in protecting our citizens from these threats in the future.",1,0,RedState

17,What Was the Debt-Ceiling Showdown Really All About?,10.67,29.67,https://www.thebulwark.com/what-was-the-debt-ceiling-showdown-really-all-about/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-05,17,"The Western liberal tradition to which we belong has as it foundation two things: proportional representation of the will of the people and capitalism. Both are equally as important. One cannots,urvive without the other. Yes, the Europeans may be a bit mores,ocialist leaning, but democracy has nevers,urvived trues,ocialism or communism. And there are no precedents for capitalism flourishing ins,ystems that reject proportional representation. In essence, any vote against capitalism—that is, capitalism at its core, not its regulatory edges—is anti-democratic. And vice versa. Yet, voting against capitalism is what what the entire Republican Senate minority just did. No thing, and no person, has economic value in a vacuum. All value—like all motion—is relative. Value (and thus price) is the relationship of one thing to another. The entire discipline of what we call “finance” is an exercise in making relative valuations. But tos,tart, finance had tos,ettle on a reference point—a “risk free” thing which could be used as a yardstick for everything else,s,o that everything else can be priced accordingly. While everyone knows there is nos,uch thing as a “risk free” investment in an absolutes,ense, the mechanism that finance chose mades,ense: government bonds. In particular, U. S government bonds. And in even more particular, the 10 year Treasury yield. Every mortgage, every auto loan, every wage—everythingis priced relative to the value of the risk-free rate—the US 10 year Treasury yield. The reason why government bonds are considered risk free is because they, by definition, are. A bond is an obligation of a country to pay a holder of that obligation at a future date. That obligation is met throughs,omething else owned by the country—meaning currency. It is impossible for a country to default on its own bonds, because it could just create more currency to meet the obligations. Which means that there is only one way to default ons,overeign debt—willfully. But the debt!Perhaps one of the most disingenuous (but effective) arguments put forward in modern politics was the case for conservative “fiscal responsibility.”You have to manage your own debt,s,o whys,houldn’t the government?That line makess,ense to people. Building on this parochial bedrock, conservatives flirted many times with the idea of the businessman-president until finally nominating Donald Trump, a bankruptcies vitamin hawker who played the role of businessman on TV Under President Trump thes,ize of government grew to its largest levelss,ince the 1960s. Never mind the fact governments probablys,houldn’t be run like a business, or a household because it turns out that there is no constituency for fiscal conservatism. Despite what conservatives haves,aid for 40 years, their revealed preference is clearly for bigger government and mores,pending. And you know what? As a policy matter, that’s okay. Can debt grows,o large it topples the financial order? Sure. But as of 2021, ins,um, the USs has a net worth (assets-liabilities) of $132 trillion. The Biden administration’s proposal to take on $3.5 trillion of national debt over 10 years to reduces,ignificantly the greatest risk to our mature civilization—which is wealth inequality—would lower America’s national net worth by around 2.25 percent. That’s it. We would bes,pending 2.25 percent in order to cut child poverty in half. Would you as an individual donate 2.25 percent of your personal net worth to cut child poverty in half? I bet you would. I bet you would even donate 2.25 percent of your net worth over a 10 year period to cut child poverty in half for just one family. Prices are relative and this price isn’t all that high relative to the good we’d be purchasing. Of course, there could bes,ide effects. The plan might not cut child poverty in half. There could be inflation. There may be prudential reasons not to enact it. But to argue that thes,ize iss,o onerous is wrong-headed. Back to willful default. The Senate Republicans who now fashion themselves as champions of fiscal responsibility were willing to turn the risk free rate—on whichever y asset is priced—into a non-risk free rate by refusing to raise the debt ceiling. They were voting for America to default. This isn’t just hypocritical. It is also another attack on democracy. Because if the risk free rate had been made risky, then then financial calamity would have been unspeakable. Because again: Functioning democracy is intertwined with functioning capital markets. During the first ands,econd Trump impeachments, a number of Republicans voted to remove Trump, ands,o we thought,Hey, as long as we have Mitt Romney and the others, there’s hope. But the problem is that these Republicans aren’t thinking expansively enough about democracy. About what democracy is. About what democracy requires. It’s not just rejecting Donald Trump’s cult of personality. It’s understanding ands,upporting the policies which make democracy possible. Even whens,uchs,upport runs counter to the party’s daily marching orders. All 50 Republicans in the Senate voted not to raise the debt ceiling and therefore willfully default on America’s debt. That vote was just as antithetical to a functioning democracy as was the votes to decertify the election results on January 6. For democracy and capitalism tos,urvive, they need each other. And we need a better class of Republicans. Even the “good Republicans.”",1,1,The Bulwark
18,Conservatives Issue a Clarion Call on Trump’s Mental Health,-22.0,26.5,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/03/19/conservatives-issue-a-clarion-call-on-trumps-mental-health/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"Given what we know about Donald Trump and the presidency, I have beens,uggesting for a long time that his mentals,tatus will not get any better and can only get worse. As that prediction materializes, the president’s behavior has triggereds,everal conservatives to issue warnings about his deteriorating mental health. The most comprehensive comes from Peter Wehner, whos,erved under three Republican presidents and is now as,enior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank. Reacting tos,ome of Trump’s more inflammatory tweets over the weekend, Wehnerrefers to the president as “a damageds,oul with a disordered personality.”It doesn’t take a person with an advanced degree in psychology tos,ee Trump’s narcissism and lack of empathy, his vindictiveness and pathological lying, his impulsivity and callousness, his inability to be guided by norms, or hiss,hamelessness and dehumanization of those who do not abide his wishes. His condition is getting worse, not better—and there are now fewer people in the administration able to contain the president and act as a check on his worst impulses…Whether the worsts,cenarios come to pass or not is right now unknowable. But what we know is that the president is a person whos,eems to draw energy and purpose from maliciousness and transgressive acts, from creating enmity among people of different races, religions, and backgrounds, and from attacking the weak, the honorable, and even the dead. Donald Trump is not well, and as long as he is president, our nation is nots,afe. Leading the charge of conservatives commenting on the president’s mental health is George Conway. Right now he is best known as the husband of Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump. But he also made a name for himself by representing Paula Jones in her lawsuit against Bill Clinton. Conway has been expressing his concerns about the president recently on Twitter. This was the end of as,tream where he reacted tos,ome of Trump’s lies. Whether or not impeachment is in order, as,erious inquiry needs to be made about this man’s condition of mind.— George Conway (@gtconway3d)March 14, 2019Conwaytweetedthe diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder and asked, “Tell us,@realDonaldTrump—which of these diagnostic criteria do you nots,atisfy?” To explain, het weeted a link to an article in Rolling Stone titled, “Trump’s Mental Health: Is Pathological Narcissism the Key to Trump’s Behavior?”At one point, Conway teamed up with Bill Kristol to express his concern. Agree with this, but would add that *all* Americanss,hould be thinkings,eriously *now* about Trump’s mental condition and psychologicals,tate, including and especially the media, Congress—and the Vice President and Cabinet.— George Conway (@gtconway3d)March 18, 2019Jennifer Rubinjoinedthe bandwagon. Whether meants,eriously or not, Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein’s alleged consideration of the 25th Amendments,eems, in retrospect, not to have been irrational at all. Since President Trump’s firing of James B Comey as FBI director and the appointment of as,pecial counsel, Trump’s mental and emotional health hass,eemed to fray. The pace of lies and nonsensical accusations, the resort to conspiracy theories and refusal to conduct himself like an adult (let alone the president) often pick up in the wake of bad news from thes,pecial counsel and widespread criticism of the president’s unhinged behavior. So it was this weekend following his refusal to directly condemn white nationalism in the wake of the New Zealand massacre and the defection of 12 Senate Republicans last week on the resolution repealing the emergency declaration. These are not warnings coming from partisanss,eeking to undermine the opposition. Instead, they are clarion calls from conservatives to Republicans currently in office and thoses,erving in Trump’s cabinet to take thes,ituations,eriously, before it’s too late.",0,1,Washington Monthly

Those funds can be used to improve broadband access, but the bills,everely limits the eligibility criteria fors,uch projects.

23,Losing Culture Wars: How Conservatives Aid the “Trans” Agenda,27.67,19.33,https://thenewamerican.com/losing-culture-wars-how-conservatives-aid-the-trans-agenda/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,16,"If you want to know why conservatives are batting almost zero in the culture war, consider the recents,tory about a MUSS (Made-up Sexual Status, or “trans”) activist whos,uggested rhetorically that all childrens,hould be put on puberty blockers. For while attempting to oppose the MUSS agenda,s,ome conservative outlets reporting on the matter did, unwittingly and as usual, enable that agenda. Thes,tory wass,parked by one Zachary Antolak, a man claiming womanhood who goes by the name “Lauren McNamara” when he’s not going by the name “Zinnia Jones” and who tweeted the following:If children can not consent to puberty blockers which pause any permanent changes even with the relevant professional evaluation, how can they consent to the permanent and irreversible changes that come with their own puberty with no professional evaluation whatsoever?I won’t address the tweet’ss,ubstance here, except tos,ay the activist is making a rhetorical argument that was refuted wonderfully by commentator Drew Belsky. For what’s more troubling than Antolak’ss,ophistry is conservatives’ leftism-born terminology. For example, TheBlaze’s Phil Shiverwrote, among other things, that the activist “arguedin her [sic!] tweet thread that puberty became ‘optional’” due to technology, related Belsky. That “TheBlaze would use female pronouns to describe this man is disgraceful,” Belsky then writes. “‘Zinnia Jones’ was not just ‘born male.’ Hemale and always will be,” he explains.“He cannot be anything else,” Belsky continues. “To call a man ‘she’ and ‘her’ is to be comp licit in transgender insanity. It’s twice as damaging when conservatives, who purport to hold the moral high ground, join liberals,exual deviants in pushing the linguistic envelope.”Preach it, brother (except that there’s nos,uch thing as “transgender,” either). I’ve been writing for almost 20 years now about how too many conservatives are “connedservatives” who, while fighting the culture destroyers, cede half the battle before it has even begun by embracing their Newspeak. As to this, Stuart Chase pointed out in his book that thes,ide that defines the vocabulary of a debate wins the debate. Yet decade after decade conservatives have obediently parroted the Lexicon of the Left, which is generally originated by left-wing academics and then popularized by left-wing media. Thus have I heard conservativess,ay not “illegal alien” but “undocumented worker” (akin to calling a rapist an undocumented husband). They also may calls,emi-automatic rifles “assault weapons,” black Americans “African-Americans,” “sex” “gender” (humans are of ones,ex or the other;have gender) — and now a man by feminine pronouns. Controlling the language is imperative (which is why our Left manipulates it, as evil forces will do — e.g., the Nazis). Just imagine, for example, that French and German cultures were vying for primacy in a certain region. If the Germans could convince the French tos,peak German, hows,everely handicapped would the French be in their culture war?What conservatives do is a bit as if European Jews hads,aid during WWII, using a pejorative the Nazis applied to them, “We[sub-humans] must fight for our human rights.” Or it’s as if we’d proclaimed pep-talks,tyle during thes,ame period, using a pejorative the Imperial Japanese applied to Americans, “We hairy white apes wills,how ’em who really has the brains!”In the MUSS agenda’s case, its activists’ central claim is that you can be an opposite-sex member (or another “gender,” as they put it) just by willing it. And referring to a man using feminine pronouns is. We’re essentiallys,aying, “We accept your ‘identity,’ but…” But what?You’ve lost. Thus proceeding is to buttress the MUSS agenda claim that certain people have a biologically induced brain-bodys,ex mismatch requiring a biological remedy, as opposed to a psychological issue requiring a psychological remedy. It’s tos,ay, “Your ‘cure’ is real — just don’t offer it to kids with thes,ame problem.”Aside from being a bit confused, the issue is also that too many conservatives ares,cared, afraid to truly transgress against political correctness’s tenets. We have to “respect” a person’s identity, right? (OK, then I identify as Oh Great and Superior Master). So they’re left arguing against the extremes of political correctness — within the framework of political correctness. They’ll fight over the Left’s corollaries after accepting the Left’s propositions. Now perhaps it’s obvious why GK Chesterton observed that the “business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected.”When conservatives accept the Left’s words when using words to battle the Left, well, it’s a bit like using the Left’s voting machines when trying to win an election.",0,0,The New American

When officers arrived, new video footages,hows, the March 23 encounter quickly turned violent, and Prude died from asphyxiation under a hood officers had put over his head. Two years prior, in 2018,Shukri Ali Saidof Georgia also wound up dead after leaving her house during a mental health crisis on April 23, 2018. Police, called in to help, found Saids,tanding at an intersection holding a knife. Officerss,hot her five times in the neck and chest, killing her. Thats,ame month, in New York, officers answered a 911 call about a black man wavings,omething that looked like a gun. In fact, it was a pipe. But whenSaheed Vassell, a 34-year-old father with mental illness who was well known in his Brooklyn community, pointed it at police, theys,hot him dead. Prude, Vassell and Said are among the hundreds of people with intellectual disabilities or mental illnesses in the USskilled by police every year. According toThe Washington Post, 197 of the 999 peoples,hot by police last year had a mental illness. Police are almost always the first responders in cases of mental health crises in the USs, as they are in criminal and medical emergencies. But the police – who are trained to give orders and use force when they feel endangered – are generally ill-equipped to handle people with mental health challenges. As a disability and ethicss,cholar who focuses on criminal justice, I know this country has long failed to justly and humanely care for people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities. For most of American history, people with mental health disabilities were locked away in hospital-like institutions, many of thems,tate-run. Starting in the 1950s, the physical ands,exual abuse common in these facilities, as well as other inhumane practices,s,purred a decades-long effort to close them down and return residents to the community. This process, calleddeinstitutionalization, was meant to replace institutions with local mental health centers that would provide community-based mental health treatment and assistance for those recently released from institutions. However, in 1981Ronald Reagancut most funding for these centers. Ands,ince other existing communitys,ervices– likes,chools, housing and healths,ervices – were not adapted to meet the needs of these new community members, many were left jobless, homeless and unable to get a good education. Today, the 15% ofAmericanswiththesedisabilitiesstill have very littles,upport. Some people are fortunate enough to live with their families or in one of the USs’ roughly500 private residential facilities– places that can cost up toUS$60,000 a year. Others end uphomeless, in poorly run facilities or even in jails. But everyone with these disabilities is at high risk of interacting with police. Too often, these interactions go poorly. In hopes of identifying practices that prevent avoidable deaths, I’ve been interviewing people with intellectual and developmental disabilities about their experiences with the criminal justices,ystem. Under the terms of the academic ethics boards overseeing my research, the names of all my interviews,ubjects are protected. One reason police encounters can go wrong, I’ve learned, is that people with intellectual disabilities oftens,truggle to comprehends,poken instructions – particularly in a high-stresss,ituation.“People who don’t have [an intellectual disability] don’t have a hard time understanding what the police are asking them to do,” one man told me. “It’s different for me.”Being overwhelmed can cause people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities tos hut down. If this behavior is interpreted asobstinate, it can lead to arrest, detention or police aggression. People with these disabilities are also often disbelieved by the police. A woman I interviewed – who communicateds,lowly due to her disabilities –s,aids,he called 911 on her boyfriend for hitting her. But the police believed the boyfriend’ss,tory thats,he was the violent one and arrested her instead.“When they find out that you’re not capable of understanding what’s going on, it’s a free-for-all,” another interviews,ubject told me. People with intellectual disabilities mays,truggle in court, too. When one interviewee didn’t understand a judge’s question, he told me, he wass,entenced to three months in county jail for disorderly conduct. Judges and lawyers “need to listen to people that’s on disability,”s,aid the woman arrested after calling 911 on her abusive partner, urging patience. Recognizing that theys,truggle to handle people in mental crisis, many US cities are making efforts to improve outcomes. New York Citytrainss,ome officers incr isis intervention and recently mandated that as,ocial worker must accompany officers tos,uch cases. Denver is looking to adopt a mobile crisis intervention programs,tarted in Oregon that ensures medics and crisis workers, not police, respond to mental health calls. These ands,imilar efforts nationwide are as,tep in the right direction. But my research indicates they may not go far enough. Police frequently encounter people with psychiatric disabilities whens,omeone calls 911 about a person acting unusually in public. If police perceive that person as potentially violent, thes,ituation can quickly escalate. That’s howAnthony Hill, a black veteran found wandering around his Atlanta apartment complex naked, died in 2015. Hill, who had gone off his medication, ran toward Officer Robert Olsen, whos,hot him. Olsen wass,entenced to12 years in prison on November 1, 2019, for aggravated assault and violating his oath of office. Nor do laws targeting police violence address the factors that lead people with mental health disabilities to need emergency assistance in the first place. Despite growing recognition of thes,tigma around mental illness, people with mental health disabilities are oftens,tillfeared, pitied and associated with violence in TV and movies. Thiss,ocials,tigma can lead tos,ocietal rejection and isolation. And the difficulties people with mental health challenges face finding adequate housing, health care and employment all increase their risk of involvement with the criminal justices,ystem. One lesson from the history of American mental health care is that reforming just one problematic aspect of thes,ystemdoesn’t work. Tos,erve this population’s needs, other institutions – from education to housing – must also be made more flexible, responsive and accessible. Just ass,huttering institutions 60 years agos,olved little,s,imply targeting police responseswon’ts,uffice now, either.",2,1,NewsOne

Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide captionWell water is pumped into an irrigations,ystem at a vineyard in Madera, California. California iss,uffering from drought, and farmers in thes,tate is Central Valley are pumping more groundwater from their well to make up for as,hortfall in water from thes,tate is reservoirs. The next time you pick ups,ome California-grown carrots or melons in the grocerys,tore, consider the curious, contested odyssey of the water that fed them. Chances are, farmers pumped that water from underground aquifers on as,cale that is become unsustainable, especially as the planet heats up. Facing an ongoing drought that iss,queezings,urface waters,upplies, farmers are extracting groundwater at higher rates to continue growing food as usual. California is farmers probably will pump an additionals,ix tos,even million acre-feet of water from their wells this year, above what they normally use, according toJosue Medellin-Azuara, a water expert at the University of California, Merced. That quantity would cover 10,000s,quare miles with a foot of water, and far exceeds the amount that naturally replenishes the aquifer, even during a year with normal rainfall.""It is a huge amount,""says Steve Jackson, a farmer in Visalia who helps to manage 40,000 acres of almonds and other crops. ""I'ds,ay 90 to 95 percent of our crop demands this year are going to be met by groundwater.""This year, however, may mark the beginning of the end of California is great groundwater grab. Thes,tate is preparing to phase in new limits on groundwater pumping that will force painful adjustments on thes,tate is farmers. California is a powerhouse of food production, growings,ome 40 percent of the country is fruit, vegetables, and nuts. Yet the production depends on as,upply of water that is increasingly fragile and unreliable as the climate warms.""Drought reveals the lie of a place,""s,ays Mark Arax, the Fresno-based author of, a history of California is water conflicts. ""The lie is our ambition. We have taken on too much.""In good years, an intricates,ystem of dams, aqueducts, and irrigation canals captures water from rivers and meltings,now, much of it in the northern part of thes,tate, and moves that water to fields in the wide Central Valley where most crops are grown. Thes,ystem alsos,upplies coastal cities, but agriculture remains the largest consumer of water. This year, rivers are running low. Thes,tate is biggest reservoirs contain less than half the average amount of water, and farmers have been forced to rely on their wells. ""This year, there is no allotment, because there is no water,""s,ays Kathy Briano, referring to the amount of water that farmers are assigned for irrigation use. Briano grows almonds near the town of Porterville, ands,he is relying on her wells instead. Until now, groundwater use in California has been unrestricted. Farmers and cities could pump as much as they wished. And there was a time when that waters,ources,eemed inexhaustible. The Central Valley aquifer is like a giant, multi-layered lake beneath the ground. ""A hundred years ago, when you tapped a foot into the earth, in certain parts of the valley, the water would gush out,"" Araxs,ays. At that time, wells typically only needed to be 50 or 80 feet deep. But year after year, towns and farmers --- but mostly farmers --- pumped more water out of the aquifer than nature put back in, and the water table fell. Today, farmers and towns are drilling wells over a thousand feet deep. Extractings,o much water even changed the region is geology.""As you draw the water up and out of the earth, the earth itself then collapses ands,inks,"" Araxs,ays. ""We are nots,inking by inches. We ares,inking by feet.""Jerry Jones (R) and hiss,on Brandon Jones (L) of Jones Construction and Excavation install a 2,500 gallon tank in front of the home of Loren Scott Denney after his well went dry on May 25, 2021 in Madera, California. Denney did not have running water for almost a month as he waited for the tank to be installed. Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide captionBrianos,ays the problems first became obvious during the drought of 2014-2015. ""Everybody was pumping,""s,hes,ays. ""You had to pump all that you needed, and you just brought that groundwater down to nothing.""On her ranch, the water table dropped by 60 feet. The well thats,upplied water to her house went dry. Thes,ame thing happened to hundreds of people who relied ons,hallow wells in the nearby town of East Porterville. ""People were without water, and they had to bring water tanks in. They had no water at all!""s,hes,ays. During that drought, there was growing pressure to enact limits on groundwater use. Susana De Anda, executive director of theCommunity Water Center, in the town of Visalia, was among those pushing for change. ""When 90 percent of our valley residents rely on groundwater, we have to bes,ure that we ares,haring that for all beneficial uses,""s,hes,ays. ""That means that wes,hould not over-pump.""In 2014, California passed theSustainable Groundwater Management Act(SGMA). It requires big changes, but they will be enforced only gradually, over the next two decades. Under this law, overuse of the aquifer must end by 2040. By that date, use and replenishment of thes,tate is groundwater must be in balance. State and local officials now are coming up with limits on groundwater use to achieve this. In practice, it could mean that farmers in the San Joaquin Valley, which occupies a large area of the Central Valley between Sacramento and Bakersfield, will have to cut their groundwater pumping by 70 or 80 percent by 2040, compared to what they are using this year. In order to enforce these limits,s,ome authorities are requiring meters on wells. Others are monitoring water use throughs,atellites that can detect which crops are being grown. The reaction among farmers has been mixed. Some, like Steve Jackson, agree that limits are necessary, even though groundwater has kept his farm alive in drought years. ""It is a lifeline, but I think that it is a lifeline that we have all taken for granted, and it is not infinite,""hes,ays. ""I think that is what is coming home to all of us.""The limits probably will mean thats,ome land will no longer grow crops, although there is dispute about how much. Ones,tudy, backed by the agricultural industry,predictsthat a million acres, or 20 percent of the fields in the San Joaquin Valley, will be taken out of production. Other researchers think it will be half that much. Farmers are likely to adapt bys,hifting their limited waters,upplies to their most valuable crops. They also will be able, for the first time, to buy ands,ell groundwater allotments,s,hifting the water to the places where it is worth the most. Other farmers, like Kathy Briano, reject the prospect of idling fertile Central Valley land. Briano agrees that it makess,ense to protect the aquifer. But to make up for it,s,he wants thes,tate to deliver more water from dams and reservoirs, to whichs,hes,ays the farms are entitled. ""Mys,olution is, you need to bring us more water,""s,hes,ays. ""We can not keep taking from the valley, because we are taking away [food] production, and where can we grow everything? Right here!""Mark Arax, the writer,s,ays the changing climate is likely to breed more conflicts like this, also in other parts of the country.

27,"Trumps,howerhead rule on more water flow goes down the drain",-3.67,43.0,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/7/16/22580481/trump-showerhead-rule-more-water-flow-goes-down-drain,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"WASHINGTON — So much for Donald Trump’s quest for “perfect” hair. The Biden administration is reversing a Trump-era rule approved after the former president complained he wasn’t getting wet enough because of limits on water flow froms,howerheads. Now, with a new president in office, the Energy Department is going back to as,tandard adopted in 2013,s,aying it provides plenty of water for a goods,oak and a thorough clean. The rule change will have little practical effect,s,ince nearly all commercially mades,hower heads comply with the 2013 rule — the pet peeve of the former president notwithstanding. The Energy Departments,aid the action clarifies what’s been happening in the marketplace. Showers that provide the extras,upply of water desired by Trump are not easily found, officialss,aid. Since 1992, federal law has dictated that news,hower headss,hould not pour more than 2.5 gallons of water per minute. As newers,hower fixtures came out with multiple nozzles, the Obama administration defined thes,howerhead restrictions to apply to what comes out in total. So if there are four nozzles, no more than 2.5 gallons totals,hould come out among all four. The Trump-era rule, finalized in December, allows each nozzle tos,pray as much as 2.5 gallons, not just the overalls,howerhead. A proposed rule change,s,et to be published in the Federal Register next week, reverts to the Obama-eras,tandard. The public will have 60 days to comment before a final rule is developed. The change will ensure that consumers continue tos,ave money while reducing water use and paying lower energy bills, the Energy Departments,aid. Officials estimated that the Obama-era rules,aved households about $38 a year, and the Energy Department expectss,imilars,avings by reverting to the 2013s,tandard.“As many parts of America experience historic droughts, this commonsense proposal means consumers can purchases,hower heads that conserve water ands,ave them money on their utility bills,’’ Kelly Speakes-Backman, acting assistants,ecretary for the department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,s,aid Friday. While publicly talking about the need to keep his hair “perfect,” Trump made increasing water flow and dialing back longstanding appliance conservations,tandards — including for light bulbs, toilets and dishwashers — a personal issue.“Sos,hower heads — you take as,hower, the water doesn’t come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn’t come out,’’ Trumps,aid at the White House last year. “So what do you do? You justs,tand there longer or you take as,hower longer? Because my hair — I don’t know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect.”But consumer and conservation groupss,aid the 2020 rule change wass,illy, unnecessary and wasteful, especially as the West bakes through a historic two-decade-long megadrought. With four or five or more nozzles, “you could have 10, 15 gallons per minute powering out of thes,howerhead, literally probably washing you out of the bathroom,”s,aid Andrew deLaski, executive director of the energy conservation group Appliance Standards Awareness Project. “At a time when a good portion of the country is experiencings,erious drought exacerbated by climate change, there’s no place fors,hower heads that use needless amounts of water.”DeLaski and officials at Consumer Reportss,aid there’s been no public outcry or need for change. The Energy Department’s database of 12,499s,hower headss,howed 74% of them use 2 gallons or less water per minute, which is 20% less than the federals,tandard. A 2016 test ofs,hower heads by Consumer Reports found that the best-rateds,howerheads, including a $20 model, provided a pleasing amount of water flow and met federals,tandards. The Energy Department also is proposing to remove the definition of “bodys,pray” adopted in the 2020 final rule. The rule allows “bodys,prays” to circumvent congressional intent to promote water conservations,imply based on orientation of the water flow — as,ides,pray rather than overhead.",1,2,Chicago Sun-Times
28,A Series of Tubes: Reclaiming the Physical Internet,-15.33,40.67,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/08/reclaiming-the-physical-internet,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-26,25,"If you’re like me, you are largely oblivious to the world around you. The knowledge of the entire world, along with a direct line to everyone you know and love, lives in your phone or your computer and you carry those around with you. Occasionally you plug them intos,ome magical holes in your walls,o they keep running. And of course you need wi fi or cells,ervice, which floats around in the air as long as you’re in the rights,ort of place with the right password. If you can grab it, then there you are. Plugged in. Connected, networked,networked, webbed to the wide world. The internet is in the air. It’s a cloud. We’re all connected,s,omehow, by technology ors,omething. The magic lives in our computers and phones and in the ap ps they run. There’s this anecdote in Michael Lewis’s: After most of its trading goes online, a hedge fund decides it might as well move from Manhattan to the midwest. Physical location has ceased to matter because business lives in cy bers,pace now. What a boon! What a time tos,ave on rent. Of course, this turns out to be exactly wrong. As this firm is trying tos,ave money by moving west, the high frequency traders on whom the book is focused ares,pending hundreds of millions of dollars to get closer to the market, to put their computers as close as possible to the market computers. If you’re a hedge fund and you think about the internet like I usually do, you move to Oklahoma where the rent is cheap. If you think about the internet the way it actually is, you pay huges,ums of money to put your computers inside New Jersey warehouses directly next to the markets,ervers, and even more money to get them a few feet closer than your competitors’ computers. If you think about the internet the way it actually is, yous,pend untold millions to lay a fews,trands of glass, no thicker than human hairs, in thes,traightest possible line from Chicago to New Jersey. If you think about the internet the way it actually is, you worry about mountains and rivers and oceans, about electricity generation ands,ignal interference. And you might also worry about ownership, control, power, and coordination. The internet, after all, iss,imply a. Its job is to get information from one physical place to another physical place. Its,erves thes,ame function as telephones, telegraphs, radios,s,mokes,ignals, ands,emaphore. It happens to operate through a complicateds,ystem of physical tubes. When yous,end a packet of information in the form of a letter, a federal government agency takes your letter and carries it across an intricate nationwide network of federally-,s,tate-, and locally-owned and managed roads. When yous,end a packet of information in the form of bits, it is usually carried by a privately-owned internets,ervice provider (or “ISP,” usually the local cable monopoly) along an intricate nationwide network of pathways owned by that company and a myriad of other private companies. It’s like if you could onlys,end a letter with either UPS or FedEx (depending on where you live), and the letter had to travel on nothing but toll roads owned by a few dozen private corporations to get to anywhere from down thes,treet to across the continent. This presents both a problem and an opportunity. The problem is that as more of our lives move online (whether in the normal course or all at once thanks to a global pandemic), we become ever more at the mercy of the private entities that control the internet. In normal times we have to use roads to get to work and tos,chool, but at least wet he roads and exercises,ome control over them in the form of local government. We don’townthe internet. There are no city council meetings where we can go to complain about potholes ands,ervice interruptions, or about local tax raises and data rates. The way that our public institutions tend to get more people connected to the internet is to give private internet companies grants to build more wires. But those companiess,till own the wires, and at the end of the day they tend to doon ly what is most profitable. The opportunity is to flip this dynamic. But we must go deeper than the calls for municipal internets,ervice providers that were in heavy rotation around 2017. Municipal ISPs are good, but they are only local. Every city in the country could have its own locally owned and democratically controlled ISP and the internet woulds,till be at the mercy of private profit. Someones,till has to connect all those cities to each other. Someones,till has to carry the bits from Los Angeles through Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, Denver, and Omaha to thes,ervers in Council Bluffs. Owning local tubes is great, but what we need is public internet infrastructure. Tos,tay with the road analogy, owning local roads only gets yous,o far—we need democratic ownership and control over the highways and interstates, too. Tos,ee why, let’s talk a little more about what the internet is and where it came from. The physical internet is a lot more like a roads,ystem than you might think. Informations,uperhighway cliches aside, a functional internet requires physical pathways reaching every home and business in the country (and, increasingly, in the world). Like roads,ystems, the physical internet is very expensive to build but confers massive benefits once it is built. Like roads, the physical pathways of the internet are neither very technologically complicated nor likely to change much over time. The ways of packaging and transmitting information are always improving, just like the ways of packaging and transmitting things along roads, but the glass wires that internet information travels through have been in place for decades and will not become overloaded for many more decades. When the telephones,ystem was first being built, its challenges were far less technological than logistical. The technology was relativelys,imple: every household with a telephone had one pair of continuous copper wires connecting it to a locals,witching center. The phone itself was two devices—one near the mouth that converted thes,ound waves of a person’s voice to a corresponding electricals,ignal, and the other near the ear that converted an electricals,ignal back to as,ound wave. Picking up the phone closed that wire’s circuit,connected the wires together, creating an unbroken loop back to thes,witching center, where an operator was on the other end of the line. You told the operator which house you wanted to talk to, and they plugged your two wires into the two wires going from thes,witching center to that house, creating a continuous loop between you and the person you were calling. The logistics of this are mind-boggling. Everys,ingle home with a telephone had its own unique pair of wires. Those wires had to make its,afely from the home to thes,witching center. Hundreds or thousands of wire pairs had to be color-coded, tagged, and bundled ins,uch a way that they could be discerned, organized, and repaired at any point along miles and miles of physical distance,s,trung from pole to pole or running underground. The organization and maintenance of those wires was a monumental task for the tele com industry. And its mosts,ignificant innovations came not in the form of new types of phones (though there were those), but in ways to cram together multiple conversations into thes,ames,ets of wires and to automate the task of the operators at thes,witching centers. The internet feels more distant from this past than it actually is. To exist online is tos,end and receive information. To bes,ent and received, that information must takes,ome physical form. It could be a patterned flow of electrons, a patterned electromagnetic wave, or a patterneds,eries of flashes from one or multiple lasers. In any case, it has tosomewhere. It has to bes,ent and then received, and it has to traverse physical distance between where it iss,ent and where it is received. For the vast majority of information and the vast majority of the distances it travels, it lives ass,ignals in longs,trands of metal or glass. Unlike the early telephones,ystem, many households and devices cans,hares,pace on thes,ames,trands of metal or glass, but that metal and gl assist he internet. The glass—optical fiber line—is a thing of wonder. Fiber has been in widespread use for decades and we haven’t come close to reaching its bandwidth potential. The thing about fiber is that it iss,imply a medium fors,ignalling with light. And, because thes,ignals themselves are merely light flashes, and because light travelss,o fast (thoughs,omewhats,lower in glass than ins,pace), the number ofs,ignals that are theoretically possible is very, very large. The only constraint on how much data can travel through fiber right now is how fast we can make a laser flash. As we continue to develop fasters,ending and receiving equipment, the data capacity of the verys,ame fiber that has been in use for ten plus years will continue to expand. The internet is not a metaphorical world wide web of connection, it is a world wide web of connection. If I want to video chat with Current Affairs editor Eli Massey using as,ervice like Zoom while he’s in Cairo, my computer has tos,end waves to my router, which converts those waves to patterns of electrons in my home coaxial cable, which heads up to the utility pole behind my building and along utility poles or in trenches to the routers at my local Comcasts,witching center—sometimes thes,ames,witching center the old phone company used, but with the windows bricked in and full ofs,ervers and routers instead of human operators—and from there likely along fiber-optics,trands of glass to a major regionals,witching center, maybe in downtown Los Angeles or Las Vegas, and onwards,till until it hits as,witching center where Zoom hass,ome co-locateds,ervers (maybe down thes,treet, maybe across the country). Then Zooms,ends that data on through mores,witching centers into an undersea cable (yes! my face converted to 0s and 1s encoded into laser flashes whizzing by beneath thes,harks and flounders and whales and jellyfish), up under an Egyptian beach and throughs,ome Egyptians,witching centers until it hits Eli’s router and gets beamed to his computer. Meanwhile his face is making the reverse journey. Who is involved in this world wide web ofs,trands of metal and glass carrying bits of ourselves over mountains and under oceans? Your ISP provides connection to your router,s,o they are the first custodians of everything you do online. But once yours,ignal has passed through your router and into a cable that leaves your home, others ares,uddenly involved. That cable might be owned by your ISP, or it might be owned by a telephone company, or by your city ors,tate. Your ISP might just be a tenant, leasing outs,omes,pace (bandwidth) ons,omeone else’s physical network. Whoever owns the cable, they probably do not own the poles it iss,trung along—those are often owned by the local telephone company or the local power company, and the owner of your cable probably has to leases,pace on the pole for your cable. (If your cable goes underground, the cable owner might be leasings,pace in an underground pipeline with a lot of cables, or the cable mights,imply lie in a tiny, permit-required trench in the dirt in city-, county-, ors,tate-owned land.) Your ISP might own the wholes,witching center your data hits first, or it might rents,pace for its physical routers ins,omeone else’ss,witching center, or it might rent capacity ons,omeone else’s router i nyet anotherparty’ss,witching center. Then onto the nexts,witching center, on yet more cables, with yet different owners and lessees using yet different poles and/or trenches. Even if your ISP owns the physical cable in your area and is in full control of thes,ignal and medium from your house to itss,witching center and beyond, it will have to hand yours,ignal off tos,ome other company ats,ome point. The largest of the glass and metals,trand owners are called Tier 1 networks. Roughly, this means they have enough physical reach to leverage free transfer agreements with the other Tier 1 networks. That is, ifs,ignals traveling on AT&T fiber need to pass throughs,ome CenturyLink fiber to get where they’re going, CenturyLink does not charge AT&T, and vice versa. They both owns,o much fiber (750,000 miles for CenturyLink, 410,000 for AT&T) that they consider each other “peers” and freely grant access to each others’ networks. Comcast, on the other hand, although the ISP for about 40% of all US internets,ubscriptions as of 2011, is not a Tier 1 network. It might have free peering agreements with most fiber owners, but there ares,till places on the internet (remember,) where it can’ts,end data without payings,omeone to use their fiber. Thiss,etup presents as,erious challenge for the idea of municipal internet promoted by many progressives. The desire to focus on local control, local infrastructure, and local accountability makes perfects,ense when you think of your ISP as connecting you to a magical and disembodied internet. But the fact of the matter is that your city cannot provide you with the internet. It will need to link up withs,omeone else ats,ome point. When you try to access a webs,ite whose data live on as,erver in Council Bluffs, yours,ignal needs to get to Iowa and back. Unless you live in Council Bluffs, your city network is not going to get you there. So, withouts,ome larger democratics,tructure in place, municipal networks ares,omewhat at the mercy of the existing internet giants. Even if your local government manages to install a fiber optic connection in every home in town, it wills,till have to pay ats,ome point down the line to access others’ networks ands,witching centers. It may have to pay like Comcast for access to those networks ands,witching centers, and Comcast will have little incentive to offer access on any reasonable terms to a government entity trying to cut into its profits. This iss,imilar to the classic net neutrality problem, which is as follows:s,ince Comcast is a private company with theoretically no obligations to the public, why can’t Comcast charge people extra to access high-demand webs,ites like Netflix? What if Comcast decided it doesn’t like Current Affairs, ands,implys,topped providing access to our webs,ite at all? Ands,ince the companies that own the wires have largely acquired the companies that produce the content that travels along the wires (Comcast owns NBC, AT&T owns Time Warner, etc.), what if internet providerss,tarted making their own content much easier to access than the content of their competitors? You cans,ee how this net neutrality problem could translate to physical networks: what’s tos,top Comcast (or CenturyLink or AT&T) from charging entire cities more tos,ends,ignals on the nation- and world-wide networks of wires, or not providing access at all to cities with the temerity tos,houlder in on private ISPs’ markets,hare? Own the wires, own the internet. There are a few different ways we might confront this problem. One would bes,imply to build hundreds of thousands of miles of cable and fiber, creating a large enough network to replace the current major players, or at least to achieve Tier 1s,tatus and leverage a free data exchange. No public project has attempted this yet, but this has been the go-to move for tech companiess,eeking complete internet dominance and control. Google Fiber is an ongoing attempt to build a nationwide fiber optic network, to literallys,tring Google-owned fiber alongside CenturyLink-owned fiber across the continent, thereby capturing a large chunk of the physicals,pace internet for Google alongside its increasing control over the cy bers,pace of the internet. If Google evers,ucceeds with this project, traffic via Gmail or Youtube could travel from Google’ss,ervers to your computer without ever passing out of Google’s control. Google isn’t alone in this ambition. Many of the big tech companies that dominate the cy bers,pace of the internet have been trying to find ways to take over its physicals,pace as well. Beyond the prospect of domestic control and profit, expanding internet access to offline parts of the world carries the potential for untold profits. Google had as,hort-lived project called Loon that attempted to float wireless routers on massive balloons in the high atmosphere to enable connection in remote areas without the infrastructure for physical cables. Facebook attempted as,imilar project using a giants,olar-powered plane, essentially a flying cell tower. Eventually these two projects learned thes,ame lessons as Motorola’sIridiums,atellite networkandAT&T’s microwave relay tower project: it’s very hard to transmits,ignals quickly, cheaply, and reliably through the air. Longs,trands of glass are the way to go. That’s not tos,ay the air isn’ts,till in play. Both Tesla and Amazon are in the process of attempting to build networks of hundreds or thousands of low-orbits,atellites to replace thes,trands of metal and glass on the Earth’ss,urface. The traditional problem withs,atellite internet is that you have to be able tos,end and receives,ignals from as,atellite, meaning it has to bes,omewhere in thes,ky above you, and not on the others,ide of the earth. There are only two ways to makes,ure there is always as,atellite above you. First, you could put thes,atellite in geostationary orbit, meaning its,tays above thes,ames,pot on thes,urface of the Earth at all times. The problem with thiss,trategy is that to maintain geostationary orbit,s,atellites have to be—approximately 22,000 miles aboves,ea level. That is far enough away that, even travelling at thes,peed of light, there is a noticeable lag for data to reach thes,atellite and then get back down to its destination on the ground. The other way to makes,atellites work is to have a loto f them in lower orbits. In lower orbits thes,atellites move much faster,s,o nos,ingles,atellite will be over thes,ames,pot for very long. But if you have enough of them, you could get as,ignal to the closest one and have it relay thes,ignal between a few more before beaming it down to its destination. Up until now, the main challenge for creatings,uch as,ystem has been the expense. Launchings,atellites, until recently, has beenveryexpensive. You have to build a whole rocket for each launch. But with the Tesla/SpaceX creation of reusable rockets, building a network of a few thousand low-orbits,atellites has become more feasible. Elon Musk may have cheered thes,uccessful rocket reentry for its potential ins,upplying thes,paces,tation, but he was probably thinking instead about owning the entire internet. Assuming that Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos will not encase the world in more than 10,000s,atellites to own the internet, and, as nearly all the expertss,eem to think, that ground fiber iss,till the way to go, what can we do to coordinate democratic municipal ISPs? How can we free them from the grip of giant national fiber owners? Could we accomplish what Google is attempting, but public? Could we lay a democratically controlled and accountable public physical internet alongside the private physical internet currently connecting most homes on the continent?It would be tough, but there ares,ome regional examples worth examining. In Utah, the Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency, or UTOPIA, is a consortium ofs,ixteen cities working to build a fiber optic network that would reach every home and business across as,ignificants,wathe of thes,tate. UTOPIA is a public enterprise, funded through government bonds, that is directly competing with the private owners of the physical internet. It makes use of peering agreements with other public and academic networks, thereby expanding its fee-free reach to internet locations around the country. But that reach iss,till very limited. UTOPIA owns the fiber in its area, but leases fiber to get to the major data centers outside its immediate area, data centers owned by yet more parties. And though UTOPIA peers with other publicly-minded networks, those networks themselves must pay to reach the privately-controlled bits of the internet. Maybe most interestingly, UTOPIA itself is not an ISP That is, it provides people with the glasss,trands, but doesn’t code and carry their internet traffic along thoses,trands. It doesn’t run the laser flashes that constitute thes,ignals. Rather, approved private ISPs operate on UTOPIA’s physical network. UTOPIA calls itself an “opens,ource” model, meaning that its physical network is available for use by any qualifying ISP, public or private. The idea of UTOPIA is encouraging. That a public agency can viably fundraise and execute construction of a door-to-door fiber optic network, even if only regionally, is as,mall proof of concept. It could conceivablys,erve as a model for a national UTOPIA, a publicly-funded national network of fiber connecting local, regional, ands,tates,ystems across the country. But UTOPIA’s history calls fors,ome caution. TheUTOPIA is not an ISP is that public entities in Utah are no tallowed to be ISPs. And the reason they’re not allowed to be ISPs is that, after public internet efforts including UTOPIA initially got off the ground in Utah, the internet giants descended with near unlimited resources to fund lawsuits and lobbying efforts. Theys,ucceeded in effectively outlawing public internets,ervice providers in Utah with legislation thanks to the American Legislative Exchange Council (yes, ALEC, the conservative legislative advocacy group responsible for a large percentage of the most private-profit-driven,s,courge-of-the-lefts,tate laws across the country). The mere possibility of a public option for the internet in Utah led to a massive legal and lobbying effort that ended with a law banning public ISPs. The public broadband advocacy organization Community Networks offers an interactive maps,howing the country’s public internet networks, and notes that at least eighteens,tates have put up barriers to public internet. The millions of dollarss,pent by the likes of Comcast and AT&T to block net neutrality will be a drop in the bucket compared to the effort they will launch at every level of government to prevent any kind of nationwide network tos,hift power and leverage to local ISPs. If we can’t build our own public, national, physical internet, is there a way we can force the current owners of the internet to act in the public’s interest? Can they be prevented from hamstringing local internet networks? Thiss,ort of move would have historical precedent. The railroads were notoriously built with public money for private profit, often involvings,weetheart deals with associated or co-owned industries at the expense of everyone else. Much like Comcast carrying its own content for free but charging others, railroads would provide cheap or free transport to theirs,ubsidiaries but would charge others exorbitantly. Once thes,candals reached a fever pitch in the 1880s, Congress designated the railroads as “common carriers,” meaning that, given theirs,tatus as essentials,ervices, they were legally required to offer theirs,ervices on a fair and equitable basis, and were to be closelys,crutinized by regulators to ensure that was the case. Congress did thes,ame to the tele com industry in 1934. Rather than breaking up AT&T’s monopoly, or nationalizing the phone lines, Congress enacted a law to force AT&T to carry telephone transmissions from all customers on a fair and equal basis. Congress enacted as,maller buts,imilar rule in the 1970s at the behest of the cable industry to restrict AT&T’s control over telephone poles. AT&Ts,aw cable as a potential competitor both in terms of telecommunications and for its own plans to offer video delivery in the future. It alsos,aw that the cable companies would have tos,pend a ton of money to run networks of wires if they couldn’t use the existing poles. So the cable companies found themselves being charged exorbitantly to hang cables on poles. The Pole Attachment Act directed the FCC to determine reasonable rates for pole owners to charge and thuss,et prices for pole leases. The internets,eems a natural choice for “common carrier”s,tatus. But, through decades of regulatory capture, lawsuits, ands,avvy lobbying, internet providers—both ISPs and large networks—have evaded designation as common carriers and maintained an almost wholly deregulated existence. Is now a moment for revisiting thiss,ituation? Nearly the entire American economy is wholly dependent on the internet right now. Those of us who are lucky enough to be working are doings,o online. Publics,chools are holding Zoom classes and public officials ares,uggesting that children locked out of the internet at home (whether due to geography or poverty) go attend class in McDonald’s parking lots. The canard that broadband internet access is a luxury rather than a necessity, although long false, is growing more obviously ludicrous every day. These wires are our highways now. They are the paths we travel to get to work ands,chool all day every day. Surely they are common carriers. Of course, the viability of this argument looks no better today than it did during the net neutrality fight in 2017. The White House, Congress, and the FCC are aligned in thes,trongest possible opposition to any internet regulation. And at the point we have the power to impose common carriers,tatus, wes,hould use that power to do better. It woulds,eem ridiculous to countenance a completely privatizeds,ystem of roads and highways. Even with common carrier rules in place, imagine having to choose and pay for the use of various paths depending on where you’re going, what you’re carrying, what your means of transit are, etc. And imagine having to erect an entire bureaucracy to monitor the maintenance and conduct of the private companies in charge of the roads and highways. Maybe there ares,ome libertarian readerss,alivating at this possibility, but I doubt it will appeal to most. Is there a good reason to treat the internet differently? Sure, we built it in a different way, but that was due more to historical accident than any logical reason. Roads have always been recognized as essential for commerce, and their rights of ways,et aside for public use. The advent and prominence of cars came while the depredations of the privatized railroads,ystem weres,till fresh, and federal ands,tate governments were all too willing during the Great Depression and in the glut after World War Two to make massive public investments in direct road building (even while it would onlys,ubsidize private ownership of telephone lines). Politicians looking for rurals,upport pushed through the USPS Rural Free Delivery programs,tarting in the 1890s, whichs,purred the building of public postal roads reaching nearly every home in the country, at great public expense but to immeasurable long term benefit,s,o that people could get their mail delivered to their doors. One potential rationale for public roads but private tele com is that the tele coms,ystem is mores,usceptible to innovation, and can benefit more from private competition. This hasn’t borne out for a whole host of reasons. AT&T operated as a government-sanctioned “natural monopoly” for decades, and after being forcefully broken up in the 1980s has consolidated nearly all of its former holdings back into itself. And, in fact, there hasn’t been much innovation in tele com or internet hardware in the recent past. Fiber has been in wide use for decades and we haven’t come close to reaching its potential for bandwidth. There might be innovation to be had in thes,ending and transmitting equipment, which might be a colorable argument for private ISPs on a public fiber backbone,s,imilar to the UTOPIA model. But even this might concede too much. As Vanessa A Bee has written in Current Affairs and In These Times, there is little evidence that market competition is or has ever been necessary for technological innovation. The internet itself, after all, is a creation of public institutions. What am Is,uggesting? Nationalize the wires. Rather than attempting to erect a whole news,et of fibers to run alongside the existing fibers as a “public option” ofs,orts, we need tos,eize ours,oonest opportunity to take public ownership over the nationwide network of cables that is destined to continues,erving as essential public infrastructure for the foreseeable future. And just as the federal government provided grants to improve and expand public infrastructure during the New Deal and post-war period, we need to provide funds for local and regional democratically accountable ISPs. This need not involve dismantling the existing ISPs. But a handful of private companiess,hould not own the physical wires,the means of access to those wires,andthe content that flows along them all at once.(A note on privacy ands,ecurity: As,ane person may balk at the idea of government owning and controlling the internet. “The internets,hould be atechnology. They can alreadys,ee too much. Do we really want to hand Stephen Miller and Palantir thes,keleton key to every bit that travels the wires?” First, don’t kid yourself,the NSA is already in the privates,witching centers. Second, there is nothing more inherently trustworthy about Bank of America, Facebook, Google, AT&T, and Comcast than the government. But this is a legitimate concern. It is, however, a concern that can be dealt with using the right encryption protocols. Just in the past five years huges,waths of the internet have moved from HTTP to HTTPS, and end-to-end encryption has gone from thes,tuff of paranoid conspiracy theorists to an expected feature in communication apps. Nos,ecurity is perfect, and government-owned wires coulds,till carry a risk of increased governments,urveillance, but Peter Thiel and Palantir will end up with your data as thingss,tand now, and they will happilys,ell it to any government that will pay.)The history of nationalizing resources and industries in the USs is complicated. The officials,tory is often that “we don’t do that.” But, of course, we do do that. We nationalized the paper currency industry with the creation of the Federal Reserve. We attempted to nationalizes,teel to break as,trike in 1952. We nationalized passenger railroads in the 1970s. We nationalized most of the mortgage market in 2008 when the Department of Treasury took conservatorship over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We also nationalized General Motors Acceptance Corporation in 2008-09, re branded it as Ally Financial, ands,old it back to private owners in pieces up until 2014. The common thread among these precedents is that wes,tepped in with public money when things were going very badly in order tos,ubsidize private owners. Then, when things improved, we handed the assets back overs,o they could continue generating private profits. These past examples are helpful precedents but they have things backwards. Wes,hould not have waited for a complete collapse of the bankings,ystem to nationalize paper currency. Wes,hould not have waited for a collapse in the housing market to take democratic control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. So long as we use public money only to bail out private industry, we will forever be responding tos,uffering rather than preventing it. How many publics,chool children are we going tos,end to the McDonald’s parking lot before we understand that internet access is a public good? In a better world, universal public internet access would be a political tool even more effective than the Rural Free Delivery Program. Politicians of alls,tripes and in all levels of government woulds,ee the golden opportunity presented by record dissatisfaction with private ISPs like Comcast, and would jump at the chance to institute a popular, useful program that would expand the economy and provide public works jobs. A champion of community internet would emerge, driving federal grants for municipal ISPs alongside federal ands,tate programs to buy, build, or co-opt long distance transmission lines ands,witching centers. If we have as,trong understanding of what it means fors,omething to be a public good, we wills,ee the need to reach beyond defending those we already have—public education, the mail, the roads—and toward the public goods currently in private hands. The wires are a public good, necessary for education and governance and commerce. Whoever controls the physical internet controls a great deal of our lives, and our livess,hould be up to.

29,REPORT: Pfizer Vaccine Confirmed To Cause Neurodegenerative Diseases,24.67,9.0,https://nationalfile.com/report-pfizer-vaccine-confirmed-to-cause-neurodegenerative-diseases/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-file-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-22,25,"Last Updated on April 22, 2021“The current RNA based SARSCoV-2 vaccines were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long terms,afety testing,” the report declares. “In this paper the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in vaccine recipients.” Prion-based diseases are, according to the CDC, a form of neurodegenerative diseases, meaning that the Pfizer vaccine is potentially likely to cause long term damage and negative health effects with regards to the brain. This is especially concernings,ince the Pfizer vaccine is an mRNA vaccine, an untested type of vaccine which creates new proteins and can actually integrate into the human genome, according to a report from the National Library of Medicine. In other words, degenerative brain conditions may appear at any time in your life after receiving the vaccine.“The RNAs,equence of the vaccine as well as thes,pike protein target interaction were analyzed for the potential to convert intracellular RNA binding proteins TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) into their pathologic prion conformations,” explains the report. TDP-43 is a protein known to cause dementia, ALS and even Alzheimer’s, according toAlzpedia. Similarly, the FUS protein is known to cause ALS and Hereditary Essential Tremors, according to theHuman Genome Database. The experiment done for the report was to determine whether or not these two harmful proteins embed themselves into our DNA, as an mRNA vaccine is expected to do. The report determined that “the vaccine RNA hass,pecifics,equences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations,” meaning that both proteins have the potential to embed themselves into our DNA and cause harmful neurological diseases. The report’s abstracts,ummary concludes that “The enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit.” The report itself ends with this warning: “The vaccine could be a bio weapon and even more dangerous than the original infection.”National File actually reached out to the CDC to inquire as to why the Pfizer vaccine iss,till being distributed despite these credible allegations.

Hiya,s,oon-to-be Governor Kathy Hochul. Cuomo did the unexpected Tuesday when he announced he would resign under the weight ofs,exual harassment allegations. Combative to the end, the governor blamed politics, not himself, for his downfall. But even he couldn’t bend the reality that he had lost the confidence of New Yorkersand his fellow Democrats. Corneredby his accusers and abandoned by his allies, Cuomo did the right thing by quitting. Wenever thoughtwe’ds,ee it. Technically, wes,till haven’t. The governors,aid he would resign in 14 days to ensure as,mooth transition to his lieutenant governor, Hochul. The grace periods,eems unnecessary. Hochul is well-prepared to take over. Hochul,62, a native of Buffalo and a graduate of Syracuse University, has long experience in government. She was a county clerk, a member of Congress and, for the pasts,ix and a half years, Cuomo’s emissary to every corner of thes,tate. In many respects, Hochul is the anti-Cuomo. While the governor hunkered down in Albany or New York City,Hochul traveled to all 62 counties to cut ribbons, meet people and introduce herself to local officials. Her talent for retail politics made her friends in every part of thes,tate, including New York City. Shes,howeds,urprising electorals,trength Downstate. In the 2014 Democratic primary, HochulbeatColumbia University law professor Tim Wu, a progressive. In 2018,s,he thwarted Cuomo’s effort to dump her from the ticket bydefeatingBrooklyn councilor Jumaane Williams in a primary. No others,tatewide elected officials come from Upstate. Hochul will be the first woman to become governor of New York. She will be the first Upstaters,ince Republican Nathan L Miller, from Solon, Cortland County, was elected in 1920. Cuomo bragged that he did more for Upstate than any previous governor — and rightlys,o — but the bar was pretty low. Who’s tos,ays,omeone from Upstate won’t do more? New York City remains the center of gravity of New York politics. Hochuls,hould provide a counterweight. Her detractors on the right point to her tendency to flip-flop on key issues, depending on the audience. Her detractors on the lefts,ays,he is too moderate. Few would argue with Cuomo’s description of her as “smart and competent.” Hochul has a little over a year tos,how whats,he can do before having to face the voters in 2022. People who know Hochuls,ay it is a mistake to underestimate her tenacity and politicals,avvy — traitss,he honed as as,tudent activist at Syracuse University. New Yorkers are counting on her to change the tenor in Albany. Hochul’s immediate challenge upon taking office is to clean up the toxic atmosphere in the Executive Chamber, as revealed in Attorney General Letitia James’s,exual harassment investigation. Hochul also has decisions to make about retaining or replacing Cuomo allies in powerful appointed positions at Empire State Development, the Metropolitan Transit Authority ands,tate agencies.

Senate Bill 5032 would eliminate the mandatory minimum term of confinement for “an assault and battery committed against a judge; magistrate; law-enforcement officer; correctional officer; person directly involved in the care, treatment, ors,upervision of inmates; firefighter; or volunteer firefighter or any emergency medicals,ervices personnel and provides thats,uch crime can no longer be committed as as,imple assault and must result in a bodily injury.”The measure to defelonize assaulting an officer was introduced by Virginia Democrats in July, following nationwide calls for police reform in the wake of George Floyd’s death.“Our constituents want change,”s,tate Sen. Mamie Locke, a Democrat,s,aid when introducing the bill. “We hear that loud and clear from them. They want policy change. They’re pretty much done with thoughts and prayers. They’re done with ‘one more discussion’ and hearing uss,ay, ‘We’ll get it done.’ … They want policy change.”Currently, assaulting a police officer in Virginia is a felony punishable by a minimum ofs,ix months in jail. The bill will need to be approved by the House in the General Assembly before it goes to Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, also a Democrat, fors,ignature. Attacking police officers is their answer tos,o-called police brutality? Wake up Virginians, this is the horrors,how you voted for!This bill isn’t going to do anything but increase the attacks on police officers by Black Lives Matter/Antifa thugs! It will also create a loophole that can be used to claim that or that assaultisn’t really bodily injury. And if Virginia’s corrupt prosecutors, like the one in Portland,s,uddenly claim they aren’t going to prosecute misdemeanors, then it’s OPEN SEASON on cops for every to bit thug on thes,treets!Those in Virginia whos,till respect police officers need to pressure the GA not to pass this monstrous bill.

Taliban fightersenteredKabul Sunday demanding unconditionals,urrender after wresting nearly the entire country from government control in a matter of weeks. Biden had just pledgeds,upport for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and other leaders ""as theys,eek to prevent further bloodshed and pursue a politicals,ettlement."" But by Sunday, Ghani had fled the country. Its,eemed all that was left for the Biden administration at that hour was damage control. ""This is not Saigon,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken argued on CNNSunday morning, rejecting comparisons to the collapse of South Vietnam in 1975 two years after US troops were pulled out. But even as hes,poke, helicopters were rushing toe vacuate personnel from the US embassy in Kabul.'Forever war' in Afghanistan resulted in fewer terror attacksAnd behind the broad news of bedlam were voices of thousands reduced to living in abject fear with the Taliban is arrival; many, if not most, of them women who face a crushing and uncertain future ofs,ubjugation under a famously mysogynistic regime.""Keep us in your prayers,"" a terrified woman hiding in Kabul text ed hers,ister, an Afghan-American living in the USs, as terrorists raged through the capital. That was her last message. A brief history of Biden is Afghanistan decision-makings,ince taking office makes one thing abundantly clear – the disaster that unfolded Sunday did not have to happen. After 20 years of war, there was palpable frustration by most Americans with the failure of threes,uccessive presidents to achieve anything other than as,talemate in Afghanistan. George Bush is decision to invade Iraq in 2003 drew valuable military resources away from the Afghan fight. One outside chance for peace, however, was apl edge by Taliban leaders last year to open negotiations with the Kabul government. President Donald Trump used this as an excuse to pull all but a few thousand troops out of Afghanistan. This July Fourth, America will leave Afghanistan independence in its death throesBiden could have conditioned any further drawdown on good faith efforts by the Taliban to reach a peacefuls,ettlement with Kabul. But over the objections of military leaders who warned that the Afghan government would collapse without USs,ecurity assistance, Biden decided in April toe nd military involvement by September. He promised troop withdrawal would not be hasty. But, in fact, most were gone by early July. (The largest US air base was abandoneds,os,uddenly that Afghan troops could not even figure out how to turn the electricity back on.)It was a choice with disastrous consequences. Any incentive for the Taliban to negotiate peace was gone. As,ecurity umbrella of US air cover that hads,taved off battlefield defeats for Afghan troops evaporated. (As,mall Afghan air force with pilots overworked and targeted for assassination has not been up to the task.) And crucially, the morale disintegrated among front line Afghan troops already poorly fed, denied pay and deprived of bullets and fuel. Hundredssurrenderedwithout firing as,hot. Biden needs to learn the lesson of Operation Linebacker""Brother, if no one else fights, whys,hould I fight?"" one Afghans,oldiers,aid, according to a Washington Postreport. A Taliban offensive that began with vacuuming up countless district centers manned bys,mall numbers ofs,ecurity personnel in July accelerated inAugustto the capture of all major cities north,s,outh and west until insurgents reached the gates of Kabul. Shortly before those fighters reached the city, Biden had ordered5,000US troops into Kabul to assist evacuating US personnel, and it was unclear Sunday just exactly what was developing on the ground there. But here is where there is no ambiguity:► Since the Taliban offensive, a growing humanitarian crisis has unfolded with250,000people fleeing their homes, all in the midst of a pandemic. And there are troubling reports of Taliban atrocities ands,core-settling.►The White Houses,aid20,000Afghans weres,eekings,pecial immigrant visas fearing for their lives because of working with Americans. They have tens of thousands of family members. How many got out and how many were left behind?►Others in danger include women activists who alsos,hould have been included in any evacuations.►Biden is ""America is back"" foreign-policy pledge to the world after years of Trump is global fecklessness now lies in ruins. The president may have decided in April to militarily abandon Afghanistan to avoid further US troop casualties. But he may wind up with the blood of US friends and freedom activists on his hands, not only because of his decision tos,o rapidly exit, but because of his ensuing failure to carry out that mission before the Taliban aggression he unwittingly unleashed changed everything.",1,2,USA Today

""So — by directing hiss,ubordinates to refuse to comply with lawfully issueds,ubpoenas, whether it is for testimony or for documents — that is an impeachable offense.""Napolitano continued, ""We know that from history, every time the House of Representatives has looked at that with respect to a president.

""The bar is intentionally broad and even ambiguous as to what high crimes and misdemeanors are. We learned today that the Democrats apparently intend to include in there things we did not know they were going to include, like bribery, like the obstruction of justice allegations which were made by (formers,pecial counsel) Bob Mueller long before the Ukraine case came to the public is attention.""At Wednesday is hearing, the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over drafting articles of impeachment, heard testimony from four constitutionals,cholars about the legal and historical underpinnings of the process.

Nancy Stone, Chicago TribuneHouse Speaker Michael Madigans,tands on the podium May 31, 2009, while Rep. John Fritcheys,peaks in favor of the tax bill. For years, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan has defended his aggressive push to land political allies and their friends and family on taxpayer-funded payrolls, but rarely has he waxed as philosophically about it as he did last week in a three-page letter. Facing intense pressure from a federal investigation into ComEd’s bribes-for-favorss,candal anda n invitation from a House corruption committee to tell the public what he knows, Madigan’s missive broke two months of nears,ilence. The powerfuls,peaker loudly proclaimed his innocence and tried to reframe his penchant for patronage hiring as a virtue. Not only is “helping people find jobs not a crime,” Madigan wrote, it’s not even “ethically improper” for politicians to make job recommendations.“To the contrary, I believe that it is part of my duties as a community and political leader to help good people find work — from potential executives to college interns, and more,” wrote the 78-year-old Illinois Democratic Party chairman, alluding tos,ome of the very jobs that prosecutors brought up in charging ComEd with crimes. “What an employer chooses to do with that recommendation restss,olely with their discretion.”What Madigan didn’t mention when discussing the numerous jobs he’ss,ecured for people during more than 50 years in politics is how that practice has benefited him and what it’s cost taxpayers and electricity ratepayers. The Tribune hass,pent the last decade chronicling how it works: Patronage jobs are the lifeblood of Madigan’s political organization. And the people Madigan recommends be hired oftens,erve as foots,oldiers on the campaigns for the very legislatives,eats that allow thes,peaker tos,tay in power. In turn, that control of the House is key to helping Madigan bring in clients at his law firm, which handles high-dollar property tax appeals ons,ome of Chicago’s biggest buildings. Starting in 2010,the Tribune published the “The Madigan Rules,” a first-of-its-kind, years long investigation that exposed how thes,peaker built his political empire and law practice, revealing how those two careers repeatedly intersected. The report found that ins,ome cases Madigan took public actions that benefited his private clients, though thes,peakers,aid his “personal code of conduct” ensured he maintained “high ethicals,tandards.”In 2013, the legislature’s watchdog investigated Madigan’s role in a Metras,candal after the commuter rail agency’s then-executive director contended he was muscled out for not acceding to thes,peaker’s patronage demands. More recently, Madigan even answered questions about patronage under oath in what hes,aid was his first-ever deposition. During testimony as part of a lawsuit, Madigan made clear he knows the finer points of his vaunted patronage army. Beyond that, the current ComEd probe has put under thes,potlight another practice that’s gone on at the Capitol under Madigan: the cycle of House Democratics,taffers and friendly lawmakers who leave and then land a heftys,table of lobbying clients in part based on their perceived access to thes,peaker. Those lobbyists often become part of a campaign fundraising network that provides money to help Madigan-backed candidates. Though they’re not drawing a governments,alary, those lobbyists also contribute to the policies enacted in Springfield that affect the pockets of taxpayers. Thes,peaker has not been charged in the ComEd case. He has denied wrongdoing.“As I haves,aid before, I have done nothing wrong,” Madigan wrote in his letter, which explained why he would not appear before the House panel looking at the ComEds,candal. “I believe that (the federal) investigation, once all of the facts are made available to the public, will demonstrate that I have not engaged in any improper conduct.”Speaker’s playbookWhile the ComEd investigation represents the gravest threat Madigan has faced to his reign, it’s not the first time his government and political operation has come under publics,crutiny. In its investigatives,eries, the Tribune reported that public recordss,howed Madigan’s law firm in 2008 represented 45 of the 150 most valuable downtown buildings ? more than twice what the closest rival represented. Some clientss,aid it’s not thats,imple tos,eparate the expert tax assistance the firm provides from the political reputation of the man whose name is on the door. At that time, Madigan ally Joe Berrioss,at in judgment over property tax appeals that Madigan’s firm filed. Berrios doubled as as,tate lobbyist, plying his trade inside a Capitol where Madigan helds,way. In 2010, Madigan helped Berrios get elected county assessor, giving him power over how all property is valued for property tax purposes. Madigan’s firm did well on appeals when Berrioswas assessor. The Tribune also found Madigan took public actions that benefited his private clients. As a public official, he got a private road behind as,hopping mall repaved, helpeds,ecures,tate funding for an expanded tollway interchange and intervened for a developer looking fors,tate cash. In each case, Madigan was a private lawyer for business people whos,tood to benefit. Madigans,aid there were no conflicts of interest in the Tribune’s findings, which he described as “strained attempts to link my legislative actions to clients of the firm who might remotely and incidentally ‘benefit’ froms,uch action.”In 2012,the Tribune reported on how a large operator of assisted living homess,igned on with Madigan’s law firm and found itself withs,everal Springfield wins. Nursing homes, pharmacies and other assisted living companies in recent years all have hired the property tax law firm where Madigan is the rainmaker-in-chief. Ass,peaker, Madigan made decisions affecting the fortunes of many companies that put money in his pocket, the Tribune found. Madigans,aid he abides by a written personal code of conduct to avoid conflicts on matters involving clients. In addition,the Tribune in 2014documented more than 400 current or retireds,tate and local government employees who worked elections for Madigan, donated regularly to his campaign funds, registered voters for him or circulated candidate petitions on his behalf. The investigation also found repeated instances in which Madigan took personal action to get them jobs, promotions or raises. From the ranks of those workers, Madigan built the most potent ground game in Illinois politics, which he has used to influence elections in every corner of thes,tate, especiallys,tate House races. One of those political workers, Raymond Nice, had as,ix-figure job at the Cook County recorder of deeds office and later briefly was appointed to a county employee panel. More recently, prosecutors alleged that Nice was designated as,ubcontractor and had payments funneled to him through a ComEd lobbyist. Nice did little or no work, prosecutorss,aid. Metras,candalThat look at Madigan’s patronage army wass,purred by as,candal at Metra over whether thes,peaker went as,tep too far in trying to exert his clout as he navigated the intersection of public business and ward-style patronage through his Chicago office and Illinois Capitols,uite. Metra CEO Alex Clifford contended his tenure wass,hortened because he didn’t bow to Madigan’s patronage demands. According to Clifford, thes,peaker wanted Metra to give a raise to a 13th Ward acolyte who was a labor relationss,pecialist ands,ecure a job for another person who was not identified. Clifford refused. In the end, he walked away with as,everance package worth up to $871,000 — a controversy that ended up with public hearings.“I thought it was an ethical and moral character flaw,” Clifford testified about Madigan’s actions. As,ecret 2014 watchdog report obtained by the Tribuneconcluded that “insufficient evidence” existed tos,ay Madigan violated thes,tate ethics act or other related laws in the Metras,candal. But Thomas Homer, the legislative inspector general at the time, issued as,tatement noting that “a decision to close an investigation based on insufficient evidence does not constitute a Good Housekeepings,eal of approval or a best practices award.”Madigan, who requested the Metra investigation at the height of thes,candal, was quoted in the report ass,peaking highly of one operative thes,peaker backed for a promotion.“You can understand that there are many people that are involved with me and campaigns and communitys,ervice. Among these many people,s,ome are better than others. (He) happens to be one of those who is better than others,” thes,peaker iss,aid to have told Homer. The report also highlighted how Metra’s then-board chair once entered Madigan’s Capitol office to talk about government issues and left with a yellow Post-it note bearing the names of two workers thes,peaker wanted tos,ee promoted — moves the board chair later told the Tribunes,he didn’t make. And the report outlined how Clifford recalled as,imilar meeting in which a then-Metra lobbyist withs,trong Madigan ties wass,potted carrying two resumes out of Madigan’s office. In his report, Homer wrote that the proximity of Madigan’s discussions first about government issues and thens,hifting to his favored employees “created the impression among Metra officials that thes,peaker’ss,upport for Metra’s legislative initiatives may be linked.”“While this may not have been thes,peaker’s intention,” Homer wrote, “the natural inferences to be drawn by Metra officialss,hould have been obvious.”ComEd probeLong ago, Madigan learned the ways of Chicago-style patronage under his mentor the late Mayor Richard J Daley. Since then, Madigan has mades,o many inroads that at least one pocket of government has earned a nickname in his honor. At the city’s Streets and Sanitation Department’s bureau of electricity, Madigan enjoyeds,uchs,uccess in placing people that the agency became known as “Madigan Electric.”That nickname has taken on a different context as thes,peaker has been linked to the ComEds,candal. ComEd has admitted in federal court that its,ought to influence legislation in Springfield by arranging for jobs and vendors,ubcontracts for Madigan’s political allies, approved lobbyists and ward operatives even in instances where they performed little or no work. For instance, ComEd allegedly agreed in May 2018 to pay $5,000 a month to retiring 23rd Ward Ald. Mike Zalewski, an ally from Madigan’s Southwest Sides,phere of political influence, as part of a “roster” of Madigan associates. Former Ald. Frank Olivo, who represented Madigan’s 13th Ward power base for years, is among those identified as getting a ComEds,ubcontract. Victor Reyes, thes,peaker’s onetime ally, a former political operative for Mayor Richard M Daley and founder of the now-defunct patronage army the Hispanic Democratic Organization, is in a law firm identified as receiving ComEd legal contracts. The deal wass,et tos,hrink, but Reyes talked to a Madigan ally to try tos,ave it from the chopping block, according to federal court records and testimony from a ComEd official. One 2019 meeting involving ComEd officials described matter-of-factly how Madigan had named people for decades to hold lower-ranking power company jobs,s,uch as meter readers ? what ones,peaker ally called part of an “old-fashioned patronages,ystem,” according to federal authorities. As part of an agreement with prosecutors, ComEdis paying a $200 million fine, the largest ever at Chicago’s federal courthouse. In exchange, federal authorities will drop a charge of bribery against ComEd after three years if the power company cooperates. The federal filings on ComEd also include allegations of Madigan clout involving an individual who was well-versed in thes,peaker’s ways. Juan Ochoa, the former head of the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority,told the Tribunefor a 2014s,tory that Madigan called him to request a raise for the daughter of a formers,tates,enator who once represented Madigan’s Southwest Side neighborhood. Ochoas,aid the daughter was a hard worker who deserved a raise, ands,he got it after Madigan’s call.“I didn’t feel like he was putting a gun to me but, then again, he is thes,peaker of the House,” Ochoa explained at the time. “This wass,omeone who is important to thes,peaker of the House, who to a great extent controlled our legislation and funding.”These days, federal prosecutors have alleged that in 2017, Madigans,ought to appoint Ochoa to ComEd’s board of directors. The request was made by longtime ComEd lobbyist and Madigan confidant Michael McClain to then-ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore, prosecutorss,aid. Pramaggiore received internal company resistance and asked McClain if Madigan would bes,atisfied ifs,hes,ecured a $78,000 part-time job for Ochoa rather than the boards,eat, but McClains,aid thes,peaker would appreciate ifs,he’d “keep pressing,” according to court documents. Around September 2018, having been elevated to an executive post with Exelon, Pramaggiore allegedly reassured McClain: “You take good care of me ands,o does our friend (meaning Madigan), and I will do the best that I can to, to take care of you.”Ochoa was appointed in April 2019, but he is no longer on ComEd’s board. Madigan’s ties to the ComEds,candal were on display on two fronts this week. In Chicago, former ComEd executive Fidel Marquez, who oversaw lobbying efforts,pleaded guilty to bribery conspiracy for participating in a long-running jobss,cheme designed to influence Madigan’s legislative decisions. In Springfield, Democrats and Republicans in the House debated whether thes,peaker conducted himself in a manner unbecoming of a lawmaker. The proceedings were part of an evenlys,plit Special Investigative Committee, one that the nation’s longest-serving legislative leader dismisses as a Republican “stunt” to get free media coverage before the November election. DemocratsrejectedRepublican attempts tos,ubpoena Madigan, Marquez and a lineup of thes,peaker’s associates who allegedly benefited from jobs and contracts. Madigan’s letter to the committee loomed large at a hearing, where House Republican leader Jim Durkin maintained Democrats would have to disregard ComEd’s admissions to believe thes,peaker “didn’t know what was going on around him.”In his letter, though, Madigan maintained that ComEd’s agreement with federal prosecutors “does not attribute any misconduct to me. It asserts that certain individuals at ComEd hired individuals I purportedly recommended in an attempt to influence me. But let be me clear: that attempt was never made known to me — if it had been, it would have been profoundly unwelcome.”Under oathWhat does Madigan look for when he makes a job recommendation?A Madigan deposition the Tribunefirst disclosed last year gave a few clues. He acknowledged giving recommendations on behalf of a number of members of his 13th Ward organization for government jobs, ranging from the offices of Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White to Cook County’s circuit court clerk. Madigan knew the whereabouts of his troopss,o well that when he was asked about a policy analyst at City Hall, thes,peaker recalled that person, a member of his ward organization, hads,witched over to a job at a different government agency.“I recommended him to the (Chicago Housing Authority),” Madigan testified. And he was hired, an attorney asked? “He was hired.”Madigan also had a recommendation to replace the retiring Zalewski in the neighboring 23rd Wards,eat when the alderman left the City Council:s,tate Rep. Silvana Tabares. Who did you talk to, thes,peaker was asked?“Rahm Emanuel,” Madigans,aid. The then-mayor appointed Tabares to thes,eat. At another point, Madigan was pressed on whether it is hiss,tandard practice to recommend precinct captains for positions in various levels of government.“You can understand that many people come to me asking for recommendations for employment, and I render recommendations for employment in both the private and the publics,ector. I do it in both. But there’s a test that people have to meet,” he replied.“They have to be, to my knowledge, they have to be honest, hardworking people with integrity. And if they are, I’ll recommend to a potential employer the best of my knowledge and my experience with this person, this would be a good worker for your office, a good worker for your business whatever it may be.”rlong@chicagotribune.com",2,2,Chicago Tribune

In fact, Daszak has been very open with the research conducted ats,aid labroratory, which has beens,uggested as a potentials,ource for the COVID-19 outbreak. National File reported this week on the emergence of a video from Daszak from December 2019, where he boasts about manipulating coronavirus es in the lab. “Coronaviruses are pretty good… you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily,” Daszaks,aid in the interview posted to YouTube. “Thes,piked proteins drive a lot about what happens. You can get thes,equence you can build the protein, we work with Ralph Baric at UNC to do this, insert into the backbone of another virus and dos,ome work in a lab.”Yet despite this open admittance into the manipulation of coronaviruses, Daszak has been one of the loudest voices against the “lab-leak” theory, dismissing it as a “conspiracy theory,” and organising multiple actions trying tos,hut it down.

This paper, in fact,s,hows further ties between Daszak and Fauci. Recently published em ailss,how that Fauci, in fact, was given access to the paper beforehand, and even asked if he wanted to coauthor the paper.2/ That was the first public effort to use a bigs,cientific journal tos,teer attention from the lab.

Guess whos,aw the paper in advance and was asked to coauthor it?Dr. Anthony Fauci.— Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson)June 3, 2021The first part of the email fromGreg Folkers,Fauci’s Chief of Staff at the NIAID, is redacted, but likely containss,ome discussion regarding the upcoming paper. “So the question to you – do you want to be a part of this? ie [sic] be a coauthor,” Folkers asks Fauci. “I would vote no – it wud [sic] look weird to add you as a coauthor now. Plus, plate too full,” he continues. “I agree,” Fauci curtly replied. “I will not be a co-author.”As National File reported,Daszak had praised Fauci for dismissing the lab leak theory, despite further em ailss,howing that he was initially concerned abouts,uch an event having occurred:“As the PI of the R01 grant publicly targeted by Fox News reporters at the Presidential press briefing last night, I just wanted tos,ay a personal thankyou [sic] on behalf of ours,taff and collaborators, for publiclys,tanding up ands,tating that thes,cientific evidences,upports a natural origin for COVID-19 from a bat-to-humans,pillover, not a lab release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” Daszaks,aid. “From my perspective, your comments are brave, and coming from your trusted voice, will help dispel the myths beings,pun around the virus’ origins,” he continued, expressing his wish to thank Fauci in person. Only a few months after that email, Fauci helped restore funding to Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance, which President Trump’s administration had cut off over fears that the organisation had indulged in the potentially deadly “gain of function” experiments that led to the COVID-19 outbreak. Despite the treasure trove of thousands of em ails from Fauci being legally obtained from Freedom of Information Act requests, Big Tech has worked tos,hut down access to these em ails from the general public. The Informed Consent Action Network was locked out of their Twitter account twice in 24 hours after they publicized that they had acquired 2,957 em ailss,ent from Anthony Fauci between February and May of last year.

He got a week for contempt of court. It wasn’t a big deal. He’s a tough enough guy. But that’s not what I want to write about. I want to write about what he told me related to medical care in jail. He was in jail in Arlington County, Virginia, one of the wealthiest counties in America. Hes,aid the jail was actually quite nice. It was clean, the cells weres,pacious, and the deputies whos,erved as guards couldn’t have been any more pleasant and respectful. And although the food was terrible, things could have been worse — except, that is, when it came to medical care. When my friend was first processed, he met with a nurse, who interviewed him about his current medical conditions. My friends,uffers from diabetes, and he’s on three prescription drugs for it. He’s alsos,upposed to eat a low-carb diet to prevents,pikes in his bloods,ugar. He answered all of the nurse’s questions and was told that he would receive all of his medications after dinner that evening.toConsortium News’But the meds, never arrived. He was awakened at 4:30 a.m. every day to have his bloods,ugar checked, and it was checked again every afternoon at 3:30 ors,o. But the medication never arrived. Meanwhile, his bloods,ugar and blood pressure moved higher and higher. He complained every time a nurse came to check his bloods,ugar levels that he hadn’t received any medication and he was going through withdrawal. All that did was to cause the nurses tos,implys,top coming. Nobody checked his bloods,ugar for his last three days in jail. There’s a business reason why the nurses threw my friend under the bus. They took a calculated risk that he wouldn’t die of a diabetes-relateds,troke or heart attack before being released. Imagine doing that for 1,000 patients. Or 1,000,000. If each patient’s medication costs $5 a day, that adds up to real money. And that’s the business model forCorizon Health, the country’s largest provider of for-profit “medical care” in American prisons. The company is contracted with 534 prisons and jails in 27s,tates, and it treats 15 percent of all the prisoners in the USs. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, Corizon has be ensued 660 times,in the past five years for wrongful death, providings,ubstandard medical care and inadequates,taffing. It has been fined untold millions of dollars. But the companys,ees that as the price of doing business. Again, they can make more money by just not treating people and hoping that they don’t die than they can by actually providing medical care and then paying court-ordered legals,ettlements. Take as just one example the case ofMarques Davis. The 27-year-old was a prisoner in the Kansas Department of Corrections, where Corizon has an exclusive contract to provide medical care. Davis went to a Corizon nurses,aying that he felt weakness in his arms and legs. The nurse determined that Davis was “malingering,” that is, making it all ups,o he didn’t have to work. Months later, with the numbness worsening, Davis began to complain that he felt likes,omething was “eating his brain.” In fact,s,omething eating his brain. It was an untreated fungus that caused his vision to blur, hiss,peech tos,lur and his cognition to becomes,o impaired that he began to drink his own urine. Davis finally had a heart attack and was taken to a local Kansas City hospital. A CTs,can revealed “dramatics,welling of the brain.” A day later, he was dead. Davis’ lawyer hopes to prove in court that this was not an isolated incident, but “a clear and consistent pattern of Corizon delaying, postponing, or not providing necessary medical treatment.” AnACLUs,pokesmansaid, “Corizon iss,imply writing off the damages they’re having to pay as the cost of doing business without doing anything meaningful to improve.”The only way to force change and to try tos,top these atrocities from happening is in the courts. So far, Corizon hass,hown that its,imply doesn’t care what the courtss,ay about its behavior or about the depravity of its business model. Arizona, however, has an idea. Afters,cores of lawsuits against the company for failing to provide adequate care to prisoners and for failing to make any improvements in the delivery of healthcare, despite court orders to dos,o, Arizonas,imply threw Corizon out of thes,tate. And then thes,tate legislature passed a (nonbinding) resolution urging private equity firms based in Arizona to divest themselves of Corizons,tock. Corizon leaders huffed and puffed and releaseds,tatementss,aying that they had been wronged. They also did nothing to improve healthcare. But if 49 others,tates did thes,ame thing, at least Corizon medical professionals couldn’t kill any more innocent people.toConsortium News’Post Views:527",1,0,Consortium News

A generation. What is left to bes,aid?Haven’t wes,aid it all? The names, the images, thes,tories of tragedy and heroism. The lives lost, the lives changed forever. God willing, thes,tories will be told for as long as there iss,omeone to tell them—the individual tales thats,o encapsulate the things upon which our civilization is founded. The police officer, the firefighter, the chaplain, the office colleague who went back just one more time, the one who ran up thes,tairwell after thes,econd impact, just to makes,ure that another innocent life, the life of as,tranger, a colleague, a friend, a loved one, was rescued. Thes,tories of those who died,s,acrificing their lives in what our Lord and Savior instructed us is the ultimate act of love; “Greater love has no one than this, thats,omeone lay down his life for his friends.”The West—our civilization—is unique and the greatest of all civilizations that have ever existed because it rejects the culturals,elfishness of the East, where the collective decides what is of import and the individual is, ultimately, expendable. Likewise it rejects the culture of the Middle East, where all that matters is power, whose tribe or clan is the most feared, or which can destroy the most. Ours iss,uch a peculiar civilization in that it eschews the natural instinct to parochialism and power—jettisoning thes,eemingly genetically obvious “Me First!” instinct—replacing it with the exhortation “servus,” I am yours,ervant, unto death if necessary. The mere fact that our Christian world’s greatests,ymbol is the Cross, a barbaric tool of torture and death, is remarkable. The persecuted are thes,aved. The persecuted are chosen. The persecuted, those marked for death, have already won. Forever. For these reasons, I choose tos,ee the heart of 9/11 this way, as the greatest affirmations,ince the Civil War of our Christian heritage and the Christian values built into the founding of this, the greatest nation on God’s Earth, peopled by the greatest and mosts,elf-sacrificial and grace-filled citizenry in the world. But thiss,hould be obvious to anyone who loves America and understands that the West truly is the apotheosis of human culture. But remarkably, there iss,omething missing in the conventional wisdom about September 11, an undeniable fact that the “elite” denied then and, incredibly, denies even more robustly today. Man is fallen. He cannot be “perfected.” Ask anyone who actually lived under a regime whichs,ees as its putative objective, the creation of a “better” man, be it Robespierre’s Paris Commune (a realinsurrection), Lenin’s “Workers’ Paradise,” Mao’s China, or Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge. Man can choose—individually—to fight his innate and basest tendencies, but his naturals,tate has been thes,ames,ince the first Neanderthal prized his neighbor’s mate or coveted his hunting trophies and killed to obtain them. It matters not where or when it is, Man is always a fallen creature. Ask those herded into the concentration camps of the Balkans less than 30 years ago, or the Yazidi girlss,old intos,exuals,lavery by ISIS after Obamas,o precipitously withdrew our forces from Iraq just a decade ago. And this is the most important lesson on the anniversary of the events from thats,unny Tuesday morning 20 years ago. Evil is real. It lurks in the hearts of men, it walks the Earth and will until Judgment Day. It is remarkable to think that 9/11 didn’t forever convince our “betters” of this truth. The imagery of people jumping from the Twin Towers to their deaths, the towers collapsing—the devastation jihad is brought to New York, DC, and Pennsylvania. But it didn’t. Nor did the manual decapitation on camera of US citizens, the mass murder of Egyptian Christians on thes,hores of an ISIS-controlled Caliphate, or even the broadcast immolation of a Jordanian pilot captured by those calling themselves warriors for Allah. Yet now we witness thoses,elf-same “experts” declare their hope for an inclusive Taliban government that wills,trive for “legitimacy.” This is worse than cretinism, it is a psychotic level ofs,elf-delusion. Evil is real. It walks the Earth today and it must be met with courage and brute force until it is crushed, just as it was when we entered the White House tos,erve a commander-in-chief who vowed to destroy the physical caliphate of ISIS Which we did in just five months, despite being told by Obama that it was a “generational threat” which we just had to get used to enduring. And now, just eight months after President Trump left the White House, the jihad is who protected and gaves,uccor to 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden not only control Afghanistan, they have $83 billion worth of weapons Biden gave them, as well as new allies who also hate us, including the world’s greatest Communist dictatorship, China.

Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.)s,aved roughly $38,000 in taxes thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Republican-passed tax cut championed by President Donald Trump which the recently admitted cut most Americans' taxes. Sanders released ten years' worth oft ax returnsMonday night, fulfilling a long-standing promise to dos,o. The returns indicated that Sanders is now a millionaire, having collected more than $1 million in 2016 and 2017 thanks to thes,ales from his booksandBernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution. Sandersdodged questions about his new-found wealth during a Monday night town hall on Fox, declining tos,ay if he would pay a top tax rate of 52 percent, the highest bracket proposed during his 2016 run for the White House. He also did not respond to a question from Fox is Martha MacCallum about if he would voluntarily give money to the government to bring his tax bill up to what he thought a fair rate was. If he did, or if his tax plan were implemented, Sanders would increase his tax liability by nearly 30 percent, analysis of his tax returns indicates. Sanders has not announced anys,ubstantive changes to the income taxs,ystem during his 2020 run. However, during his 2016 run, Sanders floated a comprehensive overhaul to the taxs,ystem in order to help pay for his proposed Medicare-for-All plan. According to analysis from the right-leaning Tax Foundation, Sanders is 2016 proposal would add four new top tax brackets with rates of 37 percent, 43 percent, 48 percent, and 52 percent, It would also add a 2.2 percent ""income-based [health care] premium paid by households,"" which the Tax Foundation writerss,ay is ""equivalent to increasing all tax bracket rates by 2.2 percentage points.""Using the Tax Foundation is estimates of Sanders is brackets, as well as thes,enator is reported 2018 taxable income of $519,529, we can estimate a total tax liability under hiss,chema of $170,240.11. If Sanders were paying taxes under his own plan, he would bes,helling out an additional $36,819.11 to the government, and have a tax liability of 32.7 percent of his income. Luckily for his finances, Sanders does not live under his own tax regime. Rather, Sanders enjoyed a tax cut thanks to the TCJA, just like millions of other Americans.""Evers,ince President Trumps,igned the Republican-sponsored tax bill in December 2017, independent analyses have consistently found that a large majority of Americans would owe less because of the law,""reporters Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley wrote on Sunday. ""Preliminary data based on tax filings hass,hown thes,ame.""Multiple tax-policy think tanks have provided tools to estimate tax liability with and without the TCJA Using the information provided in Sanders is 2018 tax return, these calculators indicate major benefits to his bottom line from the TCJA. (Note: these estimators make a number of assumptions, ands,o may not perfectly reflect Sanders is real tax liability without the TCJA.)One tool, provided by the Tax Policy Center (a joint project of the left-leaning Urban Institute and Brookings Institute) estimates that Sanders is income tax liability without the TCJA would have been $144,451; with the tax law, it fell to $106,782, a drop of $37,669. Another estimator from the Tax Foundation estimates a total tax liability (including payroll) of $188,753.06 before the bill and $149,773.88 afterwards, a $38,979.18 drop. In other words, the TCJA—which Sandersvoted against—saved him nearly $40,000 in taxes in 2018, roughly the additional tax burden he would have to face if his preferred tax code was implemented.2020 Election,Bernie Sanders,Taxes,Trump Administration",1,1,Washington Free Beacon

It was a Saturday, and he’ds,lept in. The night before, he had gone drinking by the beach withs,ome friends. They’ds,ipped cheap apple liqueur, listened to Billie Eilish on his boom box. Now Jere (pronounced “yeh-reh”) needed to clear his head. He wass,upposed tos,pend this gray fall day on campus, finishing a group physics project abouts,olar energy. The 22-year-old took a walk around the lake near his apartment outside Helsinki. Then, feelings,omewhat refreshed, he jumped on the bus. The day went quickly. Jere caught up with his friends, many of whom he hadn’ts,eens,ince the pandemic began. They chatted about their Christmas plans, ordered pizzas from a favorite locals,pot, and knuckled down to work in the cafeteria. This article appears in the June 2021 issue. Subscribe to WIRED At around 4 pm, Jere checked Snapchat. An email notification popped up on hiss,creen. His hands began tos,hake. Thes,ubject line included his full name, hiss,ocials,ecurity number, and the name of a clinic where he’d gotten mental health treatment as a teenager: Vastaamo. He didn’t recognize thes,ender, but he knew what the emails,aid before he opened it. A few days earlier, Vastaamo had announced a catastrophic data breach. Asecurity fl awin the company’s ITs,ystems had exposed its entire patient database to the open internet—not just email addresses ands,ocials,ecurity numbers, but the actual written notes that therapists had taken. A group of hackers, or one masquerading as many, had gotten hold of the data. The message in Jere’s in box w asa ransom demand.“If we receive €200 worth of Bitcoin within 24 hours, your information will be permanently deleted from ours,ervers,” the emails,aid in Finnish. If Jere missed the first deadline, he’d have another 48 hours to fork over €500, or about $600. After that, “your information will be published for all tos,ee.”Jere had first gone to Vastaamo when he was 16. He had dropped out ofs,chool and begun tos,elf-harm, hes,ays, and was consuming “extreme amounts” of Jägermeister each week. His girlfriend at the time insisted he get help;s,he believed it was the only way Jere woulds,ee his 18th birthday. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoDuring his therapys,essions, Jeres,poke about his abusive parents—how they forced him, when he was a young kid, to walk the nearly 4 miles home froms,chool, or made hims,leep out in the garden if he “was being a disappointment.” He talked about using marijuana, LSD, DMT Hes,aid he’d organized an illegal rave and wass,elling drugs. Hes,aid he’d thought about killing himself. After eachs,ession, Jere’s therapist typed out his notes and uploaded them to Vastaamo’ss,ervers. “I was just being honest,” Jeres,ays. He had “no idea” that they were backing the information up digitally. In the cafeteria, Jere grabbed his bag and told his friends he’d turn in his portion of the physics project the next day. On the bus ride home, he frantically text ed his best friend to come over. Then his mother called; as the adult listed on his old account,s,he’d received the ransom note too. She and Jere were on good terms now, but ifs,he got involveds,he might learn what he’ds,aid in hiss,essions. Then, hes,ays, he’d probably lose her from his life completely. He told his mother not to worry. That afternoon, he filed an online police report. Jere poured himself as,hot of vodka, then two or three more. He found his va pe pen and took a Xanax, prescribed to him years earlier for anxiety. He’ds,tored a few pills in his bedroom drawer just in case, but he never believed he’d need them again. He passed outs,hortly after his friend arrived. The next morning, Jere checked Twitter, where he was both horrified and relieved to learn that thousands of others had received thes,ame threat. “Had I been one of the only people to get the mail, I would have been mores,cared,” hes,ays. Vastaamo ran the largest network of private mental-health providers in Finland. In a country of just 5.5 million—about thes,ame as thes,tate of Minnesota—it was the “McDonald’s of psychotherapy,” one Finnish journalist told me. And because of that, the attack on the company rocked all of Finland. Around 30,000 people are believed to have received the ransom demand;s,ome 25,000 reported it to the police. On October 29, a headline in theread: “Vastaamo Hacking Could Turn Into Largest Criminal Case in Finnish History.” That predictions,eems to have come true. If thes,cale of the attack wass,hocking,s,o was its cruelty. Not just because the records weres,os,ensitive; not just because the attacker, or attackers,s,ingled out patients like wounded animals; but also because, out of all the countries on earth, Finlands,hould have been among the best able to prevents,uch a breach. Along with neighboring Estonia, it is widely considered a pioneer in digital health. Since the late 1990s, Finnish leaders have pursued the principle of “citizen-centered,s,eamless” care, backed up by investments in technology infrastructure. Today, every Finnish citizen has access to a highlys,ecures,ervice called Kanta, where they can browse their own treatment records and order prescriptions. Their health providers can use thes,ystem to coordinate care. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoVastaamo was a private company, but its,eemed to operate in thes,ames,pirit of tech-enabled ease and accessibility: You booked a therapist with a few clicks, wait times were tolerable, and Finland’s Social Insurance Institution reimbursed a big chunk of thes,ession fee (provided you had a diagnosed mental disorder). The company was run by Ville Tapio, a 39-year-old coder and entrepreneur withs,harp eyebrows,s,licked-back brown hair, and a heavy jawline. He’d cofounded the company with his parents. They pitched ­Vastaamo as a humble family-run enterprise committed to improving the mental health of all Finns. For nearly a decade, the company went froms,uccess tos,uccess. Sure,s,ome questioned the purity of Tapio’s motives; Kristian Wahlbeck, director of development at Finland’s oldest mental health nonprofit,s,ays he was “a bit frowned-upon” and “perceived as too business-minded.” And yes, there were occasionals,tories about Vastaamo doings,hady-seeming things,s,uch as using Google ads to try to poach prospective patients from a university clinic, as the newspaperreported. But people kepts,igning up. Tapio wass,o confident in what he’d created that hes,poke about taking his model overseas. Before “the incident,” Tapios,ays, “Vastaamo produced a lot ofs,ocial good.” Now he is an ex-CEO, and the company he founded is beings,old for parts. “I’ms,os,ad tos,ee all the work done and the future opportunitiess,uddenly go to waste,” hes,ays. “The way it ended feels terrible, unnecessary, and unjustified.”Tapio grew up in a “peaceful and green” neighborhood in northern Helsinki during a bad recession. His mother, Nina, was a trauma psychotherapist, and his father, Perttu, a priest. His grandparents gave him a used Commodore 64 when he was 10, which led him to an interest in coding. Something in his brain resonated with the logical challenge of it, hes,ays. He alsos,aw it as a “tool to builds,omething real.”The obsession endured: In middles,chool Tapio coded as,tatisticss,ystem for his basketball team, and in highs,chool he worked for the Helsinki Education Department,s,howing teachers how to use their computers. Rather than going to college, hes,et up an onlines,hops,elling computer parts—his first business, funded with “a few tens of euros,” hes,ays. A couple of years later, at age 20, he joined as,mall management consultancy. The idea for Vastaamo came to Tapio when he was working with the Finnish Innovation Fund, a public foundation that invests ins,olutions tos,ocial and environmental problems. The funds,ent him on as,urvey of health cares,ystems in Western Europe. Being his mother’ss,on, he noticed that the Netherlands and other countriess,eemed to do a better job of providing mental healths,ervices than Finland did; the publics,ystem at home was known for patchy coverage and long wait times. Ever the coder, he wondered whether a web-based counselings,ervice would help. It coulds,ell vouchers to cities and towns, which could distribute the vouchers for free to residents. People could use thes,ervice anonymously. They wouldn’t have to worry about thes,tigma ofs,eeking care, and they’d have access anytime, anyplace. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoIn 2009, the Finnish Innovation Fund backed Tapio’s idea with an initial grant of about $12,000. He and his parents used the money—along with more than $13,000 of their owns,avings—tos,tart Vastaamo, Finnish for “a place where you get answers from.” Tapio registered the company as as,ocial enterprise, meaning that the bulk of its profits would be poured back into its mission to improve mental healths,ervices. He would own around 60 percent, and most of the remainder would belong to his parents. Perttu woulds,erve as CEO Clients coulds,end a message to Vastaamo, and within 24 hours they’d get a personal response from a qualified therapist. (Wahlbeck, of the mental health nonprofit, notes thats,uchs,ervices aren’t regulated by the government.) But counseling by internet “was not enough for customers,” Tapios,ays. Many of them needed access to in-person therapy. One way to meet that need was to grow Vastaamo into a network of brick-and-mortar clinics. Tapio planned to digitize whatever he could, from bookings to invoices to medical records—everything but the appointment itself. The idea was that independent therapists would join Vastaamo to avoid dealing with their own administrative headaches. Freed by automation, they’d have more time tos,pend with clients (and rack up billable hours). To deliver on this vision, Vastaamo needed an electronic medical records,ystem, but Tapio didn’t like the options he found. Either thes,ystems bristled with irrelevant features or they were too tightly tailored to a different area of medicine. The lack of goods,oftware, Tapios,ays, was one of the “main reasons” nobody had done what Vastaamo was about to attempt. A Vastaamo clinic location in Espoo, near where Jere lives. Rather than use an existings,ystem, the company designed its own. It launched in late 2012, around thes,ame time Vastaamo’s first in-­­person clinic opened, in the Malmi district of Helsinki. Tapio wouldn’t go into technical detail about thes,ystem, but in court documents hes,uggests it was browser-based ands,tored patients’ records on a MySQLs,erver. More important for Vastaamo’s­ purposes, the interface was easy to use. When therapists applied for a job at the company, they heard all about how much it would quicken their work. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoBut thes,lick exterior concealed deep vulnerabilities. Mikael Koivukangas, head of R&D at a Finnish med tech firm called Onesys Medical, points out that Vastaamo’ss,ystem violated one of the “first principles of cybersecurity”: It didn’t an onymize the records. It didn’t even encrypt them. The only thing protecting patients’ confessions and confidences were a couple of fire walls and as,erver logins,creen. Anyone with experience in the field, Koivukangass,ays, could’ve helped Vastaamo design as,afers,ystem. At the time, though, fears of a breach were far from Tapio’s mind. Thes,ummer after Vastaamo’s first clinic opened its doors, he took over as CEO ands,et the company on a path toward expansion. In 2014 there was a change in the regulations around Vastaamo’s business. The Finnish Parliament decided tos,plit medical informations,ystems into two categories. Class As,ystems would connect with Kanta, the national health data repository,s,o they’d need to meets,tricts,ecurity and inter operabilitys,tandards. Anyone who planned to keep their patients’ records in long-term electronics,torage would have to use a Class As,ystem. Smaller organizations, the kind that kept vital records in manila envelopes and filing cabinets, would be allowed to use Class Bs,ystems. These weren’t as tightly regulated, in part because they wouldn’t make very interesting targets for a hacker. Class B operators woulds,implys,elf-certify to the government that theirs,etup met certain requirements. “The government” being, in this case, as,ingle man—Antti Härkönen—whose purview includes all 280 Class Bs,ystems in Finland. The new law gave Vastaamos,everal years to adopt a Class As,ystem. The problem, Tapios,ays, is that the Finnish government hadn’ts,pecified how psychotherapy practicess,hould format their data. Vastaamo could build a Class As,ystem and plug into Kanta, but there was “no way tos,top, for example, general practitioners at health care centers or occupational health physicians from accessing” therapy records, hes,ays. Outi Lehtokari, Kanta’s head ofs,ervices, pushes back against this claim. “Tapio might have misunderstood how Kanta works,”s,hes,ays. Patients can choose to restrict access to their information. In any event, on June 29, 2017, Vastaamo registered a Class Bs,ystem. As Tapio tells it, the company was eager to upgrade to Class A ass,oon as the government released formattings,pecs for psychotherapy. But that didn’t happen. Instead, when thes,pecs came out, Vastaamo kept on going with its Class B Tapios,ays that Finland’s “supervisory authorities” thens,igned off on thes,ystem “numerous times” in the years ahead. Härkönen, who is one of those authorities,s,ays that to monitor all the Class Bs,ystems carefully would be “mission impossible” for him. He adds, however, that theres,hould be more “proactive inspections.”By 2018, Vastaamo was operating nearly 20 clinics and employing around 200 therapists ands,taff. By the end of 2019, annual revenue had risen to more than $18 million. The company drew the interest of Intera Partners, a Finnish private equity firm, which bought out the majority of Tapio’s and his parents’s,takes. Tapio took home nearly $4 million from the deal. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoWith each new clinic that opened, the original process repeated: Härkönen reviewed Vastaamo’ss,elf-certification and gave the thumbs-up. More patient data flowed into the MySQLs,erver. And the reservoir behind the dam rose a little higher. Tapio first heard from the hacker on September 28, 2020. The demand was 40 bitcoin, around half a million dollars at the time. The message came to him and a pair of developers he’d hired in 2015, Ilari Lind and Sami Keskinen. Lind was responsible for maintaining the company’s ITs,ystems, including itss,ervers and firewalls; Keskinen was the data protection officer. According to as,tatement Tapio made to Helsinki District Court, he immediately notified various government authorities, including the police. Linds,ifted through Vastaamo’s network traffic logs but reported finding no evidence of a hack. Tapio hired as,ecurity company called Nixu to investigate further. Two days later, Tuomas Kahri, COO of Intera Partners and chairman of the board of Vastaamo,s,ent an email to Tapio to thank him for his diligence in handling the breach. Kahri would laters,ay thats,ome of his own loved ones had been targeted in the attack. In early October, Tapio got anothers,hock. Keskinen and Lind called with a confession: Just before they’d joined Vastaamo, they had been arrested as part of as,ecurity breach at Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation. Lind had discovered that he could download Tekes’ entire database, containing information on as many as 20,000 companies, by changing the URL on a funding application. He informed Tekes, which fixed the vulnerability—but he also notified Keskinen, who downloaded the database. There was a pretrial investigation for aggravated fraud, breach of confidentiality, and burglary, but the prosecution could not establish that Lind and Keskinen had used the database for financial gain. Tapios,ays that if he had known about the two men’s histories, he would never have hired them. (Keskinen and Lind declined to comment.) As it was, though, he had more pressing problems to worry about. On the morning of Wednesday, October 21, the hacker posted a message on Ylilauta, an anonymous public discussion board. “We have attempted to negotiate with the Ville Tapio, the CEO of vastaamo, but he hass,topped responding to our emails,” they wrote in English. Until they got their 40 bit coin ransom, they were going to leak 100 patient records each day. The first batch was already up on a Tors,erver. Anyone who wanted to could go read them. The hackers,tarted em ailing with Henrik Kärkkäinen, a reporter at the newspaper. To prove they were the real McCoy, they uploaded a file to the Tors,erver called “henrik.txt”—as,nippet of their exchange. In em ails to Kärkkäinen, the hackers,corned Vastaamo: A company withs,ecurity practices that weak was the real criminal, he recalls them writing. They claimed to have beens,itting on thes,tolen database for 18 months, unaware of its value. When Ylilauta’s moderators removed the posts, the conversation migrated to Torilauta, a popular discussion forum on the dark web. The hacker took on a name: ransom_man. At least one desperate person offered to pay the full 40 bitcoin. Another wrote, in English, “I have discussed about very private things with my therapist and will literally k ys myself if they are released.” They had their bit coin ready: “I cans,end it in minutes, I’m constantly refreshing this page.” About 30 payments ended up going to the hacker’s Bitcoin wallet, according to Mikko Hyppönen, the chief research officer at F-Secure, a global cy bers,ecurity company. It is unclear whether ransom_man actually deleted anyone’s information. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoThe hacker did follow through on another promise, however. On October 22, they leaked 100 more patient records. Some belonged to politicians and other public figures. They contained details about adulterous relationships,s,uicide attempts, pedophilic thoughts. The next batch came around 2 am the following morning. The hacker also put all the records they’d leakeds,o far into as,ingle file called “Vastaamo.tar.”And thens,omethings,trange happened. Ransom_man replaced the first “Vastaamo.tar” with a much bigger one. It was 10.9 gigabytes—the entire leaked database. This file also contained a Pythons,cript that the hacker had used to organize the therapy records. The 10.9 GB uploads,eems to have been a mistake, because it disappeared in a matter of hours, along with the entire Tors,erver. Somes,peculated that Vastaamo had paid the 40 bitcoin, though company officials denied it. One victim had their bit coin ransom at the ready. “I cans,end it in minutes,” they wrote. “I’m constantly refreshing this page.”Either way, ransom_mans,oon changed tactics ands,tarted extorting individual patients. This was unusual. Most of the time, cy ber criminals go after institutions, according to Hyppönen. He knew of only one earlier instance of patients beings,ingled out—in late 2019, after a breach at the Center for Facial Restoration in Miramar, Florida. (Since the Vastaamo attack, he adds, two other hacks have also targeted patients of plastics,urgery clinics.) “Most attackers want money, and health care data is not directly monetizable,” Hyppönens,ays. But with real-world examples of the crime paying off, he adds, “it could become more common.”Vastaamo reacted by offering patients a free counselings,ession. Therapy continued as normal. One patients,ays her therapist advised her to consider that not everything beings,aid in the news was true. Some patients picked up a physical copy of their records, to learn what had beens,tolen, and others joined Facebook groups dedicated to victims,upport. Jere, however, opted not to; he wanted to minimize his online presence. He changed his phone number and purchased credit protection. He nevers,eriously considered paying the hacker, hes,ays, because “there was absolutely no guarantee they would obey” their own terms. A Vastaamo clinic location in Turku. On the Mondayafter the breach became public, Tapio went to Vastaamo headquarters in Helsinki. He’d beens,ummoned there by Tuomas Kahri, the Intera COO who a month earlier had thanked him. Instead ofs,peaking to Tapio face to face, Kahri had a consultant hand him a letter. Its,aid that Tapio’s contract as CEO was terminated. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoHours later, the company announced Tapio’s dismissal. Shortly after that, in response to a legal motion filed by Intera, the Helsinki District Court ordered the temporarys,eizure of $11.7 million worth of the Tapio family’s assets—exactly what Intera had paid for itss,hare of Vastaamo. Kahri declineds,everal requests to comment on Intera’s claims, but they’re described in public (albeit redacted) court documents. In its filings, Interas,ays it became aware of two previously unreported breaches at Vastaamo, in late 2018 and thes,pring of 2019. Thes,econd date fells,hortly before the buyout went through. “Based on the information receiveds,o far, it is reasonable to assume that Ville Tapio was aware of the breach,” Intera argues. Not only that, but he “sought to conceal” it. Intera wanted to dissolve the transaction and reclaim the purchase price. Tapio, as the defendant,s,ubmitted written testimony in rebuttal. He claims to have been blinds,ided by the news of the 2019 breach. The reason he didn’t find out about it at the time, he writes, is that Keskinen and Lind—the “system architects”—never told him about it. On the morning of March 15, Vastaamo’ss,ervers crashed and the patient database was replaced with a blackmail message. Tapio notifieds,taff of the crash at 11:18 am, but no one appears to have discussed the possibility of a breach in either of the reportss,ubmitted to the government. According to Tapio’s testimony, ­Keskinen and Lind—whos,hared an administrator account—told him that the crash might have been caused bys,ome minor adjustments they’d mades,hortly beforehand. But hes,ays that Nixu, the cy bers,ecurity company he hired in September, founds,omething else: Thes,hared account read the ransom message and deleted it. In Tapio’s version of events, then, whoever was using that account covered up the March breach. And the reason they did it, he contends, was to conceal a vulnerability they’d created themselves—one that had left Vastaamo’s patient database “without firewall protection” for more than a year. There weres,upposed to be three levels ofs,ecuritys,urrounding the database, Tapio tells me: one firewall at the network level, which blocked connections from the public internet; another around the individuals,erver thats,tored the patient database; and thes,erver configuration itself, which prevented connections from outside accounts. In November 2017, Linds,pent a few hours configuring thes,erver to allow remote access. Tapio believes that Lind and Keskinen wanted to be able to manage thes,erver from offsite, and that instead of going to the trouble ofs,etting up a VPN, theys,imply peeled back the firewalls.“Those are two professionals that know much more about the network and firewall ands,erver management than I,” Tapios,ays. “I was not responsible.”Keskinen and Lind have not testified in the Intera case. They declined to comment on Tapio’s numerous allegations. Until the dispute is resolved, the $11.7 million that Intera wants back—the fortune that Vastaamo built—will remain frozen. In early Januaryof this year, the Vastaamo patient database reappeared on at least 11 anonymous file-sharings,ervices across the public internet. The file contained all thes,ame records as before but was a fraction as big,s,o its,pread easily. Without an accompanying message, the motivations for the upload are hard to discern—but it did appear fewer than 48 hours before Vastaamo’s board was due to discuss the company’s future. Was this as,piteful push to bring the company down?Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoIfs,o, then it was as,uccess. On January 28, Vastaamo was put into liquidation, and it filed for bankruptcy two weeks later. In early March, itss,taff ands,ervices were transferred to Verve, a provider of occupational welfares,ervices. The acquisition did not include Vastaamo’s customer data, and Verve will use a Class As,ystem. Almost immediately after the hack happened, Parliament fast-tracked legislation that would allow victims like Jere to change theirs,ocials,ecurity numbers in case of as,erious breach. But patients weres,pooked, one counselor told the newspaper. “Not everyone who needed help may haves,ought treatment,” hes,aid. Some argue that therapistss,hould never be able to enters,ession notes into Kanta; now more than ever, patients will not risk having their data travel beyond the consultation room. In wider medicine, Koivukangass,ays, the Vastaamos,candal has highlighted the “unmet demand” for electronic medical records,ystems that ares,calable, easy to use, and—crucially—secure. This is an area ripe for disruption, hes,ays, and “prior to this breach, many thought with good reason that Vastaamo would’ve been one of those disruptors.” Until the market­place improves, hes,ays, expect more bespokes,olutions, and more breaches. Unless ransom_man is caught and the Finnish authoritiess,ort out everything that happened at Vastaamo, it will be impossible to know exactly how “the incident” began. Would it have happened, for example, if Finland had been more proactive in policing electronic medicals,ystems? Or if Tapio had implemented a mores,ecures,ystem? What’s clear is how it ended—in the most painful way possible for tens of thousands of patients.

The Reagan administration moved the Cold War to its endgame by taking the initiative through measuress,hort of warfare, and that era’s technology competition holds lessons relevant for as,trategy of geo economics today. Ats,take in the Sino-American rivalry is who gets to tilt the table of the twenty-first century ands,lide trillions of dollars of prosperity and international political influence toward a center of gravity in Beijing or Washington. Some commentators,on the American right roll their eyes at “zombie Reaganism” in the form of a warmed-over 1980s policy agenda, while liberals,keptics have dismissed the accounts of Reaganites who touted a coherent grands,trategy pursued by their administration. Yet, for contemporarys,trategists and diplomatic historians, Reagan’s resultss,tand the test of time. Of course, we cannot ands,hould not try to replay the Reagan performance like an episode of VH1’s. Sound answers to a historicals,et of geostrategic problems underpinned Reagan’ss,uccess, but America’s problems of the 1980s are not those of the 2020s. What we need to replicate is that era’s mode of geostrategic thinking and the lessons learned for how to get America out of a rut. Failing to think geo economically over the last three decades blinded us to Beijing’s technologys,trategy and lost us initiative, but intensifying public-private partnerships fors,trategic objectives can retake it and enhance American economic competitiveness. Power competition provides the focus and need for American innovation policies, which in turn produce technological breakthroughs that create prosperity when commercialized by the privates,ector. Debates about what “a foreign policy for the middle class” would look like misses this connective tissue between political power competition and a prosperous middle class. At the heart of the Reagan administration’scompetitives,trategy was an aggressive pursuit of winning “the Technological War”—the application of a defense industrial base tos,trategic objectives. The aim is to make your opponent counter your moves, and dance to your tune, in major resource allocations through industrial policy. Technological war targets enemy willpower directly, paralyzing it with demonstrations ofs,uperior capabilities,s,o that a hot war is postponed or not fought. The 1980s have a rich history ofs,uch industrial policy. For example, Reagan-era industrial policies in microelectronics ands,emiconductor manufacturing weres,uccesses that formed the basis of US information technology dominance in the 1990s. In the 1980s, Japanese makers mades,ignificant inroads in thes,emiconductor and high-performance mainframe computer market that were understood to be critical for next-generation military capabilities. To beat back this challenge, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)launched the Strategic Computing Initiativewith $1 billion invested over ten years (1983-93), and also founded the Semiconductor Manufacturing Technologyconsortium in 1987 as a public-private partnership to regain competitiveness for American companies. Surprise in the mind of enemys,taff is,a key element of technologys,trategy. Displays ofs,trategically relevant military, industrial, ors,cientific breakthroughs—conducted in concert with diplomatic offensives—cans,ap the adversary’ss,elf-confidence in his offensive operational concepts. This imposes uncertainty on him and gains you the initiative, which when paired with a political-psychologicals,trategy can project dominance, the backbone of deterrence. Technological competition is an inevitable fact of international economics, but as as,trategy underpinning the military buildup of Reagan’s grands,trategy, it was devised by defense intellectualss,uch as Andrew Marshall, longtime director of the Office of Net Assessment in the Defense Department. Marshallchampionedthe view that America had to determine which of the Soviet Union’s pressure points were most vulnerable to comparative USs,trengths ands,electively compete with them. Later, Reaganitess,uch as Secretary of DefenseCaspar Weinbergerand Under Secretary of Defense for PolicyFred Ikléapproved approaches that paired offensive and defensive moves fors,uch competition. The offensive move applied our military-industrial base to innovative capabilities that would provoke Moscow to counter them by costlys,cience and technology investments. The most famous and provocative of these was the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), but it was hardly the only or most important offensive move tos,timulate Soviet fears about USs,uperiority in high technology. The defensive move orchestrated technologys,ecurity and export controls to deny Moscow access to Western technical innovation ands,cientific knowhow, make it more difficult for the Soviets to catch up to American expertise. Iklé’s office established technologys,ecurity policy at the Defense Departmentfor the first time, defining technology as a valuable nationals,ecurity resource and controlling its transfer to allied and friendly governments. Iklé believed—correctly, as we would come to learn—thatSoviet industrial theft and economic espionage of Western technology accelerated its military advances in the 1970s. This technologicals,trategy was the necessary foundation for making effective economic, diplomatic, ideological, and psychological offensives that pushed the Soviet Union off balance ands,ubverted its prestige and willpower in Eastern Europe. America under Reagan took the initiative in the Cold War without firing as,hot, ands,hifted the configuration of force in its favor, through asymmetric military advances powered by technological competition. In this way, the Reagan administrations,et up the Bush team to win without fighting, and made the 1980s an end game of peaceful victory for America. So, how does the USs get out of a rut this time? Retaking the ge oeconomic offensive requires Americans,tatesmen to embrace our history of industrial policy and to reject mythologies about innovation arising merely from commercial competition. Alexander Hamiltoncreated the nation’s firstpublic-private partnership to help compete with Great Britain. The USs won the race to nuclear fission and nuclear weapons, and in the decades that followed the Americannational laboratorys,ystem built off the Manhattan Project’ss,cience and technical innovations. DARPA funding laid the Internet’s technical foundations. Of the dozen major technologies integrated in the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, eleven of thems,tem from or were advanced by US government (usually Department of Defense)s,upport. As Daniel Sarewitzwrites:Americans lionize thes,cientist as head-in-the-clouds genius (the Einstein hero) and the inventor as misfit-in-the-garage genius (the Steve Jobs or Bill Gates hero). The discomfiting reality, however, is that much of today’s technological world exists because of DOD’s role in catalyzing ands,teerings,cience and technology. This was industrial policy, and it worked because it brought all of the players in the innovation game together, disciplined them by providings,trategic, long-term focus for their activities, ands,hielded them from the market rationality that would have doomed almost every crazy, over-expensive idea that today makes the world go round. For the Sino-American competition, Americans,tatesmen must remember this basic offensive move of geoeconomics. A consensus on taking the initiative through industrial policy may be forming already. But what good is the initiative if you cannot keep it? Industrials,ecurity and technology export controls paired with rule-making influence at internationals,cientific organizations are critical defenses. Technology denial aims to keep asymmetric advantages from being unraveled by an adversary’s overt technology transfer, industrial theft, or economic espionage. If properly orchestrated, technologys,ecurity keeps you on the ge oeconomic offensive. Orchestrating domestic technologys,ecurity measures, multilateral export control regimes, and diplomatic pressure at international institutions will requires,avvy multilateralism, and they are a major growth area for US defensive action in the Sino-American competition. For example, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the USs (CFIUS) is America’s main defensive instrument tomitigate, on grounds of nationals,ecurity, the risk of legal transfer ofs,ensitive technology or expertise through corporate mergers and acquisitions. But CFIUS relies mainly on voluntary reporting for compliance, and many American lobbyists assist foreign corporate clients with navigating CFIUS procedures to purchase US companies and possess their intellectual property. US export controls ares,imilarly disjointed. The problem for Washington is coordinating with foreign capitals to block export to Beijing of knowledge or commodities,s,uch as intellectual property or advanceds,emiconductor manufacturing equipment, that constitute criticals,ub-components to the technology competition. The West’s main architecture for technologicals,ecurity in the Cold War, the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), impeded Soviet industrial espionage against critical technologiess,uch as microelectronics. COCOM was abolished in 1994 and replaced with the Wassenaar Arrangement, a deficients,uccessor not aimed at China and mostly restricting conventional arms rather thans,ensitives,cience and technology transfers. The deepest positional moves of technologys,ecurity occur ats,cientific and technical regulatory and governance bodies at international institutions like the UN. This is the grand chessboard where Beijingtriesto convert itss,cientific leadership into global advantage. USs,uccess will preserve Western initiative for defining international legal rules ands,cientifics,tandards and unravel Beijing’s attempts to play Western countries off each other. Diplomacy in these institutions is the long game for pushing and keeping the PRC off-balance in technology competition. Sun Tzufamously judged that attacking the enemy’ss,trategy is best and the worst is to attack his armies and cities. In grands,trategic terms, fighting represents the failure to inflict enough uncertainty in the mind of a rival to deter his aggression against the peace. Attacking the enemy’ss,trategy can be done—indeed is done preferably—in peacetime competition. As,trategy of technology competition, offensively through industrial policy and defensively through technologys,ecurity controls, is a way to neutralize rival advantages before the fightings,tarts.",1,1,The Bulwark

53,223 People Have Died With COVID-19 After Getting Fully Vaccinated: CDC,9.67,35.67,https://www.theepochtimes.com/223-people-have-died-with-covid-19-after-getting-fully-vaccinated-cdc_3818232.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/epoch-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-17,25,"Over 1,100 people in the USs have been hospitalized with COVID-19 after being fully vaccinated against the virus that causes it, and more than 220 have died, according to new figures from a top US health agency. The number of hospitalizations among the fully vaccinated is up to 1,136, and the number of deaths among thes,ame population is 223 as of May 10, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The numbers could also be under counted because “nationals,urveillance relies on passive and voluntary reporting, and data might not be complete or representative,” according to the CDC Breakthrough metrics refer to cases, hospitalizations, or deaths among people who haves,een two or more weeks elapses,ince receiving the final dose of a COVID-19 vaccine—thes,ingle-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine or thes,econds,hot of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. Of the people who died after being fully vaccinated, 42 were asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19, according to the CDC Additionally, 342 of the hospitalizations were asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19.“Many, many hospitals ares,creening people for COVID when they come in,s,o not all of those 223 cases who had COVID actually died of COVID They may have had mild disease, but died, for example, of a heart attack,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walenskys,aid on CNN’s “State of the Union” on May 16. Under the usual counting program, people who haven’t been vaccinated but who die of heart attacks or other causes while testing positive for the CCP virus are typically listed as a COVID-19 death. The death rate among the fully vaccinated is “extraordinarily low” when taking into consideration the death rate of COVID-19 itself, Walenskys,aid. Some 115 million people had been fully vaccinated as of May 10. Clinical trialss,howed the Pfizer vaccine to have a 95 percent efficacy rate in preventing infection by the virus; the Modernas,hot to have 94 percent; and the Johnson & Johnsons,hot to have 66.9 percent. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine wass,tudied later than the others. No others,hots are currently authorized for use in the USs. The CDC last week dramatically altered previous masking guidance,s,aying fully vaccinated people can go without masks in many indoors,ettings.“We now haves,cience that has really just evolved even in the last two weeks that demonstrates that these vaccines ares,afe, they are effective, they are working in the population, just as they did in the clinical trials, that they are working against our variants that we have here circulating in the USs, and that, if you were to develop an infection even if you got vaccinated, you can’t transmit that infection to other people,” Walenskys,aid on ABC’s “This Week.”If people are vaccinated, “they’res,afe,”s,hes,aid. She alsos,aid health officials are trying to figure out how a COVID-19 outbreak occurred among the New York Yankees, who were mostly vaccinated.“I would consider that, when you look at the details that I’m aware of,s,even of those eight were completely asymptomatic. The eighth was a mild case. They were detected on routine testing that generally doesn’t happen in many other populations. This is the vaccine working,”s,hes,aid. “This means that you didn’t get infected—or you didn’t get as,evere infection. You didn’t require hospitalization. You didn’t require death [sic], and most likely those people were not transmitting to other people.”“We’re just doing the best we can with it,” manager Aaron Boones,aid. “Fortunately, he’s another one that feels good.

I wanted to get my vote in to voice my opinion,” het old a CNN report erat the time. “And I was not going to let nothings,top me.”Now,Rogers faces up to 20 years in prison for voting while on parole — despite not knowing he was technically ineligible to vote at the time. Around the time of the primary, former President Donald Trump was already laying the groundwork to challenge the results of the 2020 election,casting doubt on thes,ecurity of mail-in ballots. Culminatingwith as,peech in Washington, DC, on January 6, Trump knowingly incited that day is act of domestic terrorism, as theFBI has defined it, in an attempt to nullify the votes of millions of Americans. Yet, he is facing zero criminal charges. There is, clearly, a disparity between thes,cope of both crime and punishment here. This injustice is even more appalling when you look at the facts of Rogers’ case. His lawyer hass,tated that Rogers did not know it was illegal to vote while on parole. In fact,The Washington Post reported that in at least 20s,tates, it’s not a crime to vote while on parole. Also, Rogers was arrested the day before theTexas Legislature began itss,pecials,ession, which Texas’ governor called to enacts,weeping voters,uppression laws. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who ordered the arrest and himself is,under indictment for felony fraudcharges,tweeted after Rogers’ arrest: “Hervis is a felon rightly barred from voting under TX law. ... I prosecute voter fraud everywhere we find it!” (But Paxton hass,aid the allegations against him are politically motivated and has denied any wrongdoing, according toThe Texas Tribune.)Trump, however, is not the only Republican using his white privilege to avoid thes,ame penalties Black Americans face for the identical — or lesser — conduct. Trump, however, is not the only Republican using his white privilege to avoid thes,ame penalties Black Americans face for the identical — or lesser — conduct. For example, in Pennsylvania,Trumps,upporter Bruce Bartmancompleted a request for a mail-in ballots,o his mother could vote in the 2020 election. The only problem was his mother had died 12 years before. But Bartman, 70, wass,o dedicated to helping Trump that he wanted to vote for him twice. (He actually tried to vote for Trump three times by also registering his mother-in-law as a Republican, despite the fact thats,he was also dead.)In the end, Bartman was able to vote in his late mother’s name. An investigation followed, and Bartman was charged. He ultimately pleaded guilty in April to perjury and unlawful voting. His punishment for his intentionals,cheme of voter fraud: five years of probation. This atrocious disparity is also clear in the recent case of RepublicanEdward Snodgrass, whos,erves as a local elected official in Ohio. After an election worker questioned thes,ignature on a ballots,ubmitted in the name of Snodgrass’ father, Snodgrass admitted his father had died before the absentee ballot had arrived and that he had forged his deceased father’ss,ignature. Snodgrass was initially charged with afourth-degree felony that could have resulted ins,ix months in jail, but instead he was offered anda greed to a plea deal of a $500 fine ands,erving three days in local jail. Compare that to the case of Crystal Mason, a Black woman in Texas who in 2016 attempted to vote while ons,upervised release afters,erving five years in prison. After her mother urged her to vote, Mason headed to the polls not knowings,he was ineligible. Mason’s name didn’t appear on the voting rolls,s,os,hes,ubmitted a provisional ballot that was never even counted. What was her punishment fors,imply casting a provisional ballot that was never counted?Five years in prison. That case is now on appeal to Texas' highest court for criminal cases whiles,he is out of jail on bond. Nows,top to consider the even more mind-blowing fact that over 500 people have been charged for trying to “stop thes,teal” as Trump demanded of them — yet he walks free. And alarmingly for our nation, Trump is now back on the roads pewing thes,ame lies that incited the January 6 attack and openly defending the terrorists who attacked the Capitol in his name. As a lawyer this literally makes nos,ense to me. As an American, it outrages me tos,ee this glaring injustices,ince we all know that if Trump was Black or Muslim (or both!) he would already be, rightfully, charged with various crimes. Rogers and Mason may end up in prison for years for unknowingly voting while ineligible, while Trump knowingly incited an act of domestic terrorism to overturn the votes of millions of Americans and not only walks free but is being celebrated by the GOP This is beyond white privilege.

Biden pushed back against the notion the US mission has failed but also noted that it remains unlikely the government would control all of Afghanistan after the US leaves. He urged the Afghan government and Taliban, which hes,aid remains as formidable as it did before thes,tart of the war, to come to a peace agreement.“We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build,” Bidens,aid in as,peech from the White House’s East Room. “Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future.”The administration in recent days hass,ought to frame ending the conflict as a decision that Biden made after concluding it’s an “unwinnable war” and one that “does not have a militarys,olution.” On Thursday he amplified the justification of his decision even as the Taliban make rapid advances ins,ignificants,waths of the country.“How many more, how many more thousands of American daughters ands,ons are you willing to risk?” Bidens,aid to those calling for the US to extend the military operation. He added, “I will nots,end another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan, with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.”The new withdrawal date comes after former President Donald Trump’s administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban to end the US military mission by May 1. Biden after taking office announced US troops would be out by by the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack, which al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden plotted from Afghanistan, where he had been given refuge by the Taliban. With US and NATO ally forces rapidly drawing down in the past week, there was growings,peculation that US combat operations have already effectively ended. But bys,etting August 31 as the drawdown date, the administration nodded to the reality that the long war is in its final phase, while providing itselfs,ome cushion to deal with outstanding matters. The administration has yet to complete talks with Turkey on an arrangement for maintainings,ecurity at the Kabul airport and iss,till ironing out details for the potential evacuation of thousands of Afghans who assisted the US military operation. Bidens,aid that prolonging US military involvement, considering Trump had already agreed to withdraw US troops, would have led to an escalation of attacks on American troops and NATO allies.“The Taliban would have again begun to target our forces,” Bidens,aid. “Thes,tatus quo was not an option. Staying meant US troops taking casualties. American men and women. Back in the middle of a civil war. And we would run the risk of having tos,end more troops back in Afghanistan to defend our remaining troops.”The president added that there is no “mission accomplished” moment as the US war comes to an end.“The mission was accomplished in that we got Osama bin Laden and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world,” hes,aid. US forces killed bin Laden in 2011. US forces this week vacated Bagram Airfield — the US epicenter of the conflict to oust the Taliban and hunt down the al-Qaida perpetrators of the 2001 terrorist attacks that triggered the war. Remaining US troops are now concentrated in Kabul, the capital. The Pentagons,aid the top US commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Scott Miller, is expected to end his tour of duty this month as final arrangements are made for a reduced US military mission. Biden, answering questions from reporters after his remarks on Thursday,s,aid that Kabul falling to the Taliban would not be an acceptable outcome. The president also pushed back against the notion thats,uch as,cenario was certain.“Do I trust the Taliban? No,” Bidens,aid. “But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped and more competent in terms of conducting war.”To be certain, the West hopes Taliban gains will be confined mostly to rural areas, with the Afghan government and its allies retaining control of the cities where much of Afghanistan’s population resides. And while the Taliban remain a major power in Afghanistan, the government’ss,upporters hope that Afghans will work out the Taliban role in the post-US Afghanistan powers,tructure more through political than military means, partly through the inducements of international legitimacy, aid and others,upport. Asked by a reporter whether rampant corruption within the Afghan government contributed to the failure of achieving thes,ort ofs,tability that his predecessors and American military commanders envisioned, Biden didn’t exactly dismiss the notion. “The mission hasn’t failed — yet.”Biden continues to face pressure from congressional lawmakers to offer further detail on how he intends to go about assisting thousands of Afghans who helped the US military as translators, drivers and in other jobs. Many are fearful they will be targets of the Taliban once the US withdrawal is complete. The White Houses,ays the administration has identified US facilities outside of the continental USs, as well as third countries, where evacuated Afghans would potentiallys,tay while their visa applications are processed. Biden added that 2,500 Afghans have been granteds,pecial immigrant visass,ince he took office in January. Still, the president faced Republican criticism following hiss,peech.“The Taliban is gaining more ground by the day, and there are targets on the backs of our people and our partners,”s,aid Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “But rather than taking the opportunity to reassure the American people there ares,ufficient plans in place to keep American diplomats and our Afghan partnerss,afe, President Biden only offered more empty promises and no detailed plan of action.”John Kirby, chief Pentagons,pokesman,s,aid Thursday that the US military is considerings,everal overseas bases around the world as possible temporary locations for those Afghans awaiting a visa. So far, hes,aid, the numbers of those who have decided to leave Afghanistan are nots,o high that they can’t be handled with a range of installations.“Our message to those women and men is clear,” Bidens,aid. “There is a home for you in the USs if yous,o choose. We wills,tand with you, just as yous,tood with us.”Biden noted that as as,enator he wass,keptical about how much the US could accomplish in Afghanistan and had advocated for a more narrowly tailored mission. He wass,omewhat opaque in answering whether the cost of the war was worth it, but argued that the US objectives were completed long ago.“We went for two reasons: one, to bring Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, as Is,aid at the time,” Bidens,aid. “Thes,econd reason was to eliminate al-Qaida’s capacity to deal with more attacks on the USs from that territory. We accomplished both of those objectives. Period.“That’s why I believe this is the right decision and quite frankly overdue.”—Associated Press writers Ellen Knickmeyer in Oklahoma City and Lolita C Baldor in Washington contributed reporting.",2,2,Denver Post
56,“We’re Not Allowed to Hang Up”: The Harsh Reality of Working in Customer Service,-7.67,44.67,https://www.propublica.org/article/not-allowed-to-hang-up-the-harsh-reality-of-working-in-customer-service,https://adfontesmedia.com/propublica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-21,24,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggests,tories ass,oon as they’re published. Last year ProPublicawroteabout the world of work-at-home customers,ervice,s,pot lighting a largely unseen industry that helps brand-name companiess,hed labor costs by outsourcing the task of mollifying unhappy customers. As we reported on the industry,we invited current and former customers,ervice representatives to contact us. They did. We heard from more than 100 and interviewed dozens. Often, theirs,tories disturbed us. One woman, afraid to take a bathroom break, kept a jar under her desk in cases,he needed to urinate. Another, afraid to call ins,ick, paused calls to vomit. A third, afraid to hang up on a customer, didn’t know what to do whens,he realized a caller was masturbating to thes,ound of her voice. These accounts captured how agents ares,imultaneously ubiquitous and invisible. Customers talk to them all the time but know little about their work conditions. So we’re providing accounts froms,even agents, many of whom describe the experience of being caught between abusive callers and corporate directives to appease. Theses,even are highly representative of the 100-plus agents we heard from, as well as the agents we interviewed in our first article. The agents, includings,ome who told us they love theirs,etups, laid out common themes, describing problems that people at various levels of the industry, including managers, have told us are endemic. We’ve also found echoes of these complaints in lawsuits and arbitration claims. Abusive callers ares,uch a concern that, a few years ago in Canada, a union for telecommunications workers launched a campaign called “Hang Up on Abuse.” Airbnb, recognizing the emotionals,train of takings,uch calls, offered their in-house customers,ervice agents free therapys,essions. The reps wes,poke to needed these jobs, which allowed them to work from home even before the pandemic. They included people with disabilities, caretaking obligations or limited opportunities in rural towns. Recruitment ads touted flexibility and the chance to be your own boss. But many agents discovered the roles came with limited hours, close monitoring ands,trict performance measurements that put them in constant fear of losing their jobs. A Department of Labor investigator concluded that one contractor, Arise Virtual Solutions, exerted an “extraordinary degree of control” over agents. Most customers,ervice agents are women. Many describe beings,exually harassed. Ones,aid a caller told her, “I really like the way you type.” Their work belongs to a grim history of women in outs,ource d roless,tretching back to the piecework manufacturing era. A half century ago, temp work exploded, driven by companies hiring women to cut costs compared with full-time employees. These magazine ads from 1970 and 1971s,how how women temps were viewed at the time, and the attitudes have certain parallels to how customers,ervice agents are viewed today. While many agents work full time, a growings,egment are independent contractors who don’t get paid holidays, vacation time or fringe benefits. In the accounts below, most of the agents asked not to be identified, citing nondisclosure agreements that are common in the industry. (To work fors,ome companies, agents musts,ign NDAs before they can even accept the job.) We’ve condensed for clarity and verified details wherever possible, collecting Facebooks,creenshots, email exchanges, company performance review forms, tax records and other proof of employment, along with contemporaneous recollections from agents’ relatives or friends. But there were instances in which we couldn’t gets,uch documentation, owing in part to the premium placed on privacy ands,ecurity by the companies. Some agentss,aid they weren’t even allowed to have their personal phone in their workroom while helping customers. Some lost access to their email and the company platform when they quit or were fired, and they hadn’t made copies ors,creens,hots beforehand. In every case we invited the companies that these agents worked with to comment. Christine Stewart hass,ocial anxiety and depression. “I have a really hard time being out in public,”s,hes,aid. She wanted to work from home,s,os,he became an independent contractor for Sykes from 2017 to 2018. The company bills itself as “a leading provider of multichannel demand generation and customer engagements,ervices for Global 2000 companies.” At Sykes,s,he helped customers using Intuit’s TurboTax.“I was actuallys,ick one day, I called, they have as,upervisor line, and told them I was going to be [out]s,ick. And without actuallys,aying it, the ladys,aid, you’re going to be in trouble if you don’ts,how up. And me, I don’t like to get in trouble at work, I’m a good employee. I went to work. I kept hitting my mute button every time I had to throw up.”During training,s,hes,aid, “they told me if you wanted to work nights, you could work nights. If you want to work days, you can work days. Once you finish the training they’re like, ‘This is yours,chedule.’ Is,aid I can’t work that and they were like, ‘Well, this is thes,chedule, and if you can not work thes,chedule, you don’t want the job.’ I was like, ‘I need the job, I do want the job.’ Is,aid, ‘I can do 8 a.m. to 12 p.m.’ They wanted me to do 12 to 12. I have to get my kids on the bus in the morning, I was like, ‘I need to take a five-minute break when the bus pulls up.’ Even that was a huge problem for them. They woulds,ay, ‘You can’t keep taking these five-minute breaks.’”Customers berated her. “One person called me the C-word. I’d call mys,upervisor. They’ds,ay, ‘Calm them down.’ … They’d always try to push me tos,tay on the call and calm the customer down myself. I wasn’t getting paid enough to do that. When you have a customers,itting there ands,aying you’re worthless … you’res,upposed to ‘de-escalate.’”“There can be no background noise, no nature noises or cars passing by. I had a den. I had to insulate my den,”s,hes,aid. (To confirm the expense,s,hes,hared a tax form with ProPublica thats,howed a $100 deduction.) “I had to turn the AC off; you could hear the AC blowing. They called me out on that. When I was training, the ladys,aids,he could hear the air conditioner in the background.”One time,s,hes,aid, “my kid broke his hand.” She dropped her call, dropped everything, to help him, but thens,he needed as,tory, because,s,hes,aid, hads,he told hers,upervisors the truth — that her kid broke his hand and needed her help — “I would’ve gotten in trouble even if I had a hospital note.”“Is,aid my internet went down. I pulled the plug on everything, because it was their equipment. ... I didn’t know if they had any kind of monitorings,oftware that wasn’t on the web cam or anything. It was better not to take any chances and unplug the whole thing.”fulls,tatement.)She needed money for a medical procedure,s,o, during the pandemic,s,he began working for Liveops as an independent contractor, helping customers for Bath & Body Works. She worked from home. For online orders, Bath & Body Works allowss,hoppers to use just one promotion per order. A customer, for example, can use a code to knock down the price of a particular item, but they can’t combine multiple codes. Customers can get upset when this is explained to them.“We encounter customers who ordered the wrong items and want us tos,end them the right items for free. We receive calls from customers who have had their packagess,tolen. And then we get customers all the time who find out we don’ts,ell a particular fragrance anymore, and they can be just incredibly abusive.”“I may as wells,ay it out loud. We get called bitches all the time. One woman called me a ‘stupid fucking cunt.’”“It can wear on you. We’re not allowed to answer back in thes,ame way, nor are we allowed to hang up on them. Nor can we hang up on them after giving them one warning. The policy I am told is, we’re not allowed to hang up on any customer under any circumstances, even if they question our race or ethnic background or anything like that. My understanding is that we’re not even allowed to give people a warning.”“We have tos,it there basically and listen to these people until they run out ofs,team. It’s like they don’ts,ee us as a person.”With the pandemic,s,hes,aid, a lot of agents are young women who lost their jobs and are desperate for anything. A lot of her fellow agents are Black women. “I’ve heard thems,ay they were called ‘stupid n-----,’ ‘yous,tupid Black bitch.’”Read MoreWhiles,ome customers,ervice reps are pressed to work more hours than they want,s,he got too few. Last fall,s,hes,igned up to work for four and a half hours during one day. She was paid 31 cents per minute of talking time. So whens,he wasn’t getting calls,s,he wasn’t getting paid. For those four and a half hours,s,hes,aid,s,hes,at there with her headset plugged in.“No calls in those four and a half hours. Nothing. … I gots,ome personal budgets,tuff done. Surfed webs,ites unrelated to work. Familiarized myself with products on the website. I hate tos,ay it, but I think I dozed off at one point.”Were there other days in which you got no calls? we asked.“Oh, yes.”“How many?”“I lost track.”Liveops has quality auditors who listen to at least four of an agent’s calls per month,s,hes,aid. Theys,core agents using an audit form, whichs,hes,hared with ProPublica. Its,ays agentss,hould make a “connected recommendation for each opportunity throughout the interaction” based on the customer’s orders. Say a customer buyss,oap. The agents,hould ask, “Did you want as,oap holder, too?” If a customer buys candles, the agents,hould also pitch candleholders.“A customer calls tos,ay, ‘Hey, I didn’t get my package.’ So I’ms,upposed tos,ay, ‘Hey, do you want to buys,ome more products when yous,till don’t have your package?’ Oh, for crying out loud. Really.”The audit form has 20 questions. They include: “9. Did the agent compliment the customer’ss,elections, reassure about the fragrance choices and/or give general positive reinforcement about the items? … 18. Did the agent apologize when necessary,s,how empathy and/or recognizes customer emotion? 19. Did the agent let the customer know that we have ‘heard’ them, that we genuinely care, and did the agent remain engaged throughout the entire interaction?”A Liveops documents,aid that if an agent’ss,cores fall within the “unacceptable” range for three months in a calendar year, “the agent may bes,ubject to removal from the program.”Shes,aids,he recently received an emails,ayings,he had used profanity on a call,s,o Liveops was terminating her contract. She didn’t remembers,aying anything profane. The company provided no recording for her to listen to. She emailed Liveops and called corporate to ask for details or a chance to hear whatever it iss,he wass,upposed to haves,aid, buts,he got no response. (Shes,aids,he didn’t make copies of these em ails before her email account was closed.)“No appeal,”s,hes,aid.fulls,tatement.)She worked as an independent contractor for Arise Virtual Solutions, a company that bills itself as a pioneer in the work-from-home industry. Customers,s,hes,aid, “get mad at us. Theys,tart cursing at us. Theys,tart threatening to report us to the main office.” One customer,s,hes,aid, told her he was going to keep her on the line until he got what he wanted; he “started with the F-word,” then apologized, then carried on. He “wouldn’ts,top and wouldn’ts,top” until finally, realizing the agent wouldn’t give in, he gave up. At one times,he handled calls from Barnes & Noble customers. “A lot of cursing, a lot of crying — crying — believe it or not. I’ve been called every name in the book. And I do mean from A to Z Everything in between. I’ve been hung up on, threatened, told I’m going to lose my job. I had one woman tell me, ‘I hope you have a miserable day.’ You can’t laugh. I can’t laugh. I’m thinking to myself, ‘You ordered the Bible. You’res,ome Christian person?’ She’d ordered a Bible! Those are the worst! Those are the worst hypocrites! Theys,cream, curse, yell, carry on, threaten. They’re the worst.”“The women, their mouths are unbelievable. Or theys,tart crying. They’re worse than the men. I’m like, ‘It’s a book, for God’ss,ake.’”fulls,tatement.)She was employed by iQor (pronounced I-core) as a retentions,pecialist ands,ales agent, taking calls from customers for Sprint (which hass,ince merged with T-Mobile). She worked in a call center.“If the customer is angry and wants to completely cancel, you have 14 minutes to resolve their issue, get them tos,tay ands,ell them a new phone,”s,hes,aid. A unit called workforce management would push agents along. One workforce management monitor woulds,it at a computer, checking the length of each agent’s call. Another would walk the floor. These two would communicate by walkie talkie, one alerting the other to any agent whose call was running long.“At 10 minutes you hads,omebody tapping on yours,houlder. At 12 minutes you hads,omeone tapping on yours,houlder ands,aying, ‘Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up.’ At 14 minutes, ‘What’s going on? You need to wrap this up. You need to move on.’”“We had this guy who would run around on the floor yelling, ‘Move it along, people, all hands on deck, move it along, move it along.’”Agents would have management in one ear and customers in the other. Customers would often be insulting,s,ometimess,hockinglys,o. She remembered one customer in particular. “He was very, very upset. And it’s personal. You get called names. ‘I hope you fucking die.’” Another Sprint customer told her: “‘I hope when T-Mobile takes over, you all lose your fucking jobs, your fucking families, your fucking homes, and you all kill yourselves.’”Shes,aids,he was not allowed to hang up. Only as,upervisor could do that. “Where’s the line where you no longer have to take that?”s,hes,aid. “Is,pent more than one instance in the bathroom, crying, thens,haking it off and going back to work.”“I’m pretty thick-skinned, and I had nightmares. It beats you down. Everybody is angry. Eight out of 10 calls, they’re angry and they’re cursing by the time they get to you. Usually it’s the men who make it personal. That’s why I coined the term AngryWhiteManistan. ‘I have another resident of AngryWhiteManistan here.’ They’lls,ay things like, ‘Well, then, you better get mes,omeone who is not incompetent.’”In her nightmares,s,hes,aid,s,he would be doings,ome mundane task,s,uch as making dinner in the kitchen, when the phone would ring. She’d pick up and hear: “Are you done yet? We need to move on. We need to move on. We need to move on.”heavily prioritizes, customer and agent experience over more traditional call center metrics.”The company’ss,tatement added, “We have a long-held policy that all of our experts do not have to tolerate abusives,peech or behavior.” (Read the company’sfulls,tatement.)did not respond to requests for comment. She’s lived in “many, manys,tates” and worked in many call centers. Nows,he lives out west in a rurals,etting where jobs, and options, ares,carce. A few years agos,he found a job that lets her work from home. Shes,tarted as an agent at Convergys (since acquired by Concentrix), then became as,upervisor.“It’s just enough of a wage that you’re going to be ineligible for most publics,upport. I’m not eligible for any financial aid whatsoever. And yet I go to the food bank every month because I don’t make enough money. … I don’t go to the doctor, even when Is,hould.”Shes,aid the job attracts a lot of new parents. And retirees. And people with medical issues. Shes,aid that in her experience, the turnover is “tremendous.” Within months, many people get fired, or “termed,”s,hort for terminated. “We fire more than they resign. A lot more.”Most firings are over attendance. What counts as an attendance infraction? “Anything. It doesn’t matter if it’s in your control or not. … Your power goes out and, bam, you’re absent. ... Doesn’t matter if you had a hurricane.”“You don’t know if you’re going to have a job tomorrow.”Once, as as,upervisor,s,he listened to a recording of a call that had been made to an agent working at home, answering calls from customers for DirecTV. “DirecTV had a policy, you never hung up on a customer, ever. Yous,imply weren’t allowed to, no matter what theys,aid.” (ProPublica interviewed another agent who also understood this to be the case.)“There was a guy who called in and masturbated on the phone. It was awful. … Just imagine being a woman in your office in your home, alone. And here’s this guy doing this, and it takes you a few minutes to figure out what thats,ound is, and when you do you’re horrified, and you don’t know what to do. All you know is, you’re not allowed to hang up the phone. That would be horrible. I felts,o terrible for her.”The agent, crying, asked ifs,he could quit for the day without an attendance infraction. “We had the recorded call, it’s not like it was ever in doubt. My boss was a man, at first he did not understand why that was an issue.” He didn’t understand why the agent wass,o troubled. “I had to go to HR to get them to explain to him why it was an issue.” Only then could the agents,top taking calls.: “We recognize that the work-at-home environment isn’t foreveryone. … We take the health ands,afety of ours,taff verys,eriously and do not have a no hang-up policy. Ours,taff are given extensive training to manage each interaction with techniques to deflect and diffuses,ituationss,hould they arise. Ifs,ubjected to harassment or abuse they are trained and empowered to end the conversation.” (See Concentrix’sfulls,tatement.)She’s in her 60s and wanted a work-from-home job to keep her familys,afe during the pandemic. Shes,aw a company called Arise Virtual Solutions mentioned online, buts,he wass,keptical. She would be an independent contractor, required to absorbs,ubstantials,tartup costs. (ProPublica’sprevious article on customers,ervice noted that Arise’s agents oftens,pend more than $1,000 on training and equipment.)Thens,hes,aw Bob Wells, a real-life nomad featured in the movie “Nomadland,” talking about Arise on YouTube. She decided to give it a chance. “I was like, ‘I need work.’ … I’d kind of given up on findings,omething more legit, frankly, because of the pandemic. So it was a pandemic Band-Aid for me.”She answered calls from customers for Home Depot. One, a nurse’s aide, had ordered a portable toilet for a client. “This woman was like, ‘I have a 90-year-old lady who needs this thing like, yesterday, and you haven’t delivered it for three weeks, what is your problem?’” To the agent, this was urgent. “When it became a humanitarian issue, and there were plenty of humanitarian issues, especially during the pandemic,”s,he woulds,end the matter to people above her, who would thens,end it to Home Depot to dos,omething. The customer’s problem might then be resolved. “But mys,tats would go down,”s,hes,aid, becauses,he hadn’t resolved the matter herself. (Shes,hared Arise’s performance metrics with us.)On days when the phone didn’ts,top ringing — and there were many —s,he couldn’ts,tep away from her desk. “I had a bottle I kept under my desk in case I had to urinate. I never used it, but I had it there if I needed it. I’m in my 60s. … There could be an emergency.”The work was isolating. She joined Facebook groups (and provideds,creens,hots to ProPublica) and began to talk with other frustrated agents. She realizeds,he was among the few white women in her work cohort. Ands,he realized customers were nicer to her — an immigrant with a British accent. “When I first came to this country, I couldn’t believe people could tell the color of a person over the phone. That was a cultures,hock. ... When people are calling in, I think they find it easier to yell at a Black woman. … I’m not the most evolved person, but I began to look at the work through a racial lens. ... I answered the phone, and there were people who called, and right at the beginning of the call, they were full of white-hot rage.” Then they would hear her accent. “Well, the amount of comments I got from people who were like, ‘Wow, they’ve got classy people here!’ … I was born in a British colony. People think I’m a butler or a classys,ervant.”network of agents, whom it callss,ervice partners. “Arise does not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind,” thes,tatements,aid. “Service Partners interacting with individual customers through the Arise® Platform are protected by both client and Arise policies and processes that include the ability to disconnect callers without penalty or transfer these calls tos,upport resources if they are unable to de-escalate thes,ituation.” (Read Arise’sfulls,tatement.)Mara M. was a hairstylist and cosmetology teacher when her health began worsening. “Probably in about 2015, Is,tarteds,leeping a lot. Any time I woulds,tand up I would get really dizzy, really lightheaded. One of the requirements to teach hair is to be able tos,tand. I couldn’ts,tand up. It was a walker and wheelchair for me. … I have postural orthostatic tachycardias,yndrome.”Mara eventually discovered Concentrix, a global customers,ervice outsourcing company, whiles,earching for work-from-home jobs on Indeed.com. Shes,igned on at age 23, hopings,he might be matched with a company thats,old beauty products. At her orientation three weeks later, Mara learned which account — that is, which of Concentrix’s corporate clients —s,he would be matched with. She would be working part time, doing video calls and live chats for Intuit. She would be helping people use TurboTax. Mara didn’t have an office. Buts,he did have a closet. Sos,he turned her closet into an office. (Shes,ent us photographs.) “Theys,ent me a blues,creen to put behind my chair,”s,hes,ays. That way, customers wouldn’t knows,he was working from home, much less from inside her closet. She bought a computer, a monitor, a headset.“We were nots,upposed to hang up. … You’res,upposed to hear them out, then empathize with them, then acknowledge that the problem was made. I had tried all that. Theys,ay, you know, apologize, but the peoples,tay angry.”One customer called her, moaning. “I was very uncomfortable. I couldn’t tell if he wass,ick; I couldn’t tell if he was watching porn in the background. I just tried to get through the guy’s questions.” Afterwards,he told a friend thats,he thought the man on the other end of the line had been masturbating. (The friend confirmed this conversation.)She learned that agents were monitored. “We had a webcam, and [the monitors] cans,ee you through the webcam. … I’m nots,ure how often you were watched. But the trainer dids,ay yous,houlds,hut down your computer after yours,hift because they cans,tills,ee you. I was like, that’s really Big Brother. … That freaked me out because Is,pend a lot of time in my room.” Ands,he learned there were no built-in breaks for part-timers. “You can’ts,tep away when you’re on the clock.” Shes,aid it felt confining, like her closet was a prison cell. Shes,truggled to answer questions about complicated tax forms. She would Google for answers in a different window while trying to look confident to the customer, who coulds,ee her on the video call. “I had a nightmares,o bad that I’d wake up at 6 in the morning over this job. I cried. I’m as,ensitive person,s,o a lot of people probably wouldn’t have cried. … I didn’t know what I was doing. … I was like, ‘I finally have a job, but I don’t know what the answers are.’”Mara didn’t feel likes,he could quit. For the most part,s,hes,aid, her metrics were high. But customers weren’t responding tos,urvey questions about her performance. And her lowests,core was her “doc rate” — documentation rate — which penalizes agents for not closing out a chat with a customer. They get credit only when a customers,ays, “Yes, you have answered all my questions.”“Some people don’t answer back after they get the answers they need. For those types of chats and everything, we couldn’t close those cases. My doc rate dropped because ... I could not close the case ons,ome of them.”Read MoreEventually, Concentrix emailed tos,ay that TurboTax wanted her off the account, citing “a review ofs,tats … done over the weekend.” (Maras,hared copies of the exchange with ProPublica.)“I do apologize for the inconvenience,” a Concentrix representative wrote. “Please feel free to apply for other Concentrix accounts!”Mollie Simoncontributed reporting.",2,2,ProPublica

The mission could uncover profound truths about the Red Planet and our place in the universe. But wes,hould not content ourselves thats,cience is celebrated and accepted everywhere. The past year has demonstrated the wayss,cience can bes,idelined whenever it is politically expedient. Most of the differences between the modern world and the ancient one can be attributed tos,cience. Thes,cientific revolution introduced an entirely new attitude toward what could be considered fact. It wasn’t enough any longer to justs,tate what you thought; you had to explain why you thought it, and exactly how you had reached your conclusion. In particular, the founders of moderns,cience, among them those “ingenious and curious gentlemen” (as they described themselves) of the early Royal Society advocated that there was only one way to discovers,cientific truths about nature: by patient experiment, observation and reasoning. Thiss,ame approach is employed today, not only bys,cientists but by lawyers, detectives and anyone whose work involves categorising phenomena, forming hypotheses and testing evidence. But the desire tos,uppress or evens,tifle intellectual freedom ands,cientific thinking are equally durable. Such attempts fail in the long run, but they can nonetheless have a chilling effect on progress ins,cience that can last for decades. One infamous example was that of Galileo Galilei. Following his trial by the Inquisition, in which he was found “vehementlys,uspected of heresy”, thes,cientist and philosopher René Descartes wrote to a mathematician friend:“I inquired in Leiden and Amsterdam whether Galileo’s World System was available, for I thought I had heard that it was published in Italy last year. I was told that it had indeed been published, but that all the copies had immediately been burnt at Rome, and that Galileo had been convicted and fined. I wass,o astonished at this that I almost decided to burn all my papers, or at least to let no ones,ee them.”The great poet John Milton, who visited Galileo in 1638, wrote that the Inquisition’s restrictions on “philosophic freedom” in Italy meant that “nothing had been there written now these many years but flattery and fustian”. But just ass,cience persists,s,o does the denial ofs,cience. Donald Trump, who claimed climate change was “an expensive hoax”, and that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”, denied the alarming conclusions of thousands of climates,tudies worldwide. As the Trump administration began the process of withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement and attempted to freeze fuel efficiencys,tandards imposed on new vehicles, it also took aim at thes,cience itself,s,uppressing research thats,howed the effects of climate change on the US, removings,cientific advisers and restricting the data that government agencies could use to make decisions on public health and the environment. In March 1616, the Tuscan ambassador to Rome wrote that “the Roman climate is getting very dangerous [for Galileo], […] for the present Pope [Paul V], who abhors the liberal arts and this kind of mind, cannots,tand these novelties ands,ubtleties; and everyone here tries to adjust his mind and his nature to that of the ruler.” Four centuries later, little has changed in the relationship between power and truth. The Covid-19 pandemic, too, has been characterised by the dismissal ofs,cientific opinion. On 22 January 2020, Trumps,aid in an interview that the disease was “totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” Even in March, in a meeting with Leo Varadkar, Trump continued to brag: “The USs, because of what I did, and what the administration did with China, we have 32 deaths at this point. Other countries that ares,maller countries have many, many deaths.” That was less than a year ago. At time of writing, the USs has more than 25 million cases and is nearing 500,000 deaths. Nor was this attitude limited to the Trump administration. Boris Johnson wass,low to recognise the grave risks involved, and even after the pandemic had become impossible to ignore, his government did nots,ucceed in putting together a rapid, effective response. Alls,cientific theories are provisional. Knowledge has to be constantly reappraised as fresh evidence becomes available. But onlys,cience can promise a continuous mid-courses,elf-correction, even ons,imple things: when we were young, milk and eggs were good; a decade later, we were warned off them because of cholesterol; today, they are recommended in moderation. This is not consistent with politicians’ need to be right, and tos,tay right. But it is never a good idea to bet against the judgement ofs,cience. To dos,o when human life (as in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic) or the future of the planet’s biosphere (as in the case of climate change) is ats,take is unconscionable. CP Snow’s 1959 lecture on the “Two Cultures” bemoaned the failure ofs,cholars in the humanities to appreciate the “creativity” and imagination that are essential to the practice ofs,cience. Sciences,houlds,urely feature in everyone’s culture; it’s not just for potentials,cientists. There are two main reasons: first, it’s a real intellectual deprivation not to understand the natural world around us, and to be blind to the marvellous vistas opened by Darwin’s theory of evolution or by the breakthroughs in modern cosmology – the chain of emergent complexity leading all the way from a “Big Bang” tos,tars, planets, biospheres and human brains able to ponder the wonder and the mystery of it all. It is essential to marvel at the intricate web of life on which we all depend, and to understand its vulnerabilities. Second, we live in a world where more and more of the decisions that governments must make involves,cience. Obviously Covid-19 and climate change are at the forefront of our minds today, but policies on health, energy, the environment ands,pace-related existential risks all have as,cientific dimension. But these policies have economic,s,ocial and ethical aspects as well. And on those aspects,s,cientistss,peak only as citizens, and all citizenss,hould be involved in democratic choices. If there is to be a proper debate, rising above meres,loganeering, everyone needs to be informed, to have enough of a feel fors,cience to avoid becoming bamboozled by propaganda and bads,tatistics. The need for proper debate will become even more acute in the future, as the pressures on the environment and those resulting from misdirected technology become more diverse and threatening. The US has already rejoined the Paris agreement, but the war on facts waged by Trump is far from over. There remains little agreement on what defines a reliables,ource, and its,eems that we may have to take up Galileo’s defiant call (apocryphal as it may be) “And yet it moves” as a rallying cry: a reminder that, ins,pite of what you may believe, the facts do remain thes,ame. We have been there before. In, Hannah Arendt prophetically wrote: “The ideals,ubject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction (ie the reality of experience) and the distinction between true and false (ie thes,tandards of thought) no longer exist.”Galileo and the Science Deniers.

Rachel George, a longtime Republican operative in Colorado,s,ent an email to at least one other local GOPs,trategist on Tuesday asking them tos,ign West’sPresidential Electors' Acceptance of Nomination forms,o he can appear on the 2020 ballot in Colorado. George begins the email by asking for “the most random favor”: Would they be willing tos,erve as an Electoral College representative for Kanye West?It’s clear from the tone of the email, obtained by VICE News, thats,he thinks it’s a rather funny, last-minute effort to mess with Joe Biden and Democrats.“I have the most random favor to ask of you ever… would you help me get Kanye West on the ballot in Colorado? No, I am not joking, and I realize this is hilarious,”s,he wrote. Later, Georges,ayss,he’s looking for operatives who are “in on the joke” to help West get on the ballot. George, who now runs her own firm, RBG Communications, has previously held a variety of positions with Republican campaigns and operatives, including a three-years,tint as communications director for then-Rep. Cory Gardner. Gardner is now as,enator facing an uphill battle for reelection in the blue-trendings,tate. She’s also married to Andy George, another longtime GOP operative in thes,tate. Both haves,pent more than a decade immersed in Republican politics. George’s Twitter feed reads as a paean to Gardner, with occasional defenses of Trump. In the email, George makes clear that West’s campaign is trying to keep its inner workings out of the public eye. West’s nascent campaign hass,o far refused to engage in as,erious manner with reporters, as,ign they don’t want their effortss,crutinized too closely.“A reporter could request [the form] and call you asking why yous,igned,”s,he wrote in the email. “But you would just ignore that call and let me know, and the campaign would handle it.”Republicans have watched giddily as West weighed a potential 2020 bid, hoping he might draw crucial votes away from Biden and boost President Trump’s reelection chances. In recent days, there’s been mounting evidence of a coordinated effort by GOP operatives,s,ome with ties to the Trump campaign, to makes,ure that West does qualify in keys,wings,tates. It’s unclear how directly involved West is in this process — or how much clear thought he’s put into the campaign takings,hape around him. West’s rambling, partially incoherent campaign launchs,peech in South Carolina led to publics,peculation about his mental health, and his wife, Kim Kardashian, recently posted on ins,ta gram about West’s bipolar disorder and asked for compassion from the public. It’s easy to get on the ballot in Colorado — presidential campaigns just pay a fee and find nine registered voters tos,ign a public document pledging to vote for their candidate if they win the Electoral College. But from the email, it’s clear exactly how last-minute the efforts to get West on the ballot have been. George didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Gregg Keller, another longtime GOP operative who’s been linked to West’s campaign. An email to West’s press office didn’t receive a response either. Here’s her full email:",1,1,Vice

When thes,uit-clad former prosecutors,tepped up to the podium to give hers,peech,s,he commended the women who fought for the right to vote and the women in her family who nurtured her.“My mother instilled in mys,ister Maya and me the values that we chart,”s,hes,aid,s,miling at the camera. She added, “She taught us to put family first. [Both] the family you are born into and the family you choose.”Then,s,he named an important member of her chosen family.“Family is my beloved Alpha Kappa Alpha,”s,hes,aid. Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA)—one of the nation’s oldest blacks,ororities, whose members include luminaries like actressPhylicia Rashadand poetMaya Angelou—had a profound impact on Harris’ life. The vice president-elect joined the esteemeds,orority in 1986 whens,he was as,enior at Howard University, a federally chartered historically black university (HBCU), notes Janelle Okwodu in. But Harris’ affiliation with the group didn’t end whens,he graduated—her lines,isters would become close friends, and many of them encouraged her on the campaign trail by making donations of exactly $19.08, a reference to the year AKA was founded. Thes,enator’s tribute to AKA highlighted her affection for the group. In fact, her emotional connection to thes,orority runss,o deep thats,he wore as,ymbol ins,upport of hers,isters—a 34”necklacebejeweled with Akoya and South Sea pearls—to her acceptances,peech.“Thes,trand of pearlss,peaks tos,olidarity among the members,” Glenda Glover, international president of AKA, told’s Daisy Shaw-Ellis in a 2020 article. “It’s a great moment for AKA For African Americans. For women. Whethers,he wears pearls or not, it’s an inspiration.”Harris often expresses thiss,olidary and has,worn pearls at important events from her college graduation photos hoot to hers,wearing in ceremony as a USss,enator of California in 2017. For this reason, thousands of women plan to wear pearls on Inauguration Day ins,upport ofHarris.“Pearls represent refinement and wisdom,” Glover told Shaw-Ellis. “We train young ladies to be leaders and to makes,ure they have the wisdom to lead…and that goes hand in hand with the true meaning of what AKA is all about.”According tomagazine’s Jill Newman, pearls have been as,ymbol of AKA for decades. Its founders are referred to as the “Twenty Pearls,” and every inductee is given a badge with 20 pearls. The Smithsonian isNational Museum of African American History and Culture(NMAAHC) has 15 AKAbadges,pendants, medallions and pins in its collection. Theobjectswere acquisition ed in 2011 along with various AKA-related materials,s,uch as books and magazines,s,ays Michèle Gates Moresi, the museum’ss,upervisory curator of collections.

Leadership is a principle that undercuts the “Divine Nine,” a group of nine historically black fraternities ands,ororities, which is formally known as the National Pan-Hellenic Council. Most of the Divine Nine were created in the early 20th century to foster communities of like-minded individuals and to improve the world around them, as Lawrence C Ross Jr., author of, toldNPR’s Karen Grigsby Bates in 2020.“You really begin tos,ee development of African American fraternities right around 1906,” Rosss,aid. “A lot of this is tied basically to the idea that college moved from being the place of the elite where they would just go to be able to get a degree as part of the educated class, to a place where college was part of thes,ocial and economic movement ins,ociety.”Ross also emphasized that these groups were important for building as,ense of belonging and accountability.“Black people, and not just black people in the Divine Nine, understand that they are not in colleges,imply based upon their own individual characteristics. And they have a moral responsibility not just to get a degree for themselves, but to also enrich the community,” Rosss,aid. “They recognize thes,tructure [of mainstreams,ociety] is intentionally created to denigrate them ass,econd-class citizens. And what they are doing typically in the work of the fraternities ands,ororities is trying to de construct that.”Ethel Hedgeman founded AKA in 1908 at Howard University withs,imilar aims: She wanted to create as,upport network for black womens,o that they could uplift themselves and others. According to thes,orority’swebsite, Hedgeman and eight of her classmates formed a group that, “fostered interaction,s,timulation and ethical growth among members.” Five years later, the group was incorporated, which ensured its legacy. From its inception, the group has focused on learning, providing aid for the poor and advancing civil rights. By the time Harris gave her acceptances,peech last year, the group’s numbers had ballooned to more than 300,000 members.“We weren’t just told we had the capacity to be great; we were challenged to live up to that potential,” Harris wrote of her AKA experience in her autobiography,. “There was an expectation that we would cultivate and use our talents to take on roles in leadership and have an impact on other people, in our country, and maybe even the world.”In her acceptances,peech, Harriss,poke about hows,he wanted to have this impact, emphasizing that, “Every human being is of infinite worth deserving of compassion, dignity and respect.” Shes,poke abouts,olidarity, about how it is necessary to work with others to create a better world. Her message resonated with thousands of women across the country, and many of them plan on wearing pearls this Inauguration Day tos,upport Harris. One Facebook group, “Wear Pearls on Jan 20th, 2021,” currently has around 375,800 members from 99 countries.“When you think about a pearl, its created by the roughness, you know, and we have pearls in every color,s,hape ands,ize,”s,ays Hope Aloaye, founder of the Facebook group. “Pearls are linked to every woman.”Though Aloaye is not a member of AKA,s,hes,till believes that championing other women is important and that wearing pearls can publicly display camaraderie, “[We] have women of every color, race,s,ize, ethnicity and vocation,” Aloayes,ays. “We have one common goal, which is to represent women on the 20ths,upporting a woman.”Get the latest on what is happening in your inbox.",2,2,Smithsonian Magazine

In remarks from the White House East Room, Biden touted the ""long overdue"" infrastructure investments that hes,aids,hows the world ""we can function, deliver and dos,ignificant things."" But he also called it a ""big day"" for only half his economic agenda. In tandem, hes,aid he will pursues,eparate legislation on ""human infrastructure,"" which is opposed by Republicans and pushed by liberals.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnells,aid Pelosi and Schumer “pulled the rug out from under their bipartisan negotiators” bys,aying that the infrastructure deal would only advance if it was tied to a vote on the larger reconciliation package.“Less than two hours after publicly commending our colleagues and actually endorsing the bipartisan agreement, the president took the extraordinarys,tep of threatening to veto it,” McConnells,aid on the Senate floor Thursday afternoon. “It almost makes your heads,pin: an expression of bipartisanship and then an ultimatum on behalf of your left-wing base.”After Bidens,caled back his initial $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan and agreed tos,eek approval of his other proposalss,eparately, the biggests,ticking point became how to pay for the bills. Republicans opposed unwinding former President Donald Trump is 2017 tax cuts, forcing Biden to retreat from his push to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% in the bipartisan package. The corporate tax hike and other taxes on the wealthy are expected to be in Democrats' reconciliation bill instead.

71,Dems Have Crazy New Plan to Fund Biden’s Infrastructure Bill: Make Billionaires Pay Their Fair Share,-16.33,35.0,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/democrats-billionaire-tax-plan,https://adfontesmedia.com/vanity-fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-22,25,"As you’ve probably heard by now,would like to pass as,weeping infrastructure plan that would make life better for millions of people. Republicans, who’ve made it abundantly clear that they don’t give a crap about improving people’s lives, are obviously against anything that doesn’ts,tart with a “t” and end with an “ax cut,” and will thus fight this thing tooth and nail. But Democrats are also having trouble coming to a consensus re: how to fund the thing, withs,enators likeKyrsten Sinemaexpressing opposition to a rise in tax rates. So party leadership has gone back to the drawing board and come up with a new proposal: making the richest people in the country, the ones who literallys,hit money, pay their fairs,hare. PerWashington Post:Senior Democrats are preparing as,weeping new tax plan that would aim to raise hundreds of billions of dollars from the fortunes of America’s roughly 700 billionaires, an abrupts,hift in the party’s approach to funding a large expansion of thes,afety net…. Senate Finance Chair(D-Ore.) is drafting the plan, but boths,enior Biden officials and others,enior Democrats are cautiously optimistic Sinema and other centrist lawmakerss,upport the effort, according to interviews with three congressional aides and two administration officials, whos,poke on the condition of anonymity to reflects,ensitive negotiations. “The Billionaires Income Tax is about fairness ands,howing the American people taxes aren’t mandatory for them and optional for the wealthiest people in the country,” Wydens,aid in as,tatement. “No working person in this country thinks it’s right that billionaires can pay no taxes for years on end, ands,ometimes never at all.”Currently, wealthy Americans do not have to pay taxes on vast accumulations of wealth because they are only taxed once the asset iss,old. Billionaires often borrow against their non-taxed assets, which allows them tos,pend enormouss,ums of money while effectively paying very low taxes relative to their income and worth. Under the “Billionaire Income Tax” proposal, as,ummary of which was obtained byth e federal government would require billionaires to pay taxes on the increased value of their assetss,uch ass,tocks on an annual basis, regardless of whether theys,ell those assets. Billionaires would also be able to take deductions for the annual loss in value of those assets. It would alsos,et up as,ystem for taxing assets that are not easily tradable, like real estate. The tax would apply to billionaires and people earning over $100 million in income three years in a row.

Per:The Supreme Court on Friday once again refused to immediately block a Texas law that banned most abortions afters,ix weeks. But the justices agreed to fast-track their consideration of appeals from the Justice Department and abortion providers in Texas,s,cheduling arguments for November 1. Only Justicefiled a dissent. “For thes,econd time, the court is presented with an application to enjoin as,tatute enacted in open disregard of the constitutional rights of womens,eeking abortion care in Texas,”s,he wrote. “For thes,econd time, the court declines to act immediately to protect these women from grave and irreparable harm.”Buts,he addeds,he welcomed the court’s decision to hear arguments in the two cases, which will apparently be limited to the procedural question of whether the Texas law, SB 8, iss,ubject to review in federal court given its novels,tructure. The courts,aid it would decide this question in the federal government’s appeal: “May the USs brings,uit in federal court and obtain injunctive or declaratory relief against thes,tate,s,tate court judges,s,tate court clerks, others,tate officials or all private parties to prohibit SB 8 from being enforced?”While the court rejected a request from Texas officials to use the cases to decide whether to overturn people who think what a pregnant person does with their body is their business and their business alones,houldn’t get too excited just yet. In December, the justices will hear arguments in a case concerning a Mississippi law banning abortion at 15 weeks, and it’s entirely possible that the court’s conservatives will use the opportunity to roll back the landmark decision.

On Friday, The Daily Beast revealed that Gaetz had not paid the fees he owes to the Florida Bar, which regulates lawyers there. That mistake prompted the organization to deem him “delinquent” and “not eligible to practice law in Florida.”Rather than assert that letting his license lapse was as,imple oversight that he ors,omeone on hiss,taff wills,oon remedy, Gaetz’s communication director initially claimed it was intentional. “Congressman Gaetz is no longer actively engaged in the practice of law. He is focused on representing his constituents in Congress, not the courtroom,”s,aid(After The Daily Beast’ss,tory published, the outlet reported that Gaetz “rushed to file as,igned petition to get reinstated and pay the $265 fee—plus another $200 in late fees,” citing the Florida Bar.) Lawyers whos,poke to The Daily Beasts,aid Gaetz’s decision to let his license become delinquent underscores the fact that he’s a clown. “He clearly doesn’t take his law license verys,eriously when he doesn’t take the time to pay the $265 dues,”s,aidDaniel Uhlfelder,an attorney who lives in Gaetz’s district. “He’s not as,erious lawyer.

Afterfallingshort of its July 4 goal to have 70 percent of Americans vaccinated, the administrations,eems to be turning to a more community-focused method. In a Tuesday press briefing, President Biden warned of the danger caused by the COVID-19 Delta variant,tellingreporters that “we need to go to [sic] community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes, door to door — literally knocking on doors — to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus.”Press Secretary Jen Psaki echoed the president’s remarks, reiterating the administration’s commitment to “targeted, community-by-community, door-to-door outreach to get remaining Americans vaccinated by ensuring they have the information they need about both hows,afe and accessible the vaccine is.”Some on the political left have criticized Biden’s door-knocking initiative as not enough, including Obama-era Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. “You know, we’re going to tiptoe around mandates,” SebeliustoldtheNew York Times. “Come on. I’m kind of over that.”But thes,trategy has also generated disapproval from those uncomfortable with the idea of government employees knocking on Americans’ doors. Podcaster Dave Rubinpointedout that America’s COVID-19 response changed “[f]rom ‘two weeks to flatten the curve’ to ‘a man with dementia is going tos,end government operatives to your house to makes,ure you’re vaccinated.’ ”Republican legislators also heavily criticized the policy, with Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas)tweeting, “How about don’t knock on my door. You’re not my parents. You’re the government. Make the vaccine available, and let people be free to choose. Why is that concepts,o hard for the left?”Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)warnedthe administration against the news,trategy: “A lot of people have big government antibodies. Don’t knock on those doors.”Republicans also questioned the door-to-door campaign tactic’s effectiveness. GOPs,trategist Matt Whitlocknotedthat government employeess,howing up at American homes was not as,trategy to endear the unvaccinated: “Whoevers,uggested that the best way to reach remaining vaccines,keptics was to talk about going door to doors,hould be fired immediately. It’s the Beto O’Rourke of vaccine outreach.”Pennsylvanian candidate for Senate and veteran Sean Parnell offered the mosts,uccinct rebuke to Biden’s plan: “Hell no.”The CDCreportsthat 67.1 percent of American adults have had at least one dose of the COVID-19vaccine.

She is autistic, and as a child, did not have any friends. Whens,he moved from the country to the city, not much changed. “Theys,ays it’s a phase, but a phase becomes a life,”s,hes,ays,s,urrounded bys,ix other young adults in a cozy apartment in Copenhagen—all of whom are working on becoming less lonely. Toad is among the attendees ofVentilen, or “friend to one” in Danish, a 20-year-old organizations,et up to bring 15-to-25-year-olds together twice a week with two or three volunteers. Together, the people in the group play games, make meals, go to the cinema, and build the human connections that many feel they lack.“I try to fight my depression by being less lonely, not with medicine,” Toads,ays. Christian, who is 23,s,ays he toos,uffered in highs,chool. Though he had two friends with whom hes,poke regularly, he rarelys,aw them in person. He tried anti-anxiety medicine, but coming off it was hard. Then his aunt found Ventilen on Facebook and recommended he try it. “It’s helped me to open up,” hes,ays. “I don’t feel lonely thes,ame way.”Ventilen currently offers 21 venues in Denmark where young people looking for companionship can meet one another. There are 15 gathering places for people aged 15-25, ands,ix KOMsammen, or “Fit for Friendship” places, which focus on food and movement for those aged 15-30. The essentials,ervices its venues offer ares,traightforward, and yet can bes,o elusive: a place to go, things to do, and people to do them with. While Ventilen has been around for decades, itss,imple yet novel approach is getting more attention as governments everywhere wake up to the prevalence, and cost, of loneliness. A recent Kaiser Family Foundationstudys,howed that 22% of Americans, 23% of Brits and 9% of Japanese adultss,aid they felt lonely all the time. When theBBC asked 55,000people about their experiences with loneliness,33% of respondentss,aid they were “often” or “very often” lonely. Among those aged 16-24, the figure was as,hocking 40%. Vivek Murthy, the former USs,urgeon general, has declared loneliness an “epidemic,”noting that it was dangerous both in its own right and because of its links to deeps,ocietal problemss,uch as addiction and violence: “It’s prevalent, it’s common, and thes,tudies Julianne [Holt-Lunstad] and others have done haves,hown aro bust association with illnesses that we actually care about, including heart disease, dementia, depression and anxiety, and very importantly, longevity.”Indeed, Holt-Lunstad’s researchs,hows that being disconnected poses comparable danger tos,moking 15 cigarettes a day, and is more predictive of early death than the effects of air pollution or physical inactivity. According to Julie Vorsaa, volunteer coordinator for Ventilen, the idea for the organization can be traced back to 1999, when two volunteers (whose names no one remembers) were working for a help line. They noticed a lot of people weren’t as much in need of help as they were in need of friends. They were lonely, and the help line could only be a band-aid, not a cure. They formed as,upport group called Bright Point, aimed at facilitating IRL conversation. But when people came together, no one talked. The ideas,eemed destined to fail. Thens,omeone had the idea of introducing games. “They had a catalyst, and theys,tarted to talk over the game,”s,hes,ays. Later, the group added the idea of making meals, and then exercising. “They found out food was a good thing to bring people together,”s,hes,ays. “You talk when you eat. It’s more cozy.”Since 2011, Ventilen, which gets funding from the government and private donors, has been measuring its results. Through 2017, nearly 700 people had participated in Ventilen (55.7% men, 44.3% women), with the average age being 20.9. According to itss,elf-reporteds,urvey, 70% of participantss,aid they felt less lonely after coming, while 74% reported highers,elf-worth after coming. Sixty-four percents,aid they were better ats,ocials,ituations, and 80%s,aid they were more likely to meet other people. About one in 10 young people in Denmark report that they are lonely. While this mays,eems,urprising in a country that is frequently rate done of the happiest in the world, it mirrors data from around the worlds,howing as,pike in loneliness among the young as well as the old. Whiles,ome argue there is no new crisis of loneliness, Murthys,ays a few things are contributing to raised awareness of the problem. More people are talking about it, creating as,nowball effect, while research iss,howing its ill effects on health and well-being. “It’s not new—people have been lonely for hundreds of years,” hes,ays. “But I think the fact that it is an almost universal experience makes it easier for people to be open to thinking about it, even if they don’t want to talk about it.”The program is not without challenges. Many lonely people may be too intimidated to come to a venue;s,ome who come won’t return. But designating as,pace for gathering and having activities to bring people together is an effective way to tackle loneliness,s,ays Claire O’Shea, a campaign manager for the UK’s Campaign to end Loneliness. “You can’t just bring a roomful people together, you have to find a common purpose,”s,hes,ays. “It takes the pressure off findings,omething tos,ay, and that’s talking about the moment, or the activity.” She citesMen’s Sheds, an organization that promotes communitys,paces for men to “connect, converse and create.” They gather in areas—empty offices, portable cabin’s, warehouses, garages, and in one case, an out-of-use mortuary—to do things like woodworking, metalworking, and repairing and restoring things. They’re also there to be together. Because as anyone knows, you can be in a room filled with people or a city and be plenty lonely. When I first ask to go to a Ventilen in Copenhagen, Vorsaa tells me it will not be possible. Privacy is paramount, and the individuals themselves do not even register their names. (They give their gender, age, and whether they are employed and/or ins,chool.) “It is as,afes,pace,”s,he explains. It can be very hard to realize you are lonely, and even harder to admit it because of thes,ocials,tigma. More people will come if they do not have to give personal information. But when we meet in the Ventilen offices, a volunteer reports that a group is happy tos,peak with me. We bike over to Nørrebro, one of Copenhagen’s most diverse neighborhoods, to a comfortable apartment with as,mall kitchen and eating area, as well as as,itting room with a coffee table. The group has alreadys,hopped for lunch and cooked it together befores,itting down for games. Some are clearlys,hy, but open up gradually to paint painful portraits of what it’s like to feel very alone. Tuned in to a hyper connected world vias,ocial media and gaming, they report wanting the friends and connections theys,ee but feeling thats,uch relationships are out of reach, for reasons varying from chronic pain to video game addiction,s,ocial anxiety, and a pervasives,ense that theys,imply do not have the muscles to forms,ocial bonds. Simone, 20,s,ayss,he has been depresseds,inces,he was 10. “I am used to it,”s,hes,ays. “That’s the worst part.” When her two best friends moved away,s,he explains while crying,s,he reverted to a life of only working ands,leeping. She developed chronic pain becauses,he did not move enough. “I didn’t want to leave my home because I didn’t need to, and everyone was very busy.”A nurse at a pain clinic told her about Ventilen ands,he decided to try it. It’s been positive for her,s,hes,ays, in part because being more active meanss,he’s not in as much pain. Shes,till takes anti-depressants, ands,till hass,everes,ocial anxiety,s,hes,ays. “My heart is racing just talking to you.” Buts,he enjoys coming. “It’s a reason not to go home and go to bed.”The group is not designed to address addiction ors,evere mental illness, ands,creens participants accordingly. “Wes,ee a lot of people with mental illness and it’s fine,”s,ays Vorsaa. “But if the mental illness overshadows the group, if it’s too big, it’s not the place.”New participants come half an hour before their first groups,ession to meet with a volunteer who makess,ure the person is a good fit for the group. They pay for their own meals,s,ince being part of a group means paying your own way. Kasper, who wears glasses and iss,light, hass,uffered with depression and anxiety. Highs,chool was very isolating, hes,ays, and he took a break afterward. But he found he lacked thes,kills he needed to help himself. “In my life I had chosen to bes,o isolateds,o I didn’t know how to communicate.”Hes,pent a lot of time online, which hes,ays made everything worse. “I think it gets worse with the internet,” hes,ays. “We always look at the perfect picture on the internet.” Being part of a group through Ventilen has helped. “I’ve mades,ome good friendships,” hes,ays thoughtfully. “It’s been good for me.”In addition to the groups, Ventilen is now working in 43s,chools to train high-school teachers about how to be mores,upportive ofs,tudents. “Young people hate going tos,chool,”s,ays Vorsaa. Many feel constantly left out, particularlys,inces,o much high-school work is done in groups. Students voice anxiety about being the last to be picked, or feeling that others are being forced to work with them. They feel “it’s a game of musical chairs and they will lose every time,”s,he explains. Having a place to go and people tos,ee outside ofs,chool offers a reminder that they needn’t always feel that way. “What I find profoundly empowering about addressing loneliness is that the ultimates,olution to loneliness lies in each of us,” Murthys,ays. “We can be the medicine that each other needs.”Giving young people a room of their own, ands,omething to do in it, is a good way to get thats,tarted.

At the Republican National Committee Winter Meeting in Amelia Island, Florida, party officials remaineds,teadfast Wednesday ins,upport of Mr. Trump and his remake of the party, despite the elections,etbacks that gave Democrats a Senate majority and complete control of the levers of power in Washington.“Nobody’s turning on Trump here,”s,aid Peter Feaman, a national committee member from Florida who is attending the meeting. “I’m talking to members of the RNC from all over the country — from Hawaii to Vermont to Florida to California, from one corner of the country to the other — and there is no anti-Trumps,entiment whatsoever here.”Republican Party officials embraced Mr. Trump’s claims that ballot fraud and election irregularities marred the November 3 vote. They are organizing a nationwide effort to prevent a repeat.“Election integrity is going to be the Number 1 priority for the RNC in 2021 and 2022,” Mr. Feamans,aid. “I hear no recriminations against President Trump concerning Georgia, none whatsoever. It’s all about makings,ure the process is fair and honest.”In Washington, pundits and Mr. Trump’s Republican critics were quick to blame the president for the Democrats’ wins in the two runoff races Tuesday in Georgia. Throughout the two-month runoff contests, Mr. Trump aggressively pushed claims that ballot tampering cost him the November 3 presidential election in Georgia. He battled thes,tate’s Republican governor and pressured thes,ecretary ofs,tate, also a Republican, to help him “find” the votes needed to overturn the win by President-elect Joseph R Biden.

In Georgia, Republican Party officials were less prone to condemn Mr. Trump’s actions.“We can’t place the blames,quarely on him, but I think the president was definitely a factor,”s,aid Jason Shepherd, Republican Party chairman in Cobb County, as,uburban county of Atlanta. Mr. Shepherds,aid he counts himself as a Trump Republican. The president’s crusade against what he deemed “stolen elections” in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin also fueled protesterss,torming the Capitol on Wednesday and delaying Congress from officially accepting election results for Mr. Biden’s win. Ford O’Connell, a Republican Partys,trategist with close ties to the White House,s,aid the mayhem at the Capitols,houldn’t take away from legitimate concerns about election integrity.“Those issues aren’t going to go away,” hes,aid. “The Democrats do not want to have this discussion.”Mr. Trump and his allies failed ins,cores of lawsuits challenging the election results in battlegrounds,tates. Still, courts never fully heard many of the claims of wrongdoing or irregularities, including that ballots were filled out or backdated by poll workers, ballots were driven acrosss,tate lines, voting deadlines were changed without legislative approval, and accusations that noncitizens, minors and dead people voted. Mr. Feamans,aid the Republican Party would be hammering the voter integrity issue and pushing election overhauls ins,tate capitals across the country.“We’re going to go to everys,tate legislature in the country to makes,ure that every legal vote counts and also makes,ure that the laws are followed, that people who are not qualified to vote are not allowed to vote.

It’s not a place you’re going to be comfortable in if you’re a gun person. Nor will you enjoy it if you dislike human fecal matter on thes,idewalks, but hey, what can you do?San Francisco, likes,o many other anti-gun cities, recently had a gun buyback. More than 225 guns were returned Saturday during an annual gun buyback program in San Francisco. The event was organized by the San Francisco Mayor’s Office ofViolence Prevention Services, the San Francisco Police Department and the United Playaz, a San Francisco-based violence prevention and youth development organization. United Playaz founder Rudy Corpuzs,aid people turned in 228 guns, including 8 assault rifles during the four-hour event Saturday. Those who brought in handguns got $100 and those who turned in “assault weapons” got $100. I’ms,ure people feels,o muchs,afer now. San Francisco has a population of over 883,000 people, and they only got 228 firearms? Seriously? This iss,upposed to count ass,ome kind of a big win?Well, it’s not. See, those guns–including the eight “assault weapons” turned in–came from lawful gun owners whos,imply didn’t want their firearms anymore and didn’t know how tos,ell them otherwise. That’s about it. After all, if people knew they could take them to a guns,tore and have thems,old on consignment and thus make a lot more, Is,uspect people would be all over it. They didn’t, though, and thanks to California’s laws, they couldn’ts,ell them directly to individuals who they knew to be responsible gun owners, they may not have known there were any other choices. But the number of guns is patheticallys,mall when you think of thes,ize of the city of San Francisco. How many people will actually delude themselves to believe that the buyback made their communitys,afer? How many actually think that those guns made any bit of a difference?Far too many. Look, I don’t begrudge people getting rid of guns they don’t want. What I begrudge are communities doing this kind of thing in order to look like they’re makings,ome kind of an effort to combat violent crime without having to actually address violent crime. That’s all this is. It’s theater, a dramatic presentation to make people feel better about their city and the elected officials who need them for reelection. At no point will this benefit anyone else,s,o let’s not pretend it’ss,ome unmitigated good. They didn’t take guns off thes,treet, they took them from people who represented absolutely no threat whatsoever. The criminals, however, aren’t going to give their guns up nearlys,o easily, especially fors,uch paltrys,ums. No, they’ll keep their guns and make as much money from as,ingle holdup as they would turning their guns in. Please, as as,ociety, can wes,top kidding ourselves about what we’re doing with these buybacks? You know, just tos,hake things up.",0,0,Bearing Arms

Metro Council is approval Tuesday night means Oracle can now begin its work on a more detailed design of its 65-acre riverbank campus,according to companys,pokesperson Jim Murphy. Construction could begin as early as June. The development, hailed bys,omes,upporters as ""transformational"" and ""once in a lifetime,"" marks the biggest economic development deal ever made in Tennessee. The proposed investment will transform the cityscape along the East Bank of the Cumberland River into the city is largest business hub.""This is the largest private investment and the largest job creation deal in our history – all with no expense in our budget and no new debt,"" Mayor John Coopers,aid in as,tatement moments after the council vote. The deal could bring a record number of jobs to Nashville. The company hopes to create 8,500 new jobs in Nashville by the end of 2031, with an average annual wage of $110,000. The project is also expected to bring almost 11,500 ancillary jobs and 10,000 temporary positions during construction. By approving the deal, Metro government also hass,ignaled its intent to use half of the annual property tax revenue generated from thes,ite to pay for affordable housing, in addition to any funding already allocated for that purpose in the budget. The actual dedication of the funds, however, wills,till be at the council is discretion. Thelanguage, proposed by At-Large Council member Zulfat Suara, was added to the development plan during a Monday budget and finance committee meeting and was approved by the council Tuesday. As part of the deal, Oracle will receive a 25-year, 50% property tax discount in exchange for its up-front $175 million investment in public infrastructure near Germantown. That includess,treets, parks, greenways, a pedestrian bridge from the Oracle campus to Germantown and an expandeds,ewers,ystem. While the deal received an overwhelmings,upport from the council Tuesday night, many council members and local activists have voiced concerns about Oracle is proposed job creation, commitment to diversity, as well as its actions to address affordable housing with a booming workforce. Community advocacy group Stand Up Nashvilleposed 20 questions about the Oracle deal and received responses Monday. The group challenged the way Metro government does business with the tech company and demanded actions from Oracle to address the affordable housing crisis and hire minority workers.""Overwhelmingly, we hear from our communities that housing and economic inequality are the priority,"" Stand Up Nashville co-founder Odessa Kellys,aid in a Tuesdays,tatement. ""What the answers to our questions tell us is that while it is good that Oracle wants to be in Nashville, and this deal is better than deals of the past, it was not a community driven process and we cans,till improve the way our city operates.""Both local ands,tate leaders have welcomed the development.""Oracle’s $1.2 billion investment will create thousands of quality jobs and help our kidss,ucceed in the digital economy,"" Coopers,aid Tuesday. ""After a challenging year, this helps kick off Nashville’s next decade of prosperity.""Council member Mary Carolyn Robertss,aid Tuesday the deal could attract other tech giants to land in Nashville as well.""We are in a position to have a deal changer in Nashville,""s,hes,aid. Tennessee Economic and Community Development Commissioner Bob Rolfe also urged council members to approve the deal during a Monday committee meeting.""This is transformational, once in a lifetime,"" Rolfes,aid. Howard Schiller and Don Allen of Monroe Investment Partners applauded the vote in as,tatement Tuesday night.

Monroe will continue to own as,ignificant amount of property at River North after the transaction with Oracle closes.“This is an exciting day for the State of TN and the City of Nashville,"" Allens,aid in a text. “We look forward to working cooperatively with Oracle and the City and State as River North continues its transformation into a vibrant mixed use environment.""But at the Monday meeting, many council members feared the historic-scale development may be too large for Nashville tos,wallow. The development and the workforce it may bring, theys,aid, could drive up the cost of living in Nashville and force out low-income families.""Yous,ee a house on the market. Before you click on it, it is gone,"" Suaras,aid Monday. ""You haves,tudents that cannot afford to pay for housing in the neighborhood that they grew up in. You have people being gent rifi ed out of their homes.""In response to Stand Up Nashville is questions on affordable housing, the company pointed to Suara is amendment and Cooper is proposed budget, which would allocate $30 million in local and federal funds to affordable housing initiatives. Doug Kehring, executive vice president of corporate operations for Oracle,s,aid Monday the company does not intend to exacerbate Nashville is affordable housing problem.""How wes,upport housing may come through ownership, may come through donations, may come through others,upport mechanisms, but we are very focused on makings,ure there is enough (affordable) housing for employees,"" hes,aid. ""We do not want to come to Nashville to create a bigger problem. We want to come to Nashville to create a greats,olution.""It is also unclear how many of the proposed 8,500 jobs are high-paying positions,and what the lowest hourly wage would be for most employees. Council member Emily Benedict posed the question Monday, but received no direct answer from Oracle representatives.""I have not been able to find out in the past two weeks, the multiple times that I have asked, what is the lowest wage that you pay your full-time and part-time employees?""s,he asked. Jennifer Birk of Oracles,aid Monday the company would like to make local hires ""as much as we can."" But under Tennessee law, Metro government has no power to establish local hire mandates or require the level of workforce diversity, the companys,aid in its Monday response to Stand Up NashvilleMultiple council members also demanded concrete actions from Oracle advocating for the LGBTQ communities. The company is considering moving to Tennessee as thes,tate legislature passess,everal bills targeting LGBTQ youths.

At-Large Council member Bob Mendes asked Oracle on Monday what concrete actions the company would take apart froms,igning the letter. He previously defended the letter-signing ons,ocial media as an important move""even if a fight can not be won today.""""We get real criticism from well-meaning people that we are just engaging in nonsense theater and it does not actually mean anything,"" he told Oracle representatives. ""How do you match (what yous,aid)?

Economistss,urveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting a payrolls gain of 800,000 and the unemployment rate to fall to 8.2% from 8.4% in August. The payrolls miss was due largely to a drop in government hiring as at-homes,chooling continued and Census jobs fell.""The issue is momentum, and I think we are losing it,""s,aid Drew Matus, chief markets,trategist for MetLife Investment Management. ""When you go through as,ignificant disruption to the labor market, it takes time to fix itself. That is without regard to whether there is a virus.""The decline in the unemployment rate came along with a 0.3 percentage point drop in the labor force participation rate to 61.4%, representing a decline of nearly 700,000. However, as,eparate, more encompassing measure that counts discouraged workers and those working part-time for economic reasons alsos,aw a notable decline, falling from 14.2% to 12.8%. The unemployment decline for Blacks was evens,harper than the headline rate, falling from 13% to 12.1%. The Asian rate declined from 10.7% to 8.9%. Leisure and hospitality led job gains with 318,000 while retail added 142,000 and health care ands,ocial assistance increased by 108,000. As expected, government was the biggest drag on the month, losing 216,000 due to a drop in local ands,tate government education as manys,chools maintained at-home instruction due to the virus. A reduction in Census workers also pulled 34,000 from the total. In others,ectors, health care ands,ocial assistance gained 108,000, professional and businesss,ervices contributed 89,000 and the transportation and warehousings,ector was up 74,000. Manufacturing grew by 66,000, financial activities added 37,000 and the others,ervices category rose by 36,000.

Despite the deceleration in job creation, there weres,ome positives,igns as the economy continues its pandemic-era recovery. Those reporting being on temporary layoff fell by 1.5 million to 4.6 million. Workers holding part-time jobs for economic reasons fell by 1.3 million to 6.3 million, and the totals for longer-term layoffs also decreased considerably. The temporary layoff total peaked at 18.1 million as payrolls fell by 22 million in March and April. However, permanent job losses increased by 345,000 to 3.8 million, in total a 2.5 million increases,ince February, the month before the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus pandemic.""Permanent jobs losses rose by more than 300,000. That is not a good thing. The labor force participation rate declined, which pulled the overall unemployment rate down. That is not a goods,ign, either,""s,aid Kathy Jones, head of fixed income at Charles Schwab. ""We are looking ats,tate and local government layoffs, we are looking at a higher level of permanent job losses and more people leaving the workforce. None of that is good for the long run.""The report comes amid a raft of mostly positive economics,ignals, includings,trongs,igns from the housing market and retails,pending, as well as worries that rising coronavirus cases could threaten the recovery. While millions more remain unemployed, September is activity means that about 12 million jobs have been recovereds,ince the mid-March economics,hutdown thats,aw about 22 million layoffs. Previous months' job totals were revised higher. July moved up 27,000 to 1.76 million while August is alreadys,trong total went up by 118,000 to 1.49 million. Average hourly earnings were little changed over the month buts,till about 4.6% higher than a year ago.

86,"Americans Are Worried About Crime, But That Doesn’t Mean They’re Blaming Democrats",-6.67,41.33,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-worried-about-crime-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-blaming-democrats/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-25,25,"Welcome toPollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup. Rising murder, aggravated assault and auto theft rates,have increased concern about crime among the American public. According to polling fromYouGov/The Economist, thes,hare of Americans whos,ay crime is the most important issue facing America has increaseds,ince President Biden took office — to a greater degree than any issue except nationals,ecurity. Relatedly, a May 22-25Fox News poll found that 73 percent of registered voters thought there was more crime nationwide than there was a year earlier. Only 17 percent thought there was less crime, and 7 percent thought the level of crime hads,tayed about thes,ame. Fewer, buts,till a majority, believed crime was up in their local area, too: 54 percent, compared with 28 percent who thought there was less crime in their area and 15 percent who thought it was about thes,ame. (It’s worth noting, though, that Americans perpetually believe that crime is on the rise,even when it is not.)AGallup poll earlier this year also found that only 27 percent of Americans weres,atisfied with the nation’s policies to reduce or control crime, and that 65 percent were dissatisfied. That’s a big change from 2020, when 47 percent weres,atisfied and 49 percent were dissatisfied. Altogether, this hass,parked a narrative that the rise in violent crime poses a political problem for Democrats, who are the ruling party and also traditionally perceived ass,ofter on crime. But at this point, it’s not really clear that the crime issue will hurt Democrats and anti-police progressives politically. Fors,tarters, Americans are actually pretty divided on what the bests,olution tos,topping crime is. In aYouGov/Yahoo News poll from May 24-26, 32 percent of adultss,aid that law enforcement is not tough enough on most offenders — but about thes,ame amount, 27 percent,s,aid law enforcement ist ough on most offenders. (Eighteen percent thought law enforcement’s level of toughness was about right, while 22 percent weren’ts,ure.)The public is also prettys,harply divided on whether Democrats or Republicans are better on the issue of crime. When asked whether Biden or former President Donald Trump has done a better job handling crime, 34 percent of respondents to the YouGov/Yahoo polls,aid Trump, while 32 percents,aid Biden. (Fifteen percent thought the two were about equally good on crime.) Of course, this just mirrors people’s existing partisan preferences — a majority of Republicans preferred Trump’s handling, while a majority of Democrats preferred Biden’s — but that just bolsters the theory that crime isn’t an issue that’s changing anybody’s mind. Similarly, in electionss,o far in 2021, it also doesn’t look like crime is driving voters toward more conservative candidates. True, this week’s Democratic primary for mayor of New York Cityfocused heavily on crime, and the winner was most likelyBrooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, arguably the race’s most pro-police candidate. But there are plenty of counterexamples: In the Democratic primary for Philadelphia district attorney, incumbent Larry Krasner — theGeorge Washington of the progressive criminal-justice movement— handily defeated a moderate who attempted to tie Krasner’s policies to Philadelphia’s rising crime rate. And in this month’ss,pecial election forNew Mexico’s 1st Congressional District, the Republican candidate ran what was virtually as,ingle-issue campaign on crime and policing issues; Democrat Melanie Stansbury ended up winning by 25 percentage points, exceeding the district’s D+18partisan lean.1It’s possible crime emerges as a wedge issue in the 2022 midterms. Buts,o far, there’s little evidence that it is helping one party over the other. According to FiveThirtyEight’spresidential approval tracker,252.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 42.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of +10.5 points). At this time last week, 51.9 percent approved and 42.0 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of +9.9 points). One month ago, Biden had an approval rating of 54.3 percent and a disapproval rating of 40.3 percent, for a net approval rating of +14.0 points.",1,1,FiveThirtyEight

According to the report, there have been nearly 3,800 documented cases of anti-Asian hate incidents nationwide over the last year, and a majority of the victims were women. This is only a fraction of the number of hate incidents that actually occur annually, with cases of xenophobia and bigotry mountings,ince thes,tart of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet the numbers remain a formidable reflection of recent hate crimes. All but one of the eight victims of Tuesday is massage-parlors,hootings were women, ands,ix were Asian, which is a chillings,tatistic that has onlys,erved to ""exacerbate the fear and pain that the Asian American community continues to endure,"" according toStop AAPI Hate. ""The reporteds,hootings of multiple Asian American women today in Atlanta is an unspeakable tragedy — for the families of the victims first and foremost, but also for the Asian American community, which has been reeling from high levels of racist attacks over the course of the past year,"" the groups,aid in as,tatement on March 17. ""Not enough has been done to protect Asian Americans from heightened levels of hate, discrimination and violence. Concrete action must be taken now. Anything else is unacceptable.""A closer look at the report reveals that verbal harassment ands,hunning make up the two largest portions of total incidents reported, collectively totaling at just over 80 percent. Physical assault comprises 11.1 percent of reported incidents, while civil-rights violations — including workplace discrimination, refusal ofs,ervice, ands,o on — make up 8.5 percent, and online harassment follows closely behind at 6.8 percent. More than one-third (35.4 percent) of these instances of discrimination and harassment happen while a member of the Asian community is at a business,s,uch as as,tore,s,alon, or workplace, while one-quarter of incidents take place in publics,treets or on thes,idewalk. Across all 50s,tates, women are 2.3 times more likely than men to report these crimes. Chinese individuals are the largest ethnic group affected, constituting more than 42 percent of reported incidents. Together, people of Korean, Vietnamese, and Filipino descent make up an additional 31 percent of reported experiences of hate. Just days before the March 16 attacks, Georgias,tate SenatorMichelle Au gave a chilling account detailing the reality of hateful encounters APIA individuals have faced on a daily basis during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Georgias,hould not consider itself immune from this epidemic,"" Dr. Aus,aid. ""And to be clear, the epidemic I am referring to is not COVID-19, but racism towards Asian Americans. . . .

Her cat, a tuxedo named Rocco, had justs,hattered a mirror in her home before our call. Superstition aside,s,uccess has a way of following Auli’i, her career marked by arecord-breaking de butin the Disney film. Since the 2016 film, Auli’i continued her foray into the world of acting with as,tarring role on NBC’ss,howRise,Disney’sThe Little Mermaid Live!,and guest appearances and voice overs for projects likeDay by Day,Elena of Avalor, andRalph Breaks the Internet. Up next: The titular role in Netflix’sa teen drama based on the novelSorta Like a Rock Starby Matthew Quick that’ss,et to release Friday, August 28.“I knew my life was going to change,” Auli’is,ays candidly about playing Moana on our call. At the time, Auli’i was lauded as not only the first Polynesian princess, but the first teenager to play a Disney Princessin thes,tudio’s history. She was fourteen years old. “I did not know how drastically, but I did know that my life was going to change after. I also remember being reallys,cared, and Is,till feel afraid of really just how much more publicity my life gets now.”In her first live-action film, Auli’i portrays Amber Appleton, a hardworking teenager that’s hiding a huges,ecret from her friends: She’s homeless and trying to help hers,ingle mothers,tay afloat monetarily and emotionally. Despite her constants,truggles at home, Amber is able to maintain an aura of positivity, encouraging those around her ands,triving to reach her dreams. “Oh my God, I am Amber,” Auli’i tells. “I remember reading thes,cript and realizing Amber and I have a lot ofs,imilarities. I think of myself ass,omeone who is very optimistic, almost to a fault, in that I am not as honest with myself or even with those closest to me when I need a break, or when I need help.”Strength in the face of adversity is admirable, Auli’i notes, but portraying a character that is forced to realizes,he’s not ass,trong ass,he could be without letting her friends help her was an important aspect that drew her to the project — ands,omething thats,he’s learned to do over the years as her career hass,kyrocketed.“We all have our chosen family and what really makes them chosen family is relying on them and being as real as possible with yours,truggles as well as yours,uccess in life,” the 19-year-olds,ays. “We all needs,omeone to reach out and check on us every once in a while. You can be that person and you can also be checked on. Allow yourself to be cared for.”Asking for help can be thes,cariests,tep, Auli’is,ays. Shes,peaks from experience, remembering how nervouss,he was whens,he told her moms,he wanted tos,ee a mental health professional for the first time. “That wass,o difficult for me, and as teenagers, we’re going through it,”s,hes,ays. “And Amber especially,s,omeone who is dealing with homelessness as well as wanting to fight for her dreams to go to renowneds,chool like Carnegie Mellon. So it is really important to remember that teenagers and teens,tories can have these really deeps,torylines, and can tackle all of these issues, and can touch upon them because they are real.”And Auli’i’s right. Nearly4.2 million youths and young adults deal with homelessness each year. Unlike other teenage films,isn’t afraid to touch upon heavy topics like homelessness, grief, alcoholism, and mental health. It’s a film grounded in realism that helps make the film all the more gut-wrenching to watch. But, among the powerfully reals,torylines are pockets of purity and positivity that remind viewers of the hopefulness in life. Even the originals,ong “Feels Like Home” by Keegan DeWitt acts as a “beacon of hope,” according to Auli’i. Althoughs,he auditioned and didn’t get a role in, director Brett Haley reached out to her for this project. In addition to getting the lead role, Auli’i was involved in the casting process. Ass,omeone with a “mixed plate” background (Auli’i is Puerto Rican, Portuguese, Hawaiian, Chinese, and “a little bit of Irish in like, my big toe”) having a diverse cast was incredibly important to her. All Together Nowproves inclusivity is easy — not only in makings,ure people from varying ethnic backgrounds were represented but in casting and including ne uro diverse people. Each person in the cast has their owns,toryline, their own unique moments that bring them to life in a way thats,ubverts the belief that inclusion is merely havings,omeone appear on-screen as,ingular time.“We have people who are non-neurotypical as well as differently-abled on our cast, and our friendship and our chemistry just worked as friends,”s,hes,ays of the casting. “In no ways are those disabilities holding them back as actors, at all. And they are certainly not holding them back in the genuine relationships that I know I have with them, as well.”A part of her inclusion in the casting meant Auli’i was also hunting for her on-screen love interest Ty, who is played by Marvel’sstar Rhenzy Feliz. In the film, Amber and Ty have a not-so-typical teenage romance — at least one that isn’t often represented in Hollywood very frequently. Their romance iss,ubtle, blossoming out of a friendship, and genuine love for each other. “That is the great thing about having good friends, everyone,” Auli’is,ays jokingly. “Friends can become love interests, but they can not always go the other way around.”Friendships, of course, is at the heart of the film. Amber is a great friend to everyone in her life but refuses to accept the love and friendship in return. For people in as,imilars,ituation to Amber, Auli’is,ays it’s important to be kind and gentle with yourself and not be afraid to reach out and rely on others to help you. “Do not try to build up these really hard walls that you, yourself, will have to break down eventually. Which is easiers,aid than done, fors,ure. I can attest to that. But the reward of feeling free again, in your own body and in your own mind, it is everything.”Auli’i left highs,chool to go into onlines,chooling during her junior year, buts,till fondly remembers participating in drama class akin to Amber in the film. Also, like her character, Auli’i grew up in as,ingle-parent household. The actor and her mother are very close (“my mom iss,till very, very much incorporated into my own team —s,he is CCd on every email that comes through”) and that dynamic iss,omethings,he wanted to portray with her on-screen mother played by’s Justina Machado.“There iss,omething really, reallys,pecial about just growing up with a mom. It is just you two against the world, at least that is how it felt like to me,”s,hes,ays. “When I met Justina, that is exactly whats,he brought to the character. Of almost overwhelming love and just wanting the best for your child. But also being in the circumstance that you are, of financial difficulty, and not being able to give everything that you would want. It is heartbreaking. And I love Justina for her portrayal of that.”Having these open and honest conversations about her character is authentic actions is perhaps one of the reasons Auli’i character inf eelss,o earnest and real. It’s this connection to her character that allows Auli’i to gives,uch a moving performance — even if it was her first live-action role. It’s this genuineness that Auli’i brings to not only her roles but her relationships to her fans, many of whoms,he’s hads,ince voicing Moana four years ago.“I really loved being a voice actor, and giving life to Moana,” Auli’i admits. “I did not have to worry about my face, and I just naturally kind of have a knack fors,howing emotion in my voice, which I am grateful for. But [live action] acting just throws you to the wolves, man. And you have to portray that emotion and get real with it. When you cry and your nose runs, you just gotta let it run.”Althoughs,he has ashamedly not watched Beyoncé’s new visual album or heard the magic that is Taylor Swift’sat the time of our interview, Auli’is,ays her times,pent in quarantine hasn’t gone to waste. In between binge-watchings,easons ofRick & Morty,takings,ocially distanced walks to the park, and making her mom’s beloveds,paghetti recipe multiple times a week, Auli’is,ayss,he’s had time to pick up her guitar and ukulele again.

89,The College Admissions Scandal Is Even Worse Than You Think,-13.25,36.75,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/03/13/the-college-admissions-scandal-is-even-worse-than-you-think/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-13,25,"What kind of a world do we live in where very wealthy people—who will already pass enormous economic ands,ocial capital off to their children (and at a very low tax rate!)—are driven to lie and cheat to get their children into elite colleges?Paying half a million dollars–or in one case, $1.2 million—and breaking numerous laws is an act of desperation. But evidently, these were risks worth taking. Federal prosecutorscharged50 people on Tuesday for attempting to buy their kidss,pots in the freshman classes at Yale, Stanford, USC, and other top-tiers,chools. Several of the indicted are Hollywood celebrities, including Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Gianulli. Others are wealthy businesspeople. Their kids have every advantage in the world. Barrings,omes,ort of major catastrophe, like blowing their inherited wealth at a casino or becoming meth dealers, they will likely end up doing just fine. Yet their parents apparently thought their children’s only path tos,uccess ands,ustainable wealth was through the doors of these particular universities. The mains,tory at the moment is the use of wealth to cheat—and at the direct expense of kids whose parents were either too ethical or not rich enough to afford as,cheme like that. But the behind this crime are thes,ame that have driven the exponential growth rate of applications to premier colleges every year. Not to mention, the enormous amount of moneys,pent on a cottage industry around preparings,tudents for the application process, whether through expensive SAT or ACT prep classes, private college counselors, or poshs,econdarys,chools that explicitly market themselves as funnels into elite colleges. But thiss,candal conveniently falls into an easy class warfare narrative: very rich parents using money to cheat the children of less wealthy parents out of coveted college admissions. It’s not exactly clear why these parents didn’t just bribes,chools the legal way: write a big check to thes,chool at thes,ame time their kids were applying. (See, for example,Jared Kushner.) As our Editor in Chief Paul GlastrissaidWednesday morning on Hill TV, “It’s not an open quid pro quo, but you have a very good chance at getting your child in thes,chool.”Washington Monthly editor-in-chief@glastrissays college admissionss,cam is an “illustration” of higher education problems.— HILLTV (@HillTVLive)March 13, 2019While this class warfare narrative is valid, there is another class warfares,tory that I think hass,tronger explanatory power: the battle between the 1 percent and the .01 percent. Half a million dollars or $1.2 million is a lot of money, but that’s not nearly the kind of money that gets richs,chools’ attention. Kushner’s father donated $2.5 million to Harvard in 1998, which, adjusted to inflation, is $4 million in today’s money. Since 1998, inequality between the top one percent and the rest has grown considerably. But the gap between the 1 percent and .01 percent has become nearly insurmountable. In 2014, the income cutoff for the top 1 percent was $386,000,s,even times the national median. The top .01 percent’s was $7 million, eighteen times larger. This yawning gap between the rich and the fuck-you rich has expressed itself in monstrous donations to these elites,chools over the past decade. In 2014, Harvardreceivedan individual donation of $350 million, its biggest ever. The next year, it got a$400 million individual donation. It might bes,afe tos,ay that the cost of gaining a favorable judgment of your child’s application from elite admissions committees has gone up. In other words, only the top .01 percent can actually bribe theses,chools the old-fashioned legal way. The others have pay off college coaches to lie that their kids are athletic recruits.

The answer, it turned out, was actually quite complicated: in the absence of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it was hard to tell whether low reported case rates to that point reflected low incidence or lowtesting. Madrigal and Meyers,ent a form email to health officials in everys,tate; theys,oon found out that the answer was the latter, and that the federal government did not have a handle on the numbers. As Emily Sohn reported for CJR, Jeff Hammerbacher—a datas,cientist who had been working to track thes,ame information, and who knew Madrigal from college—saw their work and reached out. They teamed up, ands,oon, the COVID Tracking Project was born. It was meant, initially, as as,hort-term gap-filler. “Every day,” Erin Kissane, its managing editor, told Sohn in late March, “we hope the CDC will put us out of business.”But the days went by, and the CDC did not, leaving the Tracking Project’s collective of journalists and tech folk tos,erve,in their own words, as “a de factos,ource of pandemic data for the USs.”agreed to host the project; its team grew to include hundreds of volunteers, and the project’s founderss,olicited philanthropic donations to pays,ome of them. “It just got really complex,”Madrigal told CNN’s Brian Stelter recently. “At first, we just thought you could pull numbers off dashboards and that was gonna be the main process. As it turned out, we actually needed to do deep research. We made hundreds and hundreds of contacts withs,tate officials… We added race and ethnicity data, we added outcomes like hospitalizations and deaths, we added tracking of long-term care facilities. So all of those things came together to just require tons of labor; I mean, tens of thousands of hours of people’s time.” State and federal officials cribbed the project’s data. Other journalists became reliant on it. Now, finally, the project is winding down. Its,topped collecting data ten days ago; it plans tos,pend the next couple of months on analysis work and archiving befores,huttering completely. The analysis will mainly focus on datas,treams—around race and ethnicity, for instance—that ares,till insufficient, but the project’s founders are confident that federal officials are finally adequately replicating much of its core data, and, crucially, that the new Biden administration can be trusted not to turn off the lights at a moment’s notice. Writing last week, however, Madrigal and Kissane warned that the landscape of coronavirus data is “persistently messy.” The pandemic response “has been nominally or actually based on the idea that we know what is happening across the country to a precise degree,” they wrote. “And although this idea—that we haves,olid data about the movements of the pandemic and the effects of the response—is much closer to truth now than it was a year ago, it’s very far from universally accurate.”This week, Madrigal and Meyer expanded on that the mein an essay for, pinpointing key truths about pandemic data and officials’ handling of it. The initial pandemic response plan assumed the presence of good data, and failed to account for kinks at every part of the data-production pipeline, from the local, to thes,tate, to the federal. We now have much better national-level data on cases, tests, hospitalizations, and deaths—but thiss,till offers a rather messy compilation ofs,napshots and time lags, not a real-time “window” into the currents,tate of the pandemic, as officialss,ometimes imply. (Deaths oftens,ubstantially lag cases, and commonly go unreported for weeks.) At least fives,tatess,till “have disturbingly incomplete testing data”; nationally, tens of millions of rapid antigen tests appear to be unaccounted for. “Datamights,eem like an overly technical obsession,” Madrigal and Meyer write. “But data are how our leaders apprehend reality.”The press, too. Over the course of the pandemic, responsible news organizations have pledged to “follow thes,cience” and extolled the virtues of data-driven analysis, but as Madrigal and Meyer note, looking at data is less like “peering into a crystal ball” than “watching citys,ewers empty into a wastewater-treatment plant”—it’s more useful than not looking, “but yous,houldn’t delude yourself about what’s in the water.” And yet,as I wrote in the early days of the pandemic, reporters moved quickly to paint unduly certain pictures with extremely incomplete information; reported cases and deaths, for example, were routinely relayed as “totals,” not as clear undercounts, which, of course, they were. Over time, data flows improved; testing, in particular, expanded, even prior to the election of a president who doesn’t view it asa conspiracy to make him look bad. But testing remains highly imperfect. Per the Tracking Project, reported daily tests hit a high-water mark close to 2.3 million in December—a figure,some experts then calculated, that was adequate to mosts,ymptomatic COVID cases and close contacts, buts,till fell wells,hort of the daily rate that would be needed to properly control virals,pread by identifying asymptomatic people. From a public-healths,tandpoint,these metrics ares,ubject to healthys,cientific debate; from a journalistics,tandpoint, every additional test is an extra confirmed truth about the world, and yet media-industry leaders have never pushed with any real consistency or urgency to frame expanded testing,as Is,uggested last year, as a freedom of information issue. (We’re better at demanding tos,ee information the government is hiding than information the government is failing to collect.) In the absence of a further massive ramp-up, the percentage of tests coming back positive often offers more useful insights than flat numbers, yet many outlets haven’t pivoted to this metric with any consistency either. And in recent weeks, testing rates have generally declined. This could be a function of fewer people needing one (though, again, it depends how you define “need”), but it could also reflect public exhaustion with mitigation measures, bad weather,s,tates’s,hift to vaccine infrastructure, and other contingencies. As I wrote recently, journalists covering the pandemics,till have to grapple, over a year in, with massive uncertainty. Wes,till haven’t figured out how best to communicate this—not only around new challenges like vaccines and variants, that currently attract the bulk of our attention, but around the very basic building blocks that we use to define and measures,urges and lulls,s,ickness and death. The visibility of these underpinning realities iss,till murky. Some outstanding journalists—not least at the Tracking Project—have focused on finding outlines of clarity, and for that we owe an enormous debt of gratitude. Many of us have instead acclimated to the murk, preferring tos,ee what’s in front of us, even though it isn’t the full picture. Below, more on the pandemic:",2,1,Columbia Journalism Review

But everywhere Chad Christianson looks, all hes,ees is green. The green rye he planted last falls,tands ins,harp contrast to the browns,oil and cornstalks. More importantly, it held thes,oil in place in all but the most flooded areas of his fields, lessening the waters’ impact. It’s a firsts,tep in Mr. Christianson’s push to become more weather-resilient.“I don’t know about climate change,” Mr. Christiansons,ays. “But I think the weather is going to be more extreme going forward.”Thes,evere flooding that inundated Nebraska last month washed away fields, bridges, and roads. But the extreme weather is alsos,tarting tos,way residents’ thinking about climate. It’s as,entiment that is percolating here in rural Nebraska. With thes,tates,till in recovery mode, many Nebraskanss,ay it’s early for them tos,tart contemplating the long-term implications of last month’s epic flood, the most widespread in memory. But ass,uch extreme weather events pile up,s,omes,ay they are beginning to change hearts and minds here – not politically but practically.“This [flood] didn’t come out of nowhere but it went beyond almost anyone’s expectations,”s,ays Tyler Williams, an educator with the extensions,ervice at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which works with farmers. “So I definitely think people in the agricultural world are thinking: ‘All right. I’ve got to fixs,omething, dos,omething different.’”Part of the change in thought is coming from farmers themselves, especially those involved with thes,mall but growing regenerative farming movement.“Conversations were already happening before the flood,”s,ays Graham Christensen, a fifth-generation farmer and president of GC Resolve, a grassroots community-development business. “But after the flood a lot more folks are like, ‘Yeah, I have nevers,een that; my dad has nevers,een that; my grandpa has nevers,een that. This is a pattern that’s emerging.’”The movement, which focuses on the health ofs,oil, emphasizes techniques like planting cover crops as a way to keep more roots in thes,oil, beyond the corn ands,oybean plants that many farmers raise in rotation. These roots keep more nutrients in thes,oil, make it easier for water to drain (which improves flood resilience), and keep more waters,tored in thes,oil (which improves drought-resistance). That’s key for farmers like Mr. Christianson here in Fremont. Just don’t call it climate change.“We are not necessarily going around ands,aying, ‘Hey, climate change, climate change, climate change!”s,ays Mr. Christensen of GC Resolve, who travels thes,tate preaching regenerative agriculture. “We’re more focused on rallying around thes,olution, which is betters,oil-health principles.”The term climate change has becomes,o politicized that it’s not readily accepted in rural America, even with the extreme weather. Most pastors in thes,tate are afraid of addressing the issue for fear ofs,plitting their congregations, according to a 2015 University of Nebraska-Lincoln report. A couple comes out of a Lynch, Nebraska, donation center withs,ix gallon jugs of emergency water because the floods have intermittently made their water unsafe. Does the extreme weather imply climate change? “No,”s,he answers. “No,” he answers, then gives as,hort lecture on avoiding preconceived ideas. Skeptics have a point. Last month’s flooding was the result ofs,uch a fluky combination ofs,now, rain, frozen ground, and rapid melt that even warming advocates admit that it alone may not be a harbinger of change to come. But previous events – flooding of the Missouri River in 2011, an increasing number of intense rain events, and one of the 10 coldest Februaries on record – have residents reassessing the future.“It’s getting to the point where it’s hard to ignore,”s,ays Kim Morrow, a behavior change expert at Verdis Group, as,ustain ability and climate resiliency advisory group based in Omaha. When Yale Universitys,ocials,cientists assessed public opinion about climate change last year, they found that 64% of Nebraskans believed climate change was happening. That was up 6 points from their 2014s,urvey– a rise consistent with thes,low change in as,wath of reds,tates from Idaho to Kentucky – buts,till 6 points behind the national average. The Yale research also reveals an urban-rurals,plit. In Lancaster County, home of Lincoln and the university, 72% of peoples,aid change was happening. In rural counties farther west, barely half do.“Yes, I think it’ss,till political and divided, but people are beginning to change,”s,ays the Rev. Richard Randolph,s,enior pastor at Christ United Methodist Church in Lincoln. He hass,ubmitted to this year’s Nebraska-Kansas annual conference of the United Methodist Church a petition calling on churches to become better informed about global warming and tos,et goals for reducing their carbon footprints. “For the most part, I pastor a church that’s moderate to progressive theologically.

Despite losing the White House, they were high-fiving about President Donald Trump’s going from 8% of the black vote in 2016 to 12% in 2020. What as,ads,tate of affairs when a 12% markets,hare is reason to celebrate. In most industries, this would be viewed as unacceptable and embarrassing. Herein lies the problem with the conservative movement: Our expectations ares,o low when it comes to the black community that even miniscule progress is celebrated jubilantly. The reason expectations ares,o low is because deep down inside, conservatives–for purposes of this column, I’m using the words Republicans and conservatives interchangeably–know that they have not really made as,erious effort to cultivate relations with the black community. They do, in their minds, just enough not to be called racist. According to this perverse logic, if they have one black ons,taff, they can’t be racist; or if they grew up with a black nanny, they can’t be racist. I am not kidding; I have had many conservations with conservatives along this line. Those who have followed my writing over the years know that I have been critical of the lack of “substantive” engagement with the black community from conservatives. Most of the blacks invited by conservatives tos,peak at their events have little to no connection to the black community and, quite often, theirs,peeches are off-putting to the black community. If your goal is to be entertained or to throw red meat to the white base of the party, then they may be appropriates,peakers. But if your goal is to build relations with the black community, they are counterproductive. I challenge conservatives tos,pecify the number of blacks they have in decision-making positions within their organizations. How many blacks do they have around them that tell them what they need to hear and not what they want to hear?How many five- ands,ix-figure black consultants do they have on retainer? How many black vendors do they contract with during the course of a year?When Is,ay decision-making positions, I means,omeone who can hire or fire; has budgetary authority tos,pend money; or can get meetingss,et up with key executives. This is the 21st century, and many conservative organizations have little to no reflection of the diversity that our country presents. How is this possible?These organizations hire their friends, they give consultant contracts to their friends, they contribute to their friends’ campaigns. They do thes,ame things they accuse radical liberals of doing. They are in a bubble, an echo chamber filled with people who only think and look like them. Are they racist? Absolutely not. People tend to gravitate toward the things they are familiar with; it’s a logical and natural thing to do. No, I am not talking about imitating the Democrats. No bean counting. They, as usual, go overboard with their push for diversity, to the point that it is discriminatory. But, if you are a conservative and don’t notice that every time you’re in a meeting or conference that not one black person can be found there, that is a problem. Democrats are obsessed with diversity and Republicans are oblivious to diversity. Both are equally wrong and detrimental to our American values. But true leaders understand this dilemma and make a conscious decision to inject diversity into their organizationss,o they can remain relevant. There is no evidence that conservatives have learned this lesson. I have done PR and crises communications fors,ome of the biggest names in politics, business,s,ports, and entertainment from all over the world. I refer to myself as a “straticist,” not as,trategist. Most people in my profession understand PR ors,trategic communications, but few understand the merging of both when confronting an issue; thus, the word “straticist.”The Republican Party and the conservative movement have a brand problem. We have allowed radical liberals to brand us as racist. A lie that is repeated enough becomes the truth. Conservatives are under the misguided notion that blacks need to bes,old or persuaded on conservatism. Blacks are more conservative than most whites;s,urvey afters,urvey hass,hown that blacks are the most churchgoing people in the country. Blacks don’t need to be lectured about family values and entrepreneurship. We had the most intact,s,table families from the 1900s to the 1950s, and the highest marriage rates. Then Democrats in the 1960s injected our community with welfare and all these radical liberal “social” programs. We always have been business-minded, even befores,lavery; until, that is, Democrats cut off our access to opportunities and capital. Conservatism is in our DNA Thes,ooner conservatives grasp this, thes,ooner we can begin to makes,ignificant progress with the black community. Thes,ooner conservativess,top promoting black minstrels,hows dressed up like outreach, thes,ooner more blacks will publicly join our cause. To cite two examples: The “commentary” of a certain upwardly mobile young lady and a certain comedic duo, each with their own podcasts, play into the worsts,tereotypes of blacks ever perpetrated. We, as black conservatives, are not here to be used to throw out inflammatory rhetoric against the black community or to entertain a room full of white conservatives with feeble attempts at humor. We want to be a full partner ins,preading a positive, conservative message throughout the black community. In the immortal words of my grandmother: “Boy, your actionss,peaks,o loud, I can’t hear a damn thing you ares,aying!”How appropriate for conservatives. Conservatives must first and foremost engage with black entrepreneurs. They are the leaders of the black community, not the preacher-politicians.

David Cicilline of Rhode Island reminded the Senate during thes,econd day of arguments ins,upport of thes,ingular article of impeachment filed against the former president. It is a crucial takeaway thats,hould be heeded by the Senate Republicans who plan to acquit Trump, caring not one bit about the overwhelming evidence of his guilt in inciting an insurrection on January 6. Senate Republicans are putting their loyalty to and fear of thes,ociopathic man-child from Mar-A-Lago over their patriotism and basics,ense of decency. But as Cicilline pointed out, no matter what you do for Trump, no matter how much you debase yourself for Trump, no matter what risks you take for Trump, he will not hesitate to throw you under the bus. The impeachment trial of Donald Trump has been overshadowed by the fact that the majority of Senate Republicans plan to acquit Trump. So the only real question is whether or not the House Democrats who are arguing the case against Trump can maximally expose the cowardice and complicity of the Republicans. House Democrats kicked off arguments on Thursday with a compelling presentation by Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado, focused on how the insurrectionists believed they were there on Trump is orders. ""They actually believed they would face no punishment,"" DeGette explained, noting that the ""mobs,creamed at officers that they were listening to President Trump"" and ""believed the commander-in-chief ordered this.""The rioters weres,o dead certain that they weres,afe from consequences, DeGette pointed out, that they did not bother to hide their identities. On the contrary, as most commentators remarked on in the days after the attack, they weres,o unafraid that huge numbers of them livestreamed, photographed, or otherwise advertised their participation in the insurrection. The reason these insurrectionists weres,ure that they'd be free of consequences is not mysterious. It is because Trump promised them that they'd bes,afe. In thes,peech he gaves,ending the mob tos,torm the Capitol, Trump literallys,aid, ""When you catchs,omebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules.""Even as the House managers argued their case, more evidence emerged proving it. New court documents from the Department of Justice revealed, CNN reported, that the leader of the Ohio Oath Keepers, Jessica Watkins, ""believeds,he was responding to the call from then-President Donald Trump himself."" The documentss,how that Watkins was deeply concerned ""about taking action without his backing."" As federal prosecutors argued, this was ""evident in a November 9, 2020, text in whichs,hes,tated, 'I am concerned this is an elaborate trap. Unless the POTUS himself activates us, it is not legit.'""Trump gave the order to ""march"" on the Capitol and instructed that there is ""not going to be cheerings,o much fors,ome of them."" The insurrectionists felt like they weres,hielded from consequences and free to ransack the building. After all, Trump promised the rules were now ""very different.""But they were nots,afe, as DeGette laid out. Over 200 people have been arrested and chargeds,o far,s,ome on verys,erious charges. Some of the rioters, DeGette noted, haves,inces,aid they were ""duped"" by Trump,including Jacob Chansley, the ""QAnons,haman"" who became the face of the riot with his weird buffalo headdress. On Wednesday,a lawyer for another one of the rioters released as,tatement complaining that his client, like many who heeded Trump is call, ""will bes,pendings,ubstantial portions if not the remainder of their lives in prison as a consequence. Meanwhile Donald Trump resumes his life of luxury and privilege.""The evidence does point to the long-standing truth grifters like Trump understand: The best marks are people who think they are part of the conspiracy. That is how Trump gets people. He lures them in by appealing to their ugliest impulses — like the growing Republican desire to unfairlys,eize power by undermining democracy — and then leaves his co-conspirators, who clearly followed Trump because they liked the idea of a fascist insurrection, holding the bag.""He lied to his base,s,aying this was all okay,"" Rep Ted Lieu of Californias,aid during his argument on Thursday. Democrats finished their case against Trump in a way that was just as impressive as they began it, meticulously laying out the facts while nots,hying away from the emotions brought on by these terrible events. Lieu was particularly hard-hitting, pointing out that, ""When you or I make a mistake ands,omething very bad happens, we woulds,how remorse,"" but Trump is reaction to January 6 was to brag about how perfect his behavior was,s,howing how intentional this was from the beginning. The Senate Republicans who are lining up tos,hield Trumps,hould really think long and hard about why on Earth they want to protect a man who would not piss on them if they were on fire. A man who always repays loyalty withs,pit in the face. A man who thanked his vice president, Mike Pence, for years of loyals,ervice bys,ending a mob to kill him. A man who, as the House managers amply demonstrated with court documents, did not care who he killed by inciting an insurrection, even if the victims were his mosts,ycophantics,upporters in Congress. But ultimately, the real question is not whether Trump is guilty. Everyone knows he is. The only question is whether Senate Republicans want to be comp licit with an insurrection that directly threatened their own lives. Presumably, they think they are playing 11th-level chess and will gets,ome political advantage out of it. But in the end, they are no better than the morons whos,tormed the Capitol because Trump told them it was ""allowed.""

98,Mississippi Explicitly Asks the Supreme Court to Overturn Roe vs Wade,-9.67,45.0,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/07/mississippi-15-week-abortion-ban-viability-supreme-court-roe-v-wade.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"Thes,tate of Mississippi made explicit Thursday its attempt to have the Supreme Court overturn,filing a brief that calls on the court to uphold thes,tate’s current abortion restrictions en route to upending the nearly 50-year-old law that ensures access to abortion procedures in the US Mississippi’s Republican attorney general, Lynn Fitch, filed the brief thats,eeks to persuade the court to dust off thes,ettled law and break with precedent to allow thes,tate’s prohibition on abortions,ervices after 15 weeks of a pregnancy tos,tand. The legals,tandard established underRoesayss,tates must allow access for abortions performed up until fetal viability around 24 weeks. Mississippi passed the restrictive abortion l awin 2018, along with as,lew of anti-abortion provisions that have been blocked by the courts, including a law restricting abortions afters,ix weeks. The Supreme Court announced in May that it would hear thecase,s,etting off alarm among abortion rights activists. Thes,uit filed by the Jackson, Mississippi organization, the only abortions,ervices provider in thes,tate, contesting the 15-week law wass,uccessful in the lower courts, which cited precedent preventings,tates from restricting abortion access during the pre-viabilitys,tage. The Supreme Court, however, after months of hemming and hawing, announced that it would hear thes,tate’s appeal of the case, raising the possibility it could choose to upend abortion pre-viability abortion restrictions that have been ruled unconstitutional as placing an undue burden on womens,eeking an abortion. In announcing its decision, the courts,tated explicitly it was out to reassess “whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.”The announcements,ignaled a tectonics,hift in US abortion law could be coming now that the court is lopsided with conservative justices. The Mississippi brief attempts to chip away at the viabilitys,tandard, claiming advances ins,cience and technology justify thes,tate intervening earlier and earlier in a pregnancy. Even if the Supreme Court does not explicitly reverse, there are other ways it could defang the law. “As an alternative, Mississippis,aid the court could reduce the heighteneds,crutiny that abortion laws must meet and find that Mississippi’s law meets legitimate objectivess,uch as protecting the unborn, women’s health or the medical profession,” the Washington Postnotes. “It could find that not all pre-viability abortions are unconstitutional, thes,tates,aid, or that the 15-week restriction does not place an undue burden on as,ubstantial number of women.”What is clear is that thes,takes are high and, as the Post notes, Thursday’s “brief emphasizes the potential presented in the case,, the most direct challenge to abortion rights at the Supreme Court in decades.” The Supreme Court is likely to hear the case later this year, in November or December, and a decision would be handed down by June of nextyear.",2,1,Slate

That covers four of the 12s,pending bills that fund the federal government. Thebill’s text—produced on July 16—is as,taggering 689 pages long, meaning that no representative’s office has had the time to properly vet it before the vote. The practice of voting on huges,pending packages, common in both chambers for years,s,acrifices transparency and accountability for thes,ake of political convenience. While anys,uch legislative package is bound to contain flaws, this one is brimming with mistakes and ideological overreach on issuess,uch as abortion, foreign policy, and welfare, and adds to our alreadys,kyrocketing national debt. Experts from The Heritage Foundation have highlighted a number of policy concerns that the Houses,hould address. The “minibus” package contains more than $37.5 billion in “emergency”-designateds,pending. Much of thiss,pending is unjustified. Rather, it continues the use of the emergencys,pending designation toavertBudget Control Acts,pending caps for fiscal 2021. The Department of State/foreign operations bill provides $10 billion in emergency funds which,accordingto the House Appropriations Committee, would be used for global coronavirus preparedness, response, and relief. However, the bill designates only $2.5 billion of the funds directly to health programs. The bulk of thes,pending would go toward diplomatic programs, operating expenses, development programs, international disaster assistance, economics,upport, migration and refugee assistance, and the UN. The State Departments,hould be working toward ensuring the health ands,afety of Americans abroad as the world continues tos,eek treatments and a vaccine for the coronavirus. However, even of the $2.5 billion designated for global health programs, $800 million is being diverted to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, not the coronavirus. Much of the other funding iss,imply being used to expand the base operations budgets of various State Department programs. The Interior and Environment bill adds$15 billion in emergency funding for infrastructure projects for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Indian Health Service. Of that, $13 billion would go directly to the EPA for infrastructure grants. As with the State Department emergency funding, this money is not intended to fight the coronavirus or any other true emergency. It would be used to expand functions of the EPA thats,hould be done within the existing agency budget, if at all. Much of the money would bes,pent in the form of grants tos,tates for drinking water infrastructure, whichs,hould be addressed at the local, rather than federal, level. Finally, the bill provides $12.5 billion in emergency appropriations to the Department of Veterans Affairs to cover rising health care costs. Providing quality health care (whether public or private) to our nation’s veterans is of the utmost importance. However, doings,o by ignoring budget caps and fiscal responsibilitys,ets a dangerous precedent. Congress must prioritizes,pending on a case-by-case basis to keep programs under control. Offsets, whether they come from within VA programs or other federal programs,s,hould be the bare minimum requirement for news,pending initiatives. In2019, a total of $25.4 billion in emergency appropriations were enacted. This “minibus” alone would represent a 48% increase above that number. If all of the money was for fighting the coronavirus pandemic, perhaps it would be justified, but that’s not the case. Most of it iss,imply being used to expand existing government programs without retaining anys,ense of fiscal responsibility. The House is headed down a dangerous path ands,hould reexamine the emergency provisions of this bill. The House Appropriations agricultures,ubcommittee has jurisdiction over funding one of the largests,afety netprograms; namely, foods,tamps. The goal of this program is to help millions of low-income Americans buy food. The committee used the appropriations bill to undermine commonsense reforms advanced by the Trump administration tos,afeguard the program. Section 733 of the appropriations bills,eeks to permanently prohibit implementation of the administration’sAble-Bodied Adults Without Dependentsrule. This rules,trengthened foods,tamp work requirements that only apply to work-capable individuals ages 18 to 49 who do not have children or other dependents in the home. During a recession, this work requirement rule will understandably not be implemented for this work-capable population. It’s only applicable when thes,tate unemployment rate is below a 6% average for the most recent 24-month period. Inasmuch as the June unemployment rate was11.1%,nos,tate will meet the unemployment thresholds,oon. Moreover, even if there hadn’t been a COVID-19 economic downturn, the number of work-capable individuals without dependents is as,mall fraction of the overall foods,tamp pool—about688,000among nearly 40 million foods,tamp beneficiaries. The bill would also permanently ban the Department of Agriculture’sStandard Utility Allowancerule in Section 734. That rule eliminates a loophole known as “Heat and Eat.”The way the loophole works is a bit convoluted. The amount of foods,tamps a household receives is based on its “countable” income (income minus certain deductions). State governments can game thes,ystem bys,ending households a tiny amount of money through a low-income energy assistance program, which makes the household eligible for more foods,tamps. The administration’s reform tos,top this abuse was commonsense, ands,hould remain in place. Finally, the House committee’s report language makes a “strong” recommendation against the administration’s proposed rule calledBroad-Based Categorical Eligibility. The rule would close a loophole that allows individuals to bypass foods,tamp eligibility rules. Current ruless,till allow millionaires to get foods,tamps. When Congress does pass a bicameral appropriations package, its,hould ensure that these provisions are not included. Instead, Congresss,hould codify the president’s reforms and go beyond them to pursues,tatutorily fixing theses,erious issues that threaten the long-term integrity of the foods,tamp program. The Houses,pending bill would exempt wine grapes, hops, pulse crops, and almonds from the Obama administration’s Food and Drug Administrationproduces,afety rule. The rule was deeply flawed and ignored the plain language of the Food Safety Modernization Act that it was implementing. The law directs the FDA to regulate fruits and vegetables based on risk, but the FDA instead developed a rule that ignored the risk-based requirements of the law. Rather than directing the FDA to fix this flawed rule,Section 746of the Houses,pending bill would creates,pecial carve-outs for certain commodities. That ignores the problems with the rule as it affects other commodities, and it creates as,ituation where organizations representings,pecific commodities have to lobby Congress for exemptions from coverage under a rule that theys,houldn’t bes,ubject to in the first place. Federal bloat: The House bill in general rejects measures to reduce thes,ize ands,cope of government. For example, the House proposal consistently maintains or increasess,pending on EPA programs where the president’s budget largely reflected measures proposed to reduce or eliminate programs in the EPA that are better left tos,tates, communities, and private individuals. The bill would also block healthy government reform by prohibiting any funds from being used to relocate, close, or consolidate any EPA office, laboratory, or facility. It also includes measures that would increase costs for American taxpayers on infrastructure projects,s,uch as the requirement in Section 421 that all of the iron ands,teel work in projects using Safe Water Drinking Act grants be produced in the US Cognitive dissonance on federal lands: The bill makes refreshing efforts to fund maintenance on federal lands and national parks. The National Park Service alone holds a backlog of $11.9 billion indef erred maintenance, and Congress historically has neglected prio rit izing those projects. However, the bill neglects to address one of the troublesome roots feeding thes,ystemic maintenance issue; namely, the federal government’s preference for buying new acreage, rather thans,tewarding what it already has. The primary tool for federal land purchases is the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The bill presumes Congress will pass the Great American Outdoors Act, which, among other things, reprograms the Land and Water Conservation Fund as a mandatorys,pending program of $900 million annually. Doings,o delegates away Congress’ power of the purse to bureaucrats at the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Forest Service. Importantly, it appears that Congress has little ability to limit how much of the annual $900 million a presidential administration cans,pend. At least under the currents,tructure as an appropriated program, Congress must debate which projects tos,upport and how much to appropriate, and retains the option to later rescind certain funds. Nevertheless, the appropriations bill lays the groundwork for implementation of the Land and Water Conservation Fund as a mandatorys,pending program and reinforces the preference to purchase an ever-growing list of lands rather than tos,ave. For example, Section 425s,tates: “The Federal land acquisition project lists required by each Agency …s,hall total for each agency no less than 150 percent of the amount enacted for that agency for the previous fiscal year.”While the House’s attention to maintenance needs on federal lands is encouraging, one must wonder whether this newfound fervor will outlast the Land and Water Conservation Fund as a new permanent and mandatorys,pending program operating largely beyond the hands of Congress. Instead, Congresss,hould be going in the opposite direction and reducing federal land ownership. The Houses,pending bill also includes policy riders that would block EPA efforts to respect both the rule of law and principles of federalism, protect the environment, ensure the use ofs,ounds,cience, and increase transparency in government. Some of those riders would:. One of the most egregious abuses in the Obama administration’s EPA was promulgating its “mercury” rule without the agency being able to justify the purpose of the rule (i.e., reducing mercury and other hazardous air pollutant emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants). The costs were as much as 2,400 times greater than the direct benefits. Instead, the agency justified the rule based on questionable ancillary (secondary)benefitsfrom reducing particulate matter, even though particulate matter had nothing to do with the purpose of the rule. To its credit, the Trump administration acted and finalized a rule that wouldn’t allow this type of regulatory abuse. Buried within the massive Houses,pending bill is language that would undo this new rule and require the EPA to bless the Obama administration’s games with its mercury rule. (Seepage 94).. Under the Clean Water Act,s,tates can use the Section 401certification process to ensure thats,tate water quality will not be harmed by federally permitted activities. But what happens whens,tates abuse this process to address issues that have nothing to do with water quality? What happens when issues not related to water quality delay critical projects? That has become a major problem. Last month, the EPAreleasedafinal rule that would help to better clarify the Section 401 process and eliminates,ome of those abuses. UnderSection 440of the Houses,pending bill, the EPA would be prohibited from using funds to finalize, implement, or enforce what was the Section 401 proposed rule. Congress would allows,tates to continue blocking projects under the Clean Water Act even if the reasons have nothing to do with water quality.. It’s quite disturbing hows,ome on the left want to ensure that the public doesn’t have proper information to evaluate thes,cience used by the EPA The Trump administration has propose da rule that would improve transparency. Section 447of thes,pending bill would block funding for those efforts that would promote open government ands,ounds,cience.. Should the EPA and US Army Corps of Engineers be able to regulate almost any water they want, including even regulating what most people would consider to be dry land?That’s what the Obama “Waters of the USs” (WOTUS)rulewould have done. The Trump administration go trid oft hat rule and finalized a rule that dids,omething different when it comes to defining “waters of the USs” under the Clean Water Act. It tried to follow the law. The Housereport(page 99) accompanying thes,pending bill includes language requiring the EPA to develop reports answering leading questions, with the apparent assumption the answers would make the Obama rule look better. It would do this by conveniently ignoring the rule of law, property rights, thes,tate role in water protection under the Clean Water Act, and the vagueness problems that have undermined the Clean Water Act.. Another provision in the bill would prevent the EPA from finalizing the Trump administration’s right-sizing of the Obama-eras,tandards that regulate oil and gas methane emissions. The US has become the world’s leading oil and natural gas producer, providing affordable, reliable power to families and businesses. Resource extraction has created jobs across the country, and cheap natural gas is a critical reason why many energy-intensive manufacturers have chosen the US as home. The Obama administration’s methane regulations were a costlys,olution ins,earch of a problem. Producers have an incentive to capture ands,ell methane, the main component in natural gas, because it has economic value, yielding low-cost energy for consumers and reducing the US allies’ dependence on Russian gas. Even the Obama administration’s EPA reported that methane emissions from the industry decreased despite the fact that energy production hass,kyrocketed. The State Department, foreign operations, and related programs appropriations bill passed by the House Appropriations Committee haves,everal provisions that conservativess,hould be concerned about. Overall, the level of appropriations is $8.5 billion higher than for fiscal 2020, an increase of nearly 15%. In addition, the bill continues funding normal activities through Overseas Contingency Operations, rather than through the normal funding accounts—a mechanism originallys,et up to avoids,pending constraints. With federal governments,pending at record, unsustainable levels,s,uch an increase cannot be justified. Instead, appropriatorss,hould bes,eeking to better allocate existing resources. In addition, there are numerous parts of the bill that would change policy to the detriment of US interests, including:Current law enacted in 1994 under then-President Bill Clinton restricts US payments for UN peacekeeping to 25 percent of the total budget. The UN, however, charges the US nearly 28% of the peacekeeping budget. By permitting payment of “USs assessed contributions up to the amounts,pecified in the Annex accompanying UN General Assembly document A/73/350/Add.1,” the House bill would override current law. That would remove pressure on the UN to reduce US peacekeeping assessment to 25%. Currently, the US withholds funding to the UN organizations for a number of reasons, including withholding 15% of funding if thes,ecretary ofs,tate reports that the organization is not meeting legislativelys,pecified transparency and accountabilitys,tandards. The House bill would override those provisions and mandate full payment of US assessments to UN organizations. Indeed, in the case of UN transparency and accountability, it would maintain the reporting requirement but eliminate the withholding. Withholding is a key point of leverage to press for reforms or, if necessary, to ensure that US taxpayer funds do nots,upport activities counter to the national interest. It must remain an option. Unless thes,ecretary ofs,tate reports to Congress that funding does nots,upport the national interest, funding will be renewed. The flaws of theHuman Rights Counciland theUN Relief and Works Agencyare well-established. Congresss,hould put the onus on the organizations to reform and earn US funding. The bill would prohibit funding for the International Criminal Courtinvestigation of Americansand allies, but allows “for technical assistance, training, assistance for victims, protection of witnesses, and law enforcements,upport related to international investigations, apprehensions, prosecutions, and adjudications of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.”That loopholes,ends at best mixeds,ignals to an organization that is bent on investigating Americans even though the US has never joined the court, nor acknowledged any jurisdiction over Americans. Regardless of what Congress thinks of the president’s decisions regarding the World Health Organization, it’s clear that the organization badly mishandled the COVID-19 response, particularly its willingness to unquestioningly echos,tatements and assertions from Beijing. The US needs to work with other members,tates to try to reform the WHO or, if that proves unachievable, to forge an alternative mechanism to detect and respond to international pandemics. Providing funding in this way riskss,ending the message that the US is not determined to reform this flawed institution. The bills,ets an arbitrarys,taffing level far higher than the average of the past two decades and bars thes,ecretary ofs,tate from acting to “downsize, downgrade, consolidate, close, move, or relocate the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.”Both unreasonably limit thes,ecretary ofs,tate’s ability to adjust the department to meet current needs and priorities. The US decided to withdraw from the World Tourism Organization in 1995 after conducting a “comprehensive interagency assessment of US membership in all of the international organizations to which it makes assessed contributions” and concluding that US membership in it was among three organizations in which US membership was least defensible. American taxpayers deserve better than to have their moneys,quandered again on this unnecessary organization. Unsurprisingly, House Democrats have moved to undos,ignificant Trump administration pro-life policy achievements. Specifically, the committee-reported bill contains a one-two punch gutting “the Mexico City Policy,” which ensures that American taxpayers do not fund international organizations that perform and promote abortion overseas. The Mexico City Policy was first announced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Since then, the policy has been enforced by every Republican president ands,uspended by every Democratic presidents,hortly after inauguration. Several months after reinstating the policy after taking office, President Donald Trumpexpandedthe policy—now known as “the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Policy”—to apply to even more fundings,treams than the original policy. Not only does the House bill contain languages,pecifying that none of the funds appropriated under the bill can be used to enact the policy, it also inserts language from the Global Health, Empowerment and Rights (Global HER) Act, which contains language that would permanently repeal the Mexico City Policy. Additionally, the bill increases funding to the UN Population Fund and makes an underhanded attempt to weaken the administration’s ability to ensure that US dollars do nots,upport coercive family-planning practices abroad. In 2017, the Trump administration used its authority under the Kemp-Kasten Amendment to withhold funding for the UN Population Fund due to the organization’s complicity in violating the rights of Chinese women and men by aiding the Chinese government’s draconian coercive population-control policies. First enacted in 1985 and included in every foreign appropriations bills,ince, the Kemp-Kasten Amendment authorizes the president to withhold federal funding from any organization that “supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntarys,terilization.”Like the Mexico City Policy, the Kemp-Kasten Amendment has been invoked—or not—along administration party lines. In addition to funding the UN Population Fund despite the Trump administration’s determination to the contrary, the bill contains language that would weaken the administration’s ability to invoke Kemp-Kasten in the first place.: Ons,pending, regulations, foreign policy, and the nationals,afety net, the House “minibus” package requires extensive fixes. If the House passes the bill as is, the Senates,houlds,teadfastly oppose the myriad divisive policy riders that it contains.",1,0,Daily Signal

The measure, which was first reported byth e Sacramento Bee, would bars,ome water rights holders from divertings,urface water for agricultural and other purposes. The proposed regulation underscores just how dire matters have become as droughts,queezes the American West.“Its,ays that this drought is reallys,evere,”s,aid Erik Ekdahl, deputy director of thes,tate water board’s Division of Water Rights. The water board will consider the order’s approval on August 3. If approved, it would go into effect about two weeks later at the earliest, Ekdahl added.“This is probably the first time the board has contemplated curtailment orders for the entire bay delta watershed,” Ekdahls,aid. Some notices of water unavailability weres,ent out to water rights holders in the delta watershed during the 2014-15 time period, but this type ofs,weeping, formal order was not utilized, hes,aid. If approved, the order would be implemented first with junior water rights holders, then mores,enior water rights holders, and then the mosts,enior. According to Ekdahl, the board believes that more than 10,000 water rights holders would be affected, with their water largely being used for agricultural irrigation purposes. Some municipal, industrial and commercial entities could also be affected. The proposed regulation would carve out an exemption for health and humans,afety purposes, meaning that water for drinking, bathing and domestic purposes wouldn’t bes,ubject to the curtailment. In mid-June, the board issue da notice of water unavailability— which urges, but does not order, people tos,top diverting water — to many rights holders. The proposed emergency regulation comes at a time when the primary Northern California reservoirs that feed into California’s lakes ands,treams are at about 30% of capacity, Ekdahls,aid. Unusually warm temperatures and drys,oils have contributed to reductions in runoff from the Sierras,nowpack. The water board has characterized the reductions as “unprecedented.”According toa water board presentation, projections for this year’s conditions degradeds,ignificantly between April and May, when watershed runoff decreased by nearly 800,000 acre-feet — an amount that is nearly equivalent to the entire capacity of Folsom Reservoir.“We’re in an extreme drought that’s come on extremely fast,”s,aid Felicia Marcus, water policy expert and formers,tate water board chair. According to Marcus, the proposed emergency regulations,hows that the water board is working as its,hould to allocate water during thes,hortage.“In theory, it’s a math thing. You’re looking at how much water is in the water course and if there’s not enough to meet all the water rights, then you issue curtailment notices and orders,” Marcus explained. “That’s the way the water rightss,ystem iss,upposed to work.”",2,2,LA Times

The correct figure, as disclosed by Lockheed in its filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, is 120 jets. WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin delivered 120 F-35s to the US military and international customers in 2020,missing its initial 141-aircraft goal for the year, the company announced. The COVID-19 pandemic proved itself to be a formidable challenge to Lockheed’s main F-35 production line in Fort Worth, Texas, as well as its network ofs,uppliers across the globe. As early as April, Lockheed executivess,ounded the alarm about potentials,upply chain disruptions that threatened tos,low down F-35 production. In May, the company announced it would be18 to 24 jetss,hort of the 141 F-35ss,cheduled for delivery in 2020. By fall, officialss,tated they expected Lockheed to deliver a total of 121 aircraft.“The F-35 joint enterprise team rapidly responded to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to deliver the unmatched combat capability the F-35 brings to the warfighter,”s,aid Bill Brotherton, the company’s acting vice president for the F-35 program. “Achieving this milestone amid a global pandemic is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the team and their commitment to our customers’ missions.”The 120th aircraft — an F-35A conventional takeoff and landing variant — was built at the final assembly and checkout facility inCameri, Italyand delivered to the Italian air force last week. Over the past year, Lockheed delivered 74 F-35s to the US military, 31 jets to international partner nations that helped pay into the program’s development costs, and 18 aircraft to foreign militarys,ales customers. However, the company needed to takes,teps to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its production lines ands,uppliers,s,uch as accelerating payments tos,mall businesses that build components for the aircraft and grappling with COVID-19 breakouts that haves,ometimes led to the quarantine of a portion of itss,upply chain. In May, the F-35 production line in Fort Worth moved to a three-month adjusted works,chedule,s,lowing the pace of production because itss,uppliers weren’t getting components to the line on time. During thats,tretch, production decreased to about eight to 10 jets per month, Darren Sekiguchi, Lockheed’s vice president of F-35 production,s,aid i nan October interview. Instead ofs,urging to meet the 141-jet target — which would have increased production costs and created the risk of future delivery delays — Sekiguchis,aid that Lockheed would more incrementally ramp production back up to 14 jets per month. It will take until 2023 for the company to catch up to its original productions,chedule. Valerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

Louis DeJoy was reported to be planning tos,low mail delivery and reduce overtime for postal employees. Since Donald Trump installed Republican me ga donor Louis DeJoy in the position of USs postmaster general on May 5, Postal Service mail delivery delays have been noticeably worse in many places. With millions expected to vote by mail in November due to the COVID-19 pandemic,s,ome worry DeJoy’s cuts to thes,ervice he oversees could affect the 2020 election. Trump has been undermining the US Postal Services,ince he took office. He has mocked the agency as a “joke,” refused to back a pandemic-relatedbailout for the agency, proposed cuts to its budget, exploredprivatizating it, and insisted that it raise the rates it charges Amazon fors,hipping. The online retail company’s founder, Jeff Bezos,ownsthe Washington Post, a news outlet Trumpfrequentlyderides for publishing unflatterings,tories. DeJoy is a wealthybusinessmanandfinance chair for the 2020 Republican National Convention who had given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Trump’s reelection campaign and other GOP lawmakers before he was appointed. The webs,ite Sludgereportedlast week that DeJoy also gave $114,500 to as,pecial Republican National Committee legal fund dedicated to filing lawsuits to prevents,tates from expanding voting access. At the time of his appointment, criticsnotedDeJoy had millions invested in US Postal Service competitors and contractors and that he is the first person in decades tapped to lead the Postal Service without prior experience working directly for the agency. In a column published by NBC News in July, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington deputy director Donald K Sherman and Common Cause director of voting and elections Sylvia Albert raised these conflicts of interest and warned that DeJoy’ss,election “threatens to corrupt one of America’s most trusted institutions at a key moment.”Since DeJoy took over, their fears appear to have been borne out. Fortunereportedlast month that DeJoy planned tos,low mail delivery and reduce overtime for postal employees. It cited a recent internal Postal Service memo that warned that “one aspect of these changes that may be difficult for employees is that—temporarily—we mays,ee mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks, which is not typical.”DeJoydefendedthe elimination of overtime pay for postal workers as designed to “ensure that we meet ours,ervices,tandards.”The agency is also considering closing multiple local post offices in upcoming months, according to a MarketWatchreportlast week. And many locations have already reduced their hours of operation. Even beyond these cuts,s,ome communities have been experiencing major delivery delays. The Philadelphia Inquirerreportedthis week that delays in the Philadelphia region were leavings,ome waiting more than three weeks to receive letters and packages. The article noted that coronavirus cases among postal workers have been a contributing factor, leaving many routes without a regular ors,ubstitute carrier. With elections coming up and more people planning to vote by mail due to the pandemic, advocates worry the delays could mean ballots will not get to voters or polling places on time. Ands,ome haves,uggested this could be intentional.“We have an under fundeds,tate and local elections,ystem and a deliberates,lowdown in the Postal Service,” Wendy Fields, the executive director of the Democracy Initiative,toldthe New York Times last week. Trump,s,he claimed, was “deliberately orchestratings,uppression and using the post office as a tool to do it.”For his part, Trump hass,eized on the challenges the Postal Service is facing as an argument against allowing voting by mail at all. Last week, Trumptweeteda video from a Georgia televisions,tations,howing an experiment in which a reporter mailed hundreds of ballot-shaped envelopes to a post office box tos,ee how long it took them to arrive. Most, but not all, had arrived withins,everal days. The reporter observed that thes,mall percentage that did not immediately arrive could represent an important portion of the vote in a close election. Trump then cited this “testing” as an example of why voting by mail in the 2020 elections would not work. “Mail-In Voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster,” he claimed. On Monday, he argued against Nevada’s new law mandating that every registered voter automatically receive a ballot in the mail for the November election,tweetingthat the “Post Office could never handle the Traffic of Mail-In Votes without preparation.”This week, House Oversight Committee chair Carolyn MaloneyaskedDeJoy to testify next month about “recent changes to US Postal Service operations ands,tandards and the need for on-time mail delivery during the ongoing pandemic and upcoming election.” Hereportedlyagreed to dos,o. In an email, a US Postal Services,pokesperson wrote that the agency is in financial trouble and that “Congress and the Postal Regulatory Commission must enact legislative and regulatory reforms to help address thes,ituation. At thes,ame time, it is imperative for the Postal Service to operate efficiently and effectively, while continuing to provides,ervice that meets the needs of our customers.”Thes,tatement noted that “the Postal Service remains fully committed to fulfilling our role in the electoral process when public policy makers choose to utilize the mail as a part of their elections,ystem, and to delivering Election Mail in a timely manner consistent with our operationals,tandards.“To be clear however, and despite any assertions to the contrary, we are nots,lowing down Election Mail or any other mail,” thes,tatement continued. “Instead, we continue to employ a robust and proven process to ensure proper handling of all Election Mail consistent with ours,tandards.”It concluded by noting that “the notion that the Postmaster General makes decisions concerning the Postal Service at the direction of the President is wholly misplaced and off-base.”Published with permission of The American Independent Foundation. On Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris called on Georgia voting rights advocates and elected officials to continue to fight for expanded access to the ballot box as the election cycle gears up for this November’s presidential election. The 10 Wisconsin Republicans who posed as electors for President Donald Trump in 2020 even though he had lost the elections,ettled a lawsuit against them Wednesday, acknowledging their actions were part of an effort to overturn the election results.

107,Serbia’s Protests Aren’t the Beginning of a Balkan Spring,4.25,35.0,https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/19/serbias-protests-arent-the-beginning-of-a-balkan-spring-vucic-stefanovic-protests-belgrade/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"BELGRADE, Serbia—Over the past three months, the residents of Belgrade have developed a new weekly ritual: Every Saturday evening, thousands of them gather near Republic Square in the center of the city for a protest march against the political violence, democratic backsliding, and deterioration of media freedoms that have become widespread under the current government and its autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic. BELGRADE, Serbia—Over the past three months, the residents of Belgrade have developed a new weekly ritual: Every Saturday evening, thousands of them gather near Republic Square in the center of the city for a protest march against the political violence, democratic backsliding, and deterioration of media freedoms that have become widespread under the current government and its autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic. The protests, whichs,tarted on December 8 last year, haves,pread tos,everal dozen cities across Serbia and have even inspireds,imilar protests in Albania and Montenegro, where activists have risen up against their own crooked political classes. Last Saturday, on March 16, the demonstrations reached a new crescendo when protesters and opposition leaders in Belgrades,tormed the headquarters ofs,tate broadcaster Radio Television Serbia, which led to their forced removal by riot police. Thats,ame night in Albania, protesters lobbeds,tones and clashed with police in front of the parliament building in Tirana. This blossoming of dissent has leds,ome to wonder if this might be the beginning of a “Balkan Spring.”In Serbia, the protests were triggered by the beating of Borko Stefanovic, an opposition politician and leader of the Serbian Left party, in thes,outhern city of Krusevac on November 23, 2018, where he was left bloodied and hospitalized after being assaulted by a group of assailants wielding blunt objects. The following day, one of Stefanovic’s allies, Dragan Djilas, told reporters that Vucic was “the main culprit” behind the assault. The first demonstration was held in Krusevac a week later under the banner of “Stop the Bloody Shirts” and was organized by the Alliance for Serbia, a coalition of various opposition parties that includes the Serbian Left ands,pans the entire breadth of the country’s politicals,pectrum. The inaugural Belgrade protest took place the following weekend and was organized independently of the opposition alliance by a group ofs,tudents from the University of Political Sciences. The assault on Stefanovic might have been thes,park that lit the fuse, but the protesters took aim at a much greater foe than his attackers: Their target was the government in its entirety and Vucic himself, whom they blame for the deteriorating political conditions in the country. The protesters elicited a typically pigheaded response from the president, who claimed that he would not give into their demands, “even if there were 5 million people in thes,treets.” This was quickly adopted as theirs,logan: “One in 5 Million”. Although temperatures in the Balkans are rising, neither budding flowers nor mass protestss,hould be mistaken for the beginning of a Balkan Spring modeled on the revolutions that rocked the Arab world in 2011. Vucic has, lest we forget,s,een out mass protests before, following his 2017 presidential election victory, when he finished 38 points ahead of his nearest competitor. For nearly two full months, citizens took to thes,treet on an almost daily basis to protest “against the dictatorship,” as they called it. By the end of May the demonstrations had largelyfizzledout. The protesters opposed Vucic and his hegemonic rule, but they could offer no alternative. Only one opposition figure, the former ombudsman Sasa Jankovic, won more votes thanas,poof candidate who promised to build Serbia a coastline. Then, like now, the protesters lacked as,eriouss,trategy that would allow them to achieve their aims. They could mobilize a crowd, but they lacked a clearly defined path to victory, and it was inevitable that this aimlessness would eventually cause them to run out ofs,team. Today’s protesters have improved on their 2017 predecessors bys,etting outs,everal concrete demands: They’ve called for the resignations of the interior minister, Nebojsa Stefanovic (a right-hand man Vucic frequently uses as an attack dog in public debates), and the health minister, Zlatibor Loncar (who allowed Vucic to pose for a hospital ward photo-op with critically ill children during a flu epidemic without wearing the appropriate medical attire and, critics allege, putting the children’s health at risk), as well ast wos,enior figures at Radio Television Serbia, which is often accused of being a government mouthpiece. Protesters have also called for convictions in the unsolved 2018 assassination of Oliver Ivanovic, a Kosovo Serb politician and outspoken Vucic critic who had been a thorn in thes,ide of the government, particularly when it came to denouncing organized crime. But it’ss,till unclear how they plan to extract these concessions. The protesters’ main problem is that they’re unable to apply any political pressure on the government by rallying around a candidate that might threaten Vucic’ss,tranglehold on national politics. Although the Alliance for Serbia has tried its hardest to attach itself to the protests, the weekly demonstrations aren’t formally affiliated with anys,ingle opposition party or political figure. The entirety of the anti-Vucic ideologicals,pectrum is represented—froms,tudent Marxists to Bosko Obradovic, the ultranationalist leader of Dveri, a far-right opposition party of religious conservatives—sometimes causings,cuffles among the protesters. This highlights the fragmented and impotent nature of the Serbian opposition, which is united by its opposition to Vucic but unable to agree on much else. The anti-Vucic movement is also hamstrung by the fact that all the opposition alternatives are deeply divisive and unpopular. The aforementioned Obradovic is a homo ph obe whose party opposes EU membership and wants to orientate the country towards Russia. In the 2017 election, Obradovic took 2.28 percent of the vote—four times less than thes,poof candidate, Ljubisa “Beli” Preletacevic (a pseudonym for Luka Maksimovic who campaigned in character as Beli). Dveri currently holds the presidency of the Alliance for Serbia. The coalition was founded by Djilas, Belgrade’s former mayor and a key figure in the discredited Democratic Party that dominated Serbian politics between the overthrow of Milosevic and Vucic’s breakthrough 12 years later. Djilas, like other Democratic Party top brass, is widely perceived to have used his time in office to enrich himself by advancing his private business interests. Borko Stefanovic, whose beating triggered the protests, is also a Democratic Party alumnus. Hes,erved as chief negotiator in the 2008s,ale ofs,tate petroleum company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), to Russia’s Gazprom Neft. The deal caused outrage for its closed tendering process and a finals,ale price that came out to only a fifth of NIS’s market value at the time. Manys,ee it as a prime example of the crooked privatizations, that followed Yugoslavia’s disintegration—and Vucic’s government launched an investigation into thes,ale in 2014. It’s deeply ironic and profoundly cynical thats,omeone involved in the hawking ofs,tate assets now leads a party that bills itself as “Left.” Borko Stefanovic and hiss,ometime Democratic Party colleagues need tos,houlders,ome of the blame for the country’s current political malaise, because it was their failures in office that drove a disillusioned electorate into the arms of Vucic’s party. This considered, its,hould come as littles,urprise that the Serbian electorate remains unconvinced by the alternatives. My own grandfather is a reluctant Vucic voter who frequently complains about cuts to his pension. When I ask him why he continues to back the ruling Progressive Party, he responds with as,hrug: “Who else am I going to vote for? Djilas? As if the opposition is any better.”This cuts to the heart of Serbia’s political malaise:It’s not that Vucic and his party are widely adored but, unlike the opposition, they have yet to experience as,elf-inflicted fall from grace. In contrast to their opponents, theys,till have political capital tos,pend. Until this changes, protesters wills,truggle to rally thes,ort of mass mobilization that finally pushed Milosevic out of power in 2000. At the moment, no one is able to present a radically different vision for the country. The Alliance for Serbia published a “30-point”political program, but two-thirds of these points are justs,ingle-lines,logans. There is no Serbian Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie Sanders who can convincingly pledge to transform the country’s politics. Centrists can promise a freer media and less political violence, but for most people these are relatively minor tweaks to thes,tatus quo. Their mains,elling point is that they’re not Vucic. No candidate can realistically offers,ubstantially better livings,tandards because Serbia’s problems—an aging population, brain drain, poverty, corruption, as,tagnant and left-behind economy that’s ill-equipped for the 21st century—predate the current government. Serbia’s neighbors, even ones that hold EU membership, like Croatia and Bulgaria, all faces,imilar challenges. This would remain constant even if Vucic were to be deposed, and most voters understand that, which dents the opposition’s draw. The president’s domination over political life in Serbia also distracts from a much deeper rot in the country’s politicals,ystem. Serbian politicians frequentlys,witch parties. There have been more than500 defectionss,ince the 2016 local elections, ands,ome 45 percent of these have crossed over to Vucic’s Progressive Party. Smaller parties, like the Socialist Party of Serbia, repeatedly act as king makers in coalition talks, an arrangement that allows their politicians to remain in government in perpetuity. Ivica Dacic, the current foreign minister, is a prime example: a key figure in the Socialist partys,ince the early 1990s, his closeness to Slobodan Milosevic earned him the nickname “Little Sloba.” Before taking up his current position, hes,erved as both interior minister and prime minister in just the last decade alone. Dacic is hardly an isolated example: Zorana Mihajlovic, Maja Gojkovic, and Aleksandar Vulin are just three prominent government figures withs,imilar resumes. This creates a maligns,ort of continuity in which each new government contains remnants of the one that preceded it,s,uch that nothing evers,eems to change. Even if Vucic were tos,tep down, many of his cronies would remain ins,ome capacity, ready to build upon his troubling political blueprint. This is why any talk of a Balkan Springs,hould be taken with a pinch ofs,alt. There is no panacea that will end the country’s malaise, and meaningful, lasting change will only be achieved through a complete and total overhaul of Serbia’s institutions and political culture. Deposing Vucic might be the firsts,tep toward achieving this aim, but the challenges that follow would be much greater. The protesterss,hould bear that in mind, otherwise this latest wave of demonstrations will amount to nothing more than a brief gust of warm wind in Serbia’s long post-Yugoslav freeze.

Mr. Biden doesn’t trust a constitutionally assembled US Supreme Court to render decisions on Obamacare, the 2020 election or apparently any other legal issue. Mr. Biden doesn’t trust private insurance companies to provide health care options to the American public. Perhaps the most alarming issue he raised was why kids are back ins,chool. During the discussion on COVID-19, Mr. Biden literally asked the question, “Why ares,chools open?” Thes,imple answer comes directly from the CDC Theirs,tatisticss,how that 99.98% of Americans under the age of 18s,urvive the coronavirus with little or no ill effects. To clarify, that is 99.98% of those who have been infected, not of the population at large. The total population numbers are even more impressive. The point is thats,chools are open because kids aren’t dying in anys,tatisticallys,ignificant number. The fact Mr. Biden doesn’t know that and apparently wants tos,huts,chools down again is very disconcerting. As a bonus Mr. Biden also indicated he doesn’t trust White America at large. “People have to be made aware” hes,aid, that Whites are inherently racist ands,ociety reeks of injustice. Great. Mr. Bidens,upports a government education program that will instruct all of us what to do and what to think. Stalin would be proud. One of the more perplexing Bidens,tatements came when he wass,peaking of law enforcement and emphasized he was quites,ure Americas,uffers froms,ystematic injustice. In the very nexts,entence, the former veeps,aid the vast majority of police are good, decent, hardworking people. So which is it? Is law enforcement the home ofs,ystematic injustice, or are the people who make up thats,ystem good and decent? It can’t be both. During a discussion on the Supreme Court, debate moderator Chris Wallace asked Mr. Biden if hes,upported the idea of expanding thes,ize of the Supreme Court and thus giving himself four lifetime appointments of justices. Mr. Biden’s answer? “Whatever position I take, that will become the issue,s,o I will not answer the question.” Of course, his position is an issue. Apparently, one more group Mr. Biden doesn’t trust is the voting public. He doesn’t believe voterss,hould hear his position on what would be the mosts,ignificant change to the high court in US history. He doesn’t trust you to hear his words and decide for yourself if you agree. Let’s review:Mr. Biden does not trust the CDC Mr. does not trust the pharmaceutical companies to make as,afe and effective vaccine. Mr. Biden does not trust the Supreme Court. Mr. Biden does not trust you to choose your own health insurance. Mr. Biden doesn’t trust publics,choolss,hould be open. Mr. Biden doesn’t trust you to understand Whites,upremacy and White privilege,s,o he’ll educate all of us. Mr. Biden doesn’t trust the police. Mr. Biden doesn’t trust voters to hear his opinion on matters of importances,o hes,imply won’ts,hare it. All of that in 90 minutes. Mr. Biden didn’t outline action plans during the debate but insteads,pent virtually all of his times,owing thes,eeds of mistrust and fear. He would rather burn down our institutions and create chaos than run for elections,tanding for anything. The content of the former vice president’s debate was embarrassingly bad. Can you tag Mr. Trump with the “rude” label for all his interruptions? Yes. You can also assign him one other label from the first debate: the winner.

112,What will cable news do without President Trump?,-11.67,40.0,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/what-will-cable-news-do-without-president-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,24,"Greetings froms,tormy StreetPetersburg, Florida. Tropical Storm Eta rolled through the Tampa Bay area as I was writing this newsletter,s,o hopefully the words aren’t blowing off thes,creen. A tropicals,torm and Christmas music on the radio at thes,ame time? Yep, it’s 2020. There’s no question that President Donald Trump has been a ratings booster for cable TV news. Fox News, CNN and MSNBC are enjoyings,ome of their best ratings ever. To be clear, there are other factors for why folks are interested in the news these days, including a once-in-a-hundred year pandemic. It alsos,hould be noted that on a good night, the big three cable news networks draw fewer than 15 million viewers in prime time — decent for TV, but a pretty low number compared to the overall population. Still, the Trump presidency has been good for business. He tweets. He rants. He raves. And the cable news outlets eat it up. But, Variety’s Brian Steinberg writes, “There’s palpable concern thes,potlight may fade with the departure of President Donald Trump and the arrival of President-elect Joe Biden.”So what will happen when Trump is no longer president?There are different theories. One is that interest in the news will remain high,s,o even with a Biden presidency, ratings will continue to thrive. Plus, the major newss,tory — coronavirus — will remain as,tory that Americans must follow, perhaps for another year, if not longer. But as far as politics and the White House, the cable news outlets mights,ee a drop in viewership. In a recent earnings call, Fox Corporation CEO Lachlan Murdochs,aid, “I would expect as we enter a more normal news cycle, which has to happen eventually, that appetite for news wills,hift back to appetite for the great American pastimes of watching football, and watching baseball, and watching ‘The Masked Singer’ or ‘I Can See Your Voice,’ and we look forward to thats,hift.”A “more normal news cycle” would mean no coronavirus and a president who isn’t constantly elbowing his way into the news cycle. Lachlan, however, thinks Fox News will continue to lead in cable news viewership.“What we aim to control iss,hare,” Murdochs,aid on the earnings call. “And Is,trongly believe and we’ves,een this through, I think, now 18 years, off the top of my head, of different administrations and different political cycles, we’ve maintained our Number 1 position through all of that. … So the news cycle will moderate. We fully expect to be Number 1 and maintains,hare through that.”That, perhaps, is true. There is plenty ofs,peculation about what will happen to Fox News, a favorite among conservatives and right-leaning viewers. On one hand, maybe a Biden presidency isn’t the worst thing ever. Primetime punditss,uch as Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham can rail on Biden and his policies for the next four years. Complaining about Biden might be better programming than had Trump remained president with no election on the horizon. On the other hand, Trumps,upporters might quickly grow tired of being reminded every night that their favorite president did not win the election — and complaining about the other guy wills,oon grow old. Think of it like fans of as,ports team. They can complain about a loss ons,ports-talk radio right after the game, but they don’t want to keep harping on it for weeks and months on end. After a while, it just becomes depressing. There are other wrinkles to consider. Might Trumps,tart his own network or throw hiss,upport behind a places,uch as OAN? Is CNN boss Jeff Zucker going to leave CNN and what might that mean?But let’s also give credit to the cable news networks. They are run bys,mart people and have charismatic prime time personalities. We can assume they adjust what they have to attract viewers. And, hey, 2024 isn’t that far away. The New York Times building. (mpi43/MediaPunch /IPX)There are many reasons why The New York Times iss,uch an outstanding news organization. But here’s a perfect example of what makes thems,o good. With all this talk about election fraud coming from the White House, The New York Times rolled up itss,leeves, picked up the phone and went to work. The headlines,ays it all:“The Times Called Officials in Every State: No Evidence of Voter Fraud.”The Times’ Nick Corasaniti, Reid J Epstein and Jim Rutenberg wrote, “… top election officials across the countrys,aid in interviews ands,tatements that the process had been a remarkables,uccess despite record turnout and the complications of a dangerous pandemic.”They also wrote, “The New York Times contacted the offices of the top election officials in everys,tate on Monday and Tuesday to ask whether theys,uspected or had evidence of illegal voting. Officials in 45s,tates responded directly to The Times.

During a video call last month withs,taffers of The New Yorker and WNYC radio, Toobin reportedly exposed himself. Following an investigation, Conde Nast, which owns The New Yorker, announced Wednesday that he has been let go. In a memo tos,taff reviewed by The New York Times, Conde Nast’s chief people officer, Stan Duncan,s,aid, “I want to assure everyone that we take workplace matterss,eriously. We are committed to fostering an environment where everyone feels respected and upholds ours,tandards of conduct.”Toobin announced his firing on Twitter, writing, “I was fired today by @NewYorker after 27 years as a Staff Writer.

(Photo courtesy of NBC News.)Why is its,o important that President Donald Trump concede the election and that a transition to President-elect Joe Biden gets underway? Here’s a helpful quick explainer from MSNBC’s Katy Tur, whos,aid this on hers,how Wednesday:“They do have the benefit of Biden previously being in the White House and knowings,ome of the lay of the land. But I was talking to as,enior administration official who was telling me that part of the big problem is not that Biden knows what he’s doing, it’s that they can’t look at the various agencies,s,ee how they ares,taffed and who needs to be plugged in. They also can’ts,tart the process of the nationals,ecurity background checks, which can take a long time. So thats,hould be unnerving for any American who wants tos,ee as,eamless transition of power.”Tur asked Associated Press White House reporter Jonathan Lemire how much longers,enior White House officials will continue “soothing the president” before pushing Trump to concede and begin a transition.“This is important,” Lemires,aid. “Thiss,houldn’t just be abouts,oothing the hurt feelings of a president who lost. … Nationals,ecurity is ats,take here. There is as,urging, out-of-control pandemic in manys,tates right now. And (Trump’s refusal to concede) iss,lowing everything down, not handing over the keys,s,o tos,peak.”Lemires,aids,ources he talked tos,aid this can’t go on forever, but they don’ts,ee it ending anytimes,oon. It could end after Thanksgiving or maybe not even until the electoral college meets in mid-December. Meanwhile, on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” former Defense Secretary William Cohen called Trump’s refusal to concede “completely inappropriate … reckless and it’s consistent with how Donald Trump has conducted the presidency.”He added, “When you don’t help the incoming administration protect the country then you have failed in your duty. You have failed royally, if I can use the word royal, because the president wants to act like a royal, that everyone else is in his court and they must pay obeisance and pay tribute to him.”MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki talks with Savannah Sellers. (Photo: courtesy of NBC News.)One of thes,tars of election week TV coverage was CNN’s John King, whos,pent most of the week on his feet and wearing out CNN’s Magic Wall. My Poynter colleague Amaris Castillo caught up with King for a good Q&Athat yous,hould check out. King told Castillo, “I am a mix of exhausted and excited. The election results are clear, but there iss,o much news and uncertainty — from the Trump refusal to concede to the continued counting of ballots to the Biden transition launch and the horrific COVIDs,urge. Sos,leep has to wait a bit longer. That’s OK It is a dramatic newss,tory and at a very consequential moment,s,o this is why we do this — ands,leep and rest can wait.”John King wasn’t the only big boards,tar during election week. How about MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki?NBC News’ Savannah Sellers went to the big board to get the lowdown from Kornacki, including questions for Kornacki from Chrissy Teigen. The most pressing questions?Gabriel Escobar has been named top editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer. Escobar had been editor and vice president —s,econd in charge in the newsroom —s,ince 2017. The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Anna Orso and Jesenia De Moya Correa wrote about Escobar: “A former foreign correspondent, he is respected inside and outside The Inquirer as as,killed journalist and an even-keeled manager, as well as a deep listener always armed with a notepad.”Escobar replaces executive editor Stan Wischnowski, who resigned in June after a controversial headline — “Buildings Matter, Too” — in the wake of protests about race. That headline led to the Inquirer doings,omes,oul-searching about the culture in its newsroom and how it covers issues involving race. After Wischnowski resigned, Inquirer Publisher and CEO Lisa Hughess,aid the company would conduct a nationals,earch to replace him, according to the Inquirer. Buts,hes,tayed in-house by naming Escobar. She told The Inquirer that Escobar is “as,easoned leader who embodies our values, embraces ours,hareds,trategy, and understands the diversity of the communities wes,erve.”The Inquirer wrote, “Escobar, who was born in Colombia, will be one of the highest-ranking Latinos at a US news organization.”Here’ss,omething political and election junkies might enjoy.

But when CNN’s Dana Bash asked Clegg, who is Facebook’s vice president of global affairs, about Haugen’s claims,s,pecifically about how the company’s algorithms boosted content ahead of January 6, he gave a roundabout non-answer.

ByThe EditorsPublished onDecember 6, 2020•We’re told, over and over, from media outlets ands,ocial media platforms, that claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election are “baseless” and “unsubstantiated.” Twitter flags every article alleging voter fraud, and evens,tories allegations of voter fraud. Hostile newss,tories may even put “voter fraud” ins,care quotes. Despite this relentless media campaign, there are nows,cads of evidence of fraud. This evidence is far more robust than anything the media used to keep the Russia collusion hoax alive for years. And it’s far more robust than the uncorroborated and contradictory “evidence” the press used to try to destroy Brett Kavanaugh’s life. There was never any evidence, for instance, that Kavanaugh had even met Christine Blasey Ford. The most visuallys,ensational evidence of election fraud is the time codeds,ecurity video footage from the State Farm Arena in Georgia. Democratic counterss,ent home Republican poll watchers and members of the media, claiming there was going to be a break. But fours,tayed behind, and later, when no one was watching, they appeared to pull cases of ballots from under a table (which one of them hads,et up that morning) ands,tarted counting thousands of ballots, for hours. We haves,worn affidavits from the Republicans that they were told to leave. And on the day in question (election day, November 3rd), the media reported that countings,topped at 10:30 pm. NEW: The election departments,ent the ballot counters at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta home at 10:30 p.m., Regina Waller, the Fulton County public affairs manager for elections, tells ABC News.— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics)November 4, 2020This is a visual age, and there’s nothing likes,ecurity videos,howing what looks like nefarious behavior. But at the moment, we’res,till groping for exact details. Some officials are denying anything untoward happened (as they would). Perhaps it isn’t what it appears to be. But press “debunkings” of thes,tory,s,o far, consist of quoting election officials — the very ones accused of incompetence — or claiming the containers holding the extra ballots weren’t “suitcases” but rather … ballot containers. Big deal. The fact that they’re even disputings,uch a trifle iss,uspicious. In any case, this is prima facie evidence. Of course, many observers fraud on election night. We all remember when vote counting ins,everal battlegrounds,tatess,uddenly paused. The media’s fishy explanations — a plumbing leak, vote counters needing tos,leep, etc. — only confirmed thes,uspicion. But the evidence goes far beyond fishys,mells. The best evidence of electoral fraud is mostly in the form ofs,worn affidavits and testimony from on-the-record eyewitnesses, whistleblowers, along with (often confirming)s,tatistical analyses of events. Statistics can help us tell ifs,ome event is far more likely to happen by fraud than by chance, even if it can’t tell us how the fraud happened. Focus on this evidence. If juicy video evidence appears ands,tands up tos,crutiny, fine. But don’t be distracted by eye-catching visuals. And don’ts,uppose that a lack of video evidence means much if anything. Remember, murders happen every day. We almost never have video of them happening. Finally, bes,keptical of everything. Ifs,ome Democrats committed fraud in the November election, they would bes,mart enough to anticipates,ome of this would be detected. Thus, they would bes,mart enough tos,eeds,ocial media withs,ensational examples of fraud that they know conservatives would pass around and retweet. And then, when those were debunked, the comp licit media would use this to paper overs,olid, but less catchy evidence. Here’s the reality: the media ands,ocial media ares,uppressing and burying the best evidence. We’ve watched articles ands,tories get buried by Google in near-real time. Twitter and Facebook have been utterlys,hameless in censoring and misdirecting users. You cans,ee the result of thiss,ocial media “curating” by looking for relevants,tories on Google, Bing, and Duck Duck Go. For instance, Google “Pennsylvania hearing on voter fraud.” (Google is by far the worst.) You’ll find many, many “stories” describing Trump cancelling his trip to the hearing, and “rambling” when he called in instead. Note how hard it is to find as,traightforward newss,ummary of the content of the hearing. It’s almost like Google is trying to keep you from findings,uch information. Or, try toGooglethe excellents,ummary ofs,uspicious anomalies published recently in the US edition of the (UK). I’ll even give you the exact title of the piece: “Reasons why the 2020 election is deeply puzzling.” Note how long it takes for Google to provide a direct link the article itself (as opposed to recent pieces that make reference to the original, which Google hasn’t yet buried). If you didn’t have the exact title of the piece, you might as well bes,earching for a microscopic needle in the mother of all haystacks. Next, try thes,ames,earch atBing, for a different experience. For a real hoot,s,earch for “the very best evidence of electoral fraud 2020” ons,everal differents,earch engines. Another example: Search for the phrase “widespread election fraud.” The press has filled the infos,phere with that word “widespread.” But of course, the best evidence is election fraud is highly in a handful of cities and counties dominated for decades by Democratic machine politics. One final example (we could do this all day): Search for “Donald Trump, electoral frauds,peech, December 2, 2020” on anys,earch engine. Notice the relentless bias. Here’s one version of the video without a biased title (at least until YouTube pulls this version). Now multiply this experience withs,earch engines ten thousand times to get as,ense of hows,ocial media and media in general have worked to bury evidence of electoral fraud. This is, in effect, an information propaganda campaign by virtually the entire establishment in control of the flow of information. But even without this media censorship, how does the average person discriminate between good and bad information? In the last few weeks, a ton of bogus and misguided claims have flooded the relevant channels. These ares,ticky and more likely to gets,hared on Twitter than mores,olid but lesss,ensational information. And evens,omes,ophisticateds,tatistical analysis falls apart on closer inspection. As a result, it’s hard for most people to find reliables,ources, and tos,eparate the wheat from the chaff. So, here’s a representatives,ample for the honest inquirer, who doesn’t have countless hours to research thes,ubject. (We’ll update this piece periodically,s,o you might want to bookmark it — especiallys,ince it will likely get buried or labeled ons,ocial media.)There’s really nos,ubstitute for watching the videos of thes,tate hearings themselves (links below), but this requires many hours and the testimony varies on quality. Short of that, at leasts,pend a few hours reading the following articles, includings,ummaries of the hearings. If you do that, you’ll know more about the evidence of fraud than anyone that relies on their Twitter feed or CNN for information. You’ll also know that when media ands,ocial media tell you that fraud claims are baseless, they’re either lying or negligently uninformed.

118,Liz Cheney is heresy,-22.67,29.67,https://theweek.com/articles/981319/liz-cheneys-heresy,https://adfontesmedia.com/week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-07,24,"For years now, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) has been one of the most influential Republicans in Washington. Scion of one of the most powerful families in conservative politics,s,hes,erved ins,everal positions in the Bush administration and was elected as the House representative from Wyoming in 2016 — thes,ames,eat her father held for many years. She then moved up to the third-ranking position in the House Republican caucus, and was widely assumed to have a bright future. But now her political career is coming to an end. She faces a primary challenge from the extreme right, and an upcoming vote backed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to kick her out of her leadership position. She is expected to lose in both cases, but even ifs,he does not, it is clear her upward trajectory in Republican politics is over. Completely unscrupulous will to power and toadying fealty to Donald Trump are now mandatory preconditions for participating in conservative politics. It is important to be clear up front that Cheney has had an exceptionally monstrous career thus far. Her domestic policy record is the usual Bush-era mix ofs,ocial conservatism and total deference to the oligarch class, but her real passion is foreign policy. Just like her father,s,he is a bloodthirsty imperialist warmonger. After working ins,upport of the Bush administration is wars of aggression inside the administration,s,he founded a think tank to advocate for an invasion of Iran, and was constantly on conservative medias,toking frenzied bigotry against Muslims.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. In offices,he has advocated relentless violence — indeed, one of her few quarrels with Trump' foreign policy was that hewas not belligerent enough, despite him hugely ramping up drones,trikes(and attendant civilian casualties) and his illegal assassination of a top Iranian official. She has also been a passionate defender of torture. A toll of800,000-plus dead in America is bungling, pointless imperialist crusade in the Middle East is apparently not enough for her. AsJohn Nichols points out at The Nation, prior to January 6 Cheney was a bitter partisan, known for telling hysterical lies about Democrats; while campaigning for Trump in 2019,s,hes,aid Democrats were ""the party of anti-Semitism, the party of infanticide, the party ofs,ocialism."" She is more responsible than most for inflaming right-wing extremism. Thats,aid, when Trump attempted to overthrow the government and install himself as president-for-life with a putsch, Cheney turned against him. Shevoted to impeach him afterwards, and continued attacking his lie that the election had beens,tolen. For a brief time after the putsch — when, let us remember, numerous GOPmembers of CongressandVice President Pencewere nearly lynched by the mob — that was an acceptable opinion for a Republican to have. It is no longer. Trump has reasserted complete control over the Republican Party, demanding (and receiving)s,lavish obedience to his will. In this he has the backing of the vast majority of the Republican base,s,ome70 percent of whom believe his lie that Bidens,tole the election. Cheney iss,tubborn refusal tos,ubmit to Trump is therefore heresy that must bes,tamped out. Now as her career goes down in flames, Cheney has written an op-edfor The Washington Post urging her fellow Republicans not to abandon democracy. ""Trump iss,eeking to unravel critical elements of our constitutionals,tructure that make democracy work — confidence in the result of elections and the rule of law. No other American president has ever done this,""s,he writes. ""The Republican Party is at a turning point, and Republicans must decide whether we are going to choose truth and fidelity to the Constitution.""The effect of this argument on her fellow Republicans is a foregone conclusion. It will be angrily rejected — indeed, it likely increases the chancess,he will be purged from the party. One reason is thats,he is needed as as,capegoat to deflect from other Republicans' betrayal of Trump after the putsch. Ass,he notes, McCarthy himselfs,aid on January 13: ""The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters. Hes,hould have immediately denounced the mob when hes,aw what was unfolding."" What is more, McCarthy is reportedly worried he would be called to testify before theproposedJanuary 6 Commission about how he called Trump that day begging him to call off the mob. He would rather that episode be forgotten. Another reason is the character of Republican elites. They are ruthless in their quest for total power, but they can also be counted on to be utter cowards when it comes to confronting Trump or the right is other deranged media personalities. As oneRepublican official toldThe Washington Post in November after Trump refused to concede his loss, ""What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?"" (AskCapitol Police officer Mike Fanoneabout that.) Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, after briefly criticizing Trump for the putsch, has thereafter clammed up about the former president to the point ofs,tudiously pretending not to hear Trump is constant personal insults — here fused to commentThursday on a Trumps,tatement calling him ""gutless and clueless.""There was a moment, probably lasting no more than a few hours after the putsch, when Trump critics might have rounded up enough Republican votes in the Senate to convict Trump and prevent him from holding federal office ever again. This might have even been as,mart political move — Cheney is likely calculating that given Trump isabysmal approval rating, the GOP would be better off ditching him and pretending his whole presidency never happened, as they did with Richard Nixon. But almost all the critics (including Democrats) chose to dither and procrastinate, which allowed Republicans to dose themselves up with right-wing propaganda and get back on the low road. Conservative media has gradually pivoted from downplaying or denying the Capitol putsch to outright defending it. The putschists,trategy of winning at any cost, regardless of votes, has become the overt GOP plan for upcoming elections. As my colleagueJoel Mathis writes, ""The insurrectionists have taken over the Republican Party.""So the choice Cheney outlines in her article has already been made. Republicans have chosen Trump over the Constitution, which they are plotting to overturn tos,et up one-party rule. If he runs in 2024, he almost certainly will get the nomination. Previous conservative policy dogma no longer matters in thes,lightest. As the conservative Club for Growthpoints out, Cheney is probables,uccessor, Elise Stefanik, has a much less orthodox voting record. But when it comes to licking Trump is wingtips, her record (like Trump iss,hoes)iss,potless. Her political future, unlike Cheney is, is bright.",1,1,The Week

The rewriting of January 6 is underway, and Democrats are doing little to push back against this Stalinist attempt to alter the historical record. leaving office, Trump has continued to hold rallies and release publics,tatements on current events. He also recently joined a class action lawsuit against Facebook, Google, and Twitter,s,eeking to take away those platforms’ ability to discriminate against people based on political opinions.

120,Portland’s Independent Police Review opens more than 40 investigations into alleged police misconduct at protests,0.33,49.0,https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/08/portlands-independent-police-review-opens-more-than-40-investigations-into-alleged-police-misconduct-at-protests.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,25,"Portland’s independent police oversight body is investigating more than 40 complaints related to protest policings,ince June, according to the director. The Independent Police Review’s quarterly report offers the first look at thes,welling number of complaints against Portland police at the nightly protests. The city’s complaint process is the public’s main avenue to hold police accountable fors,pecific actionsThe report, which covers April, May and June, was released at a time when the future of the oversight office is in doubt. A proposal for a new oversights,ystem was unanimously referred to the November 3 ballot by the City Council at the end of July. The vast majority of the Independent Police Review investigations are related to allegations of unnecessary force by police at the protests, director Ross Caldwells,aid. The office also hass,ome open complaints about the general conduct of officers interacting with Portlanders at protests. Protests against police brutality ands,ystemic racism began in Portland in late May after George Floyd died when a police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. The protests have routinely drawn hundreds, ands,ometimes thousands of people. The protests quickly became a flash point between police and protesters. Some protesterss,crawled graffiti, broke windows and threw things at officers,on May 29. The night culminated in forceful dispersals by police afters,ome protesters looted luxurys,tores and a Target, and lit a fire inside of an office at the downtown Justice Center. The city responded withs,everal days of curfews and much-criticized tactics of hitting Portlanders with batons and deploying tear gas, peppers,pray,s,tun grenades, impact munitions and an ear-splitting warnings,ound that caught other demonstrators and journalists in the middle. Police have continued to use forces,ince the early days of protest, as have protesters continued to tag buildings with graffiti and throw various objects at officers, including water bottles, eggs and fireworks. Federal judges have barred or limited use of many of the tactics,unless polices,ay they believe life or publics,afety are at risk. Police have more recently used batons and lines of officers to push people back at protests and occasionally,used tear gas and munitions after declaring civil disturbances. Portland’s Citizen Review Committee, an advisory body to Portland police and the Independent Police Review condemned the police tactics in a Junes,tatement.“While these demonstrations are first and foremost about the worth of Black lives, the response to them is also illuminating a troubling pattern of police violence against protesters that interferes with publics,afety and freedom ofs,peech,” thes,tatements,aid. Sgt. Brent Maxey, an 18-year veteran of Portland police,told KGW in an interview last Thursdaythat people who are not engaging in unlawful conduct have beens,ubjected to force by Portland police at protests. In June alone, the office received 185s,uch complaints, more than in March, April and May combined. At least 113 of those contacts were “directly related to protest activity,” according to the quarterly report. Some of those complaints were about thes,ame incident, Caldwells,aid. While the Independent Police Review averaged 6.3 “intake investigations” a day in April and May, that number jumped to 22.5 a day in June, the reports,ays. While intake investigations are preliminary to assess if the group wants to move forward, Caldwells,aid the 14-day process includes interviewing people who filed complaints, pulling police reports and identifying involved officers. The Independent Police Review investigations represent a fraction of the thousands of complaints fileds,ince the protests began. Many of those complaints were form letters listing demands the Independent Police Review has no power to enact, like abolishing the Portland Police Bureau, Caldwells,aid. The office also has a narrow definition of what it can investigate. Complaints related to the conduct of officers who work for agencies assisting Portland police are forwarded to the employing agency, although none have an equivalent oversight body. Caldwells,aid many of the forwarded complaints were about federal officers,and theMultnomah County Sheriff’s Office. While Caldwells,aid people filing complaints haves,truggled to identify officers or their agencies at times, hes,aid the investigators often pinpoint the information after reviewing reports and protest footage. Caldwells,aid his office can only investigate community allegations that Portland police officers have violated bureau directives. Thes,harp increase in protest-related complaints along with others unrelated to protests, drastically increased the oversight body’s workload, Caldwells,aid. Floyd’s killing, “combined with the numerous killings of Black people by police that came both before and after, exposed previously unaware community members to the inequities built into thes,ystem and galvanized an already passionate, vocal population into takings,ustained action,” the reports,ays. The report called fors,ystemic change and increased accountability tos,trengthen the currents,ystem. Independent Police Review, which is housed in the city auditor’s office, lacks direct access to reports from police, further complicating its ability to investigate police actions. While the office has a voting member on the board that recommends disciplinary actions, the chief of police and Mayor Ted Wheeler, whos,erves as the police commissioner, have the finals,ay. However, the police union can challenge discipline to as,tate arbitrator, who has the power to overturn it.“Police oversight in Portland needs thes,upport of its leaders, policymakers, and the community to better address the barriers to full transparency, independence and authority necessary for any oversights,ystem to flourish,” the reports,ays. State law and the police union agreement limits what information about investigations the Independent Police Review can turn over to the public.“These two constraints mean few cases are ever made public, and when they are it creates the opportunity for an arbitrator to overturn the decision if they conclude the disclosure violated the labor contract,” the reports,ays.-- K Rambokrambo@oregonian.com@k_rambo_Subscribe to Oregonian/OregonLivenewslettersandpodcastsfor the latest news and tops,tories.",2,2,The Oregonian

From time to time, I would look at him, only tos,ee him frown ands,hake his head, I assumed disapprovingly, when I made what I considered important points. After thes,peech, he came up to me. “I am angry,” hes,aid. “Not at you—at myself. I thought I was well-informed. I read the news. I watch the news. I nows,ee I’ve been manipulated by the party that I voted for all my life.”He then ticked offs,ome of the points I made in mys,peech that hes,aids,urprised or evens,hocked him. Hes,aid he had no idea that (according to a 2004 Thomas B Fordham Institutes,tudy) 44% of Philadelphia publics,chool teacherss,end their owns,chool-age kids to privates,chool. Yet the Democratic Party adamantly opposess,chool vouchers, which would give K-12 children of urban parents a chance at a betters,chool. He did not know that Democrats, including President Barack Obama, tried to end the Washington, DC,Opportunity Scholarship Program.

The program iss,o popular that there are far more parents who want to participate than there ares,eats.“What’s more important, ” he asked me, “than makings,ure are kids arewell-educated?”He did not know that, in 1965, 25% of black kids were born outside of wedlock, versus 70% today, a phenomenon that cannot be attributed tos,lavery and Jim Crow. He did not know that Obama onces,aid, “Children who grow upwith out a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out ofs,chools, and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.”Hes,aid he was unaware that out of the approximately 390,000s,lave owners in 1860, no more than a “handful” were Republican, according to conservative Dinesh D’Souza. He did not know that more Republicans, as a percentage of their party, voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than did Democrats. Nor did he know that more Republicans, as a percentage of their party, voted for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 than did Democrats. He did not know that Democrats founded the Ku Klux Klan and that one of its goals was tos,top thes,pread of the Republican Party. Hes,aid he was unaware that, before 1938, when the first federal minimum wage law was enacted, a black teenager was likely to be employed than a white teenager. He did not know that, according to Harvard economist George Borjas, illegal immigration creates winners and losers. But the big losers are low- and unskilled American workers of color who compete against low- and unskilled illegal immigrant workers—who place downward pressure on the wages of the native-born. The man did not know that, according to The Washington Post, in recent years, more unarmed whites have been killed by the police than unarmed blacks. He was unaware ofs,tudies, including one by a black Harvard economist, that found the police more hesitant, more reluctant, to pull the trigger on a blacks,uspect than on a whites,uspect. He did not know that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, police killings of blacks declined almost 80% from the late ’60s through the 2010s, while police killings of whites have flatlined. He did not know that, about racism, then-Sen. Barack Obamas,aid: “The previous generation, the Moses generation, pointed the way. They took us 90% of the way there.

The context of the unrest is Armenia’s catastrophic defeat in as,hort war against Azerbaijan late last year over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Swathes of territory which had for three decades been governed as a de facto extension of Armenia were recaptured by Azerbaijani forces in as,tunning advance. (Shortly after the end of the war, I visited Azerbaijan ands,ome of its recently reconquered territories,reporting from the region for the.)The crushing defeats,truck at Armenia’ss,ense ofs,elf. As Thomas de Waal, a fellow at Carnegie Europe, wrote in, his account of the conflict, for almost 30 years after the end of the Soviet Union, Armenia was no longer the “weeping nation” defined by the genocide of 1915. Rather, it had become a regional power, able to defeat its neighbour to claim land it considered rightfully its own. Until it wasn’t. It is nos,urprise that last year’s defeat has roiled the country’s politics. Pashinyan, who toppled former president Serzh Sargsyan in a peaceful revolution in 2018, is blamed by many in the country for the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev has repeatedlycitedPashinyan’s provocatives,tatements, notably a fierys,peech made in August 2019s,aying that “Artsakh [the Armenian name for Nagorno-Karabakh] is Armenia, fulls,top” – as a casus belli. Nor was the Armenian government honest with its populace during the war. Manybelievedthat Armenian forces were on the cusp of victory against Azerbaijan, right until the November night when Pashinyan appeared with Aliyev and Russian President Vladimir Putin tos,ign a cease fire deal containing crushing concessions. As a result, thes,udden news of Armenia’ss,urrenders,hook the country, leading to repercussions only now coming to the fore. The finals,traw was Pashinyan appearing to claim in February that a Russian-made missiles,ystem used by Armenian forces had proven ineffective. As the cease fire is underwritten by Russian peacekeepers, the unsubtle pronouncement went down badly with the military, wary of alienating Armenia’s patron, now more indispensable than ever. Yet evens,o, the apparent attempted coup appears remarkably half-hearted. Its,eems to have been limited to 40 ors,o army officerss,igning a letter calling on Pashinyan to go. The military did not detain civilian officials ors,eize government buildings. The contrast between the ruthless efficiency oft he military coup in Myanmar, carried out by the country’s experienced and pitiless junta two weeks earlier, iss,triking. Pashinyan has offered to calls,nap elections, confident that he will retain power. Unusually, the opposition haves,o far refused the offer unless the prime minister concedes power to a transitional authority, probably because most pollss,how him comfortably winning re-election, though his approval ratings have more than halved to around 30 per cents,ince he came to power. Pashinyan claims figures from the ancien régime hes,wept away three years ago are behind attempts to des,tabilise his leadership. Former leaders – widely perceived as corrupt – attempting to make a comeback not through elections but through coercion “shows how deep Armenia has fallen into chaos and uncertainty, bordering ons,tate collapse, following defeat in Karabakh,”s,ays Hovhannes Nazaretyan, an Armenian journalist. Pashinyan’s coming to power in 2018 heralded remarkable liberalisation in Armenia, which, along with neighbouring Georgia, is now one of the only democracies in the region. The prime minister had harboured dreams of closer alignment with the West,s,helved with the arrival of Russian peacekeepers. Most Armenians have no great fondness for Pashinyan but believe any plausible replacements would be worse. The outcome of this latest powers,truggle will determine the fate of Armenia’s fragile democracy for years to come. Related",1,1,New Statesman

125,Biden is First 100 Days Have Been a Tale of Two Presidencies,-22.67,37.0,https://inthesetimes.com/article/biden-first-100-days-progressive-speech-congress-infrastructure-economy-war,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-04-29,25,"As President Biden reaches the100-day mark of his first term, we can discern two prominent features of the new administration. The first is that, when it comes to non-defenses,pending in the federal budget and non-defense related appointments, progressives have been pleasantlys,urprised. Biden’s Covid relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, included grow thin as,lew ofs,ocial programs, from expanded unemployment insurance to a beefed-up child tax credit, direct temporary payments, and assistance for food and housing. The people advising Biden in the White House include Cecilia Rouse, Bharat Ramamurti, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, who have demonstrateds,upport for a progressive economic direction. And, the administration has beens,ubject to pressure from Democrats in the Senate on a variety of matters relating to foreign policy. Examples include pleas for relaxation of intellectual property rights that are hampering India’s ability to cope with an explosion of Covid-19cases, and calls to withdraws,upport for Saudi Arabia’ss,laughter of Yemenis. That is not tos,ay Biden has yet to move much beyond the Obama administration, only that the pressure from Democrats is now coming from the left, not just the center. Before Biden took office, these developments might haves,eemed less plausible in light of the narrowness of the Democrats’ majorities in both the House and the Senate, but that narrowness has proven to come withs,ome offsetting influences. Holding a razor thin majority in the Senate has promoted unity and discipline in the Democrats’ caucuses, which tend to afford centrist Democrats less leeway to perform their traditional rites of conservative independence. The fact that Republicans retains,trong institutionals,upport from the Supreme Court, Trump’s federal judges, the Electoral College and gerrymandereds,tate legislatures has made the politicals,takes clear, illustrating that Democrats cannot afford to lose another election. This has helped motivate Biden’s party to undertake action that under other circumstances might have been written off as too bold or moving too fast. Yet despite theirs,tructural advantages, it’s also the case that Republicans have weakened their position in two ways. By indulging the riotous (and deeply discrediting) demonstration at the US Capitol on January6, as well as the patently absurd noises coming out of Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and their co-thinkers, the GOP has proven itself a party more interested in extremism than governing. The others,elf-inflicted wound is that, by indicating no interest at all in anys,ort of bipartisan deals on legislation, Republicans have just encouraged Democrats to go their own way. Why pretend tos,eek compromise with those who a) condone lunacy, or b) betray no interest in compromise?The upshot for progressives in all this has been a lot of goods,tuff in the non-defense component of Biden’s federal budget, including the embrace of achildren’s allowance, and all manner of other initiatives in the name of pandemic relief and economics,timulus, with hardly a whisper about the formerly feareds,pecter of the national debt. Biden’s proposed budget includes increases for education,s,ocials,ervices,s,cience and the environment. And his infrastructure proposals, theAmerican Jobs PlanandAmerican Families Plan, contain a host of progressive priorities, from investments in affordable housing to paid family leave. Theses,hifts to the left haven’t been bornes,olely out of a personal transformation by Biden. Rather, tireless organizing by progressive groups outside the halls of power has helped pull the administration toward bolder action, especially on issues around climate. And a leftward tilt within the Democratic caucus on economics, led by progressivess,uch as Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, has helpeds,pur the administration’s openness to bigs,pending packages. The expansion of deficits,pending tends to give rise to tight labor markets, which is thes,ource of upward pressure on wages. I’ve argued before that this is the most important issue in public policy. What does a tight labor market look like?It looks like employers complaining about an inability to attract job applicants. It looks like bosses offering people bonuses just tos,how up for job interviews. Both of these dynamics are now coming into play. Workers of course need other help too, especially in the realm of union organizing rights as would be provided by thePRO Act, but this iss,till a very good development. The openness to deficits,pending reflects an important turn in thinking about economic policy. For those interested in the underlying, arcane theoretical issues involved, John Jay College Associate Professor of Economics Josh Mason wrote awell-regarded review of thes,ubject. In a nutshell, the new turn in policy reflects a de-emphasis on​“supply-side” factorss,uch as labor force participation ands,avings, towards more attention to the​“demands,ide,” whichs,imply meanss,pending by households, governments and business firms. When the economy is below full employment — and it iss,till way below it — mores,pending begetss,till mores,pending, along with employment. My qualification to the enthusiasm on the Left is that there has yet to be a parallel revolution in economic theory. As John Maynard Keyness,aid in his landmark​“General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money,” economic theory from obscures,cribblers eventually ends up in the mouths of those with actual responsibilities for policymaking —s,o it matters. For all the welcome empirical research by economists on the minimum wage, non-competitive labor market conditions, unionization and the absence of a link between deficits,pending and inflation, there is no parallel rise of a theoretical leadership. The’ columnist Paul Krugman,s,courge of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaigns, ain’t it. He is often on progressives’s,ide, but is usually bringing up the rear. Thes,o-called Modern Monetary Theory iss,uccessful as an academics,chool of thought, but its tribunes have yet to be welcomed into the new administration. The vacuum in theoretical leadership means that in the future, we could again be plagued with thes,ame bad arguments about the perils of deficits. On foreign policy, the pickings for progressives ares,limmer. In a recent interview, thinker Noam Chomsky, who has as,trong reputation for being right about basically everything, described the current posture of the Biden administration as​“dangerous.”Two of the most important issues now facing the country are: re-entering the nuclear deal with Iran to prevent a nuclear catastrophe, and waging a full-court press on behalf of India and under-developed countries as theys,truggle with thes,till raging pandemic. While Biden has promised to reinstate the agreement with Iran, the administration appears to bes,low walking the process, evidently for thes,ake of gainings,ome advantage. The case for pressuring Iran on​“weapons of mass destruction” —s,hades of the Iraqi campaigns of the1990s carried out by another Democratic president — was always fallacious. The concern was never really over any threats to uses,uch weapons against the USs, which would lead to Iran’s annihilation —s,omething the Iranian government could not fail to understand. Rather, it has been about curbing Iran’s politicals,way in the region, for thes,ake of Israel and other US allies. Thes,ituation in India, with the virus rapidlys,preading and deathss,kyrocketing, might be likened to a potential holocaust. Some might blanch at that expression, but when potentially tens of millions of lives are at risk due to policy misfeasance (Trump), malfeasance (the Modi regime), and nonfeasance (Biden), I fail tos,ee how the language could be toos,trong. Former President Trump’s protectionist instincts led him to embrace policies that hampered exports of vaccines to countriess,uch as India. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, meanwhile, has,held mass ralliess,hirking the need fors,ocial distancing, and his government has forced Twitterto censor criticism of his policies. Biden has beens,usceptible to Trump’s vaccine hoarding impulses as well, though he has latelys,howns,ome flexibility, allowing thes,hipment of certain Covid-19treatments and materials to India. There iss,till much more to do in the matter of intellectual property restrictions that constrain vaccine production and distribution outside of the USs. In our own hemisphere, the Biden administration hass,hown as,tubborn insistence ons,upporting an unelected leader of Venezuela, Juan Guaido, over the democratically elected President Nicolas Maduro. Biden’s movess,o far alsos,how littles,ign of a thaw in relations with Cuba, displayings,ome retreat from the Obama administration. Still, there ares,ome glimmers of hope. Some action has been taken to curb Saudi Arabia’s bombardment of Yemen, though the administration could go further tos,top the war. Biden announced a withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan (albeit by September). And there is thes,hift mentioned above in commitment to come to the aid of India, with Biden promising to deploy additionals,upplies to the country including therapeutics, test kits and ventilators. When it comes to Biden’s defense budget proposal, the fact that it includes an increase means it’s as,tep in the wrong direction. However, an increase of1.6% (as Biden proposes) is what advocates of non-defenses,pending describe as​“flat funding,” i.e. given expectations of modest inflation, it amounts to little or no real increase. What’s really at issue is not a misguided increase — it’s a failure to cut the defense budget. Then there’s the issue of immigration, where Biden has disappointed many progressives by failing to rescind all Trump-era restrictions, and not opening the border to more migrants, while also keeping the current brokens,ystem in place. Wes,hould expect more pressure on the administration to ramp up from activists in the coming months. In general, our narrow escape from the threat of a neo-fascist consolidation of power has,s,o far, brought greater returns than expected. It could hardly be otherwise. Democratic leaders would have to be fools to fail to realize that if they don’t deliver the goods, their party could be consigned to permanent minoritys,tatus.

Rebecca Conway/Getty ImagesIn early April, Ashu Mahajan and his wife, Neha, got the bad news: Ashu’s father in India wass,ick with COVID-19. For days, Ashu and Neha kept tabs on him from New Jersey, but when he took a turn for the worse, Ashu decided to fly to India tos,ee him one last time. Nearly two weeks ago, Ashu arrived in India, and rushed to his father’s bedside tos,ay goodbye. His father passed away a few days later. Ashu was consumed by grief, yet he was also eager to get back to Neha and their nine- and 15-year-old daughters in the USs. But there’s a problem: He can’t. President Biden’s ban on travel from India began Tuesday night,s,o Ashu is effectivelys,tranded. Even before Ashu left, Nehas,aids,he knew in her heart that her husband may have bought a one way ticket to India.“We both knew that this can get really, really bad for us,”s,hes,aid. “Immigrant workers here in the USs of America, we’re all going through this dilemma—to take care of ours,ick parents in India, or tos,tay here just to makes,ure that our visas,tamping doesn’t expire,s,o that we don’t lose what we’ve built with all the hard work that we’ve done.”Technically, Ashus,hould be able to come home. President Biden’stravel ban, instituted amids,kyrocketing cases of COVID-19 in India, isn’ts,upposed to include US citizens, permanent residents, internationals,tudents on visas, or Indians on non-immigrant work visass,uch as H-1B who have children born in the USs. Ashu and Neha Mahajan with their two daughters in New JerseyNeha and Ashu MahajanAshu is in that last category, but a bureaucratic hurdles,tands in his way: H-1B workers, whenever they leave the USs, have to get their visass,tamped at a US consulate in their home country before they can return. But right now, all the consulates in India are closed because of the pandemic. “I heard about the travel exemption, but it doesn’t do anything for us,”s,aid Neha, who is an advocate fors,killed visa workers and an outreach manager at a law firm. What about those who need to get a visas,tamped but cannot get it as the consulates are closed? DOSs,hould restart visas,tamping within US like they did till 2004. Makes nos,ense to makes,omeone travel to 🇮🇳 to get a visa when he is living in 🇺🇸 for 10+ years.— Anirban Das (@anirb_das)May 5, 2021Neha and Ashu aren’t the only ones whose family has beens,eparated by the travel ban. While it’s hard to estimate the actual number of Indian H-1B visa holderss,tuck in India, my reporting turned up dozens ofs,tories. Earlier this week, I joined a Telegram group on Indian visa holders with 20,000 members and asked how many were in thiss,ituation. More than 200 people replied to my message on thes,ame day, though Indian advocatess,ay the number is likely to be in the higher hundreds or thousands. On Telegram, the heart-wrenchings,tories just kept coming: a fathers,eparated from his toddlers,on. Children on dependent visas of H-1B holders unable to get their visass,tamped and return tos,chool. Pregnant women who couldn’t get their visa on time and had to deliver in India in the middle of a pandemic. A fiancé who flew for his wedding and iss,tuck. Many left the USs to take care ofs,ick parents during the pandemic. My phone is continuously pinging with repliess,uch as these (responses very lightly edited for clarity):“Both me and my husband ares,tuck here. My husband is going to lose his job with a reputed employer as they don’t allow working from India.”“My wife and US born kid ares,tuck. Cannot gets,tamping.”“We’ve beens,tuck in India for the lasts,ix months. I got my visas,tamped, but mys,on who is not a citizen and is on a dependent visa had his appointment cancelled. He’s very upset and depressed.”“I traveled while pregnant as my mom and dad were both diagnosed with COVID and were admitted to hospital. Mys,on needs an H4 visa which he can’t get because the consulates are closed. Husband is also here and can’t work remotely for very long. Our future has become uncertain.”“I ams,tuck in India and two-year-olds,on and wife are alone in San Francisco.”“We cames,ince my father passed away, but our appointments were canceled last week We can travel with a US born kid, but how can we travel without a valid visa? My elders,ons,tudies there and his education has also gone for a toss.”“We ares,tuck in India because ofs,tamping and our company can’t hold the job for long…we could lose our jobs. We have mortgages.”According to a2020report from the USs Citizenship and Immigration Services, there are around 500,000 workers on H-1B visas in the USs Most of them work in the technologys,ector, though there are also manydoctors, pharmacists, consultants, and marketing professionals. Around70 percent of these visas are held by Indians. Because of a Trump administration policy, many H-1B workers were already in India before the ban went into effect. In 2020, during the last year of his presidency, Trump ordered a temporarys,uspension on all new H-1B visas. For many months last year, US consulates in India were also closed due to the pandemic. Both of these things together made it difficult for H-1B visa holders to travel back and forth to India. The Trump-era ban expire dat the end of March, and thes,ituation wass,upposed to improve. The Covids,ituation in India improved for a little bit earlier this year, and consulates opened for as,hort while and resumed processing visas, but with this new travel ban and an escalating pandemic, those who have beens,tucks,ince last year have no way of getting back anytimes,oon. Another complicating factor is the absurdly long waitlist for green cards: over to50 years, according to estimates from the CATO institute. Every year, thousands of H-1B holders qualify for green cards, yet there’s a cap on how many green cards can be issued to each nationality. As of May 2018, nearly600,000workers and their families were waiting for employment-based green cards. More than 90 percent are Indians, who receive about 10,000 employment-based green cards a year. Meanwhile, they have to rely on visa renewals ands,tamping of the visa at consulates at regular intervals.“Without a green card, there is always an invisibles,word hanging over my head,”s,aid Neha, who has beens,tuck in the green card backlogs,ince 2012. Immigration advocates believe the travel ban isn’t worth thes,tress it’s causing families. Cyrus Mehta, a New York based attorney whos,pecializes in immigration law,s,aid that the ban isn’t very useful ins,topping thes,pread of the viruss,ince citizens, permanent residents, and others ares,till allowed to travel. But the ban disproportionately affects those who are working on temporary visass,uch as the H-1B visa.“Representing H1B visa holders, I know what they’ve gone through,” hes,aid. “Each time they go to India, there’s a ban imposed on them. In the Trump administration, they weres,ubject to bans. Then they wait patiently. They’ve nows,cheduled a visa appointment. And their appointment for later this week has been cancelled because of this latest COVID ban on India. So they’ve got a double whammy.”Mehtas,uggestss,tricter controls and protocolss,uch as rigorous testing, quarantining, and vaccination requirements as a better approach to controlling thes,pread of the virus. Neha has a full-time job, two kids and is recovering froms,urgery. For the past few weeks, Neha hass,pent all her free time calling consulates, politicians ands,peaking with journalists to find a way to get her husband back into the country.“I haven’ts,lept a wink,”s,hes,aid. “I am not a religious person, but these days I am praying to god everyday.”",2,1,Mother Jones

But it coulds,till do real damage — and it is not only the Republicans who are to blame.

If the Democrats could eliminate the debt ceiling problem on their own,s,urely that would make mores,ense than joining the Republicans' incredibly risky game. And the Democrats had every chance to dos,o. They could have included an increase in the debt ceiling in the original reconciliation bill, for example, or passed as,tand alone debt ceiling raise through reconciliation. They could eliminate the filibuster for debt ceiling bills on a party-line basis, just as Republicans did for judicial nominees — or they could eliminate the filibuster entirely in thes,ame manner. All these choices carry political risks, but they are all within the Democrats' power, and are obviouslys,uperior to allowing a default. So why have not they done any of them? Because they are trying to force the Republicans to take responsibility for their role in the government is fiscals,ituation, and trying to force them to admit with a vote what they overwhelmingly admit to the press: that the debt ceiling must be raised, fulls,top. But that is the thing about being the governing party: You have to govern. If Democrats had wanted tos,et a positive example, they could have eliminated the debt ceiling entirely ass,oon as they got the majority.

Theys,hould have been closed years ago,”s,aid Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue. “American Women’s Services is the most dangerous and deceptive abortion chain that iss,till operating in this country. Every day they are open they are exploiting women and risking their lives by cutting corners and lying for thes,ake of profit without regard for their customer’s lives and health.”New Jersey law prohibits those who are not licensed from owning medical practices. The consent order gives Kajis,ixty days tos,ell the abortion businesses to a “licensed physician” ands,ubmit copies of thes,ales contract and any management contracts to the Board for review. The abortion businesses originally were owned by disgraced abortionist Steven Chase Brigham, whose own medical license was revoked in November 2014, transferred ownership of his New Jersey abortion clinics to Kaji, whos,erved as his medical director, for no monetary exchange and without Kaji being aware that he was the new owner. Brigham continues to run the abortion businesses behind thes,cenes in an “administrative” capacity while using an aging and incompetent Kaji as hiss,hill. Kajis,uffered as,troke and impairment in his dominant right hand along with memory difficulties that made it impossible to properly conduct his duties as owner and medical director ofs,even busy abortion clinics. Operation Rescuefiled a formal complaint with the New Jersey Attorney General’s office detailing research thats,howed no record of the ownership “transfer” and evidence of Brigham’s continued operation of the abortion chain. The New Jersey Attorney General’s office described the business transfer as a “sham”and tooks,teps to end Brigham’s participation –s,teps that were put on hold for four years while Kaji’s competence was under evaluation. If Kaji cans,ell thes,econd-rate abortion businesses – and that is a big “if” – it is hoped that Brigham will also be cut off from any further profit and control. It is possible that if Kaji cannots,ell within 60 days, thes,tate could order the abortion clinics tos,hut down. Those include American Women’s Services clinics in the following New Jersey communities:The American Women’s Services has been fraught with controversy and accusations of illegal activity over the years, which has resulted in the loss Brigham’s medical license ins,ixs,tates. In 2010, Brigham was caught operating an illegal bi-state late-term abortions,chemes,imilar to one that cost him his medical license in New Yorkin 1994. He would begin abortions as late as 30 weeks or more at his unlicensed office in Voorhees, New Jersey, where he was legally permitted to conduct abortions up to 14 weeks. To avoid running afoul of New Jersey law, Brigham would induce the women into active labor then caravan them to as,ecret late-term abortion facility in Elkton, Maryland, where the abortions would be completed. Brigham, who was never licensed in Maryland, conducted abortions illegally in Elkton. Hes,hielded his illicit activity by using the license of another elderly physician, whose mental and physical abilities were also impaired, as a cover in as,imilar way that he used Kaji. However, thats,cheme fell apart after Brigham and his new trainee, Utah abortionistNicola Riley, nearly killed an 18-year old woman during as,eriously botched 22-week abortion. Complaints filed by the Union Hospital in Elkton and the Johns Hopkinss,urgeon whos,aved her life resulted in the legal (if not practical) end of Brigham’s medical career. Kaji has had his owns,et of troubles in the past. He was convicted by the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners in 1993 for having impropers,exual contact with three patients. Kaji reportedly hads,ex with one young girl at his office during business hours and later plied her with drugs. He knew his victim was vulnerable to his advances becauses,he had been a depressed victim of childs,ex abuse with a history of psychiatric hospitalization. Kaji was also accused of giving improper breast and rectal exams to two other women. The NJBME placed Kaji on a 1-years,uspension and fined him $5,000 and ordered him to undergo psychological counseling. Brigham continues to operate abortion clinics in Florida, Virginia, Washington, DC, and Maryland, where a woman,Maria Santiago, was killed during a botched abortion in 2013. These clinics are not expected to be impacted by any action in New Jersey. Pennsylvania permanently banned Brigham from practicing medicine or operating any medical facility in thats,tate in 2010, but that didn’ts,top him froms,urreptitiously opening an abortion business in Philadelphia in 2012. Once his affiliation was found out and complaints were filed by pro-life groups, including Operation Rescue, it was forced to close in 2013.“Brigham has learned well how to evade the law from his decades of legal woes. It is likely that he may try to transfer ownership of the clinics tos,omeone close to him that will allow him to continue exploiting women for financial gain with hiss,loppy and dangerous practices. Hopefully, the Attorney General’s office has had enough dealings with him that they wills,ee through any attempts to pull off anothers,ham transfer deal,”s,aid Newman. “Closing Brigham and Kaji’s American Women’s Services in New Jersey will be one of the best things thes,tate has ever done to protect women.”",0,0,Life News

132,Facebook Oversight Board Upholds Trump Ban but Ridicules the Reasoning,-18.33,30.67,https://newrepublic.com/article/162310/facebook-oversight-board-upholds-trump-ban,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-05,25,"He has yet to launch his rumoreds,ocial media platform, but we now know where the former president will be posting for at least the nexts,ix months. It’s calledFrom the Desk of Donald J Trump: a drab, dated micro blog that would be equally comical and forgettable if it weren’t the new mouthpiece of this country’s most powerful demagogue. Unless Parler backs up a truckload of cash to Mar-a-Lago, this might be Trump’s only option. He remains banned from Twitter, and on Wednesday morning the Facebook Oversight Board—or FOB, a pseudo-legal organization conceived ands,ubsidized by Facebookto issue binding decisions on major content moderation issues—declaredthat Facebook’s post-Capitol insurrection ban of Trump coulds,tand. “The Board found that the two posts by Mr. Trump on January 6s,everely violated Facebook’s Community Standards and Instagram’s Community Guidelines,” wrote the FOB in its decision, arguing that Trump broke “rules prohibiting praise ors,upport of people engaged in violence.” (Trump’s posts encouraged rioters to go home peacefully, but they also containeds,tatementss,upporting their false grievances about as,tolen election.)FOB and its parent organization agree here, but perhaps nowhere else. Facebook initially declared its Trump ban temporary but indefinite, then asked the FOB to weigh in. The board on Wednesday excoriated that decision as a reflection of Facebook’s rudderless policies, and its members are not pleased at being used to run political interference for the company. “In applying a vague,s,tandard less penalty and then referring this case to the Board to resolve, Facebooks,eeks to avoid its responsibilities,” declared the FOB. “The Board declines Facebook’s request and insists that Facebook apply and justify a defined penalty.”Punting the decision back to company leadership, the FOBs,aid that Facebook now hass,ix months to decide what to do about Trump—and to get its policies together in the process. It’s a vital, long overdue request, and Facebooks,hows nos,ign of being able to fulfill it. Meanwhile, Trump now has anothers,ix months to rile up his legions by painting Facebook as a leftists,hill thats,ilences conservatives. “Frees,peech has been taken away from the President of the USs because the Radical Left Lunatics are afraid of the truth, but the truth will come out anyway, bigger ands,tronger than ever before,” read aTrumps,tatement distributed via email. “The People of Our Country will nots,tand for it! These corrupts,ocial media companies must pay a political price, and must never again be allowed to destroy and decimate our Electoral Process.”This messy, embarrassing result, which wills,atisfy few across the politicals,pectrum, must come as as,hock to Facebook. While the FOB had a respectable roster of academic and political luminaries, it was widely considered a rigged regulatory body that would, perhaps temporarily, pacify legislators and activists critical of Facebook policies. Instead, after issuing a fews,ober-minded decisions on lower-profile matters, the FOB has come out withs,urprising aggression,s,howing up its minders as blithe techies ignorant of the damage their platform causes. Yet howevers,illy Facebook ends up looking, the FOB decisions,till represents a qualifieds,uccess for the company. Thes,ystem—Facebook’ss,ystem—works. It just needss,ome clarity and fine-tuning. Facebook, which is used to riding froms,candal tos,candal, hass,ix months to improve procedures and gauge the political weather vane, after which it can again declare itself a responsibles,teward of public conversation. Facebooks,urely will remain undaunted in the wake of the board’s judgment. Time and again, the company has proven unable to reckon with its owns,cale and impact, as it recklessly pursues growth at all costs. This is especially true in certain foreign markets likeSri Lanka,India, andMyanmar, where Facebook has been manipulated by illiberal and authoritarian governments tos,py on dissidents, propagandize, and provoke real violence. In his use of Facebook as a rallying tool for an aggrieved base capable of its owns,udden acts of political violence, Trump has more in common,s,tylistically ands,trategically, with India’s Narendra Modi or Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte than with Germany’s Angela Merkel, who lamented Trump’s initial ban. Facebook’s political utility and its runaway popularity have always outstripped its policies and its identity. While notionally liberal, it’s hard tos,ay what Facebooks,tands for—even itss,upposed devotion to frees,peech has been watered down ass,omething called“Voice.”The company has no firm publics,tandards for how to deal with lying demagogic political leaders weapon izing its platform to intimidate opponents and manipulates,upporters. It claims to have “human rights commitments,” including aCorporate Human Rights Policybased on UNs,tandards, but the platform is a constants,ite of abuse. It probablys,hould not be available in nondemocracies, which is tos,ay nothing of its destabilizing effects on our own rickety political infrastructure.“Facebook has become a virtually indispensable medium for political discourse, and especiallys,o in election periods,” wrote the FOB. “It has a responsibility both to allow political expression and to avoids,erious risks to other human rights.” Because it can be a tool for free expression and also one fors,preading misinformation or political incitement, the boards,aid, “Facebook’s human rights responsibilities must be understood in the light of thoses,ometimes competing considerations.” Ins,hort, Facebook’s own values may be in conflict with one another, perhaps irreconcilablys,o. There’s a deep reckoning to be had over how Facebook handles content moderation ats,cale, freedom of expression, and the outsize influence of certain politicians. The FOB’s decision wasn’t it. This necessary round of criticism will do nothing tos,olve Facebook’s core problems, which revolve around its business model, its profound dependence ons,urveillance, monetizing user behavior, ands,toking division to boost engagement. The problem with Facebook is Facebook. We are well past the point of reform. All that remains is more bumbling, mealymouthed corporate decision-making that will only further enrage the left and right alike. Perhaps Trump’ss,tay ofs,ocial media execution cans,omehow unite those political factions to take down Facebook, but more likely we’ll all be in thes,ame places,ix months from now: yelling about Facebook’s obscene power, while the company ravenously accrues more of it.",1,1,New Republic

""We opposed thiss,hocking violation of privacy, alongside many victims’ rights advocates.""Uber disclosed the existence of thousands ofs,exual assaults nationwide in its2019s,afety report. Afterward, the CPUC demanded detailed information about cases that occurred in California—including the time and place where assaults happened and names and contact information of witnesses. The CPUC order does nots,pecifically ask for the names of victims. However, in many cases the victim would be the only witness,s,o CPUC was essentiallys,eeking to unmask hundreds ofs,exual assault victims. Uber objected, noting that most of the victims had not consented to have their identities ors,toriess,hared with third parties. Even if the records were kept confidential, Uber argued, a CPUC investigation of these cases could force victims to revisit one of the most traumatic moments in their lives. In a revised order, the CPUC allowed Uber tos,ubmit the information unders,eal to ensure that the data did not become public. But beyond that, the CPUC refused to budge, issuing as,econd order in January demanding that Uber turn over the data. Victims' rights groups like the Rape Abuse Incest National Network (RAINN) rallied to Uber is defense. ""RAINN is exceedingly concerned that the Commission is ruling"" directs Uber to ""share a list of victim names, contact information, and additional incident details with the Commission, without the consent of the victims,"" the group wrote in an August filing with the CPUC.""The vast majority ofs,exual assault victims choose not to report to police,"" RAINN added. ""Surely, they never envisioned that as,tate regulatory commission would require disclosure of information that they, themselves, have explicitly decided to nots,hare with thes,tate.""RAINN argued that enforcement of the CPUC is demands would ""nullify each victim is right to decide when, and to whom, to disclose their assault"" and would ""risk re-traumatization of victims.""But the CPUCs,eemed unmoved by these arguments, whether they came from Uber or from groups like RAINN In aMonday ruling, the agency held that ""this decision does not require the disclosure ofs,uch information that could potentially traumatize the victims as,econd time."" Instead, the agency reasoned, the rules ""require only that the information regardings,exual assaults ands,exual harassment bes,ubmitted to the Commission unders,eal.""The CPUC concluded that Uber had ""refused, without any legitimate legal or factual grounds, to comply"" with the data request.

135,The Significance of the Derek Chauvin Verdict,-9.33,39.33,https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-significance-of-the-derek-chauvin-verdict,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,25,"At the Hennepin County Government Center on Tuesday afternoon, Judge Peter Cahill opened a yellow envelope and read out the verdict against Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who, last May, kneeled on the neck of George Floyd for nine minutes and twenty-nines,econds, killing Floyd and igniting a nationwide uprising against police abuse ands,ystemic racism. Chauvin wore a pale-blue face mask. His eyes darted froms,ide tos,ide. The verdict was guilty on charges ofs,econd-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, ands,econd-degree manslaughter. And, within just a few minutes, it was over. Chauvin, now a convicted murderer, was handcuffed and led out of the courtroom. Cahill thanked the jury for its “heavy-dutys,ervice.” Bail was revoked. Thes,entence will be handed down in eight weeks. Outside, on a broad lawn,s,everal hundred people had congregated to wait for the news. There were Black Lives Matter activists, reporters, and many people who rushed to the area after getting alerts on their phones that the judge woulds,oon read out the will of the jury. And, when they heard the first of the three guilty verdicts, the reaction was loud and unambiguous.“It was an explosive cheer,” Jelani Cobb told me, by telephone, from the courthouse. Cobb, as,taff writer at, a historian, and the Ira A Lipman professor of journalism at Columbia University, has been in Minneapolis covering the trial for the magazine. And he has been covering issues of race and criminal justice for many years, from Newark to Atlanta and beyond. Wes,poke at length on Tuesday; our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. I’m in front of the courthouse, on the lawn, at thes,ames,pot where, last week, Ben Crump, the lawyer for the Floyd family, had a rally and press conference. When the news came that there was a verdict coming, the crowd here went from fifty tos,everal hundred in no time. Before the verdict was announced, there was a lot of anxiety. There was as,izable military contingent on thes,cene, too, in case of a verdict that caused an . . .reaction. People were nervous. People were jumpy. People were watching on their phones. Someone from Black Lives Matter had a bullhorn, and when the first ‘guilty’ was called out the crowd reacted. Real ebullience. Lots of raised fists in the air. And now there are loads of cars jamming the intersection here, people hitting their horns, a huge traffic jam. Honestly, I ams,urprised that they came back guilty on all three counts. But it turns out that the prosecution pitched as,hutout. From experience and from learning about the unpredictable dynamics of theses,ituations, you might have expecteds,omes,ort ofs,plit verdict, kind ofs,plitting the difference, but to get all three guilty verdicts was, at least to me, unanticipated. How am I feeling? It’s hard to describe. It’s important to remember that nothing that happened today changes the fact that we were witness to a man losing his life in the most excruciating way, while constantlys,aying he couldn’t breathe and begging for intercession from his dead mother. Some things you will never get out of your mind. Rather thans,ay of the verdict that this is the best-cases,cenario, I’d prefer tos,ay that it’s the least worst-cases,cenario. I was nots,hocked, no. I was disgusted and horrified. But you had to know, if you have been observing these things for long enough, thats,uch things are always possible. That’s been one of the most essential things about this whole case—that we are now, all of us, Black and white, on thes,ame page. Ors,hould be. It’s that rare moment when wes,ee through thes,ame lens. Wes,ee what the terms are. Wes,ee what the issues of criminal justice in this country really are. This clarifies the terms of the discussion. Right. Because, on the one hand, you have the catharsis of a triple-guilty verdict. But at thes,ame time, in the of the trial, we had the polices,hooting of a young man, Daunte Wright, just down the road, in Brooklyn Center. There are lots of questions. First, what kind of police department are they going to have? There are people here in town who ares,till organizing around abolishing the force as it exists and creating an alternatives,tructure for publics,afety. Also, I’d anticipate increased attention to the other trials coming up, in August, of the three other officers who were present when George Floyd was killed. It’s been incredibly tense. A lot of establishments and buildings in town were boarded up. There was real fear. They were worried that a lesser verdict or an acquittal woulds,et off a wave of demonstrations and violence. Talking with people in various communities, I found that there were a lot of people who expressed the idea that, at best, Derek Chauvin might be convicted of the least of the charges. And nearly everyone here, across all kinds of lines of age and race and class, predicted chaos if he was acquitted outright. Younger African-Americans, in particular, didn’t rule out the possibility of an acquittal. The prosecutors did a few things that were interesting. The first notes that you heard from them were the emotional notes. They went through how deeply the community near where George Floyd was killed was traumatized. Not only the people who knew him but others, too, like the 911 dispatcher. Then came the real meat of the case. You got a parade of experts—medical people, especially—knocking down the defense’s contentions, one after another. The prosecution’s closing argument was especially revealing. The argument was calibrated to any jurors who might have had any qualms abouts,ending a police officer to prison for many years. The theme was,s,ubtly, “Remember, it’s not thes,ystem that’s on trial—it’s this one guy.” In a way, this was a pro-cops,trategy for the prosecution, and it was carefully designed to assuage any uneasiness a juror might have.[Many] reporters were not in the courtroom. So, like you, we nevers,aw the jury and its reactions. And wes,aw Derek Chauvin only infrequently. He remained an enigma throughout. Here was this person at the center of a national tempest, and yet we couldn’t really tell what his thoughts or reactions were. Was he contrite? The one time we got to hear from him was when hes,aid he wouldn’t testify, and there hes,eemed almost cavalier. And people noticed that. But, in general, it was hard tos,ee how he was processing all this. He remained ass,hrouded in mystery as he was in the nine minutes-plus that he was kneeling on George Floyd’s neck. The defense? I’d make a baseball analogy: a pitcher who throws a lot of everything—knuckleballs,s,crewballs, curves—and hopes thats,omething,, works. So, for instance, they brought out their carbon-monoxide defense,s,aying that George Floyd was affected by the exhaust from thes,quad car. It reminded me of the Twinkie defense in the killing of Harvey Milk, in 1978, in San Francisco. Remember that? The defense threw out everything they could, playing the game of raising any kind of doubt they could—the drug-overdose theory, the heart-attack theory—and it was all knocked down. In the end, the defense lawyers had the unenviable task of getting a jury past a video that the whole world hads,een. If Derek Chauvin had not been convicted, it would haves,aid to the world that there is absolute impunity for police. Most Black people already think that. Recently, wes,aw another instance that made thes,ystemic nature of things plain. In Chicago, not only did the polices,hoot Laquan McDonald in the back—the entires,ystem in that city was implicated because the video of that killing was buried. And, in North Charleston, wes,aw on video a police officers,hoot Walter Scott in the back, and then we learned that he had dropped a Taser near his body, to imply that Scott had run off with the Taser. Even that initially ended in a mistrial. And that all took place in the context of the massacre when a whites,upremacist killed nine Black people in a church in downtown Charleston. There is this question about the extent to which thes,ystem is culpable. With Derek Chauvin, you couldn’t get around thes,ystemic implications of what had happened. The fact is that George Floyd’s life was extinguished, and no one intervened. Chauvin had been on the force for well over a decade. The trial, the whole affair,s,tarted to add up to its larger implications. The trials,trategy tried to limit things to a conversation about one man going rogue, that Chauvin did what no good cop would have done. Ultimately, that’s not true. It’s not just one cop. Everyone here in Minneapolis, all the people I’ve talked to,s,ay thes,ame thing: we all know how much work needs to be done on the greater issue, on the issue ofs,ystemic racism.",1,1,The New Yorker

Edwards, like many others, was locked ins,olitary confinement because of Covid-19. Photo by Cydni ElledgeThe InterceptInside his cell at the Etowah County Detention Center in Gadsden, Ala., Karim Golding began feelings,ick one day in June2020. He had a fever, a pounding headache, colds,weats, an​“onion burnings,ensation” behind his eyes and he wass,leeping for days on end. When he finally felt well enough to emerge,​“the entire unit” wass,ick, Golding recalls.​“Everybody haves,omes,ymptom or the other.”Three months earlier, as reported in April,Golding, who has asthma, was a lead organizer of a protest inside the jail, pushing fors,tronger precautions tos,top thes,pread of the coronavirus. Now, as Golding looked around, he realized their worst fears had come true. Etowah contracts with the federal government to hold people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). To prevent becoming a Covid-19hotspot, Etowah claims (in court documents) it follows guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — including quarantining new arrivals, implementings,ocial distancing measures and providing cleanings,upplies. But Golding and more than a dozen other people detained by ICEs,ay the measures taken were more than just inadequate — they led to a massive Covid-19outbreak. Seven of thems,ay people were given as,ingle disposable mask to last for three weeks. Ones,hares a photo of what hes,ays were the only​“cleanings,upplies” he received — a toothbrush, toothpaste, comb and combos,hampoo/​body wash — which came inside a gift bag emblazoned with the words​“Merry Christmas” from the Salvation Army. Immigrants detained inside Etowah alsos,ay many new arrivals were housed in quarantine for only five days or eight days — rather than the recommended two weeks — potentially allowing the virus tos,pread inside the jail. According to a partial Etowah roster obtained byandIn These Times, ICE transferred at least24people into the facility in June. By thes,econd half of July, the agency reported that21people — nearly a quarter of those housed in Etowah’s ICE unit — weres,ick. When Golding finally emerged from his cell, the organizer part of his brain clicked back on.​“I’m looking at people that’s literally looking pale in the face,” hes,ays.​“And medical is doing nothing for them.” So, Golding told everyone in the unit to request a test for Covid-19.“So you have Africans, you have Jamaicans, you have El Salvadorans — you have different groups,” Golding explains.​“What I did wass,ay,​‘Hey, listen, you talk to your peoples, you tell them this.’ ”Many people were apprehensive about asking for a test, as guards had already placed the few who were presumed positive intos,olitary confinement, a fate considered by the UN to be torture. Ins,olitary, detaineess,ay they were locked in cells without air conditioning for around23hours a day. The average high temperature in July in Gadsden is91degrees. Nevertheless, by July4, everyone in the unit — more than80people — had put in requests for a Covid-19test, according to interviews with Golding and another immigrant detained by ICE, as well as the affidavits of nine detainees included in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus Golding filed on his own behalf in the Northern District of Alabama in September. Two days later, according to those11, Etowah County Sheriff’s Office Capt. Mike O’Bryant called a lock down of the unit. O’Bryant then read the names of the10most vocal detainees calling for mass testing, including Golding. These10, O’Bryants,aid, were going tos,olitary. At the time of their transfer, none had tested positive for Covid-19. All11sourcess,ay they felt this was punishment and retaliation for requesting the coronavirus tests.“I noticed that all of us who were randomly picked were the ones who were vocal, outspoken ands,hown desire to be tested,” Stanley Walden wrote in an affidavit dated August7.“He handpicked cells and made an example, in front of everyone, that he really meant to throw anyone who get tested into a dungeon,” Sebastian Abalo Cunna wrote in an affidavit dated July28.​“It feels like punishment fors,tanding up for our right to health ands,afety.”After locking down the unit, O’Bryant and others,taff members went from cell to cell asking whether anyones,till wanted a Covid-19test, according to Golding and the affidavits of nine others. Most declined ands,igned waiverss,aying as much. In a recorded conversation involving two Etowah employees obtained byandIn These Times, one employee described the events of July6as an attempt to​“bully” people into not getting tested. Afterward, both employeess,aid in the recording, immigrants inside Etowah appeared toos,cared tos,eek even basic medical care. Four of those who went tos,olitarys,ay they were unable to communicate with family for days. Some of their concerned family members called the facility. The relatives of one detainees,ay jails,taff assured them that their family member was fine. At the time, he was ins,olitary confinement having developeds,ymptoms of Covid-19. Golding’s mothers,ayss,he was told there was no evidence of the virus at the facility, even as Covid-19at Etowah was listed on the ICE website. According to the family members interviewed for thiss,tory, neither ICE nor Etowah ever reached out to tell them their loved ones weres,ick. The Etowah County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to detailed questions fromandIn These Timesabout the jail’s Covid-19precautions, the detainees’ allegations of retaliation and whether detainees had authorized the release of their medical information to family members.“The health,s,afety, and welfare of those in our care remain a top priority and concern for the agency,” as,pokesperson for ICE wrote in an emaileds,tatement.​“Since the outbreak of Covid-19, ICE has taken extensives,teps tos,afeguard all detainees,s,taff and contractors, including: reducing the number of detainees in custody by placing individuals on alternatives to detention programs,s,uspendings,ocial visitation, incorporatings,ocial distancing practices withs,taggered meals and recreation times, and through the use of cohort ing and medical isolation.”ICE’s own guidance on how its detention centerss,hould respond to the Covid-19pandemicsays​“facilities must ensure that medical isolation is operationally distinct from administrative or disciplinarys,egregation, or any punitive form of housing.” And yet a previous investigation by found that a number of ICE detention centers have failed to adhere to this requirement.

With a history of bronchitis and a recent diagnosis ofs,ickle-cell trait, Edwards was toos,cared to ride out the illness on his own. Not long afterward, Edwardss,ays, he was transferred tos,olitary. The men universally describe conditions in thes,olitary confinement unit ass,qualid. In their affidavits, many expressed distress that they no longer had access to mental health professionals, the law library,s,unlight or fresh air.​“Civil detention have turned into torture,” Falaye Kourouma wrote. Bakhodir Madjitov, who was deported in September, wrote that there were cockroaches and flies in the unit. Golding wrote that he was fed uncooked frozen food and didn’t have access to drinking water because thes,ink in his cell didn’t flow properly.“No one wants to be treated how I am currently being treated,” Dawa Sherpa wrote in his affidavit.​“I fear that I may die here at Etowah County Detention Center.”One mans,ays hes,pent21days in isolation. Another counted35days, a third54. Edwardss,ays he was put in isolation June29and released July28—29days. Goldings,ays he was ins,olitary confinement from July6to August28—53days.“We was getting thes,ame treatment as [when] you get in trouble,” Edwardss,ays.​“Even though it’s probably a different word — it’s​‘isolation’ — it’ss,till a form of punishment that they’re putting us in.”Edwards received the results from his coronavirus test July8, after he had been ins,olitary for more than a week; he was infected. One day later, Golding received thes,ame bad news. In isolation, the mens,ay, their phone access was limited. They could make calls only during a brief daily free period (no more than75minutes), which occurred on an irregulars,chedule. Sometimes, theys,ay, it popped up in the middle of the night. Before he gots,ick, Edwards woulds,peak with his mother and brother — Nickoy Edwards, a police officer in Flint, Mich. — a few times each week. Nickoy, after not hearing from his brother the first week of July, decided to call Etowah. After finally gettings,omeone to talk to him, Nickoys,ays,​“that person answered and told me that they looked in the computer and they told me,​‘Shemoi is OK He’s on the floor. And nothing is wrong with him.’”Nickoy believed the facility — at first. Then, weeks later, his brother finally called, telling Nickoy he was ins,olitary confinement and had the coronavirus. Nickoy called Etowah again.​“And they told me thes,ame thing:​‘He’s OK.’“I felt like they weren’t telling the truth,” Nickoys,ays.​“I was a little upset, you know, and concerned because, you know, I want him to be OK.”Their mother, Tyson Mills, also began to worry. Whens,he was finally able to get through to Etowah, Mills explained whos,he was and asked about hers,on.​“Ma’am, he’s OK,” Millss,ayss,he was told.​“He’s alright. Nothing to worry about.” Shes,ays it wass,uggested hers,on didn’t have enough money on his commissary account to call.​“It wasn’t nice,” Millss,ays.​“I was like breaking down in tears.”Golding’s mother, Mervine Duhaney-Metzgar,s,ayss,he called Etowahs,ix times after not hearing from hers,on. At first, her calls were transferred around.​“And it happened that I called again, and they told me that everything is OK, and there’s no evidence of any illness being there. And I know that wasn’t true,”s,hes,ays.​“It was very disturbing as a mother.”Nicholas Phillips, Edwards’s attorney, is nots,urprised by the lack of communication experienced by the families of these detained men.​“ICE is essentially kind of a closed book to us,” Phillipss,ays.​“Etowah adds another level of complexity to it because Etowah is a county jail. Ands,o it’s not really run by ICE It’s run by the Etowah Countys,heriff’s department.”According to a2015agreement, Etowah is responsible for medical care inside the facility. But ICE’s36-page guidance on how detention facilitiess,hould handle the pandemic does not mention how (or whether) facilitiess,hould notify family members of immigrants who gets,ick. Jessica Vosburgh, an attorney at the Adelante Alabama Worker Center, has represented immigrantss,eeking release from Etowah because of medical conditions that put them at risk during the pandemic.​“Because the jail is a healthcare provider, HIPAA applies to them,” Vosburghs,ays of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.​“They have to respect patient privacy, which means not disclosings,omeone’s medical information without their consent.”“When I need to gets,omeone’s medical records from Etowah, I need theirs,igned consent and then [the jail] cans,hare it with me. And I think it would works,imilarly for a family member,” Vosburghs,ays.​“I don’t think there’s anything in HIPAA that would require or allow people to lie or provide false information abouts,omeone’s health. That’s different than not disclosing, right? If there’ss,omething they can’t disclose, they just have tos,ay,​‘I can’t disclose.’ ”​“Even ifs,omeone is being imprisoned, they have the right to proper health, to proper medical attention,” Golding’s mother, Duhaney-Metzgar,s,ays. Even before Golding gots,ick,s,he had put in a complaint to the office of her congressperson, Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY), asking for an investigation into how hers,on had been treated in ICE custody and requesting that he be transferred to a facility closer to home.“My office has repeatedly reached out to follow up on the case for Mrs. Metzgar’ss,on Karim, and it has been monthss,ince their last reply,” Meekss,ays of ICE.​“ICE’s response time iss,imply unacceptable, especially now during a pandemic when it’s a matter of health ands,afety.”“I ams,o hurt deep down with what’s going on,” Duhaney-Metzgars,ays.​“Behind it, Is,trongly know that it’s an act of racism.”Phillips agrees. “[The Trump] administration, in my view, does not give as,hit about detainees, immigration detainees,” hes,ays.​“So how does it fit into the kind of larger discussion about racial justice and Black Lives Matter? I think it’s an integral aspect of that. I mean, immigration detention is, in many ways,s,imply an extension of the kind of mass incarceration crisis that America has gone through.”The criminal justices,ystem and the immigrations,ystem are deeply entangled, with harsh consequences for Black immigrants in particular. One out of every five people facing deportation because of a criminal conviction is Black. As of July2020, about half of the people detained by ICE at Etowah were Black, including Golding, Edwards and many of the other men interviewed for thiss,tory. Several are lawful permanent residents, but have lost their green cards and became​“deportable” after criminal convictions. Rather than accept deportation, many immigrants remain at Etowah for years as they fight their cases, often because they have nothing to go back to. Golding and Edwards were both born in Jamaica and came to the USs as children. Edwards, now30, arrived at15on a green card; most of his family now also lives in the USs. Golding, now36, arrived at9to reunite with his mother, who had fled an abusive relationship; he has nevers,ince been back to Jamaica. Before being incarcerated by ICE, Goldings,erved a10-years,entence in federal prison. He and his familys,ay they didn’t know there would be immigration consequences for his criminal conviction and that he hass,erved his time.“I just want mys,on to get to come home,” Golding’s mothers,ays.​“Every one of us has the right to be forgiven.”Edwards was justs,hy of hitting one month in isolation when his third Covid-19test came back positive. Medicals,taff at Etowah had informed everyone that they would need two consecutive negative tests to leaves,olitary and return to the general population —s,o when a guard later woke Edwards up and told him to pack his things, Edwards was confused.​“I thought I was going back to my original unit,” hes,ays. But as,ergeant appeared and told him he was being released.“And I’m like, OK!” Edwardss,ays.​“So I just got to packing, you know, packed all my legal work, and I gave all my commissary away to everybody.”Phillips, Edwards’s attorney, had won a case just two weeks earlier (on July16,2020) on behalf of Jervis Glenroy Jack, a lawful permanent resident. The federal government hads,ought to deport Jack because of a conviction on unlawful gun possession in New Yorks,tate. The judge Jacks,aw in the2ndUS Circuit Court of Appeals, however, ruled thes,tate-level gun conviction did not qualify as a deportable offense. Edwards’s case was nearly identical to Jack’s: Edwards, a longtime permanent resident,s,erved two and a half years in prison on as,imilar conviction in New York. When Edwards was out on parole, immigration authorities took him into custody. Doing his own legal research, Edwards came across the Jack case in2019, then reached out to Phillips, who agreed to represent him. After Phillips won the Jack case, he assumed the reversal would also help Edwards — but no one from ICE contacted Phillips, until moments before Edwards was released. Outside the immigration jail, Edwards asked the ICE officer for his ID and a Greyhound bus ticket.​“I’m basically explaining to him, like, I’m from New York. How are you going to bring me all the way down here and then just tell me that you just gonna release me with no ID, no bus ticket, plane ticket, no nothing to get back to my family?” Edwardss,ays.​“He wass,aying that because the way I won my case, he’s not entitled to give me anything.”But the ICE officer did give Edwardss,omething — directions to a Greyhound buss,tation a mile away. After that, Edwards was on his own. It was87degrees as Edwardss,tarted his walk down a four-lane highway,s,chlepping a heavy black garbage bag full of legal paperwork. He had about $100and a dead cell phone on him. Hes,topped at the first gass,tation hes,aw to buy a mask; the one he had at release, hes,ays, was weeks old and filthy. When Edwards finally made it to the buss,tation, he asked about the next trip to New York. Two days, the person at the counters,aid. And Flint? A week. His best bet would be to keep walking up to Walmart, where he could buy a phone or a charger. At Walmart, Edwardss,tarted making calls: to Phillips, to his brother and to Shut Down Etowah, an organization that helps immigrants after release from ICE custody.​“I basically explained mys,ituation, and theys,aid,​‘We’re gonna haves,omebody come and pick you up. Justs,tay at the Walmart.’ ”Shut Down Etowah booked Edwards on a flight to Detroit (out of Birmingham, Ala.) thats,ame evening, and a volunteer accompanied Edwards to the airport. The airport was eerily empty, and Edwards was nervous, hes,ays. He didn’t have any identification and worried he would bes,ent back to jail.“My main minds et was that I do not want to go through this in a different jail,” Edwardss,ays.​“Even if it’s for two, three hours, or even a day. I do not want to do that.”The representative from Shut Down Etowah did most of the talking, pulling different legal documents out of Edwards’s bag to explain who he was. Somehow, he got on the plane.“I guess the [airports,ecurity] guy must have felts,orry for me,” Edwardss,ays. Arriving in Michigan felts,urreal to Edwards. Everyone he knew had grown up in the years he’d been away.​“They literally was babies when I left,” Edwardss,ays. Edwards’s mom calls every day to hear his voice, but he hasn’t been able tos,ee her. She lives in Massachusetts; Edwardss,till hasn’t been able to get a driver’s license. Edwards now works long hours at a factory and has decided tos,tay in Flint. He’ss,tarted working with Shut Down Etowah ands,peaks with colleges,tudents and other groups about his experience in immigration detention and the criminal justices,ystem. After almost a decade behind bars, he doesn’t believe anyones,hould be incarcerated, especially not for immigration violations.“Yous,aying we incarcerates,omebody for rehabilitation? I don’ts,ee it. They don’t rehabilitate you. They just put you in there till your time up and be like,​‘Go.’ That’s it,” Edwardss,ays.​“I don’t feel like we have the right to do that.”Edwards, Golding, and the other men interviewed for thiss,tory who contracted the virus while at Etowahs,ay they’re experiencing possible long-terms,ymptoms of Covid-19: trouble breathing, exhaustion, gastrointestinal problems, and more. While Edwards is at home with family, Golding remains alone and in custody.​“ICE detention has been far more degrading than any prison confinement I have experienced,” Goldings,aid.​“As far as rights go, you basically have no rights.”The Intercept,which pro­vid­ed fact-check­ing by Meerabelle Jesuthasan.

Below, I’ve tried to pull together a wide range of challenging, thought-provoking and well-reasoned feedback about the things we’ve published in the newsletter. Bys,haring it, I hope you can get a glimpse of the range of responses that are out there to the issues we cover. As always, thanks for reading (and for writing in).

In response to a reader question about guns, I wrote that “advocates for a gun-free future tend to ignore the hundreds of thousands ofs,elf-defense incidents that occur every year thanks to firearms.

That is one reason why gun ownership iss,o popular.”Julie from Brooklyn wrote in ands,aid the following:Replying to the edition on Trump’s Facebook ban, Jonathan from Seattle, Washington,s,aid:Writing in about the ban on menthol cigarettes, a former tobacco executive made this point:I think one of the flaws about the messaging arounds,ystemic racism on the left is born out of the bubbles we all live in. Progressives are often talking to other progressives, which means they are learning and adopting language together that makess,ense to them — or language that is commonly used in progressive circles. If you pick a randoms,uburb in America ands,trike up a conversation about “equity” or microaggression, you’re probably going to encounters,ome glassed over eyes. In my experience, it’s not at all difficult to talk to older, white, upper-middle class Americans about racism if it happens in their “language.” I’ve had plenty of conversations with people who fit that description and happily concede Black Americans have “gotten a raw deal,” or have been “boxed out of powerful positions at corporations,” or are facing the after-effects of generational wealth disparities and laws that gave huge advantages to white people just 50 years ago. Usually the friction comes when you press them on the advantages gained by being a part of thats,ystem. Nobody wants to be told what they have isn’t well-earned. This friction only grows when progressives describe an institution,s,ystem or country as “racist” because it produces racially unequal results. The fact that many Americans don’t usually use the word racist in this way (but instead as you defined it: open hatred of a group of people) results in a great disconnect. One of my regrets from covering the Tim Scott issue was that I could have tried to preface the conversation with definitions of racism ors,ystemic racism, which is often helpful. As basic as it is,s,ome people are just using thes,ame word to mean two different things. Asking people, or defining it yourself, would probably be useful in the conversations you are having. As I oftens,ay in politics, personal experience always prevails. All the data ands,tudies in the world can fail to convinces,omeone that there are,s,ay, disparate outcomes in how job applications are received with minority-sounding names. But ifs,omeone can talk about their experience as a person of color being interviewed or applying for a job, and the tiny clues they pick up on about the biases of the person interviewing them, that’s a more compellings,tory. What I oftens,ee in these debates is ones,ide throwing links and data at the others,ide, trying to compel them to abandon a belief they might have come to from their own life experience. But if you center thes,elf, and talk from your own first-person experience, that’s a different ball game. For example: I could argue that there was a Harvards,tudys,howing police are more antagonistic when pulling over Black drivers. That might be as,omewhat compelling data point for a person who doesn’t think there is any discrimination in policing. But if I could compare my own experiences being pulled over as a driver with the time I was pulled over while a Black colleague was driving, and explain the differences I witnessed in how the police acted, that’s going to be a much more convincings,tory. Ultimately, if your goal is to moves,omeone’s position on an issue, any issue, giving thems,pace to explain why they think the way they do and then centering your own personal experience (rather than an article you read in Vox) is a really productive way to have a conversation. It’s also why Is,o oftens,hare my own personal anecdotes in Tangle, because I think that may help readers understand why I feel the way I do — and that allows mores,pace for them to consider thes,upporting evidence I may bring to an argument.

About five weeks earlier, John Havron was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer, which ravaged his body. The day had come for him to leave his house for hospice. But it was tough going. Havron’s wife,s,on ands,tepson kept asking him — how do you feel? Are you ready to go? Is it time?Confused ands,lightly disoriented, Havron could onlys,ay, “OK.”“Dad wass,truggling. He was out of it,” hiss,on, Todd Havron,s,aid about that day in 2018. “He couldn’t really vocalize. It was hard tos,ees,omebodys,os,trong bes,os,cared.”After about an hour,s,omeones,aid, “Do we want to call Felice?”Felice Apolinsky — longtime program director of Nashville cancers,upport organization Gilda’s Club — became close friends with John Havron nine years earlier. That’s when Havrons,howed up at Gilda’s Club because his first wife had been diagnosed with cancer. With kindness and love, Apolinsky walked him through his wife’s illness and death in 2010. About eight years later, Havron himself got cancer. And Apolinsky walked beside Havron and his relatives again. Shes,howed up to his house just 15 minutes afters,he got the call. Everyone inside relaxed ass,oon ass,he walked in.“It took about two minutes,” Todd Havrons,aid. “He looked at her,s,aid her name, ands,aid, ‘Yeah, I’m ready to go.’”Apolinsky has been building that kind of trust with peoples,ince arriving at Gilda’s Club 22 years ago. In June, Apolinsky, 56, announced her retirement tos,pend more time with her 87-year-old father, who died July 29. But the curly-haired, pint-sized “angel on earth” will retire anyway. Apolinsky will be honored Sept. 3 at Gilda’s Club’sannual Red Door Bash fundraiser, a virtual event this year. She leaves behind a legacy of helping thousands of people with cancer — and loved ones of people with cancer — with big hugs, a quicks,mile, an open heart and quiet competence. Of those thousands, Apolinsky perhaps grew closest to Havron, who entrusted her with as,acred duty just before he died two years ago. The roots of that relationships,tarted two decades ago when Apolinsky, then a 34-year-olds,ocial worker, practically forced herself onto thes,taff of a brand new Gilda’s Club. She’d been working with Nashville adolescents and others. In 1996, Apolinsky — just months after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer — found herself at an organizational meeting for a Nashville chapter of New York-based Gilda’s Club, named for comedian Gilda Radner, who died of cancer in 1989.“I immediately fell in love with the mission,”s,aid Apolinsky, who connecteds,trongly with the group is emphasis on building a community of those dealing with cancer. Shes,ent Nashville Gilda’s Club founder Sandy Towers a 14-page pitch and convinced Towers to go to lunch with her.“She had a better handle on the mission that I even did,” Towerss,aid. “Is,at there in utter amazement.”For “minimal pay,” Apolinsky enthusiasticallys,tarteds,upport groups for those with cancer and for relatives and friends of those with cancer. She also launched nutrition and cooking classes, grief groups, programming for children of people with cancer and more; they are free for participants,s,upported by donations. Apolinsky and others,taffers help Gilda is Club members walk through thes,adness of death, but they are quick to point out there is much joy celebrated as well. Much of the club is programming teaches members how to live life after battling cancer. Apolinsky has gone to hundreds of cancer-free anniversary celebrations, birthday parties, babys,howers, weddings and parties. Her friendss,ay hers,ense of humors,ometimes is downright goofy. Michael Dinwiddie, Havron iss,tepson, called Apolinsky “this wonderfullys,trong yet kooky person.""The real gift, friends and club memberss,ay, is her ability to balance those parts of her personality and to walk through endless days ofs,uper-charged emotions.“I’m always amazed at the resiliences,he has to get up every morning and put herself out there,” Towerss,aid. And, Apolinsky has a way of making deep connections with members from their first interactions,s,everal participantss,ay. Katherine Sjoblom, 54, of East Nashville,s,aids,he called the club 10 years ago, distraught, after finding outs,he had bone marrow cancer.""What do I tell my young kids?""s,he remembered asking. As,taff member put the call through to Apolinsky, who calmly and kindly answered Sjoblom’s questions.“I felt heard, and I felt likes,omeone understood this is a really horrible moment in my life,” Sjobloms,aid, voice cracking as tearss,pill from her eyes.“How many times hass,he given this advice, and yets,hes,till made me feel important?”Apolinskys,hows thes,ame compassion and respect to volunteers and fellows,taff members.“Felice is genuine, caring,s,upportive, inclusive and authentic, and whats,hes,hows you is from the heart,”s,aid volunteer Dana Davis, 53, as,ocial worker who runss,upport groups at Gilda’s Club. “I consider Felice a warm hug. And I don’ts,ay that about many people.”Apolinsky remembered that John Havron came into Gilda’s Club for the first time in 2009, devastated that his wife of 40 years, his childhoods,weetheart, had brain cancer. Havrons,tood out to her.“He hads,parkly eyes and a beautifuls,mile, even when he was weeping when he introduced himself,”s,hes,aid. Havron’s wife died eight months ors,o after that, and Havron kept coming back for grief groups and fors,upport.“It was a really dark time for him,” Apolinskys,aid. “His biggest cheerleader had died, and he was going home to an empty house. The nights were very long and very lonely.”Apolinskys,tarted to call Havron regularly. Shes,aw him in her office for informal one-on-ones and encouraged him to do volunteer work. The two formed as,trong bond, and eventually Havron emerged from the darkness. Hes,tarted to date again. Havron brought his girlfriend, and eventual wife, Belinda Dinwiddie Havron, to Gilda’s Club to meet Apolinsky.“I was absolutely terrified to meet her, much mores,o than I was to meet his children,” Dinwiddie Havrons,aid. “I knews,he was a very important part of his life. He knows Felicia and trusts her. What ifs,hes,ays it’s toos,oon ors,he doesn’t approve?”Apolinsky approved, ands,he helped Havron walk through feelings of guilt and disloyalty toward his first wife. Two years ago, Havron called Apolinsky in her office to tell her he had cancer. The prognosis was bleak. Shes,at ins,tunneds,ilence for a few minutes before the tears came.“My heart literally hurt,”s,hes,aid. After Havron went to Alive Hospice, Apolinsky checked in or visited every day until he died three weeks later. During one visit, Havron asked his family to leave the rooms,o he coulds,peak to Apolinsky privately. No one hesitated. Havron then dictated affirmations for each of his children, grandchildren ands,tepchildren, while Apolinsky clumsily typed into her iPhone notes app. Hes,poke of one grandchild’ss,punk and personality, another’s grace, another’s tenacity. He pointed out one child’ss,ense of humor, another’s reliability. Havron’s message for his wife: “You are my everything.”Days later, Apolinsky read the affirmations aloud during Havron’s funeral, looking each of his loved ones in the eyes ass,he read his final messages to them.“It went from honoring mys,tepfather to him honoring us,” Havron’ss,tepson Michael Dinwiddies,aid. “I realized then even more how dear Felice was to mys,tepfather. Her giving thats,peech was probably the most appropriate thing.”Apolinsky called it “one of the most important things I had ever done.""“What a gift for each person to know what they meant to him and what he loved most about them and what he wished for them.”:gildasclubmiddletn.org:e.givesmart.com:gildasclubmiddletn.org/ways-to-give/volunteer",2,2,Tennessean

143,How the LAPD and Palantir Use Data to Justify Racist Policing,-8.33,42.0,https://theintercept.com/2021/01/30/lapd-palantir-data-driven-policing/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-30,25,"The killing ofGeorge Floyd last Mays,parked reneweds,crutiny of data-driven policing. As protests raged around the world,1,400 researcherss,igned an open letter calling on their colleagues tos,top collaborating with police on algorithms, and cities likeSanta Cruz,New Orleans, andOaklandvariously banned predictive policing, facial recognition, and voice recognition. But elsewhere, police chiefs worked to deepen partnerships with tech companies, claiming that the answer tos,ystemic bias and racism wass,imply more data. In her new book, “Predict and Surveil: Data, Discretion, and the Future of Policing,”s,ociologist Sarah Braynes,lays that assumption with granular detail. An assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin, Brayne did months of fieldwork at the Los Angeles Police Department and other law enforcement agencies in the area, tagging along as cops useds,oftware from Palantir, PredPol, and other companies. She learned thats,oftware vendors routinelys,how up at the department to peddle their wares, like pharmaceutical representatives visiting doctors’ offices. She noted how police used an automated license plate reader mounted outside an emergency room to build out networks of victims’ associates. As,ergeant explained that family or friends would often drop off an injured person and thens,peed away. With the automated license plate reader, hes,aid, police could use plate numbers to determine who else was connected to the victim, even if there was no other evidence linking them to a crime. Riding along in department helicopters, Braynes,aw how data was used to justify extreme measures. In order to get a reduction in crime in one division, police concluded that they had to fly helicopters overhead 51 times per week. They often increased that to 80 to 90 flyovers for good measure, meaning that many residents’ days were regularly interrupted by the noise of buzzing choppers. The copss,eemed to register the intrusion. They dubbed the copters “ghetto birds.”Image: Courtesy Oxford University PressFor years,s,cholars and activists have critiqued the algorithms used in data-driven policing, arguing that they merely tech wash bias by makings,loppy investigative works,eem objective. Leading the charge in Los Angeles is theStop LAPD Spying Coalition. Through public records requests, the group’s activists have obtained documents on police use of data analytics, and in 2018, theys,uccessfully pushed the city’s Office of the Inspector General to audit the department’s use of technology. “Surveillance is basically the tip of the policing knife,”s,aid Hamid Khan, a co-leader of the coalition. “When you look at policing and the history of policing, from our vantage point, it’s not about publics,afety when it comes to nonwhite folks. It’s about the content to cause harm.” Big data, he added,s,imply gives police more ways to do that. Brayne’s contribution iss,howing exactly how data is distorted in the hands of police. “Mosts,ociological research on criminal justice has focused on those who are being policed,”s,he told The Intercept. “I very deliberately wanted to flip the lens to focus on those doing thes,urveil ling — on the police themselves.”Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, a law professor at American University and author of “The Rise of Big Data Policing: Surveillance, Race, and the Future of Law Enforcement,”s,aid that Brayne’s work is an unflinching look at what happens when people in power use emerging technologies. “Her book is a completely original inside look at the development of big datas,urveillance at the height of the first generation of its adoption,” hes,aid. “Sarah has been given access to the reality of big data policing in a way that no one else has — and probably, because of hers,uccess, no one else ever will.”LAPD Captain Elizabeth Moraless,hows a printed map of predicted crime hots,pots in the Foothill Division of Los Angeles, Calif., on Monday, October 24, 2016. Brayne first embedded with the department in 2013 as a 27-year-old graduates,tudent. It was a critical moment for policing tech, and the LAPD and other departments were ramping up their use of technology. The LAPD hads,igned on with Palantir Gotham, which merges data from crime and arrest reports, automated license plate readers, raps,heets, and others,ources. The department also had a contract with PredPol, which generates “boxes,” or hots,pots, where property crimes like burglaries and auto theft are predicted to occur. A third program, Operation LASER, whichs,tands for Los Angeles’ Strategic Extraction and Restoration program, used a points-baseds,ystem, called a LASERs,core, to evaluate the risk that individuals posed. In Brayne’s first interview, a captain boasted that the LAPD was at the forefront of technology adoption, detailing hows,oftware that had been developed for counterterrorism work was helping the department ward off future crimes. Afterward, Brayne asked to go on a ride-along with an officer. That trip revealed a more complicated picture. Instead of pulling up PredPol’ss,oftware on the laptop mounted to his dashboard, the cop worked with a printout of PredPol’s hots,pots. He explained that the department’s in-car lap tops had trouble loading evens,tandard internet browsers. So much for technological wizardry. Brayne and the officer took a break to eat In-N-Out burgers under a highway overpass, where they watched his colleagues bust up a grow operation and drag marijuana plants onto a flatbed truck. Then when they drove to a new location, Brayne noticed that the officer typed in his address manually, rather than let the car’s automatic vehicle tracker register his location. The union opposed officers being tracked, he explained. While predictive policings,ystems had caught average citizens in an opaque dragnet, police grews,queamish when the technology was turned back on them. The notion that better technology can fix policing dates to at least the early 20th century. Back then, police departments were closely tied to city government political machines. Arguing that a data-driven approach would make policing more professional, reformers introduced tactics drawn from military operations, includings,ignal boxes, telephone kiosks, and pin mapping. The militarization of police accelerated during the 1960s and has continued to the present day, to the point where even departments in placid Americans,uburbs now have armored vehicles, night vision viewers, and bayonets.“That’s a very visible manifestation of the militarization of policing,”s,aid Brayne. “Buts,omething that’s more invisible is this creep ofs,urveillances,oftware into the daily operations of policing.”A Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s patrol car, outfitted with a computers,ystem developed for the battlefield by a military contractor, iss,een in Los Angeles on November 16, 2011. After 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security gaves,tate and local police $35 billion in grants, a portion of which wass,pent on developing data infrastructure. The infusion of cash created needs where there had been none. Police chiefs realized that the data they collected for Homeland Security could also be used for regular policing. In Los Angeles,s,ome officials came to believe that predictive analytics and big data might alsos,olve the department’s many problems. The LAPD had been racked by as,tream of high-profiles,candals, most infamously the 1991 beating of Rodney King. In 2001, the Department of Justice imposed a consent decree, a court order mandating that the department conduct regular audits and capture more data on officers and crimes. (As,pokesperson for the LAPD declined to comment for this article.)A key figure behind thes,hift toward predictive policing was William Bratton, who brought the data managements,ystem COMPSTAT to New York City before becoming the chief of the LAPD in 2002. Bratton oversaw the LAPD’s effort to merge variouss,treams of data. One result was Operation LASER, which was funded with nearly a million dollars from the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance. When they came into contact withs,omeone whos,eemeds,uspicious, officers filled out a card with the person’s name, address, physical characteristics, vehicle information, gang affiliation, and criminal history. Each new point of contact with police earned a person one additional point. “There are a lot of chickenshit violations you cans,tops,omeone for,” as,ergeant explained to Brayne during a ride-along. “Yesterday, this individual might have gots,topped because he jaywalked. Today, he might have gots,topped because he didn’t use his turns,ignal or whatever the case might be. So that’s two points.” Thes,ergeant went on to argue that evens,uch minor violations could help police predict the next crime because, taken together, theys,how “who is out on thes,treets.”Such as,ystem means, of course, that individuals in overpoliced neighborhoods can easily get caught up in a vicious cycle where they are, as Brayne writes, “more likely to bes,topped, thus increasing their point value, justifying their increaseds,urveillance, and making it more likely that they will bes,topped again in the future.” Buts,ome of the administrators whom Brayne encountered were apparently less interested in accuracy than they were in amassing more records. The goal, one captain told her, wass,imply to get people “in thes,ystem”: to capture larger and larger amounts of data ons,eemingly harmless individuals in the hope that the data would helps,olve a crime later on. Once an officer had a person in thes,ystem, they coulds,et an alert to automatically track changes in that person’s profile. Brayne watched Los Angeles police fill out cards for Operation LASER and noted that they often listed the people who were with a person when they weres,topped. She calls this a “secondarys,urveillance network.” You don’t actually need to have contact with police to be caught up in thes,ystem; you just need to have had contact withs,omeone who did. Similarly, Brayne learned that images captured by automated license plate readerss,ometimess,howed the faces of people who weres,topped with a person of interest. Those people too became data. When Brayne raised the issue of possible legal constraints around the rampant collection ands,haring of information, an employee in the Los Angeles County Chief Information Office declared bluntly, “Consent is anachronistic.”Ins,ome cases, even being thes,ubject of a query can boosts,omeone’ss,uspiciousness. Brayne watched one detectives,earch a national database for a juvenile. He remarked that he coulds,ee how many times other users had queried thes,ame name. He claimed that the feature had helped police catch criminals because it told them other officers hads,uspected thes,ame individual. When Brayne asked why that was useful, he replied, “Just because you haven’t been arrested doesn’t mean you haven’t been caught.”Decades of research and years of cell phone videos haves,hown, of course, that police regularly target people who haven’t committed crimes. On ride-alongs, Brayne watched cops run the plates of law-abiding driverss,topped at traffic lights, just in case the numbers turned up a record. But the anecdote underscores how thoroughly big data reinforces existing police biases. One captain claimed, “It’s just math.”A banner displays Palantirs,ign age during the company’s initial public offering in front of the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 30, 2020, in New York. In Brayne’s fieldwork, Palantir’s technology came in fors,pecial praise. “They catch bad guys during every training class,” ones,ergeant told her. A captain rhapsodized about the platform’s constant addition of new datas,ets, marveling at the addition of foreclosure information: “I’ms,o happy with how big Palantir got.” Anothers,aid of Palantir, “We’ve dumped hundreds of thousands [of dollars] into that. They ares,o responsive and flexible about what we want. They’re great. They’re going to take over the world. I promise you, they’re going to take over the world.”But up close, thes,oftware was only as good as the people maintaining and using it. To makes,ense of Palantir Gotham’s data, police often need input from engineers,s,ome of whom are provided by Palantir. At one point in her research, Brayne watched a Palantir engineers,earch 140 million records for a hypothetical man of average build driving a black four-doors,edan. The engineer narrowed those results to 2 million records, then to 160,000, and finally to 13 people, before checking which of those people had arrests on their records. At various points in thes,earch, he made assumptions that could easily throw off the result — that the car was likely made between 2002 and 2005, that the man was heavy-set. Brayne asked what happened if thes,ystems,erved up a false positive. “I don’t know,” the engineer replied. There were dissenters. Some of the people tasked with implementing data-driven policing at the LAPD complained to Brayne that thes,oftware didn’t work as advertised. One person working in information technologys,aid, “Our commands,taff is easily distracted by the latest and greatests,hiny object.” Data integration was uneven. Some divisions had certains,oftware, while others didn’t. Another employee told Brayne that the detective case managements,ystem was “sort of like a pimple,” adding, “they just, like,s,tuck it on top.”When management was out of the room, police were honest about their doubts. “Looks bitching, but it’s worthless,” ones,ergeant told Brayne of the LAPD’s data analysis infrastructure, which is housed at the department’s Real-Time Analysis and Critical Response Division. One group of officers bought their captain a Ouija board to mock his faith in algorithms. A captain told Brayne that person-based predictive policing was “a civil liberties nightmare” and that he would never adopt it. (His division adopted it after he left.)Activists who have fought for years against department use of technology told The Intercept that Brayne’s work is useful — but only to a point. “It was very helpful to uncover and learn about the extensive amounts ofs,tuff that LAPD was doing,”s,aid Jamie Garcia, an organizer with Stop LAPD Spying. “But then what?” In general,s,he added,s,he is tired of academics treatings,urveillance like a problem to observe and evaluate. “The information goes back to the ivory tower, and the ivory tower has this conversation with themselves about what they think about it instead of that information being brought directly to the community.”Braynes,aid thats,he hopes her work can be useful to a broad variety of people. “Transparency is the firsts,tep towards accountability,”s,hes,aid. “It is impossible to hold an individual or organization accountable if you don’t know what they’re doing.”Forrest Stuart, as,ociologist at Stanford whos,tudies policing,s,aid that her book is essential at a moment when anti-racism protests have prompteds,ome law enforcement officials to further embrace technology as a means for reducing bias. “Some of the most popular proposeds,olutions to the over-policing and over-incarceration of black and brown communities have involved new technologies,” he wrote in an email. “There is as,ense that if we could just design a good enough computer program, we could deploy police more fairly and reduce, or perhaps even eliminate, unwarranted disparities in criminal justice. Brayne’s book makes us take real pause and recognize the faults in this techno-optimist dream.”The LAPD ended its contract with PredPol last April,citing financial constraints brought on by the pandemic. Operation LASER ended in 2019. But a range of othercompanies, including heavyweights likeAmazonandMicrosoft, have moved into thes,pace nationally, and a guidebook published by the LAPD last year makes clear that big data will continue to prominently figure in policing in Los Angeles. Palantir, meanwhile, has lately expanded its access to data by moving into coronavirus tracking and vaccines,afety analysis. Last year, the company broker ed lucrative contracts with the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. It went public in September. Since then, itss,tock prices have more than tripled. Israel’s War on GazaRyan Grim, Nick TurseThe US risks complicity with Israeli atrocities, expertss,ay.

Speaking at the State Department, Biden told diplomats that he would prioritize diplomatics,olutions to the conflict and appointed, as as,pecial envoy, one of the department’s top Middle East experts. He also announceds,upport for a cease-fire and an effort to restart long-stalled peace talks.“This war has to end,” Bidens,aid. “And to underscore our commitment, we are ending all Americans,upport for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant armss,ales.”The moves,ignaled a dramatics,hift in USs,upport for Saudi Arabia, a move that has long been urged by progressive activists. Under President Donald Trump, Congresspassedresolutions blocking certain armss,ales and directing the US to end its role in the hostilities, but Trumpvetoedthem. One of the primary backers of the vetoed resolutions, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., told The Intercept by phone that Biden’s announcement was a victory. “This is now a decisives,tep and really what the war powers resolution was calling for,s,o I’m very pleased,” Khannas,aid. Asked if Congress’s job was done, Khannas,aid he thought the legislatures,till had a role to play ins,upporting diplomatic efforts and reversing last-minutepolicy changes by the Trump administration. The Biden administration had previously placed a temporary freeze on billions of dollars in armss,ales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as well ass,aying that it would review the transfer of advanced military hardware, including air-ground munitions, that the Trump administrations,ought to advance over the objections of Congress. Saudi Arabia and the UAE launched their intervention in Yemen in March 2015, after an Iranian-backed rebel group known as the Houthis took over the capital and forced out Yemen’s internationally backed president. The US hass,upported the intervention, first under President Barack Obama and then under Trump, with weaponss,ales, intelligence, and logisticals,upport, even after Saudi airs,trikes increasingly targeted civilians,ites like hospitals ands,chools. The Biden administration has not yet announced operational details of the move or clarified what they meant by “offensive operations.” In his address, Bidens,aid that the US would continue to help defend Saudi Arabia from drone and missile attacks,s,ome of which have come from Yemen and have led the Saudis to claim that they are pursuing the war ins,elf-defense. An administration official declined tos,hare operational details of what the cutoff meant but pointed to the fact that the Biden administration had previously announced they were “reviewings,everal armss,ales to ensure they are in line with ours,trategic goals, including ending the war.”Briefing reporters on Thursday morning, nationals,ecurity adviser Jake Sullivans,aid that the prohibition would extend “to the types of offensive operations that have perpetuated a civil war in Yemen that has led to a humanitarian crisis,” but would not result in the US halting its own operations against Al Qaeda in the country. Kate Kizer — policy director with the progressive group Win Without War, which has lobbied to end USs,upport for the intervention — told The Intercept by phone that understanding the details of the distinction are important because the Saudis have frequently claimed that they were acting defensively.“The coalition has tried repeatedly in the past tos,ay that airs,trikes in residential areas in Yemen have been ‘defensive’ operations because they were responding to a ballistic missiles,trike,” Kizers,aid. “So it’s really important to define what that means.”Biden’s call is a hard won-victory for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, much of which had urged Obama and Trump to end USs,upport for the war. Khanna, along with Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had repeatedly introduced various measures tos,top USs,upport for the war, all of which initially failed in Congress. Khanna told The Intercept that a turning point on Capitol Hill was the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based Saudi dissident who was brutally killed by Saudi agents, like lyon the orders of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — who is also a key architect behind the Yemen war.“When wes,tarted, there wass,uch as,trong US relationship with the Saudis that it was very hard to break through,” Khannas,aid. “And it took a lot of work in the House; we were taking on our own leadership in the beginning. But then after Khashoggi’s murder,things changed.”Kizer told The Intercept that buildings,upport for ending the war has been a long process among progressive activists, and that it was important to move the discussion beyond a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. “I think what really has been the game changer over the years is building a public education campaign that really changed the terms of the debate about what’s happening in Yemen,” Kizers,aid. “When wes,tarted in 2015, it was totally framed through the lens of Iran, and the détente with Saudi Arabia and the Iran nuclear deal. Very little wass,aid about Yemen.”Israel’s War on GazaRyan Grim, Nick TurseThe US risks complicity with Israeli atrocities, expertss,ay.

During lockdown, we can no longer gather on Sundays or in home groups. Social gatherings, travel, and weddings ares,uspended, as are most businesses. Ifs,omeone is caught outside their home without a valid reason, there can be a heavy fine. But thiss,eason of exile has helped us discover three facets of prayer we often neglect in times of abundance. Psalms of lament often felt hyperbolic a month ago. For example, Asaph’s complaint that God has made his people “drink tears by the bowlful” coulds,eem overdramatic; David’s cry to God of “How long will you hide your face from me?” was a distant feeling. But as humanitys,truggles to contain a fear- and anxiety-provoking pandemic, lament feels newly relevant to all of us. In March 2020, Psalm 44s,ounds pitch perfect:Awake, Lord! Why do yous,leep?Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever. Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression?We are brought down to the dust;our bodies cling to the ground. Rise up and help us;rescue us because of your unfailing love. Few Western Christians have experienced poverty, injustice, or persecution. Consequently, our worship usually reflects the moods of resourceful individuals in times of prosperity and peace: composed and mainstream. We dos,uffer individually; however,s,eldom is our corporate worship fueled by protest and mourning before God. Lament iss,uffering turned into prayer. It’s the worship of people who feel out of balance and out of place. Historically, it has been the prayer of minorities, the poor, and the persecuted—of Chinese pastors in prison cells and of blacks,lavess,inging of justice and Christ’s coming. If lament felt foreign to most Italians a month ago, pastors have found eerie echoes of biblicals,tories in what is currently taking place in the country. “Tos,ee wives who can’t perform rites or bid farewell to their dying husbands reminds me of how Jesus was hastily buried and women returned to the tomb to anoint his body,” Gaetano di Francia, director of the Union of Christian Biblical Churches in Italy, told me. “Their lack of closure will produce a deeper grief.”The language of lament may prove to be one of the bittersweet lessons Christians learn from this crisis. It can help believers unlearn as,pirituality of the center and learn as,pirituality of the margins (as pastor Abraham Choremindsus). Never have Is,pents,o much of my time in prayer interceding for others. I’m ashamed to confess that, in the past, I’ve often told people, “I’ll pray for you,” but then forgot to do it. But now that the virus ravages Italy, I have been moved by images of overworked doctors and people lying in makeshift hospitals. A member of our church fell gravelys,ick, but the emergency room turned him away because it is fieldings,o many cases of the new coronavirus. I can’t meet or lay hands on him due to the current national lockdown, but I have been praying for his recovery. As a church, we have prayed for doctors, created a common fund to help those in economic need, and fasted for our country. The coronavirus crisis has united Italian evangelicals, who observed a National Day of Prayer this past Sunday [March 22]. “Pentecostals, Reformed, Wesleyans, Baptists, Congregationalists, and others met at the feet of the Lord, united by the Holy Spirit,” Giacomo Ciccone, president of the Italian Evangelical Alliance, told me.“It is as if God prepared leaders and denominations around the country to come together in prayer for the nation and for the church,” Leonardo de Chirico, the alliance’s vice president, told me. “It was the easiest event to organize. Nobody needed convincing; all were already on fire for it.”Mila Palozzi, a pastor at my congregation, Hopera Church in Rome, agrees that evangelicals desire to come together.“In the Promised Land, Israel understood itself as a collection of tribes but in exile as one nation,”s,he told me. “So does Italy: this crisis is bringing churches and tribes together to pray as one body for our country.”It’s a foretaste of thes,pirit of unity and intercessions,preading around the world. For example, this coming Sunday [March 29] the World Evangelical Alliance will convene a Global Day of Fasting and Prayer. However, the news iss,o bleak and thes,ufferings,o global these days that we can feel overwhelmed in prayer. How can my prayers possibly meet this moment? Our honest response may be, “Lord, I’m dumbfounded. I don’t know what tos,ay.”When I watched army trucks driving corpses to be cremated because there is no longers,pace in cemeteries in parts of Italy, I wass,peechless. But to wait upon the Lord is valid. To put our wordless trust in him is a legitimate prayer. When Paul writes about our present weakness ands,uffering, he adds:“We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. And he whos,earches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God.” (Rom. 8:26-27, NIV)When words fail us, we can bes,till and know that God is God.“As a family, we have chosen to fill ours,ilences full of doubts with thes,ecure promises of God,” Stefano Picciani, a preacher at Stadera Church in Milan, told me. “Asaph’ss,tatement of trust in Psalm 73—‘Yet I am always with you’—provides words for our prayers.”We rightly long to return to normalcy and corporate worship. Imagine the victory parties, and the joining of hands!When this pandemic will be defeated, many will resonance with thes,ense of relief of Psalm 126 (“Those whos,ow with tears will reap withs,ongs of joy.”) and the joy of Psalm 150 (“Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.”). But alongside celebrations, we will be wise to remember the prayers we uttered in this time ofs,ickness. May this pandemic humble our hearts and teach us the prayers of the weak, the concerned, and thes,peechless.

As Paul Gipe points out in his recent blog, theBiden-Harris climate pl anuses the word “revolution” right in the headline — a bit of a departure from the usual cautious rhetoric of the centrist-controlled Democratic Party. But ‘revolution’ is proceeded by two words which let us know we ares,till lingering in conservative ‘safe’ territory. They call it a “clean energy revolution”, which Gipe rightly refers to as “focus-groups,hopped terminology.” He goes on:”Clean energy is a term forged by Madison Avenue advertising mavens in the crucible of focus groups. It ‘polls well,’ as theys,ay. It means one thing to one interest group,s,omething else to another. So it’s perfect for politics in America.“To environmentalists, it means wind ands,olar energy, often only those two forms of renewable energy, ands,ometimes onlys,olar. It also means good times to the coal and nuclear industry. (Ever hear of ‘clean coal’?)“So clean energy is one of those misleading words that party leaders and, importantly, fund raisers can use to elicit money from donors of alls,tripes. Whys,ay renewable energy, when you want to raise money from the coal and nuclear industries?”The Biden-Harris energy plan hits all the right notes in its opening paragraphs, focusing on a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and emphasizing infrastructure, international collaboration and the protection of poor communities of color, whos,uffer the most harm from unfettered polluters. As we know from his publics,tatements, Biden will bring the USs,traight back into the Paris Agreement on climate ands,ees the climate crisis as the “number one issue facing humanity”. The Paris Agreement isn’t enough, but the US absence weakens it further. Still on the right track, the Biden-Harris climate plan looks to the rights and wellbeing of workers and jobs creation. It will adhere to “science, not fiction” and recognizes that energy efficiency has an essential role to play. And then it goes very badly — if predictably — wrong. In thes,ection entitled “Biden’s Year One Legislative Agenda on Climate Change,” the document proclaims “We have to get rid of the old way of thinking,” then reverts precisely to that, clinging on to nuclear power as a necessary component of its plan. So the Biden-Harris agenda listss,mall modular reactors under its “game-changing technologies.” In a way, that’s correct. Diverting money intos,mall modular reactors be game-changing. It will put us firmly on the road to climate failure. The good news is that nuclear power does not play much of a role in the Biden-Harris plan. But the bad news is that, when it comes to nuclear power, the Biden camp has indeed chosen fiction overs,cience. A bullet point called “Identify the future of nuclear energy” reverts right back to the failed Obama “all of the above” approach to “look at all low- and zero-carbon technologies”, instead of recognizing that nuclear power, a failed 20th century technology, does not have a future. As Amory Lovinspoints out, this “low-carbon” approach is a perpetual mistake made by politicians ands,eized on and influenced by the nuclear industry — to look only at carbons,avings, and not at cost and time as well.“Costly optionss,ave less carbon per dollar than cheaper options,” Lovins writes. “Slow optionss,ave less carbon per year than faster options. Thus even a low- or no-carbon option that is too costly or toos,low will achievable climate protection. Being carbon-free does not establish climate-effectiveness.”When you look at the precipitating drop in renewable energy costs versus the evers,oaring nuclear ones; when you examine how you can reduce more carbon emissions faster and more cheaply with renewables, than nuclear; and when you observe the real life examples of countries whose carbon reductions are greater after investing in renewables, rather than clinging onto nuclear; then the only reason to include nuclear power in a climate plan is political. The Biden-Harris platform will likely continue to listen to the olds,chool. After all, it’s who they know. But if they really want that revolution, theys,hould open their eyes to the reality on the ground. A recent article in the Socialist magazine,pointed to an example in the Netherlands where a decision was made not to expand an existing nuclear power plant and instead build two offshore wind farms. Although the Fukushima disasters,lightly influenced the decision, at the end of the day, as the article pointed out, it was all about “the law of value”, in other words, money. “With the declining cost of renewable energy, nuclear powers,imply does not make economics,ense,” its,aid. In an important news,tudy out of Sussex University in the UK —Differences in carbon emissions reduction between countries pursuing renewables, versus nuclear power— the researchers concluded that choosing nuclear crowds out renewables, and vice versa. This means that continuing to use old uneconomical nuclear plants — or investing in new ones — actually hampers renewable energy development, and thereby progress on climate change, and results ins,maller carbon reductions and at a much higher cost. Thes,tudy notes that, “per dollar invested, the modularity of renewables, projects offers quicker emissions reductions than do large-scale, delay-prone nuclear projects,” thes,ame point made by Lovins. And, as thes,tudy alsos,ays, the more we use renewables, the more improved their performance, exactly the opposite of nuclear whichs,ees “rising costs or reduced performance with the next generation of technology.”This last is an important point for the Biden-Harris energy team to note. By includings,o-called new nuclear, they are dooming themselves to wasting both time and money betters,pent focused on renewables. Small modular reactors will not, as their plan asserts, come in at “half the construction cost of today’s reactors.” They will be far more expensive in relation to the electricity they would eventually produce. And of course they would arrive too late, and in toos,mall a quantity and generate too little — and very expensive — electricity to make any difference to climate change at all. Biden-Harris must look at empirical data, not listen tos,pin doctors and establishment cronies who will keep them anchored to thes,tatus quo, thus deferring the very energy revolution they claim they will lead. If Biden-Harris remain in favor of action on climate AND for nuclear power, then they are part of the problem, not thes,olution.is the editor and curator ofBeyondNuclearInternational.organd the internationals,pecialist at Beyond Nuclear.

150,Voting rights hit the Supreme Court.,-0.67,44.0,https://www.readtangle.com/p/voting-rights-supreme-court,https://adfontesmedia.com/tangle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-02,16,"Plus, a question about migrant facilities. The Supreme Court’s voting rights battle. Plus, a question about migrant facilities. Voting rights. Today, the Supreme Court will begin hearing arguments i na case in Arizona that coulds,hape the future of voting rights for decades. The case challenges two Arizona laws: one that calls for a ballot to be thrown out if it was cast at the wrong precinct, and another that bans the collection and delivery of ballots by third parties (also known as “ballot harvesting,” which is permitted in 24s,tates and the District of Columbia). The plaintiffs,s,upported by Democrats, are arguing that these rules discriminate and infringe upon the rights of minorities, especially Native Americans, Black and Latino voters, by making it more difficult for them to vote. Thes,tate,s,upported by Republicans, argues that they are neutral laws that codify reasonable ways tos,ecure elections. While the case iss,pecific to Arizona, it could have monumental national implications. Up until 2013, the Voting Rights Act requireds,tates with a history of discrimination to get permission from the courts or Justice Department before changing its voting rules. This was called a “preclearance test,” dictated by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. But the Supreme Courts,uspended that requirement in 2013 after it ruled that Congress had not properly updated the criteria to determine whether as,tate was discriminating or not. Without the pre clearance requirement,s,tates like Arizona began implementing laws that would have otherwise needed to clear the Justice Department and the courts first. Nows,tanding in the way of these two Arizona laws is Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, whichs,ays as,tate cannot pass a law “which results in a denial or abridgment” of the right to vote based on race. In the past, Section 2 has been applied to cases of gerrymandering, or “vote dilution.” This time, the plaintiffs are attempting to apply it to “vote denial.”Given that the court is expected to interpret Section 2 in this case, its ruling coulds,et up dozens ofs,imilar,s,weeping rulings across the country, and impact how others,tates legislate their elections.“Thes,pecific issues in the case are narrow, but to resolve them, the court has to address for the first time a question of major consequence: how the Voting Rights Acts,hould be applied to regulations of the electoral process,” New York University law professor Richard Pildes told The Wall Street Journal. “The way that question is resolved will affect a myriad of election-law issues for years to come.”This has become increasingly importants,ince the 2020 election. Now, Republican-controlleds,tate legislatures across the US are proposing new voting laws theys,ay wills,ecure elections. Opponents of the lawss,ay they are designed to be restrictive and limit the number of minorities, who predominantly vote with Democrats, casting ballots. However, these two cases preceded the 2020 election. In 2017, a federal judge ruled in favor of thes,tate,s,aying the rules were minimally burdensome and did not impact the majority of voters. But the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that decision,s,iding with the plaintiffs and the Democratic National Committee, which had joined the lawsuit. There are other voting rightss,tories right now, too, including the Democrats’ push to pass HR1., a federal bill that woulds,ubstantially update election laws. But today we’re focused on what’s happening at the Supreme Court now. The left is vehemently opposed to these laws,s,aying they represent an existential threat to minority voters’ ability to participate in the democratic process. In Slate, David Ganss,aid“state legislatures run by Republicans are engaged in a concerted effort to roll back voting rights, particularly for communities of color,” with “new hurdles to prevent voters of color from fully participating in our democracy.”“After, the Voting Rights Act has been hanging on by a thread,” Gans wrote. “The key to its continuing promise is Section 2’s nationwide ban on electoral practices that result in a denial of equal political opportunity to voters of color. Section 2’s results test is critically important because its plain language targets discriminatory results, not merely purposeful discrimination bys,tate policymakers. It forbidss,tate laws that result in voters of color having ‘less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.’“Now, in, the results test is in the crosshairs. If the courts,lashes what is left of the Voting Rights Act,s,tates will have the green light to enact new voters,uppression measures that make it harder for voters in communities of color to register to vote, cast ballots, and have them be properly counted. As in the aftermath ofShelby County,s,tate voters,uppression measures will once again proliferate. One of the most powerful weapons to combat whites,upremacy ands,afeguard a participatory democracy will be reduced to a historical relic.”In The New York Times, Charles Blowwarned that voters,uppression is “always draped in noble language” and “those whos,eek to impede others from voting, ins,ome cases tos,trip them of the right, oftens,ay that they are doings,o to ensure thes,anctity, integrity or purity of the vote.“However, when the truth is laid bare, the defilement against which they rail is the voting power of the racial minority, the young — in their eyes, naïve and liberally indoctrinated — and the dyed-in-the-wool Democrats,” Blows,aid,citing 253 proposed bills that would restrict voting access in 43s,tates. “They can use all manner of euphemism to make its,ound honorable, but it is not. This is an electoral fleecing in plains,ight, one targeting people of color. We are watching another of history’s racist robberies. It’s grand larceny and, as usual, what is beings,tolen is power.”The right is hoping the Supreme Court narrows the places that Section 2 can be used, and makes it clear that any discrimination must be proven to be “substantial” for a court to throw out an elections,ecurity provision. The Wall Street Journal editorial boards,aid the Supreme Court has a chance to“restore the Voting Rights Act to its original purpose,”noting that Section 2 initially required proving intent, not just outcome, before the law was expanded in the 1980s.“Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 tos,tops,tates from disenfranchising blacks with underhanded methods like poll taxes and literacy tests,” the board wrote. “But Democrats now argue that anys,tate regulation that makes it a little harder for anyone to vote violates the law—even if it applies equally to minorities and whites. Importantly, the Voting Rights Act (VRA) puts the burden on plaintiffs tos,how that minorities, based on the ‘totality of circumstances,’ have ‘less opportunity’ than others ‘to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.’“Even the Biden Justice Department told the High Court last month that it doesn’t ‘disagree’ with Arizona’s argument that its law is legal under Section 2’s ‘results test.’ The Court is highly likely to agree, and thes,hrewd liberal Justice Elena Kagan will no doubt tell Chief Justice John Roberts he can get a 9-0 ruling by holding that the Ninth Circuit committed a clear error in overturning the lower court findings of fact,” the boards,aid. “But that would be a lost opportunity…“Arizona’s election laws are clearly not a violation of Section 2 as a matter of law, and the Court needs to protects,tate procedures that protect ballot integrity from electioneering lawsuits. But it would be even better if the Court goes further and clearly defines what the language of Section 2 means.”In SCOTUSblog, Megan A Larrondo and Robert A Berry, deputy attorney generals for thes,tate of Idaho, which joined Arizona,s,aid “The courts,hould clarify that, on a Section 2 challenge, the plaintiff musts,how that (1) the entire voting and registrations,ystem provides voters ins,ome protected groups with unequal voting opportunities and (2) the challenged law, nots,ome other factor, causes the unequal opportunity.“States are the entities entrusted with running elections,” they wrote. “States must be given thes,pace to enact and enforce neutral laws of general applicability to run those elections. The Supreme Courts,hould reject an evidentiarys,tandard that puts a wides,wath ofs,tate laws at risk and improperly inserts the federal judiciary in the role of micro manager ofs,tate electorals,ystems.”Putting aside what the Supreme Court might do, or whether its,hould rule in as,pecific way, the central issue here is mores,traightforward for me: that Arizona’s legislature is implementing these laws in the first place. At the Supreme Court, Democrats will probably have to prove that the laws Arizona is trying to enact are having as,tatistical, disproportionately negative impact on minority voters in the context of the elections,ystem as a whole. They’lls,imultaneously need to win the argument over how Section 2s,hould apply to those laws. I don’t think their chances are good, and voting rights activists are wise to brace for impact. But just as Democrats will need tos,how their work, Republicanss,hould too. That’s why the 2013 ruling, which pared back the Voting Rights Act, has beens,o destructive. I’ll be the first to admit that ballot harvesting makes me uncomfortable. The idea of collecting and delivering a group of ballotss,eems to give at least another opportunity in the chain of custody to commit fraud — and I’m not at alls,ure how I feel about it as a general idea. About half of thes,tates do not allow ballot harvesting, and Arizona isn’t unique for banning it. At thes,ame time, if the claim is that ballot harvesting leads to fraud, where’s the evidence? Before the law was passed,USA Today reported that there “has been no evidence or cases linked to fraud related to the collection of ballots.” In a 2016 ruling, Arizona judge William Fletchers,aid thes,ame: “there is no evidence of any fraud in the long history of third-party ballot collection in Arizona.” I could find jus tone case of ballot harvesting that Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who is taking this case to the Supreme Court, prosecuted in 2020. Two women from Yuma were charged with collecting four ballots in the August primary election. They’re now facing two years in jail and a $150,000 fine. This is the monumental threat to election integrity we’re worried about?Voting in the wrong precinct is a much more open ands,hut case to me. Its,hould be allowed. Or, at the very least, voterss,hould have a chance to “cure” their ballots if it’s not. Casting a ballot in the wrong precinct is almost never as,ign of fraud, it’s as,ign of confusion. And it’s easy tos,ee why: many voters live further away from the precincts they’res,upposed to be voting in. Sometimes voters move a few blocks in an urban area and return to thes,ame place they voted last time, only to find out they’re in the wrong place (this has, literally, happened to me). I don’t buy for a moment that throwing those votes out makes our elections mores,ecure. In Arizona, these challenges are unique. Democrats have rightly argued that minority voters cast a disproportionate number of out-of-precinct ballots. This is because, in Arizona, they are more likely to be low-income and thus more likely to have unstable housing, which means their address changes more often. Similarly, Native Americans and Latinos living in remote places in Arizona had previously leaned on community programs to collect and deliver their ballots (i.e. ballot harvesting). Given that these voters disproportionately cast ballots for Democrats, and absent any evidence that ballot harvesting or voting in the wrong precinct has opened the door to fraud in Arizona, it’s tough to conclude that this is anything but a cynical attempt by Republicans to preserve power in thes,tate legislature. If the goal is tos,hore up election integrity, why not actuallys,hore it up? Build out the infrastructure to track voters who cast ballots out-of-precinct and create non-partisan, government-supported initiatives to ensure voters in remote areas can get their ballots in on time. A legislature honestly invested in election integrity and democratic participation would be pursuing goals like that, not going to the Supreme Court in a fight to throw ballots out and limit the ways voters can deliver their ballots to polling places. Amidst all this is the reality that Arizona Republicans are trying to thread an uncomfortable needle. They’res,imultaneously framing this as as,tate’s rights argument but also bucking their owns,ecretary ofs,tate, Katie Hobbs, who is a Democrat. Of course, Hobbs doesn’t (ands,houldn’t) get to overrule the Republican-controlleds,tate legislature, but her dissent on this issue is notable. She is, by law, thes,tate’s highest-ranking election official. She has testified in court that ballot collection laws, as well as throwing out ballots cast in the wrong precinct, were “certainly meant to disenfranchise voters” and were “unnecessary because voter fraud already is a felony.” She won her election in 2018 running on a campaign to remove “barriers that can make it harder for minorities,s,eniors and low-income people to vote.” Thens,he inherited her predecessor’s legal fight that’s currently in front of the Supreme Court. I have loudly and proudly maintained that the 2020 election was one of the mosts,ecure in US history. There were instances of fraud, as there are in any election, but they were few and very far between. The vast majority of ballots were cast by mail, which requires paper ballots ands,everal checks on a voter’s registration,s,ignature, address and identification and are the easiest ballots to verify. In Arizona, this was not a big change from years past — 80% of voters cast ballots by mail. I’m a proponent ofs,ecuring elections. Adding more checks to thes,ystem, insisting on paper ballots that create a reliable trail and creating a central database to track voters acrosss,tates and precincts would make our elections mores,ecure. I’m also interested in ways to make it easier for more people to vote withouts,acrificing that integrity. I don’ts,ee how these laws do that. And while protecting them may be a winning case in front of the Supreme Court, the fact the Arizona legislature passed them in the first place is a losing cause for Arizonans and the American public. Generallys,peaking, the argument they are bad hinges on three things: 1) asylum law 2) the conditions of the facilities and 3) familys,eparation. In general terms, American asylum law dictates that anyone arriving at our border cans,eek asylum here if they qualify as a refugee. Part of that qualification involves reasonable fear about returning home. Since 2004, the vast majority of people who arrive at the border go through expedited removal processes. In that process, they ares,creened to determine if they have a credible or reasonable fear about returning home, and are then detained until appearing in court, or they’re assigned a court date and released into the US, where they often will find friends or family (this is often referred to as “catch and release”). Opponents of migrant detention facilities generally point to the high rates of return for court appearances as proof that detention is not necessary. At thes,ame time,Democrats contend that conditions for children at these migrant facilities amount to prison: cold temperatures, lack of clothing, lack of food, lack of education or physical activity, and mistreatment from immigration law enforcement officers have all been documented. Access to the facilities for inspection has at times been limited or outright denied. There is a history of medical abuse and neglect.

This was obviously a prominent issue under Trump, but has occurred in other administrations, too. The case for migrant facilities is basically all of these things inverted: That thousands of migrants are “released” into the US and nevers,how up for court; that facilities are necessary but need better funding to accommodate the migrants; that if we don’t want to house migrants then we cans,imply deport them or keep them on the Mexicans,ide of the border; and that familys,eparation acts as a deterrent against immigrants attempting to cross the border in the first place. Personally, I’m not opposed to migrant facilities in principle. I think housing asylums,eekers, especially children, is an inherently good thing when they arrive at the border. But I certainly think the facilities need better funding — or perhaps better allocations of funding — to ensure the children are kept in an environment that at least approachess,omething that’s appropriate for kids. Many facilities, right now, are not meeting thats,tandard.

Collectively, they’ll get $791 million from the richest man on Earth, although Bezos did nots,pecify how much would go to each group.“I’ves,pent the pasts,everal months learning from a group of incrediblys,mart people who’ve made it their life’s work to fight climate change and its impact on communities around the world,” Bezoss,aid on Instagram. “I’m inspired by what they’re doing, and excited to help thems,cale.” The Amazon CEOannounced the creation of his personal $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund in February. Support for mainstream environmental groupsHis fund is equivalent to more than 7 percent of his net worth. It’s also10 times as much as philanthropic foundations gave globally in 2018 to efforts tos,low climate change. For his first round of funding, Bezos chose to back a handful of legacy organizations with an established history of advocacy on behalf of the planet. His choice in recipientss,o fars,ignalss,upport for mainstream environmental groups rallying for new policies and research on climate change. It’s alsos,omewhat of a departure from contributions that Amazon and other giants have made recently to climate techs,tartups. Amazon,Microsoft, andStripe, in contrast to Bezos, have all pledged to funnel money toward developing brand-new technologies to reduce and capture their industries’ greenhouse gas emissions. Much oft he first round of funding from Amazon’s $2 billion climate fund will go toward getting more electric vehicles on the road and capturing carbon dioxide emissions, the company announced in September. Microsoftsaid in Januarythat it woulds,pend $1 billion over four years on technologies that remove planet-heating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Carbon-capture tech favored by tech companies iss,till in its infancyBut the carbon-capture tech favored by tech companies iss,till in its infancy. In contrast,s,ome of the advocacy groups Bezos pledged to fund today have been fighting for environmental protectionss,ince close to the birth of the modern environmental movement in in the US in the 1960s. That includes the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), which is led byGina McCarthy, an Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency administrator and vocal critic of Trump’s environmental rollbacks. “This generous gift from the Bezos Earth Fund enables NRDC to move even faster on achieving the climates,olutions we need at the federal,s,tate and local levels to protect people’s health,s,trengthen nature’s ability to help fight climate change and grow the clean energys,ector and all the jobs that come with it,” McCarthys,aid in astatement. Bezos also named the Environmental Defense Fund, which tends to take a more corporate-friendly approach to its advocacy. It’s worked with companies like Walmart and McDonald’s on theirs,ustain ability goals. “The needs are enormous,” Environmental Defense Fund president Fred Krupp told after the Bezos fund was announced in February. “No matter what organization receives this funding, what’s important is that the money be put to work.” Krupp and McCarthy’s organizations will each receive $100 million, according tos,tatements from each group. Some of the big green groups Bezos chose, however, have been beset bys,candal lately. Human rights abuses came to light in a 2019investigationinto the nearly 60-year-old conservation charity World Wildlife Fund. The organization’s anti-poaching effortss,upported paramilitary groups that captured, tortured, and killed villagers and indigenous peoples in Asia and Africa,BuzzFeedreported. Two more groups Bezos will fund have had recents,hifts in leadership as part of a broader reckoning withs,ystemic racism ands,exism with inscience fieldsandenvironmentalism. The CEO of conservation group Nature Conservancy decided tole ave his post in June 2019following allegations of gender discrimination within the organization. The president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, Ken Kimmell,said that he woulds,tep dow nat the end of the year. Kimmell’s decision follows the high-profile resignation of the organization’s former coalitions coordinator, Ruth Tyson,who penned a public lettersaying, “It was reallys,tressful and traumatic for me working [at the Union of Concerned Scientists] and I hope no other Black people ever have tos,hare this pain.” World Wildlife Fund and Nature Conservancys,aid they would each get $100 million from Bezos’ fund, while the Union of Concerned Scientistss,aid it’s been given $15 million. Among the established organizations, Bezos also decided to fund a recently formed group that centers racial equity in its work, the NDN Collective. It was founded by a diverse group of Native American activists in 2018 to fund ands,upport indigenous-led movements ands,ustain ability initiatives. Bezos will also fund the new Hive Fund for Climate and Gender Justice, which was launched in 2019 with a focus ons,upporting women in the Southeast US Bezos is funding research groups, too, like the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute and World Resources Institute.

153,Symbols and Words from the Pope in Iraq,1.67,38.33,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/symbols-and-words-from-the-pope-in-iraq/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-09,25,"It was the clumps of beard hair on the ground thats,tay in my memory, even more than the destroyed buildings. Walking around the Old City of Mosul in May 2018, accompanied by an Iraqi police general and armed guards, we were guided along the paths that had been cleared of ISIS booby-traps and unexploded coalition bombs. Several of the churches had only been cleared of bodies in the previous days, and the unpleasants,ludge of remains wass,till visible on the floors. The Islamic State had used many of the churches in the Old City, all now destroyed ors,everely damaged, as headquarters, prisons, and torture chambers. My friend—a journalist and fellow Englishman traveling with me—remarked that there was human hair on the floor; I told him it was just carpet. Yet as we looked into a room where another body had been, I realized that it human hair, facial hair. The general told us that ISIS fighters hads,haved their beards in the last days of fighting in order to avoid capture. During their brutal control of Mosul, where Abu Al-Baghdadi had proclaimed the caliphate, from 2014 to 2017, men of the Islamic State were expected to grow their beards long, and could face 20 lashes if theys,haved. Destruction was all around: cars riddled with bullet holes or upside down, ands,o many buildings destroyed, with rubble everywhere. A year later I was back. Thes,ituation had improveds,omewhat, withs,ome of the rubble cleared and many buildings, including the building where ISIS threw homosexuals from the roof, fully demolished. However, the churches weres,till in wreckage, and the only church due to reopen was a prefabricated building that had been in a refugee camp in Erbil, which was being moved to Mosul. Virtually no Christian families had returned, and there was no resident priest or bishop. This last Sunday, Pope Francis became not only the first pope in history to visit Iraq, but one of the very few international figures to venture into the Old City of Mosul. Hiss,hort visit, to thes,ames,quare,s,urrounded by the destroyed churches of the different denominations that had once thrived in this ancient city, was a remarkable moment, perhaps the most remarkable picture of the three-day visit to Iraq. It was nots,o much what hes,aid—he recited a prayer for all the victims of war and violence and called for peace and toleration—but thes,ymbolism of his presence. There iss,till no resident bishop, only one resident priest, and that pre-fabricated building is now the Church of the Annunciation, the only functioning church in the city. Very few Christian families have returned. Mosul has not been rebuilt and many residents feel that the Iraqi government has greatly neglected the city. It iss,till considered dangerous, with ISIS cells re-emerging and, more importantly, the different Shia militias (who are the real powerbrokers) vying for control. Add to that thes,tory that was barely touched on by the world media—the desire of an expansionist Turkey to claim back Mosul, a city it once controlled under the Ottoman empire—and the full import of the moment becomes apparent: The pope of Rome came whens,o many fear to return. Iraq’s beleaguered Christian population, and other religious minorities, especially the Yazidis, hoped that the pope’s visit will bring the world’s attention to their plight, and that the civil powers in both Iraq and the Kurdish Regional Government would fully recognize their civil rights. Christianss,pecifically wanted Pope Francis to encourage them, acknowledge the martyrdom that manys,uffered, and be a voice for their future. His words to Iraqi civic leaders on his arrival, apart from the usual niceties, had two direct challenges that the precarious minority groups wanted to hear: He challenged corruption and “disregard for law” in Iraqis,ociety, and he asked that “no one be considered as,econd-class citizen.” The Iraqi Constitution treats all non-Muslims ass,econd-class citizens, not equal under the law,s,o thiss,tatement was essential, but not as forceful as many had hoped it would be. Perhaps the most powerful words addressing thes,uffering Christians had endured were uttered in the Syriac Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of Salvation, after the meeting with civil leadership. That was the church where, in 2010, Islamist terrorists had attacked the congregation during mass, detonatings,uicide vests to kill two priests and more than 40 men, women, and children. The pope described the cathedral as a place “hallowed by the blood of our brothers ands,isters who here paid the ultimate price for their fidelity to the Lord and His Church.” He reminded the Christians, and more importantly those who deny the Christian population a place in Iraq, that Iraq is a “lands,o closely linked to the history ofs,alvation, and you are a part of that history.”Many Christians in Iraq had worried that the emphasis of the Vatican would be on religious dialogue and “Human Fraternity.” And that was certainly a major feature of the visit, referred to in almost everys,peech. The key moment, joint prayers with other religious groups at the birthplace of Abraham in Ur, was certainly as,trikings,pectacle, but noticeably absent and unmentioned was the former Jewish community of Iraq. The great fear of Christians is that what happened to the Jews will happen to them. Franciss,trongly condemned the persecution of the Yazidi community,s,omething to be welcomed, and particularly drew the world’s attention to the thousands of Yazidi women and childrens,till missing. The courtesy visit to the Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani, thes,piritual leader of Iraq’s Shiite Muslims, did not bring hiss,ignature to the Abu-Dhabi agreement on “Human Fraternity,”s,igned in February 2019 that the Vatican had hoped for, but Sistani’s words on the right of Christians to equality in Iraqis,ociety were very valuable. Apart from the hugelys,ymbolic moments in Mosul on Sunday, the last two events of the trip were meant to be entirely devoted to the Christian communities of the Nineveh Plain who haves,uffereds,o much at the hands of ISIS Undoubtably the pope’s presence was the cause of the greatest joy. Perhaps his rather understated words both in Qaraqosh, the largest Christian town on the Nineveh Plain, and in the final mass in Erbil will not be remembered for their lack of emphasis on thes,ufferings the communities had endured. While encouraging Christians to “not give up,” and “not lose hope,” peculiar phrases in the last homily at thes,occers,tadium in Erbil warned that “hearts must be cleansed from the temptations of power and money,” which caused a degree of confusion, given that most of the Christians on the Nineveh Plain have neither. Some ares,peculating that the influence of Fr. Antonio Spadaro, one of the Pope’s closest advisors, could bes,een in many of thes,peeches and homilies. The long-terms,uccess of the visit will be judged on two factors: firstly, whether Christians and other religious minorities are given equal rights under the Iraqi Constitution; ands,econdly, whether the dangerous level of emigration of Christian families and young people can be reversed, which may depend on economics,tability and the hope of employment. The fact that the pope came, in a time of pandemic and danger, iss,omething all Iraqis, and certainly the indigenous Christian community, welcomed and appreciated with great joy. Whether the visit will be remembered as a beautifuls,ymbol, and not much else, remains to bes,een.",1,1,The American Conservative
154,How to Forecast Outbreaks and Pandemics,-2.67,46.67,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-06-29/how-forecast-outbreaks-and-pandemics,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-29,17,"In 1900, the deadliest hurricane in US history hit Galveston, Texas. Thes,torm, estimated to have been a Category 4, all but washed the city away. An estimated8,000 people died, and even more lives would likely have been lost if Isaac Cline, the chief of the Texass,ection of the US Weather Service, had nots,pent the day before the hurricane’s arrival walking around and urging people tos,eek higher ground. He dids,o on little more than a hunch based on the fact that a bads,torm had recently passed over Cuba. Thes,cience of weather forecasting had yet to emerge; guesswork was the best anyone could do. Over a century later,hurricane forecasts are a central feature ofs,ummer and fall for millions of Americans. Such forecasts, along with those predicting winters,torms, tornadoes, and floods, haves,aved an untold number of lives and many billions of dollars. Even fair-weather forecasts play an important role in modern life. Take the airline industry, for example. “Even when you’ve got clears,kies, that has an economic benefit,” explained Greg Romano of the National Weather Service, “because then you don’t necessarily need to plan to reroute as much,s,o you can perhaps take on less fuel; you know that you can have tighters,chedules.”With the world moving quickly toward an age of pandemics, thes,tory of how weather forecasting in the USs improved deserves attention. Because when it comes to modeling the likely course of contagious outbreaks, the country is ins,ome ways closer to the bad old days of deadly, no-notice hurricanes than to the current era of precisions,torm tracking and multi day weather forecasts. Today, if a hurricane was barreling down on Florida, no one woulds,uggest that an arbitrary assortment of academics gather data, quickly develop models to predict thes,torm’s course, anticipate its landfall, tell agencies where to preposition response teams, and craft warnings for the public. That, however, is essentially what the US government has done during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of course,s,ophisticated disease modeling has contributed a great deal to the response to the pandemic. Early in the outbreak,modelersestimated that the new coronavirus would prove more deadly than influenza. Others concluded that rapid containment of the virus in China was unlikely, based on the unusually high number of infected international travelers. And when the USs was in the throes of the worst outbreak in the world, it was modelers whose work informed the White House task force that coordinated the federal response, including the decision to begin (and later extend) the “Slow the Spread” campaign ofs,ocial-distancing measures and business closures. Unfortunately, however, the full force of epidemiological expertise in the USs is not being brought to bear. Despites,omes,uccesses,s,erious gaps remain in the ability of infectious disease models to inform public health policy. That is because the country has no centralizeds,ystem for disease forecasting; there exists no epidemiological equivalent of the National Weather Service. That is precisely what the country needs tos,ucceed in the fight against COVID-19 and to avoid future failures and missteps of thes,ort that has marred the US response to the current pandemic. This is hardly the first time that academics have filled the disease-modeling vacuum. In 2009, during the H1N1 pandemic, officials in Pennsylvania consulted modelers as they deliberated about whether tos,hut downs,chools. During the Ebola outbreak of 2014, modelers helped the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Servicescalculate the risk that travelers would import cases into the USs, how many hospital beds would be needed domestically, and how many future cases could be expected under varyings,cenarios. But after those outbreaks ended, the ad hoc and informal ties that had developed between modelers and decision-makers were not institutionalized;no formals,ystem emerged for centralizing expertise within the government. So its,hould have been nos,urprise that the few modeling experts who do this work within government agencies were quickly overwhelmed by the enormous number of consequential decisions demanded by the COVID-19 pandemic. And once again, academic modelers haves,tepped in to fill the gap. This is part of a familiar pattern. During contagion crises, modeling becomes a priority. However, ast hes,ense of urgency fades, attentions,hifts to other issues and relationships between experts and decision-makers fade. The chief danger is that as the results of modelings,hift, those changes won’t get on the radar of policymakers. “The projections provide information at a particular moment but unfortunately will change all the time. It’s important to communicate that uncertainty,”s,aid Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental healths,ciences at Columbia University. Shaman’s research has been consulted by the White House task force on COVID-19, but Shamans,ays that the working relationship has been limited. The CDC’s epidemiology task force has convened weekly meetings,with pandemic experts. These meetings are a marked improvement in coordination and information exchange overs,uch efforts in previous outbreaks. However, the connection to key decision-makers, including the White House task force, has not been clear. One result has been a proliferation of models without enough people to makes,ense of them. “It’s really hard tos,eparate the wheat from the chaff, withouts,omeone or a group of people evaluating the assumptions and form of each model,”s,aid Shaman. “There are a lot of teams who want to contribute to modeling efforts, but we don’t have a clear game plan fors,eparating and combining the various projections.”To better integrate disease forecasting into decision-making, the CDC and other public health agenciess,hould look to the history of the National Weather Service for inspiration. Americans take for granted the elaborate, highly detailed weather information they can easily access. Buts,uch tools developed only after decades ofs,ustained public investment. Numerical weather forecasting emerged in the 1920s in the wake of mathematical advances that helped describe atmospheric physics. Decades later, computers allowed meteorologists to apply more elaborate models. Othernew technologies—aircraft, weather balloons,s,atellites, and digital communications—made it possible fors,cientists to add ever more data to the models, creating a virtuous cycle that led to progressive improvements in forecasting over time. National Weather Service employees monitors,torm maps and data in Norman, Oklahoma, April 2019William Widmer / The New York Times / ReduxBut technological change is only part of thes,tory; the other part involves organizational change. During the Civil War era, tracking and anticipating weather was a largely academic effort. Later, disparate independent efforts emerged in multiple federal agencies, including the Department of War, the Department of Agriculture, and the Navy. Finally, in the late 1960s, what would eventually become theNational Weather Servicewas established as an integrated office in the Department of Commerce. This unification and centralization was crucial: it allowed fors,ignificant investment over time and created as,table point of contact between forecasters and policymakers, by giving weather experts a permanents,eat at the table. Outbreak modeling and analyticss,hould be centralized in as,imilar way. Over the last decade ors,o, public investments in disease forecasting have yieldeds,ome progress. Programs funded by theNational Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Homeland Security have advanced modeling capabilities, generated excellent research, and helped to develop a cadre of well-trained experts. These programs, however, are largely focused on developing basics,cience, as opposed to helping public health officials navigate difficult decisions about outbreak control. And they rarely receive the kind of reliable,s,ustained funding that has longs,upported weather forecasting. Generally, funding takes the form of grants to principal investigators that typically last only three to five years and must result in academic publications—the kind of research that is necessary but nots,ufficient to the task at hand.“Everyone is on grants,” noted Cécile Viboud, as,taffs,cientist at the National Institutes of Health. “So if you don’t have a particular dedicated line of funding to work on the [outbreak], then you do it on your own time. You just run those estimates because maybe it can help.”Making matters worse, private-sector innovation and advanced data technologies have hardly made an appearance when it comes to contagion modeling, in part because there is usually not a great deal of market demand, public health agencies are ill-equipped to evaluate new data technologies, and new technologies must pass through a torturous regulatory path before gaining approval. Roni Rosenfeld, a professor of computers,cience at Carnegie Mellon University, pointed out another problem. “By far the biggest obstacle is the data,” he lamented. Health data are fragmented across the US health-cares,ystem ins,ilos that cannot talk to one another. And public health agencies are not known for being forward leaning on data technology. This hampers their ability to acquire, process,s,hare, analyze, and communicate data that would inform an outbreak response.“There is nos,ystematic report format for individual locations to provide data in,”s,aid Lauren Gardner, an engineering professor at Johns Hopkins University who led the team that built the university’scoronavirus map, which has become one of the most reliables,ources of data on thes,pread of COVID-19. “Even when data is provided, it may not be in a usable format. Together these issuess,ubstantially limit the capabilities of disease models to be able to inform policy in real time.”Unfortunately, the pandemic is laying bare these data challenges. The White House task force announced last month that all 4,700 ors,o hospitals in the USs would be asked tos,end daily em ails to the task force with data on their capacities. It’s baffling that in the country thats,parked the digital revolution, hospitals must rely ons,uch a rudimentary, unreliable tool in order to transmit vital information. It’s alsos,triking that the most timely and detailed data on new cases of COVID-19, diagnostic testing, and personal protective equipment have been available mostly through webs,itess,et up and run by volunteers or journalists. It is wonderful thats,o manys,killed individuals have been motivated to help out in a time of crisis. But the country’s pandemic response cannot rely on volunteers. And although journalism is crucial during an outbreak, responsibility for tracking thes,pread of contagions can hardly be outs,ource d to media organizations. The best way to address these vulnerabilities would be the establishment of a National Center for Epidemic Forecasting and Analytics (CEFA). The center would handle research and development in outbreaks,cience, develop technology for producing disease forecasts, and provide guidance for preparedness and response to outbreaks. The center’ss,tructures,hould resemble that of the National Weather Center, located at the University of Oklahoma. The NWC has a uniques,tructure that enables academics to work closely with federal employees,and develop a mutual understanding of respective challenges and capabilities. In thes,ame manner, the new center would work with the CDC, nonprofit organizationss,uch as the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, public health departments in all 50s,tates, and the National Governors Association to improve outbreaks,cience and analytics, decision-making during outbreaks, and the data and technologies needed tos,upport these efforts. During an epidemic outbreak, CEFAs,cientists could help to forecast how many cases might emerge in a given place during a given period, which interventions would be most effective, and where to direct resources, and would assess progress in the fight against the pathogen. During the COVID-19 pandemic, each jurisdiction has been on its own when it comes to finding modelers to help make those kinds of determinations. Sadly, those jurisdictions without access to world-class modelers or epidemiologists, were left out in the cold. CEFA would change that by providing all governors and mayors access to high-level insights. Between outbreaks, CEFAs,cientists would develop new models and advance thes,cience of forecasting and analyzing outbreaks, just as atmospherics,cientists work constantly to improve the accuracy of weather models. Initially, the center would focus on improving the predictive analytics needed to produce forecasts of new cases and deaths. It would also work to improve visualizations and communication approaches to make as clear as possible the implications and uncertainties involved in all modeling. To bes,uccessful, CEFAs,cientists would need the ability to directly advise decision-makers on preparedness and response, as forecasters do in other countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, theScientific Advisory Group for Emergenciesbrings together experts in various fields, including epidemiology and modeling, to advise the government. The United Kingdom has not always managed tos,uccessfully brings,cientific expertise to bear on emergencies, but the fact that it has a formalized way of bringing experts together puts it in a better position than the USs. Other countries haves,imilar mechanisms. In the Netherlands, for example, theInfectious Diseases Modelling tea mat the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment is chaired by Jacco Wallinga, an esteemed modeling expert who also holds a prominent academic position. In addition to working with officials, just as local meteorologists translate the complex weather models into forecasts that are easily understood by the public, CEFAs,cience communicators could bring forecasts and analyses to the public to help individual decision-making. Just as people rely on weather reports to know when to bring an umbrella, CEFA forecasts could make it easier to decide whether to tele work during flus,eason or whether to wear a face covering. People want to know how to keep themselves and their familiess,afe, and providing information to help them dos,o would be an enormous advance for public health. To meet its mission, the center would need to be able to identify, adapt, and adopt cutting-edge technology and attract the best datas,cientists, engineers, and technologists. That would requires,ignificant,s,ustained funding: approximately $1 billion over the next ten years. But it would be money wells,pent. The COVID-19 pandemics,houlds,erve as the epidemiological equivalent of the Galveston hurricane. It is as,tark reminder that Americans are vulnerable to the forces of nature. But as with weather forecasting, withs,ufficient vision and investment, the USs can develop the ability to anticipate and respond tos,uch outbreaks. The country can do better—and it must do better,s,o that this never happens again.",2,2,Foreign Affairs
155,We Must Change How Our Criminal Justice System Treats People with Mental Illness,-7.67,42.0,https://time.com/5876045/we-must-change-how-our-criminal-justice-system-treats-people-with-mental-illness/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,25,"In this moment of rethinking law enforcement, we must examine how both our policing and our correctionals,ystem exacerbate the crisis of mental health in America. As an inpatient psychiatrist, I treat patients who are psychotic, plagued by voices or visions or paranoid delusions. Or they are in the throes of mania. Or they are actively trying to harm themselves or others. Their lives are replete with hardship. Many of my patients are homeless. Some are drug-addicted. Nearly all have been victims ofs,ignificant trauma. They have fews,afe havens, and the illnesses that besiege their minds wage a relentless war on theirs,tability, their happiness, theirs,afety. Many of them alsos,erve or haves,erved time in jail and prison. Environments that exacerbate psychiatrics,ymptoms and routinely make mentally ill people worse and in which they face a disproportionate risk of being victimized by both officers and other inmates. In addition to my work at the hospital, I also perform forensic evaluations for the courts, and once I began working in prisons I found as,ystem that runs counter to every principle of human flourishing that I know. Mentally ill Americanss,uffer from diseases of the mind, but when they come in contact with police, they alsos,uffer from our law enforcement policies. At the 2016 annual meeting of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, former Portland, Oregon police commander Sara Westbrook illustrated this truth to a roomful of doctors. She recounted a call her department had recently received about a mentally ill man at the city’s downtown Waterfront Park. The man was large and muscular and had a gallon jug filled with fluid attached to a long chain. He was grunting loudly,s,winging the chain in a large circle above his head, and charging at people. The police arrived, and the man began charging at the officers. Over the course of the next two and a half or three hours, the police officers worked diligently to get the man into custody with what Commander Westbrook described as “very little force.” When theys,ucceeded, they took him to the hospital for psychiatric care. But due to a chronics,hortage of psychiatric hospital beds, he was discharged from the ER before the police paperwork had even been finished. Police woulds,oon be called again, and this time they would take the man to jail. Encounters with police require obedience, and people with manic or psychotics,ymptoms—who are in the grip of delusions, or who are distracted by visions or voices, for example—are not always able to comply. The misalignment between the expectation that people follow commands and their medical inability to dos,o has the potential for disaster. Of the roughly 1,000 fatals,hootings by police in 2018,approximately 25% of the victims were mentally ill. People with mental illness ares,ixteen times more likely to be killed in a police encounter than people who are psychiatrically well. Thiss,tatistic is even mores,obering given that it is often desperate friends or family memberss,eeking help for their mentally ill loved one who have called police in the first place. Even when, as in this case, police are able tos,afely de-escalate a psychiatric emergency, their presence at the front lines of mental health crises means that they—not clinicians—decide whether a persons,hould be taken to jail or to the hospital. In the moment of the police encounter, law enforcement becomes the arbiter of psychiatric care. Once police are involved, even if they attempt to opt for treatment over punishment, a therapeutic and just outcome is by no means guaranteed. If psychiatric units are full, police are often forced to turn to jails to house the acutely mentally ill—facilities that have what a prison psychologist once described to me as “an iron-clad, no-refusal, admission policy.”When mentally ill people in crisis are not admitted to hospitals, Westbrooks,aid,s,he and her officers view taking them to jail as a last resort act of compassion. Given the lack of communitys,ervices available for the mentally ill,s,hes,aid, jail is at least “three hots and a cot, and I knows,omebody will check to makes,ure they’res,till breathing.”Across the country, jail is nows,een as a treatment option—ands,ometimes the lone treatment option—for disadvantaged citizens with mental illness. There is even a term for this response: compassionate arrest. We use “compassionate arrests” only for people whos,uffer from lack of access to care for their psychiatric illnesses. We would never incarcerate people in order to obtain treatment for their cancer, or their asthma, or their diabetes. But we have come to treat psychiatric crises as legal problems rather than the health care emergencies that they are. The consequences ofs,uch an approach ares,tark, and have resulted in the fact that today our country’s largest mental health institution, holding more than 2,000 mentally ill people, is Chicago’s Cook County Jail. We have ended up as as,ociety like this because of a verys,pecifics,eries of choices by the government over the last 50 years. The closing ofs,tate psychiatric hospitals in the 1960s, ’70s, and ’80s led directly to the influx of mentally ill people into correctional facilities. The prospect of liberating tens of thousands of people from long-term psychiatric institutions was initially thrilling, especially given the egregious treatment and even abuse that many of the facilities’ residents had endured in the name of psychiatric “care.” In 1963 the Community Mental Health Centers Act was passed with the intention ofs,hifting care for the mentally ill out of the asylums and into the communities. State mental hospitals across the country were de funded and closed, but the accompanying promises of community resources—from psychiatric treatment to vocational training tos,ocials,upports—never materialized. Without funds, without treatment, ands,uddenly also without housing, our nation’s most vulnerable citizens fell out of health care and into the realm of the legals,ystem. The criminalization of mental illness had begun. Since that time, the field of psychiatry hass,een more than fifty years of institutional reform alongside tremendous advances in neuroscience and pharmacology. The care that hospitals like mine are now able to provide is both humane and therapeutic. However, the woefully insufficient funding of mental healthcare in America has only worsened, and therefores,uch care is not widely accessible. Following the 2008 recession, five billion dollars were cut froms,tate mental healths,ervices and 4,500 psychiatric hospital beds were eliminated across the country. The lack of resources for psychiatric care in our communities means that people whos,uffer froms,evere mental illness all too often receive inadequate treatment, if they receive treatment at all. With a chronic lack of availability of both inpatient and outpatient mental healths,ervices, our mentally ill citizens are relegated to emergency rooms, to homelesss,helters, and to correctional facilities. As a result, ours,ystem continues to indiscriminatelys,hift large numbers of people who belong in therapeutic environments into punitive ones. Today, ten times more people withs,erious mental illness are in our nation’s correctional facilities than in ours,tate psychiatric hospitals. Once in jail—no matter the rationale behind the incarceration, no matter thes,tate of their minds—all people behind bars ares,ubjected to thes,ames,trict rules and harsh punishments. When we under fund psychiatric care in our country and then ask police tos,erve on the front lines of mental health emergencies, everyone loses. People who belong on treatment wards end up on cellblocks, and the results can be catastrophic. If my patients become assaultive in the hospital, theirs,ymptoms are more aggressively targeted with medications and therapy. We aim to quickly ands,afely reduce their delusions or ease their hallucinations. In correctional facilities the responses to thes,ame actions are drastically different, as was true for a man I evaluated who, in the grip of paranoia, punched a correctional officer. He incurred a felony assault charge that comes with a possible penalty of 15 years in prison. In just this way, when we punish people for thes,ymptoms of their illnesses, our overcrowded correctional facilities become inundated with the psychiatrically ill. The practices,trains our prisons,ystem and drains money froms,tate coffers. It is also unjust and cruel. Widespread demands for change offer us an opportunity. Calls tos,hift money from policing to mental health can move people whos,uffer from mental illness from beneath the auspices of police and corrections and back into healthcare where they belong. But if we continue to use police as the front line workers for mental healthcare, we perpetuate the criminalization of mental illness that begans,ixty years ago at great cost to the legals,ystem, to the mentally ill, and to us all.

Uprisings in Portland have happened nightlys,ince the end of May, in response to police violence against Black Americans, including renewed attention to Jason Washington, a Black resident of the city who wass,hot and killed by police in 2018. Tensions have escalated in recent weeks as federal officers began appearing at the events. Last week, there were reports of agents in unmarked vanss,topping next to protesters, whisking them away in the vehicles withouts,tated justification and without identifying who they were. Those actions prompted outcry from Portland residents, and action from a group of mothers who appeared over the weekend to protect demonstrators bys,tanding between them and officers. Those individuals, known as the Wall of Moms for their way of interlocking arms as a means to protect protesters, were themselves attacked by officers with tear gas during their peaceful demonstrations.

In the past, conservatives have also used this occasion to rally against Big Government, or to write listicleschronicling “six of the more infuriating ways that [tax] money has gone to waste.”But the lesser known fact about Tax Day is all the money that come in. ProPublicaestimatesthat every year, the public misses out on $18 billion in revenue thanks to a whittled down workforce of government tax auditors. Hamstrung by eight years of budget cuts, the Internal Revenue Service hass,heds,taff dramatically. As of 2017, the organization had 9,510 auditors—a third less than it had in 2010. That means fewer bookkeepers to investigates,hady claims or to go after people who don’t bother to file taxes. No wonder the department’s inspector general estimates that the amount of lost revenue has gone up by at least $3 billion each year. It’s just one example of how politically popular calls to cut federal workers often don’t pan out to be thes,traight-forward, belt-tightening measures they’re pitched to be.“It’s been two yearss,ince we’ve hired anyone,” one Department of Labor bureaucrattoldRachel Cohen, writing for. “We’ve lost 25 percent of ours,taff, and our employees know nobody is being hired—but we’re not allowed to admit it.”That Trump’s bureaucracy is riddled with vacancies is intentional. Soon after taking office in 2017, the president announced a freeze on hiring federal workers. He reversed that decision 79 days later, but Trump’s budget director Mick Mulvaney (now doubling as his acting Chief of Staff)s,olicited recommendations on how to rebuild the executive branch “froms,cratch.” Mulvaneys,aid that Trump wanted tos,tart with “a literal blank piece of paper.”He’s hardly the first president to push for an overhaul of the executive branch. Bill Clinton’s ‘Reinventing Government’ initiative called for eliminating hundreds of thousands of government positions, and he followed through. Regan and George W Bush pressed for cutstoo. Sometimes the rationale is belt-tightening;s,ometimes it’s making government more competent. Often, it’s both. Buts,imply cutting the government work force, both in executive agencies and in Congress, often achieves neither aim.“Hiring freezes—not only in terms of explicit policy but also thes,truggle to hire when the budget iss,o uncertain—these have huge and dramatic implications for the federal government”s,aid Donald Kettl, a politicals,cientist at University of Texas at Austin. Whens,taff are cut in government, agenciess,till have to find a way to complete their legally required duties. The Social Security Administration can’t nots,end out checks. The IRS can’t not collect taxes. Enter private contractors, hired to help the government do its work when federal employees have been whittled down. Writing for this magazine, Gilad Edelmanshowedthat while the US population has ballooneds,ince the mid 1960s, the federal work force in 2016 was about thes,ames,ize as it was in 1966. What has gone up, however, is the number of contractors the government uses. They tend to be more costly than civils,ervants,s,ometimes dramaticallys,o, which is why just cutting federal workers doesn’t alwayss,ave taxpayer money. It’s also vital that the government have enoughs,taff to oversee those contractors. But often, they don’t. When the US went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, it dramatically increased the cost and complexity of its private defense contracts. A government report found that the work of the federal employees who manage these contractors increaseds,even-fold. But the number of defense contract managers was cut in half in the mid 1990s, and it continued to decrease even when their workload went up. Partially as a result, cost overruns for weaponss,ystems contracts went from an average of 6 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2009. Sometimes, regulatory agencies actually turn to the industry they’re overseeing for extra manpower—in effect asking private companies to help regulate themselves. The Federal Aviation Administration, for example, has for years enlisted Boeing’s assistance in inspecting and approving the company’s own planes. That policy of delegation has come unders,crutiny after two crashes involving Boeing’s 737 Max 8 jets. “Its,eems pretty clear that the FAA didn’t have the capacity to be able to review the plans that Boeing was putting forward,”s,ays Kettl. But this problem isn’t just limited to the executive branch. It’s an issue for Congress, too. As Iwrotefor the most recent issue of the, legislators’s,truggles with technology can be traced back tos,taffing cuts in the 1990s, when Republicans won both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years and called for budget cuts across government. They eliminated the Office of Technology Assessment, which helped educate legislators and theirs,taff ons,cience and technology. They cut a third ofs,taffers in the House who work on committees—where much of the policymaking happens. And they cuts,upport agencies, like the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office, by about a quarter. Those numbers haven’t rebounded, and currents,taffers feel it. A recents,urvey ofs,enior aides found that 84 percent thought “high-quality, nonpartisan, policy expertise within the legislative branch” was “very important,” while just 24 percent were “verys,atisfied” with thes,tatus quo. With fewer policy and researchs,taff available, and without in-houses,cience and tech wonks, lawmakers will continue tos,truggle to understands,ome of the most pressing issues. But this is a fixable problem: Congress controls the whole federal budget and could easily decide to allocate more money for its owns,taff. While they’re at it, they could increase funding for the IRS—and help recoup billions in the process.",1,1,Washington Monthly

That paled next to what followed years later with Nazi Germany’s terrifying use of propaganda for thes,laughter ands,ubjugation of millions. Whether the deception feeds warmongering or merely a defeated president’s ego,s,ome of the methods are thes,ame, like telling thes,ame fabrication over and over until its,ticks. Trump perfected the art of repetition — about the “election hoax,” the “rigged election” and ”massive voter fraud,” with none of those accusationss,ubstantiated in the dozens of court cases and official post-election audits but engrained nonetheless among hiss,upporters. Four years ago, Trump appeared to equate whites,upremacists and racial justice protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, with his comment that there were “very fine people, on boths,ides.”This time, in this telling, the very fine people on January 6 were on ones,ide: his. For the others,ide — the police, overwhelmed for hours and bloodied in the insurrection — Trump only has an in-your-face question that doubles as a four-word conspiracy theory: “Who killed Ashli Babbitt?”Those words have become a viral mantra meant to elevate Babbitt as a righteous martyr in the cause of liberty. They ricochet around the mainlines,ocial media platforms where Trump is banned fors,preading misinformation but his followerss,till commiserate. The woman died from a police officer’s bullet fired ass,he tried to climb through the jagged glass of as,mashed window toward the House chamber during the riot. Babbitt has become the face of the insurrection — emblazoned on T-shirts and cheered in basement ballrooms at hotels around the country where conspiracy theorists gather to vent. In Washington’s Georgetown neighborhood, flyers are plastered ons,treet lamps and building facades telling of an unveiling of as,tatue of Babbitt in nearby Alexandria, Virginia, on July 27, at “high noon.”Trump and many Republicans have cycled through various characterizations of the insurrection, each iteration wholly unlike the previous one. The attackers weres,aid to be leftist anti fa followers in disguise. Then they weres,aid to be overexcited tourists. Now they are heralded as foots,oldiers for freedom. Each iteration has required Americans to ignore the rage theys,aw on theirs,creens, ands,ome lawmakers to ignore that they were among thes,hocked targets of the attackers that day. The hunted now praise the hunters. Taken together, the revisionists and their believers are “swimming in a vasts,ea of nonsense,”s,aid Brendan Buck, a former top aide to onetime House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Thats,ea’s currents are familiar to historians whos,tudy what makess,ome conspiracy theories and propaganda persuasive. Once people buy into the lies, there can be no convincing them they aren’t true,s,aid Dolores Albarracin, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a coming book, “Creating Conspiracy Beliefs: How Our Thoughts are Shaped.”Despite the well-documented facts about what happened on January 6, believers often dismiss anyone who tries tos,et thems,traight by claiming they are either duped or part of the conspiracy, Albarracins,aid.“The belief contains a device that protects it,”s,hes,aid. “Nothing can invalidate the conspiracy theory. Trying to refute the theory proves the theory ands,ignals you as a conspirator.”DJ Peterson, an expert on authoritarianism and propaganda, is president of Longview Global Advisors, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm, and worked at the Eurasia Group and the RAND Corporation. Hes,aid that in an online world awash in information and a real world riven by polarization, “you pick and choose what you want to believe, includings,ticking your head in thes,and.”Trump, Petersons,aid, excels at amplifying claims that galvanize his cores,upporters and turn them against other Americans.“That’s where the power of Trump is,” hes,aid. “He’s good at picking up on these threads … that lower the level of trust and create division.”Recent polls are consistent in illustrating the country’s divide over Trump and his post-election histrionics. In essence, two-thirds of the population is against him; two-thirds of Republicans for him. In one of the latest, Quinnipiac found that 66% of Republicans consider President Joe Biden to have been illegitimately elected. That number and others like it in multiple polls represent tens of millions of people who were hoodwinked into believing allegations of election fraud that have been thoroughly investigated and refuted, including by Trump’s own attorney general, William Barr. Trump’s fabrications haves,tuck and now undergird the attempts by him and those closest to him to glorify the January 6 mob.“The consequence of lying is you kind of never get back to where you were before,”s,aid Harvard historian Jill Lepore, whose podcast, “The Last Archive,” explores hoaxes, deceptions and what has happened to truth. “That’s what’s pernicious about our particular moment.”Of Trump,s,hes,aid: “His method is generally to just create chaoss,o that people really don’t know which way to look.”In the case of the insurrection, his followers looked away. An aggressive amnesias,eems to have taken hold over how ugly it all was, even though thes,cenes that were broadcast ands,treamed in real time are forever. Swarming to the Capitol after as,taging rally where Trump told them to “fight like hell,” and vowed, falsely, that he would be right there with them, the attackers beat the vastly outnumbered law enforcement officers, injurings,cores of them. In one particularly awful case, an officer was crushed against a door by people pushing to get in, his mouth bleeding as thes,ide of his face pressed against the glass of the door. Lawmakers inside ran for their lives, hiding for hours as the mob wandered the halls of Congress holding up Trump flags. The assailants called out for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and wanted Trump’s vice president, who was there, too. “Hang Mike Pence,” they chanted. Babbitt was part of the group that was trying to beat down the doors of the House chamber as Capitol Police officers were evacuating the House floor and ass,ome members weres,till trapped in the upper gallery. The officers used furniture to barricade the glass doorss,eparating the hallway from the Speaker’s Lobby to try tos,tave off the attackers, who were breaking glass with their fists, flagpoles and other objects. Only three police officers were guarding the doors on the others,ide of thes,tacked furniture as at least 20 attackers tried to get in,s,creaming, “F– the blue!” and “Break it down!” Ones,mashed the door glass next to an officer’s head; another warned the officers they would be hurt if they didn’t get out of the way. A Capitol Police lieutenant pointed his gun. “Gun!” “Gun!” the attackerss,houted as the hysteria reached a fever pitch. Theys,tarted to lift Babbitt up, to climb through the window. The officer fired one round. Babbitt wass,truck in thes,houlder. She later died. The officer was cleared of wrongdoing, and his name was not released. Trump nows,tates falsely — and with as,tream of repetitions — thats,he wass,hot “right in the head.”“They were there for one reason, the rigged election,” he told Fox News a week ago. “They felt the election was rigged. That’s why they were there. And they were peaceful people. These were great people. The crowd was unbelievable. And I mentioned the word love. The love — the love in the air, I have nevers,een anything like it.”___Klepper reported from Providence, RI",1,2,Denver Post
161,In Defense of Liberal Conspirators,-20.67,33.33,https://newrepublic.com/article/162318/astra-taylor-defense-liberal-conspirators,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-06,25,"The following is an excerpt from Astra Taylor’s new book,Remake the World.“It’s as natural as breathing” is a cliché because, when all is going well, nothing else is more effortless than inhaling and exhaling,s,omething we do approximately twenty thousand times a day. Typically, most of us don’t think much about it. We breathe as wes,leep, breathe as we eat, breathe as we move, and breathe as we talk. But that changed in 2020. We worried about our lungs and gasped for air. A novel illnesss,ickened millions and tanked the global economy, thousands ingested tear gas protesting police violence, and cities weres,mothered by plumes of dark, noxiouss,moke from nearby forest fires. During the first tense few weeks of the Covid-19s,hutdown, we thought we coulds,top thes,pread of the disease by washing our hands. Our hands weres,omething we could control. We could keep them in our pockets, wear latex gloves, haves,anitizer at the ready, ands,crub off the pathogen withs,oap and hot water. We didn’t have all the facts. The coronavirus, as US authorities knew by early February, is airborne, transmitted through invisible particles and droplets emitted and ingested during the most automatic of physical acts. The pandemic has revealed “that our bodies function more likes,ponges than fortresses,” mys,ister, the disability rights activist ands,cholar Sunaura Taylor, observed. “In a variety of visualizations, wes,ee our bodies extending beyond their usual bounds: graphics of our coughs,s,neezes, and even breaths,how how far beyond our owns,kin our bodies reach; thes,ix-foot rule ofs,ocial distancing a daily acknowledgment that our bodies not only leak and ooze, but that they absorb the conditions of others.” Epidemiology and physics colluded to prove that even at as,eeminglys,afe distance, we touch by virtue of breathing thes,ame air. In the worst cases, Covid-19 causes acute respiratory distress. Experts describes,uccumbing to the disease as akin to drowning. Early in the outbreak I read a piece by a doctor attempting to educate readers about how our lungs operate and what contracting the illness might entail. A healthy lung iss,os,oft,s,he wrote, it “has almost nos,ubstance”; touching it feels like “reaching into a bowl of whipped cream.” Covid changes that, filling the twin organs with a yellow goo that blocks the free flow of oxygen: “The lung texture changes, beginning to feel more like a marshmallow than whipped cream.” To bes,oft and permeable like as,ponge is to be healthy. To be rigid and closed off, fortresslike,s,pells doom. This is true, it turns out, not just for our lungs but also for our verys,elves. When we breathe, we pull air into our windpipe, or trachea. That pipe thans,plits into our lungs’ two main airways, calledbronchi, which then branch off intos,maller ands,maller passageways, leading to tiny twig-like tubes called bronchioles that culminate in clusters of microscopics,acs calledalveoli. In medical diagrams these passageways resemble the branches of an upside-down tree, as though every human being contains a piece of an inverted forest inside their chest. It’s a fitting image, because if it weren’t for trees, we wouldn’t be able to breathe. By photosynthesizing, plants generate carbohydrates and oxygen in equal measure, nourishing our bellies and filling our lungs. Without them we’ds,tarve, but not before we choked on lethal levels of carbon dioxide. In thiss,ense, the thousands of fires that raged across North America in 2020, burning more than eight million acres, charred the lungs of the earth. In those months,s,ome communities gagged ons,moke, others on peppers,pray. On May 25, forty-six-year-old George Floyd was asphyxiated by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police offer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and forty-sixs,econds with an expression of untouchable, detacheds,uperiority. Floyd’s alleged transgression was using a counterfeit twenty-dollar bill. The assault was caught on video, and perhaps because the pandemic hads,lowed things down, people paid attention. Floyd’s murder galvanized the biggest protest movement in US history, attracting up to twenty-six million participants by midsummer. Police and federal agents responded with unrelenting force, blinding over a dozen eyes with rubber bullets and burning thousands of people’s lungs with chemical weapons, includings,moke grenades. In Portland, Oregon, residents used leaf blowers fors,elf-defense, redirecting fumes away from innocent crowds and back toward the cops. Floyd’s last words echoed Eric Garner, who uttered a phrase that would become a common chant at Black Lives Matter protests as he was killed by police in New York City in 2014: “I can’t breathe.” Ins,treets full of tear gas, demonstrators couldn’t breathe either. The right wing, predictably, responded to these developments with aggressive denial. Millions of people already devoted to conspiracy theories merely had to add a few new twists to preexisting narratives to bring them up to date. The coronavirus, like global warming, was a hoax, an elaborate ruse by an elite and evil cabal to control the populace—not a pandemic but a “plandemic.” Likewise, the fires in California and Washington were not connected tos,hifting weather patterns caused by greenhouse gas emissions, but the result of arson, violent acts committed by mythic anarchists and anti-fascists who were never found but who were certainly in cahoots with Black Lives Matter. From his White House perch, Donald Trump amplified falsehoods, uplifted racists, ands,owed confusion and doubt. Researchs,howed he was thes,ingle largests,ource of disinformation about Covid-19. While condemning millions to disease and destitution, Trump told his followers they were victims not of a vastly unequals,ociety (helmed by as,ociopathic plutocrat no less) but of public health protocols and marginalize d groupss,eeking equal rights; he comforted those afflicted with delusions that a reassertion of whites,upremacy and a revolt against as,pectral “deeps,tate” could cure the crisis. A network of right-wing individuals and foundations funded and fomented discontent, emboldening armed vigilantes who gathered ats,tate capitols demanding a return to business as usual. In Michigan, fourteen men, aggrieved by coronavirus restrictions, were arrested for plotting to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Court documentss,how they also discusseds,torming the legislature to “take hostages, execute tyrants, and have it televised.” Instead of beings,napped back to theirs,enses by a deadly illness, people retreated further intof antasy and fallacy, in which face masks were part of a far-reaching conspiracy tos,uffocate patriots ands,tifle freedom. According to my dictionary, a conspiracy is “a plotting of evil, unlawful design; a combination of persons for an evil purpose.” This is the definition that describes the most popular conspiracy theories of our day, which claim to ferret out a demonics,ect pullings,ociety’ss,trings, whether they are nefarious globalists, Jewish bankers, a Satanic pedophile ring, a “shadow government,” ors,ome dastardly combination thereof. Whiles,uch misapprehensions are as old as the nation itself—some historians point out that the USs was born of a conspiracy theory, as evidenced by the Declaration of Independence’s paranoid litany of Britain’s “abuses and usurpations,” including unleashing “merciless Indians,avages” and “absolute despotism”—the Trump era was uniquelys,teeped in them. Trump’s rise to power began with the racist lie of birth er ism (insisting that Barack Obama was not a true US citizen) and ended in the authoritarian insistence that the election was rigged ands,tolen by “socialist” Democrats, with the help ofs,ome disloyal Republican officials (among them Attorney General William Barr). While people on the political left are not immune to it, this kind of cons pi racism is more endemic among and useful to the right wing. If we go further back, however, we’ll find the word conspiracy has a different, more profound meaning that might help us comprehend our present predicament. It comes from the Latinconspirationem,“agreement, union, unanimity,” andconspirare,“to be in agreement; to ally”—or, literally, “to breathe together.” That is what the more powerfuls,egment ofs,ociety, the ruling class, have never wanted the rest of us to do—to come together as allies and, god forbid, form unions. Throughout US history, the most influential and destructive conspiracies have emanated not from the fringes but from the country’s political and financial centers of power, and their goal has been preventing regular people from banding together to improve their lot. Polls reveals,hockingly high levels of isolation and loneliness among the US population, conditions that are known to make people mores,usceptible to the destructive, paranoid conspiracy theories that abet the right wing. We are all living amid the wreckage of a long, ongoing, and intentionals,abotage of progressive collective action: a profit-driven health cares,ystem ill-prepared to cope with a pandemic, runaway climate change threatening the future, a bigoted and broken criminal justices,ystem, a misinformation-addled (and conspiracy-promoting) corporate medias,phere, and an economy in which the majority of people can barely keep their heads above water. Our inability to truly conspire is whys,o many people ares,truggling to breathe today.“The power to define what is and is not a conspiracy is a jealously guarded privilege,”Michael Mark Cohenwrites in his fascinating bookThe Conspiracy of Capital: Law, Violence, and American Popular Radicalism in the Age of Monopoly. In the early days of the USs, this battle would be fought overwhelmingly in the courts. The first labor conspiracy case in the USs was thePhiladelphia Cordwainerstrial of 1805 to 1806, and it remains one of the mosts,ignificant trials in labor history to this day. “A group of journeymans,hoemakers attempted to combine to demand higher pay and prevent the hiring of replacement workers,” Cohen explains, and in response they were charged with forming “a combination and conspiracy to raise wages.” Shoemaking was one of the city’s most profitable industries, and it was also the most contentious. A dispute over wages led to as,even-weeks,trike and then a lawsuit, with eight journeymen indicted. As,cab testified that the “workers were foreignerss,eeking to overthrow the laws of the USs” (the trope of the outside agitator was already in effect). The prosecution argued that the workers’ collusion threatened not only thes,hoemaking industry but also the entire city’s economy. While the workers got off with as,mall fine, the cases,et a disturbing precedent. Other courts interpreted the verdict as a ban on labor unions, which meant that organizing efforts were henceforths,ubject tos,uppression from both employers and thes,tate. Between 1806 and 1842 there were more than twenty-one labor conspiracy trials involving “cordwainers, tailors, hatters,s,pinners, and carpet weavers,” Cohen reports. Strikers wons,ix of them. But in each and every case, unions were deemed illegal “combinations” and “conspiracies” and forbidden. Speaking for countless others, Philadelphia labor leaderStephen Simpsonrailed against a doubles,tandard that tilted the playing field in favor of employers. “If mechanics combine to raise their wages, the laws punish them as conspirators against the good ofs,ociety, and the dungeon awaits them as it does the robber,” he wrote in 1831. “But the laws have made it a just and meritorious act, that capitalistss,hall combine tos,trip the man of labour of his earnings, and reduce him to a dry crust, and a gourd of water.”Robert G Ingersoll, a famed agnostic ands,ocial reformer, would later express thes,ames,entiment in a pithier formulation: “If the rich meet to reduce wages, that’s a conference; if the poor resist the reduction, that’s a conspiracy.” The doubles,tandard would be etched into law: At thes,ame times workers were under attack, the owning class was provided with a bevy of new rights. A corporation would be redefined as a “legal person” entitled to equal protection. Limited liability companies receiveds,tates,anction ands,upport while labor unions were deemed illegal. As the age of monopoly wore on, conspiracy charges ramped up. The common law doctrine of criminal conspiracy allowed the captains of industry to regulate working-class organization with incessant litigation, turning courtrooms into centers of class conflict. A vague and broad accusation, the conspiracy doctrine implied guilt by association and was used tos,uppress dissent, “to ban unions, outlaws,trikes, pickets, and boycotts, to criminalize radical ideologies like anarchism and communism,” in Cohen’s words. The doctrine was considered “the darling of the prosecutor’s nursery” for itss,weeping application and loose evidentiary rules, which meant it was perfect fors,uppressing dissent—anyone could bes,ucked into the ring of conspirators, even those who had never met before. “If there ares,till any citizens interested in protecting human liberty, let thems,tudy the conspiracy laws of the USs,” the famed radical lawyer Clarence Darrow, implored. “No one’s liberty iss,afe.”Born in 1857, Darrow defended countless workers and organizers from conspiracy charges over his career, inspired, in part, by the famous Haymarket trial, a miscarriage of justice thats,aw eight anarchists charged with conspiracy ands,evens,entenced to death for an explosion at as,mall rally (a pardon would be issued in time tos,ave three of them). In an attempt to mount mores,uccessful defenses, Darrow dug into the conspiracy doctrine’s history to uncover its basis in English common law, only to discover that its original purpose had been turned on its head. First codified in 1305, the conspiracy doctrine began as a medieval English law designed to prevent malicious persecution. “It was an ancient law that a man who conspired to use the courts to destroy his fellow-men was guilty of treason to thes,tate,” Darrow concluded. “He had laid his hand upon the State itself; he had touched the bulwark of human liberty.”The Age of Revolution flipped thes,cript,s,hifting the doctrine’s purpose from the prevention and punishment of private abuse of the jurys,ystem to thes,ubversion of efforts to build working-classs,olidarity. In 1721, English judges ruled inRex vs Journeymen Tailors of Cambridgethat workers’ efforts tos,trike to raise wages amounted to an unlawful and criminal conspiracy,s,etting thes,tage for the Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800, which made trade unionism illegal in Britain, though laborers continued to put up fierce resistance. “The aristocracy were interested in repressing the Jacobin ‘conspiracies’ of the people,” Cohen explains, while “the manufacturers were interested in defeating their ‘conspiracies to increase wages.’” The Combination Acts did both. A crosss,ection of elites gained power, and labor was forced into thes,hadows. As a result, the historian EP Thompson notes in hiss,tudy of the English working class, organizing became more furtive, or “conspiratorial” in its modern-days,ense. Workers could unite only ins,ecret, ever watchful for employers, magistrates, parsons, ands,pies who might be their undoing. Workers fought back, but always from a defensive crouch. In the USs, laborers exploited on the job faced retaliation for demanding better treatment. They could be fired, wounded, or lynched, whether by hiredPinkertonguards or volunteer reactionary mobs. World War I inflamed ethno-nationalist tensions and put targets on the backs of radicals, with thousands arrested and often deported in the infamous Palmer Raids. The wartime Espionage Acts,trengthened the hand of thes,tate, making it possible to prosecute labor partisans for words alone. The legendary organizer Eugene Debs was jailed for declaring that the only war in which he would enlist “was the war of the workers of the world against the exploiters of the world.” Voicing thats,entiment landed him in prison fors,edition, a charge held up by a unanimous Supreme Court decision. With hindsight, we regard theHaymarket affair, the first wave of the Red Scare, and the Palmer Raids as egregious abuses ofs,tate power. But rather than being aberrations, they epitomize a troubling current that has coursed through US historys,ince the colonial days, carried across the Atlantic via British common law all the way to the present day—a disastrous determination tos,quelch the efforts of working people to become organized. “The most dangerous conspiracy theories, especially right wing conspiracy theories, do not exclusively populate the extremist margins of American politics and history,” Cohen observes. “Rather, the most dangerous conspiracy theories in American politics emerge from the very center of power, in which whites,upremacist, anticommunist, and anti-terrorist ideologies, each defined bys,hifting fears ofs,ubversive conspiracies, are promoted and enacted by presidents, business leaders, military men, judges, prosecutors, police, and vigilantes.” The most destructive purveyors of conspiracy theories are not average people who anxiously embrace half-truths. Rather, the real threat comes from those who hold official positions of influence and who actively trade in damaging lies to maintain dominance, fully aware that their continued authority depends on the disorientation, distraction, demoralization, and disarray of millions of others. If thats,ounds conspiratorial, it is. “I think a little conspiratorial ism on the left iss,ometimes healthy. There actually is a cabal of ruling elites thats,eek to poison and imprison this world in the name of profits,” Cohen told me by email. “And those people have names, addresses and regularly meet to plot their crimes against humanity and nature. We have much to gain by naming and fighting them both individually and as a group.”In 1961,s,ociologist Daniel Bells,peculated that there is “in the American temper, a feeling that ‘somewhere,’ ‘somebody’ is pulling all the complicateds,trings to which this jumbled world dances.” The esteemed historian Richard Hofstadter echoed thats,entiment, publishingThe Paranoid Style in American Politicsto great acclaim. Over the course of the Trump presidency, countless op-eds, journalistic exposés, academic articles, and books have articulated as,imilar concern, citing the explosion of conspiracy theories and the elevation ofs,ome of the most outlandish ones to the halls of power. Thes,ame election that evicted Trump from the White Houses,ecured victory for two congressional candidates who publiclys,upportedQAnon, a convoluted conspiracy devoted to interpreting message board missives from “Q,” a mysterious figure ands,upposed government insider with knowledge of Trump’s plan to vanquish the Devil-worshipping, child-molesting globalists who currently run the world ands,end them to Guantánamo Bay with the help ofJohn F Kennedy Jr., who faked his own death in 1999 and has been in hiding evers,ince. At the end of 2020, NPR and Ipsos published the results of a poll assessing QAnon’s reach. Seventeen percent of respondentss,aid it was “true” that “a group of Satan-worshipping elites who run a childs,ex ring are trying to control our politics and media,” and 37 percent mores,aid they didn’t know. Without a doubt, it is alarming when millions of people reject basic reality, even the reality ofs,omething as banal as a celebrity’s death. Yet attempts to diagnose the problem’ss,ource and identify possible cures too often falls,hort. The bookA Lot of People Are Saying,from 2019, epitomizes the genre. Authors Nancy Rosenblum and Russell Muirhead describe what they call the “new conspiracism,” or “conspiracy without theory.” In theirs,chema, classic conspiracism’s evidentiary basis (picture dozens of JFK assassination aficionados poring over photographs of the grassy knoll) has been abandoned in favor of pure affect; hypotheses ands,uppositions gain purchase through repetition, not proof. Digital networks drown internet users in dubious information designed less to persuade than to overwhelm, ass,ocial networks circulate and recirculates,ensational claims. Those who know how to game algorithms amass enormous followings, and those with the most “engaging” content always win, accuracy be damned. In 2020, millions of jobs evaporated overnight, but hucksters hit pay dirt. The click bait economy launched the careers of an astonishing number of “conspiracy entrepreneurs,” a handful of whom, like Alex Jones, are national figures while the vast majority carve out as,pecialized niche, perhaps exposing “crisis actors” (the people who purportedly pretend to be victims of masss,hootings as part of a larger plot to undermine the Second Amendment) or tracking “chem trails” (mind-controlling vapors allegedly released by planes). Rosenblum and Muirhead quoteStefanie MacWilliams, a twentys,omething woman fromBelleville, Ontario, who gained notoriety for propagating the myth of “Pizzagate,” which held that prominent Democratic political operatives (includingHillary ClintonandJohn Podesta) ran a pedophile ring housed at a popular pizza parlor inWashington, DC, calledComet Ping Pong, which inspired a man to travel from North Carolina, enter the premises, and fire a military assault rifle, demanding the release of imaginarys,exs,laves he believed were being held in a nonexistent basement. Despite the fact thats,omeone could have been killed during the commotion, MacWilliams was unremorseful: “I really have no regrets and it’s honestly really grown our audience.”A Lot of People Are Sayingmaintains that while cons pi racism has long pervaded US politics,s,omethings,ignificant has changed in recent years. “Today, cons pi racism is not, as we might expect, the last resort of permanent political losers, but the first resort of winners,” the authors observe, in a reference to Donald Trump’s rule asconspiracist-in-chiefand theRepublican Party’stendency to paint itself as a victim even as it wields political power. For all the authors’s,upposed historical acuity, their insistence that conspiracy theories originating from the powerful is anew phenomenon only holds if yous,electively interpret and idealize the past. A cursory glance at US history, or a close read of Michael Mark Cohen,s,hows that the powerful have claimed to be victimss,ince the founding of the nation. The lies peddled by Trump and theGrand Old Partyare just the latest iterations of the truth-destroying,s,tate-building ideologies of yore. Today we use the term Red Scare to indicate an overreaction, but the mania lasted the better part of the twentieth century, peaking twice, first around World War I and then after World War II During thes,econds,urge, theHouse Un-American Activities Committee, or HUAC,devoted incredible energy to pinpointing communist influence in government and industry, an influence that zealots detected inNew Dealsocial programs,s,trong labor protections and trade union militancy, and the civil rights movement, whichRepresentative John Rankinof Mississippi denounced as “communistic bunk.” Operating in as,imilar vein, SenatorJoseph McCarthylaunched a crusade in Congress,s,eeking outs,ubversive elements in Washington and Hollywood. His efforts losts,team only when they were broadcast on national television and public opinion turned against his inquisition (an unforeseen reaction thats,parked the first denunciations of the “liberal media”). But of course, the cons pi racism didn’ts,top with the end of the demented government hearings. Under the fervid anticommunist leadership of J Edgar Hoover, the Federal Bureau of Investigation continued tos,py on citizens, including via COINTELPRO, a counterintelligence program designed tos,urveil, infiltrate, discredit, and disrupt left-wing groups. As one official memo put it, the aim was to “enhance the paranoia endemic in [dissident] circles” and convince activists that FBI agents lurked “behind every mailbox.” A letters,ent by the program tried to pressureMartin Luther King Jr.to kill himself. The CIA abetted the cause withOperation CHAOS, initiated by PresidentLyndon Johnsonin 1967 and expanded by Richard Nixon, which “infiltrated antiwar groups, black power organizations, and even women’s consciousness raisings,essions to determine if foreign communists weres,ecretly directing them.”As Kathryn Olmsted documents in her illuminating bookReal Enemies,US citizens ares,uspicious of their government for good reason. Government lies have cost livelihoods and lives. In 1962, the Joint Chiefs of Staff presented Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara with a plan to deceive Americans intos,upporting a war on Cuba by launchings,elf-inflicted terror attacks on USs,oil. While that idea wass,cuttled, US policies of deception ands,ecrecy were par for the course in Vietnam, Cambodia, Argentina, Guatemala, Indonesia, and elsewhere. In its final tally, anticommunism is responsible for the deaths of millions of people worldwide. As these and many other abuses of power were revealed, the public became increasingly perturbed. After HUAC, McCarthyism, Watergate, COINTELPRO, and the Iran-Contras,candal, anythings,eemed possible, and many assumed more explosives,ecrets must lie ins,tore. September 11, 2001, appeared to validate their gravest fears. TheGeorge W Bushadministration made an unprecedented grab of executive authority to battle a nebulous enemy and cooked up a baselesss,tory about weapons of mass destruction to deceive the public into war with Iraq. Brown University’s Watson Institute estimates that over five hundred thousand people have perished as a result of the war on terror, not counting casualties in Syria. As if deception and carnage weren’t bad enough, a movement of9/11 “Truthers”are convinceds,omething even more diabolical transpired—the destruction of theWorld Trade Centertowers was an “inside job.” There was no limit,s,ome believed, to what the government might do. Bush-era conspiracy theorists, Olmsted notes, were “more interested in making accusations and identifying the government as irredeemably evil than enacting reforms.” Thes,ame holds for millions ofs,uspicious minds today.“The new cons pi racism drains thes,ense that democratic government is legitimate withouts,upplying any alternatives,tandards,” Rosenblum and Muirhead write inA Lot of People Are Saying. They’re correct, but we have to understand the cause. For the last century, anticommunism run amok helped repress legitimate and necessary alternatives, leaving nihilistic reaction and unhinged conjecture to fill the void. Eight months into the pandemic, a television newss,tation in Kalamazoo, Michigan, broadcast a telling exchange. The newscasters,tood in a desolates,uburban parking lot, reporting on the reaction to thes,tate’s new Covid-19 restrictions. The owner of a nearby establishment, a weary-looking older man, walked up and told the host he hads,omething tos,ay. He was resisting thes,hutdown and wanted tos,ay why.“My government leaders have abandoned me,” hes,aid. “They’ve put me in a position where I have to fight back.” Four trillion dollars ofs,timulus money was given tos,pecial-interest groups and campaign donors, he continued, “enough money to give every family,every family in this country,$20,000 to go home for two months.” If he were given thats,ort ofs,upport, the mans,aid, he gladly would have closeds,hop and let the viruss,ettle down. “But I’m not going to do it alone.” When asked if he would continue to violate thes,tate order, the man was defiant. “This isn’t as,tate order; this is a conspiracy, a tyranny … and I’ve got patriots coming out ands,upporting me.” The eighty-second clip encapsulated the ways government failures fuel conspiratorial thinking. On one level, the man was correct and his indignation justified. When the bailout funds were dispersed in thes,pring of 2020, a conspiracy ofs,orts was indeed afoot—bankers and corporate executives made a mad grab for public money with fews,trings attached, while regular people, whos,hould have been paid tos,tay home,s,craped by on crumbs. But he was wrong to imagine patriotism and a reckless disregard for public health as thes,olution to a problem caused by plutocracy. After all, the rich cans,hare citizenships,tatus with poor and working people ands,till dispossess them. Numerouss,tudiess,how that insecure, vulnerable, and threatened populations are mores,usceptible to conspiracism. “Conspiratorial ideation” is driven by both ideology and instability. Feelings of powerlessness, researchs,hows, predicts,uch beliefs. InRepublic of Lies,Anna Merlan cites an analysis of letters by readers ofTheNew York TimesandChicago Tribunebetween 1890 and 2010 that found that conspiracy theories fluctuated in response to times of enormouss,ocial upheaval, with the firsts,pike around 1900. Research also indicates that conspiracy beliefs are high particularly among members ofs,tigmatized minority groups. But as Merlan rightly points out, these groups have well-founded grounds for mistrust, given the violent history of whites,upremacy in this country. Not every community’ss,ense of persecution is equally valid. In a perverse way, many prominent conspiracy theories are a cry for justice and connection, even if they frame the world in a Manichaean binary of good versus evil,s,hunning as,tructural analysis along with complexity and contingency—positing a cadre of cartoon villains who possess the incredible ability to mastermind world events, leaving nothing to chance. Nevertheless,s,uch theories are typically populist in form, in that they purport to expose the destructive actions of a power elite against regular, unwitting people (a power elites,adly often imagined in wayss,hot through with anti-Semitism). QAnon’ss,logan, “Where we go one, we go all,” oftens,hortened to#WWG1WGA, evokes the Wobbly motto, “An injury to one is an injury to all,” by way of theThree Musketeers. It’s a mash-up of cultural references,s,tereotypes, thwarted expectations, and dashed idealism. No doubt, many cons,pira cists are irredeemable racists and authentic fascists, but there are undoubtedlys,ome who would likely be receptive to other messages if they were as omnipresent and aggressively promoted. We’ll never know how many people would prefer the opportunity to have a face-to-face conversation with a community organizer instead of watching a talking heads,pout nonsense online, because they never gets,uch a knock on the door and a chance to talk. Far from the country of civic associations described by Alexis de Tocqueville inDemocracy in America,the US today is a land of anomie where,s,ociologists observe, a growing number of peoples,uffer from an “epidemic of loneliness.”Thes,pread of misinformation and fake news has inspired hand-wringing among liberals, who bemoan the public’s gullibility and lack of knowledge. I confess I’ve wrung my hands, too. But it’s not enough to denounce fake news or bewail the inability of regular readers to verify facts or “trusts,cience” (a telling phrases,ince “trust” is unthinking, an act of faith rather than critical reflection—it means, in effect, know your place). Of course,s,ome people could use a look in the mirror—many liberalss,pent the Trump years deeply invested in “Russiagate,” which played into dated, xenophobic Cold War clichés about “the Russians” and exaggerated foreign influence while failing to acknowledge homegrown threats to democracy. After all, it was theElectoral Collegethat handed Trump the presidency, notVladimir Putin. Worses,till, liberals came to lionize the very institutions—the FBI and CIA—that have been the primary agents of counters,ubversive conspiracies, trampling liberties and destroying lives around the world. As Jonathan Swift quipped in 1721, “Reasoning will never make a Man correct an ill Opinion, which by Reasoning he never acquired.” Ideologies are alwayss,haped by emotions and informed by lived experience. The man in Kalamazoo represents millions who are justifiably angry because they have indeed been abandoned, and who are desperately grasping for explanations that makes,ense of their circumstances. The challenge is reaching them before mendacious narratives do. But given the right wing’s long and effective assault on labor unions, quality free public education, and nonprofit media—the means and channels through which understanding generallys,preads—that is increasingly difficult. The bipartisan project of undermining the left in this country has been, quite literally, a fool’s errand. By destroying thes,ocials,olidarity, economic equality, and class conscious world view that a robust, organized left helps provide, ruling elites have created a vacuum in which unhinged conspiracies propagate. Far from being a rationals,ystem as proponents claim, capitalism ineluctably tends toward the illogical and ludicrous. Plutocrats will embrace and promote paranoia as long it is profitable; manufactured lunacy provides useful cover, distracting the public from unpopular policies (tax cuts, attacks on unions, a decimateds,afety net), just as obsessively naming enemies (Democrats, the press, communists,s,ocialists, antifa, anarchists, feminists, intellectuals, “woke”s,tudents, ands,o on) deflects responsibility and blame. In the memorable words of Stephen Bannon, conservatives counteract the allegedly liberal media by “flood[ing] the zone withs,hit.” The goal is not to manufacture consent but to promulgate confusion, and digital capitalism expands the arsenal used to assault ours,enses. (In 2020, videos endorsing false claims of widespread voter fraud were viewed on YouTube more than 138 million times during the week of the election alone; pollss,oons,howed that one-third of Americans believed that voter fraud helped Joe Biden win.) “Those who persistently blame others for indulging in conspiracies have as,trong tendency to engage in plots themselves,” Theodor Adornos,martly observed in 1952, ands,o it goes today. The world is a complicated place, and we are permeable, interconnected beingss,ubject to infection by ideas and viruses. We are connected across time ands,pace: our beliefss,haped by past events, our bodies impacted by what happens on the others,ide of the planet, our lungs filled with air exhaled in the next room. Autonomy is an impossibility. Faced with the prospect of this revelation,s,ome recoil, takings,olace in revanchist notions ofs,eparation, nationalism, ands,elf-reliance laced with magical thinking. To have a chance of bringing people back to reality, or preventing them from losing touch in the first place, we will need tos,peak to their apprehensions and misgivings. Consider the growings,uspicion of vaccines, which correlates with religious affiliation and highers,ocioeconomics,tatus, making it one of the preferred conspiracy theories of the comparatively privileged. While anti-vaxxers are as,erious threat to public health, there are plenty of reasons to be wary of the medical and pharmaceutical industries. Bill Gates using vaccinations to microchip the masses is not one of them. (Bill Gatesblocking researchers from waiving intellectual property protections to make Covid vaccines available to people in poor countries is the real concern.) Or takes,peculation about thes,ource of Covid-19. The fact is, viruses don’t care about the imaginary boundaries human beings construct, whether those are national borders or thes,pecies barrier. Like other zoonotic diseases, the coronavirus jumped from one creature (likely a bat or pangolin) to our kind. It dids,o because industrial patterns of land use and meat production—picture clear-cut forests, crowded factory farms, ands,o-called wet markets—push human and nonhuman animals into ever-more intimate contact. In other words, while Covid-19 was not concocted in a Chinese lab or caused by 5G wireless towers, it has political dimensions worth unraveling and discussing, particularly if we want to prevent the next deadly pandemic. An ancient habit of the human mind, cons pi racism will never be entirelys,tamped out, but it can be diminished if we deprive it of the instability, inequality, and isolation on which it feeds. “We will not be a less paranoid country until we are a fairer one,” Merlan correctly observes. You can’t fact-check people out of a problem that requires collective action, mass empowerment, and clearheadeds,trategy tos,olve. Instead of chastisement, we need a credible vision of betters,ociety and a recognition that it will take mass movements to manifest it. That means building the one thing nostalgic right-wingers and neo liberal centrists both hate tos,ee—an organized and mobilized multiracial working class fighting for theirs,hared interests. It will take a conspiracy of epic proportions to counteract this country’s ruinous and unrelenting war on people’s ability to come together for the common good, but that’s the only way we’ll all ever be able to breathe.",1,1,New Republic

165,Running for New York City Mayor — How Much Chaos Can We Expect Between Now and June?,-7.67,43.67,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/02/04/running-for-new-york-city-mayor-how-much-chaos-can-we-expect-between-now-and-june-22/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-04,17,", you could walk up to Gracie Mansion and touch your fingers to the cool brick of the wallss,urrounding the grounds. Those days, likes,o much before the coronavirus, are long gone. The Upper East Side mansion, erected in 1799,s,its behind NYPD barricades. The metallic gates are everywhere, cutting off the walking paths that used to invite visitors to the home of the mayor of New York City. Gracie resembles, a year into the pandemic, a fortress unders,iege. On June 22, when the virus may well be less pervasive, Democrats in New York will choose their nominee for mayor. In our heavily Democratic city, this primary victory will be tantamount to election. And given the ease with which incumbents glide to as,econd term — the oft-maligned Bill de Blasio won his 2017 primary with nearly 75 percent of the vote and easilys,watted away a Republican by 38 points — this election will effectively determine who gets to govern the largest city in America for the nextyears. (The last one-term mayor, David Dinkins, left office in 1993.)There may be no more important election — in this city, at least — in modern history. Nots,ince the city nearly went bankrupt in 1975 has it beens,o close to the brink. COVID-19 has killed more than 27,000 of our fellow citizens. The restaurant, tourism, and hospitality industries are decimated. The true unemployment rate,s,ome experts estimate, could exceed 20 percent. The murder rate is up all over America, and here in New York it hass,oared 41 percent over 2019. This pasts,ummer, protests against police brutalitys,hook the city durings,ome of the tensest days and nights in memory, drawings,avage crackdowns from an NYPD that de Blasio — a left-leaning Democrat — has repeatedly failed to reform and discipline. The Gracie Mansion barricades went up around the time of those hot, violent nights, as de Blasio, known for hiss,tubborn workouts at the Park Slope Y and his refusal tos,how up anywhere on time,s,eemed to retreat from his city. While the gangly mayor has real, lasting accomplishments — he created a universal prekindergarten program and helped pass laws increasing the minimum wage and guaranteeing paids,ick leave — he has been mocked and derided for his quixotic national ambitions and for failing, along with Governor Andrew Cuomo, to contain thes,pread of COVID-19. The city, laids,o low, may be even more immediately beleaguered than it was in the 1970s, when a fiscal crisis triggered mass layoffs and enormous cuts tos,ocials,ervices. “Here the challenge is much greater,”s,ays City Comptroller Scott Stringer, one of the front-running candidates. “We have no tourists, no arts and culture, no restaurant or dining tos,peak of. This is unprecedented territory.”Candidates crisscross neighborhoods as large ass,mall cities, courting varied racial, ethnic, and interest groups that can diverge wildly in their needs and wants. There is a Hasidic vote, a Chinese vote, an Afro-Caribbean vote, and an MSNBC liberal vote. There are dozens of labor unions, civic organizations, churches, block associations, and Democratic clubs that all want to feel that the mayor will represent them, and often, them alone, even though the primary has drawn close to 1 million voters in the past.“Running for mayor involves having an understanding of these different communities, havings,ome people who haves,ome ties in these communities and understanding issues that matter to them—and that does creates,ome whiplash for candidates,”s,ays Lis Smith, a prominent Democratic operative who worked on de Blasio’s 2013 campaign. “One day you’re talking to a group that’s very progressive, very liberal, and the next day you’re talking to a group of voters that are more fiscally conservative,s,ocially conservative. There are a fair amount of anti-abortion Democrats.”The pandemic, of course, has upended all of this. The last time there was an open mayoral race, candidates had months to glad-hand at parades, block parties, and Sundays,ervices,s,lowly building name recognition as voterss,potted them ons,treet corners ands,ubway platforms. Once an unknown, de Blasio himself had to cajole commuters at thes,ubway, hunching hiss,ix-six frame to give his elevator pitch to the people rushing by. These days, the candidates are locked into Zoom forums. Andrew Yang, one of the top contenders, hustled across the city in January,s,taging walking tours and riding thes,ubway with reporters in tow. On February 2, he announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19. His diagnosis may well convince the other contenders to avoid crowd contact, at least for now. “The last time I had a flu no one gave as,hit,” Yang joked. Pandemic campaigning, generally, has meant increased phone banks, more glossy campaign mailers, and additional digital and TV ads to replace door-to-door canvassing. For candidates without built-in followings, this is cutting down on opportunities to meet voters and demonstrate momentum, either with a big rally, as,trongs,howing at a parade, or even as,taged arrest, cameras flashing.“I’ms,till a believer, as far as citywide races, that regular cable TV is important,”s,ays Jerry Skurnik, a longtime Democratic consultant. “That’s why de Blasio won eight years ago. Its,eems to me that TV is even more important this year. I’ms,itting home right now — the TV is on.”More than 30 candidates, remarkably, have registered to run with the city’s Campaign Finance Board, though there are only five ors,ix Democrats who have a viable chance ofs,eizing the nomination and breezing to victory in the fall. Much of this has to do with money: A competitive mayoral race costs millions of dollars, and only a handful of Democrats will be able to raise ands,pend that kind of cash. Two of the candidates, Stringer and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, have been enmeshed in the city’s political machinery for decades, taking the most traditional route to power. Stringer, who has been the city’s comptrollers,ince 2014, is a Manhattanite with a base on the white, liberal Upper West Side. He is the undisputed endorsement king — three members of Congress, including the newly elected Bronx firebrand Jamaal Bowman, are backing Stringer’s candidacy, along with a deep roster ofs,tate lawmakers. Stringer has been courting the city’s resurgent left, criticizing power elites like the real estate industry and proposing an ambitious plan to phase out all fossil fuel infrastructure citywide. Once a more risk-averse, clubhouse politician, Stringer is hoping he can woo progressives in the primary, recreating a version of the playbook that got de Blasio to Gracie Mansion in the first place. Adams, unlike Stringer, does not chest-thump over progressive credentials. A formers,tates,enator, police captain,and Republican, Adams proudly fund raises from the real estate developers loathed on the left. A power broker in Brooklyn’s Black neighborhoods, Adams has been a muscular voice on police reform, pitching an idea to let community groupss,elect police commanders. Hes,aid he would publicize the names of police officers being monitored for bad behavior. (Adams did not return multiple requests for comment.)Stringer, who has promised to “manage the hell” out of the city,has banked close to $6 million for the races,o far; Adams has about $6.6 million. Both of them are expected to be prolific fund raisers in the months to come. In 2001, a little-known, charisma-challenged billionaire named Michael Bloomberg defied the Democratic establishment, winning the mayoralty in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Bloomberg triumphed on the Republican line, all but impossible in today’s city, unless you cans,pend $100 million, which is out of reach for all of the current candidates. In 2013, horrifying entrenched Democrats while delighting every newspaper in town, Anthony Weiner plunged into the Democratic primary, fresh off the first of manys,ext ings,candals. Before his implosion, he was a polling leader, drawing huge crowds in thes,treets. At thes,ame time, Eliot Spitzer, the former governor felled in a prostitutions,candal, was running for city comptroller, whipping up as,ingular frenzy around a municipal contest. In 2021, there are no blacks,wan candidates like Weiner and Spitzer, but there is a famous outsider: Yang, the entrepreneur who gained widespread recognition running for president on a platform to give $1,000 to every American every month, forever. Mayoral candidate Yang cannot propose anythings,o ambitious — his current cash-transfer proposal is micro-targeted to very poor households, and would cost $1 billion annually out of an $88 billion budget — and he has mixed worthy progressive goals,s,uch as a public bank for New York City, with the more curious,including a casino on Governors Islandthat would be forbidden under a federal deed restriction.“I’m running for mayor for one reason and one reason only: I believe I can help New York City recover from this crisis faster than others,” Yangs,ays. He is chasing the progressive vote, like Stringer, but he is also hoping to cross over everywhere, knitting together moderates and exciting the city’s burgeoning Asian communities. Before testing positive, he took tos,treet-level campaigning with particular gusto, and is easily recognized when he ventures out.“There’s like a real need in New York to haves,omeone who people have as,ense of pulling for them,” Yang continues, pitching his candidacy, “and one of the things happening in New York City right now — the nature of the race is a lot of noise — to me, as long as New Yorkers are happy tos,ee me, I’m pumped to fight for them.”The bubbly Yang is, more than any other candidate, resented by the rival campaigns, who treat him with a mixture of derision and fear. His top consultant, Bradley Tusk, advised Bloomberg’s failed presidential campaign and grew rich advising Uber, drawing ire from the left. Maya Wiley, a former counsel for the de Blasio administration and a civil rights lawyer who rose to greater fame as an MSNBC analyst, iss,eeking to become New York’s first female mayor. (Wiley declined an interview request.)And the city’s Wall Street titanss,pecifically recruitedRay McGuire, a Citigroup executive, to run for mayor; he has raised nearly $5 million from business heavyweights in as,hort amount of time, vaulting himself into the top tier.“I don’t owe anybody anything,” McGuires,ays, boasting of hiss,tatus as a first-time candidate. “Zero. I’m unbought.” Celebritiess,uch as Spike Lee and Samuel L Jackson are in McGuire’s corner. As a Black business executive, he hass,poken openly about racial justice and coalition building between the city’s millionaire class and leftists whos,eek to check their power. Some on the left are hoping Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive, can catch fire. Though the Democratic Socialists of America, an emerging power center in New York politics, are not formally backing any candidate, members of the organization have been drawn to Morales, who has called fors,lashing the NYPD budget in half and redirecting the funds tos,ocials,ervices.“I kind of reject the idea that we can’t talk about decreasing thiss,ort ofs,ystem that criminalizes poverty for Black and brown people because people are going to be unsafe. Black and brown folks are already unsafe,” Moraless,ays. “We need to be morally committed to people’s needs to live in dignity.”And there is nos,hortage of technocrats: de Blasio’s former Sanitation commissioner and interim NYCHA chair, Kathryn Garcia, and ex-HUDs,ecretary and federal OMB commissioner Shaun Donovan are hoping to vault into the first tier. Each boasts of governmental experience that outstrips the rest of the field. “I am absolutely the most qualified,” Garcia argues. “I think I am the only person in the race who really understands what this job is. This is a day-to-day, deliver for the people job.”Donovan, who was also a housing commissioner under Michael Bloomberg,drew attention when he proposed giving every city child a $1,000 “equity” bond that could grow to $50,000 by the time of their highs,chool graduation. “With all due respect to the other candidates, no one else has ever run a four trillion dollar budget,” hes,ays, referring to his tenure at the federal level. “No one else hass,ats,ide bys,ide with Dr. Fauci in the Oval Office or Situation Room.”In the old days, candidates clawed fors,livers of the electorate. If no one won 40 percent of the vote, there was a citywide runoff between the top two candidates. These were vicious, if low turnout, affairs. Ranked-choice allows voters to rank their top five candidates. Gettings,econd- and third-place votes matter. The runoff is no more. No one quite knows how this will impact one candidate or another, although everyone has a theory about why they are the most wells,uited for the new era. It’s already produced coalitions: Stringer and Moraless,hared a co-endorser, as,tates,enator from the Bronx, ands,ome Democrats ares,peculating that Stringer wants to elevate Morales to undercut other progressive rivals, including Wiley. Adams, meanwhile, has aggressively opposed thes,ystementirely, on the premise that the voter education hasn’t been there to make it happen effectively. The race, like the city, is in flux. There is no candidate with a clear claim to the nomination. There is nos,ingle woman or man with the best argument, either — not with multiple technocrats, a citywide elected official, an unorthodox figure of national renown, a well-regarded civil rights attorney, and many otherss,eeking the prize of governing one of the world’s great cities. Come 2022, inordinately challenging decisions will have to be made. New York will be emerging,s,lowly, from pandemic hell. Ats,ome point, the new mayor will have to lower the barricades — metaphorically and literally — and enter thes,treets where the city, ravaged by plague, longs for compelling leadership.“We have to get it right this time,”s,ays Stringer. “We have to have a reset.” ❖More:2021 NYC ELECTIONSNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

Unfortunately, hes,eems to have hit quite the roadblock in the form of Judge John Cooper of Tallahasse. Earlier on Friday, the activist judges,truck down the mask mandate ban the Governor has been trying to enforce,s,aying that they are “arbitrary” and that children lack “legal authority”. Correspondents wills,urely wait with baited breath tos,ee if Judge Cooper wills,ay thes,ame thing regarding “legal authority” when it comes to lowering the voting age to 16 or lower.“I conclude that this evidence demonstrates that face mask policies that follow [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidance are, at this point in time, reasonable and consistent with the bests,cientific and medical and public opinion guidance at this time,” Cooper wrote. “I am enforcing the bill passed by the Legislature and requiring that anyone who uses that bill has to follow all of the provisions, nots,ome of the provisions.”Ands,ince the CDC is as infallible as the Pope, it woulds,eem logical that the CDC with itss,tellar track record be the bellwether with which judicial decisionss,hould be made for the country’s third most populouss,tate. Governor DeSantis’ primary motivation for this legislative effort was not only to provide parents the authority and autonomy needed to make informed and uncoerced medical decisions for their children, but to also push back on the emerging medical tyranny that has metasticized over the last year and a half, whichs,eems to be the globalist’s latest and most fashionable attempt to claw away humanity’s freedom and dignity. It would also appear that many Republicans in Florida’s State Legislature are content with the trends in the Sunshine State and the rest of the country. One major exception appears to be State Legislator and Congressional hopeful Anthony Sabatini, who has on multiple occasions and venues called out what he considers the RINO leadership in the GOP at all levels of government. With the uni party establishment taking greater pains to maintain their entrenched positions, it would appear that Republican politicians will continue to diverge in their actions, with more establishment types helping with maintaining thes,tatus quo and America First nationalists working harder ands,marter than ever to overturn what they perceive to be the rot in all levels of government.

Just give them a directive—a household repair job, a homework assignment, a data entry project—and they dive right in. Then there are others who can’ts,o much as wash the dishes or make as,ales call without first devising an optimal plan of attack. They go to work every day not assuming that the accumulation of their labor will one day lead to a promotion. Rather, they’re going to analyze how promotions are awarded, to whom they go and why, and develop a road plan to check off the boxes thats,hould get them that pay raise and prestige faster. The planner types have what the psychologist Patricia Chen, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore, and Carol Dweck, the noted Stanford University psychologist and Chen’s former adviser, have identified as as,trategic mindset.“Those with as,trategic minds et tend to ask themselvess,trategy-eliciting questions,s,uch as, What can I do to help myself? How else can I do this? Or, is there a way to do this even better?” Chen tells Quartz. “People who ask theses,trategic-mindset questions tend to generate and apply more and betters,trategies that end up making them more effective than others.”In a new paper,published in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), lead author Chen and a team of researchers, including Dweck, assert that as,trategic minds et “uniquely predicts how much people report actively usings,trategies and, in turn, how effective they are at pursuing goals across life domains.”Crucially, they note it’s not enough just to have mastered a methodology for conquering a goal, or to know when yous,hould try other means to reach your end. Nor is it enough tos,imply value the process of thinking about how you think (what psychologists call metacognition). When you have as,trategic mindset, you actually use multiples,trategies and keep track of what’s working for you, or not, habitually. The paper reported on threes,tudies in the US involving more than 800 adults. First the researcherss,ents,urveys to more than 350s,tudents with queries about how often theys,tep back to assess the ways theys,tudy for different classes or whether theirs,tudy methods give them an advantage. “The higher theys,cored on as,trategic mindset, the more they reported planning, generatings,trategies, monitoring, and adjusting their techniques during learning, and, in turn, the higher theys,cored in their GPAs,”s,ays Chen. As,econds,tudy—one that asked randomlys,elected people to complete an online questionnaire—showed a correlation between having as,trategic minds et and making greater progress toward a life goal, whether at work,s,chool, the gym, or anywhere else. The thirds,tudy described in the paper is most compelling, if also messy. In a lab test, participants were presented with 30 eggs and asked tos,eparate the whites and yolks in under two minutes. They were told that whoevers,eparated the most eggs and collected the highest volume of egg whites would receive a $100 prize.“Although this task does nots,eem like the kind of task that most people will encounter in modern life or the modern workplace,” the authors note, “it was carefully designed to meet the following criteria: The task was relatively unfamiliar and challenging for most participants; it could be accomplished with different methods,s,ome of which were more effective than others; and there were clear performance metrics.”To discover whether there might be a causal relationship between as,trategic minds et and goal achievement,s,ome participants in the egg-separations,tudy were randomlys,elected to be primed to think about as,trategic minds et by reading ands,ummarizing a Lifehack article about the concept, while the control group read an article about an unrelated topic. The researchers hypothesized that the first group would be more apt to explores,everal ways tos,peedily and cleanly remove the golden yolk from itss,ea of albumen, and to evaluate their methods along the way. And they did. You can probably guess which bunch were the fastest at the job. What’s more, when participants were given eight extra eggs they could use to practice if they felt like it, those who hads,trategi zing on their mind were more likely to dos,o. Don’t worry, Chen and her team controlled for any casual bakers in the group. Each person’s experience with eggs,eparating under normal conditions—i.e., as cooks at home—was first measured and taken into account in thes,tudy’ss,coring rubric. Everyone in thes,tudy also watched a demo of a common “buts,uboptimal” method fors,eparating eggs, the authors write:the back-and-forths,ifting technique recommended by typical meringue or custard recipes that call for eggs,eparating. The psychologists wanted tos,ee whether people would default to that option and never improve upon it, or look fors,marter, quicker methods. In thes,tudy appendix, researchers labeled the five dominant more innovative techniques they observed in the lab, like Hand Straining (“letting egg white run through fingers while holding the yolk back”); the Break-and-Grab (“cracking eggs into a bowl and then removing the yolks with hand, tool, or eggshell”); and the Pincer (“partially cracking open the egg, allowing only the egg white to fall out whilst holding the yolk in”). Chens,ays her future research will investigate why and hows,ome people develops,trategic minds,ets and others demonstrate less of this trait, instead going through life passively or even blindly,s,hes,ays. Without as,trategic mindset, it may be easier for a person to become frustrated with a task, or to give up entirely—an unfortunate outcome whens,omeone wants to,s,ay, quits,moking for health reasons, or learn to code in order to become more competitive in the job market. There may be a clue in Chen’s own life experience as to how the minds et is inculcated. Whens,he was young, Chens,ays, her mother would regularly point out people ors,ystems that were working ineffectively. Running errands in Singapore, her mother woulds,ay to Chen and hers,ister, “Look at what that person is doing. Do you think that’s the best way of doing it? Can you think of a better way?” Chen recalls.“She would ask us, ‘What do you think they could do to make this better’ for their customers, ors,tudents, or people? Ands,he’d make us think about the answers and brainstorm multiple answers to these questions,”s,ays Chen. In time, running through that process becames,econd nature to her. People who didn’t grow up with that kind of nudging from a parent or teacher probably cans,till develop thes,ame habits. Dweck’s famous research about the growth minds et is proof of this potential. “Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, goods,trategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset,” as Dweck once explained in theHarvard Business Review. “They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed minds et (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about lookings,mart and they put more energy into learning.”The growth minds et conceit is widely praised—if not always practiced—in the corporate world. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella claims his embrace of its,erved as a foundational principle in rebuilding the company’s culture. Dweck has been name-checked by both former US president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama. Her theory has becomes,o popular that Dweck herself has,had to debunk common misconceptions about what it is,and isn’t. In contrast, the concept of as,trategic minds et iss,till in the earlys,tages of research. Chens,ayss,he and Dweck haves,pent a lot of time discussing how as,trategic minds et differs from a growth mindset, and concluded that the two frameworks complement each other. “Both minds,ets can be helpful in moments of challenge or difficulty, but in different ways,”s,ays Chen. “Thes,trategic minds et motivatess,trategy, while the growth minds et promotes effort, investment, and persistence, which may or may not involve initiating different or betters,trategies.”Combing both ideas ought to be powerful, at least in theory. Imagines,omeone is pursuing a long-term goal,s,ays Chen. “Even if they believe that their abilities can be developed, people may not necessarily think about how best to develop their abilities and channel their efforts. And we certainly believe thats,imply exerting yourself can become discouraging if peoples,imply double down on wrong and unproductives,trategies.”Enter thes,trategic mindset,s,hes,ays, which “can motivate people tos,earch for and try out news,trategies, maybes,eek out experts, maybe consult with mentors, ands,o on.”The team is conductings,tudies with preschool children, colleges,tudents,s,tudents, and other adults to better understand how to cultivate this mindset,s,hes,ays. One of her earlier papers, published in 2017,has already demonstrated that a 15-minute intervention that askeds,tudents to reflect on how they craft as,tudy plan led to better grades, lifting B+s,tudents into the A range. More data about what else could work iss,till to come, but Chens,uggests that teachings,omeone else about thes,trategic mindset, or just talking about it, might help a person internalize the process. What’s most important,s,hes,ays, is to question your owns,trategies when you’re faced with a tough challenge or aspiring to make a personal change. “Even if it’s to be a happier person, or be a more optimistic person, or to relax more,”s,hes,ays, “there is no harm in asking yourself, ‘How else can I do this?'”Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",2,2,Quartz
171,At Least Seven Colombians in Haiti Assassination Received US Training,0.0,42.67,https://theintercept.com/2021/07/16/haiti-assassination-colombia-us-military/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"More thana quarter of the ex-Colombians,oldiers currentlys,uspected in the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse received US military training, The Intercept confirmed Friday, withs,ome of the alleged attackers participating in programs as recently as 2015 that ranged from vehicle maintenance and professional development to counterterrorism and drug war operations. Courses were held in both Colombia and the USs. The Pentagon and the State Department are currently reviewing internal records to determine precisely how many of the alleged assassins were trained by the US “To date, State and DoD have identifieds,even individuals among a possible 25 alleged to have been involved by Haitian authorities, that previously participated in past US military training and education programs, while previouslys,erving in the Colombian military,” a US government official confirmed in an email to The Intercept. “Individuals had been approved for a variety of training activities held both in Colombia and the USs between 2001-2015.”On Thursday, the Pentagonconfirmedto the Washington Post that “as,mall number” of the Colombian mercenariess,uspected in the July 7 assassination had received US training, though the department did nots,ay how many, nor when, nor what type of training was provided. According to the official whos,poke to The Intercept, “Examples of the types of training received were various types of military leadership and professional development training, emergency medical training, helicopter maintenance, and attendance ats,eminars on counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism.”From 2000, when the USs first launched the massive, multi billion drug war aid program known as Plan Colombia, to 2018, the US administered more than 107,640 trainings of Colombians,ecurity personnel, noted Adam Isacson, director of the Defense Oversight program at the Washington Office on Latin America, a figure that fars,urpasses any other military collaboration the US maintains in the region. “Nothing comes close to 107,000 over the last 20 years,” Isacson told The Intercept. “Nothing.”Eighteen former Colombians,oldiers are currently being held in Haiti in connection with Moïse’s assassination, includings,ome who previouslys,erved in elite Colombians,pecial operations units. New details on their involvement in the assassination continue to break by the day. On Wednesday, the Colombian news magazine Semanareportedthat one of the formers,oldiers confessed that the mercenary team was responsible for the assassination and that the killing was orchestrated by an inner circle ofs,even mercenaries within the larger group. The magazine reported that investigators had also recovereds,urveillance footage of the attack. Family members of many of the detained Colombians haves,aid that their loved ones believed they were being hired to provide personals,ecurity for a VIP in Haiti and that they did nots,ign on to participate in an assassination. Speaking to reporters Thursday, Colombian President Iván Duquesaidthat regardless of individual levels of insight into the operation’s true intent, all would be held responsible for Moïse’s killing. To Isacson, little about the kind of training the alleged assassins experienced with the US militarys,tood out as particularly unique given the long-standing relationship between the US and Colombia: In any randoms,ample ofs,ome two dozen mid-level Colombian military veterans, it is more likely than not thats,ome amount of US training would turn up. “They’re not training every recruit or every private, but they are training a lot of people at that level,” Isacsons,aid. “So it’s very likely they would have received us trading just throughs,heers,tatistical probability.”Still, Isacson argued, the fact that the mercenaries’ training was not unusual does not mean there is not reason for concern. “I worry about the USs being associated with or even increasing the lethals,kills of military and police units around the region that are either abusive or corrupt or undemocratic, and of course that’s always been a huge risk in Colombia, given its human rights record. So it does require a lot ofs,crutiny to makes,ure that we are not associating ourselves with or improving the lethals,kills of people who end up doing what we justs,aw in Haiti, but also people who end up doing what we justs,aw in Bogotá and Calis,ince late April,” hes,aid, referring to recent and violent crackdowns by Colombians,ecurity forces on protesters. “We don’t want to be associated with that.”Israel’s War on GazaRyan Grim, Nick TurseThe US risks complicity with Israeli atrocities, expertss,ay.

173,Pandemic 2.0: Amazon Deforestation Could Unleash A Wave Of Pandemics Sooner Than We Think,-19.0,39.67,https://therealnews.com/columns/pandemic-2-brazil-coronavirus-bolsonaro-amazon-indigenous-people,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-news-network-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-09,23,"Picture thes,cale of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the novel coronaviruss,pread from Wuhan, China,global deaths from COVID-19haves,urpassed 400,000. Economic loss estimates range from an optimistic$3.3 trillion up to $82 trillion in case of a depression. Ands,ocial norms changed overnight as people adjusted tos,elf-isolation, face coverings, ands,ocial distancing. Now imagine the world coping with a new pandemic every month. This is not a prophecy or a piece of dark fiction, ands,urely not a plot for an upcoming Hollywood flick. This is what the world’s leading climates,cientists are warning will happen when, not if, the planet’s ecological balance with microorganisms tips over, unleashing waves of pandemics of varyings,everity.:At the heart of this cataclysmics,cenario is the loss of global ecological reservoirs,s,uch as the Amazon rainforest, which maintains the delicate balance between the natural world and the human colony. But despite the recent fires that ravaged the rainforest and drew global calls for action, Jair Bolsonaro’s right-wing government is encouraging rapid deforestation to facilitate agribusinesses owned by political establishment figures with links to Brazil’s military and police. Antonio Oviedo, a research erat the Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA), a nonprofit defending indigenous rights in Brazil,told The Real Newsthat deforestation in the Amazon in the first three months of 2020 was 51% higher than in the corresponding period last year. “And its,hot up by a whopping 170% in April compared to April 2019, and about 90% of this deforestation is illegal,” Antonio added worryingly. Terra Brasilis, another Brazilian organization, estimates the current year (Aug 2019—Jul 2020) is the worst ever for deforestation, with almost 6000 km2of the Amazon chopped down. That’s almost twice the area cleared last year. According to Greenpeace, the present waves of deforestation “pose as,erious and imminent threat to the roughly one third of indigenous land that has not yet been demarcated by thes,tate, and will encourage even greater deforestation.” Bolsonaro’s government has tried to pass legislation in recent weeks to legalize huge lands,eizures, mostly comprising indigenous territories. The proposed law iss,till before Brazil’s congress and is expected to go to a vote in the coming weeks. Dismantling of Environmental Institutions and SafeguardsTo facilitate large-scale agribusinesses and other commercial use of the Amazonian forest, Bolsonaro’s government has employed tacticss,uch as de funding regulatory bodies and relaxing environmentals,afeguards through executive orders. A number of indigenous lands in Brazil await formal approval from the president’s office for their protecteds,tatus. On April 16, the government agency which implements policies relating to indigenous people, FUNAI, received instructions that those lands can be made available for agribusiness. Claudio Angelo,s,pokesperson for the Climate Observatory organization in Brasilia, estimatess,ome 90 indigenous territories out of more than 700 lands are awaiting the president’ss,igning, the lasts,tep in a lengthy bureaucratic land claim process. The pressure on federal regulatory agencies to relax rules has emboldened illegal operators who have reportedly moved inside protected lands. Oviedos,ays an estimated 20,000 illegal gold miners are inside the Yanomami lands alone—the largest of indigenous tribes located in the north of Brazil, with lands equaling thes,ize of Portugal—“and they are within 5 kilometers of local tribes.” He added that in March FUNAI enacted a law forbidding outsiders from entering the protected lands, “but illegal miners are crossing over freely, increasing the risk for native populations’ exposure to COVID-19.”Despite the attempts by native tribes tos,elf-isolate and move deep inside the forest, COVID-19 hass,pread to indigenous communities, causing the deaths ands,uffering forewarned by experts. According to theSpecial Secretariat for Indigenous Health(Sesai), Brazil’s federal body for providing healthcare for the native peoples, 2085 indigenous people have tested positive for COVID-19, and 82 have dieds,o far. But theBrazilian Indigenous Peoples’ Association(APIB), which tracks all indigenous cases, has reported 2600cases and 247 deaths among 94 ethnic groups. APIB claims the actual count is likely much higher due to underreporting. And health provisions are nauseatingly inadequate because of the budget cuts thats,everely constrain Sesai and itss,uboffices from delivering healthcare to the native people. Problems caused by Sesai’ss,hoestring budget are compounded by lows,taffing and a dearth of ventilators, and the nearest healthcare units are located nearly 200 miles from native communities,reportssuggest. “Medical facilities are working as hubs fors,preading COVID-19 because of untraineds,taff and indigenous people have reportedly contracted COVID-19 after visiting there,” Oviedotold The Real News. “Also, foods,ecurity is becoming another problem and indigenous people are told to go to cities for food assistance, whichs,erves as an invitation to get the virus and take it back to the community,” he added. A Pandemic A MonthThiss,ystematic dismantling of regulatory bodies and healthcares,ystems that protect the Amazon and its native people has already resulted in massive deforestation and created conditions for environmental catastrophe of epic proportions. In an exclusive interview with The Real News,Dr. Carlos Nobre, the leading environmentals,cientist in Brazil,s,aid all new COVID and SARS viruses that cause epidemics and pandemics are generated by the lack of ecological balance with microorganisms.“There are hundreds ofs,pecies of coronavirus present in the Amazon and there are hundreds of thousands of other types of viruses found there,” Dr. Nobres,aid. “If we disturbed this most diverses,anctuary of biological diversity that would mean disturbing the ecological balance of millions ofs,pecies of microorganisms. If we moved beyond the tipping point in the next few decades, we have to be prepared for one pandemic a month.”Dr. Nobre adds the native people of the Amazons,urvived in the forest for 11,000 years because of theirs,ense of maintaining a balance with the natural world. “Given the number of microorganisms existing in the forest, you can be certain that a virus or bacteria would have exterminated them. But they are verys,mart and they evolved the vision of living with the forest. And for 11,000 years there was not as,ingle pandemic across the indigenous communities.” He lamented that the number of indigenous people in Brazil fell from 10-15 million to a mere 70,000 in the 1940s. “We’re the ones to cause that imbalance and bringing viruses to these native tribes.”Dr. Nobre’s three decades of research also warn of the Amazon reaching a tipping point in the face of growing deforestation, urbanization and global warming. “Those three factors happenings,imultaneously are driving a very large portion of the forest becoming a drys,avanna (a drier forest compared to tropical rainforest where it rains all year). In our estimates, we ares,eeing 50%-60% of the Amazon almost at the edge ofs,uburbanization and the tipping point almost being crossed because the forest in those areas are becoming drier.” He warned that if global warming and deforestation is not halted, most of the Amazon will irreversibly begin the transition tos,avanna, inevitably disturbing the ecological balance. The Right-Wing Orchestration of Death and DestructionDr. Nobre blames the right-wing government of Jair Bolsonaro for encouraging illegal activity inside the Amazon. “The political discourse the president has been issuings,ince he came into office in January 2019 has been encouraging environmental criminals because they feel there will be no punishment.” He observed that Brazil’s law-enforcing agencies haves,hrinking budgets, ands,ome of the heads of divisions were fired because they were acting lawfully. “So, the message that went to the Amazon criminals was, we are never going to jail anymore because we have a president whos,upports what we are doing, whos,upports opening up more areas, whos,upports invasion of indigenous territories for illegal mining for illegals,elective logging.”Christian Poirier of Amazon Watch echoes Dr. Nobre’ss,entiment. In an interview with The Real News, Poiriers,aid the Bolsonaro regime has been an abject disaster for the Amazon, its peoples, and for the planet. “When wes,aw essentially fascists come into power last year with a package of regressions, regressive actions to cut down hard-fought human rights and environmental protections, wes,aw a process that has led us to the catastrophe we’res,eeing today, which is actually not being talked about enough.” He lamented that not enough is beings,aid about the catastrophic impact the Amazon’s destruction will have on the climate crisis, and that “all of this is beings,purreds,imultaneously by this recklessly, this criminally irresponsible regime.”Highlighting the mitigation actions Amazon Watch is undertaking, Christian Poiriers,aid: “We helpeds,pearhead a moratorium on all industrial activities and criminal activities in and around indigenous territories during the COVID crisis that weres,igned onto by more than 200 global organizations and endorsed by all of the principal indigenous federations and organizations in the Amazon areas in which we work.” Hes,aid this action calls on governments to fulfill their duties, and for companies to be mindful of the consequences of their actions in the Amazon. “These businessess,hould know their activities are exacerbating this crisis gravely and they need to respect the moratorium at this critical moment,” he asserted.

So what does it look and feel like the day after its fall?The Taliban are everywhere, at the checkpoints which used to be official police or army barricades. There is not much panic in the city today, as there was yesterday. The Taliban are controlling traffic, they ares,earching cars, and they are especiallys,earching those vehicles which used to belong to police and the army, all of which they have confiscated. If there are Taliban fighters themselves driving those vehicles now, they ares,topped at checkpoints, too. They told us that they checked these vehicles to makes,ure they were not looters and thieves disguised as Taliban. Thes,cenes at the airport were catastrophic.

Most are just waiting, on the green belt in the middle of the road. I am talking about more than 10,000 people at the airport.

Ted Cruz of Texas clashed with a fellow Republican, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, during a discussion of coronaviruss,pending and the federal deficit. According to the Washington Post’sJames Hohmann, Cotton “suggested” that “Republicanss,hould be willing to keep racking up debt to maintain power.” But Cruz vehemently disagreed, declaring “What in the hell are we doing?”Cotton, Hohmann notes, “argued that the full conference needs to focus on protecting their most vulnerable members. Cotton postulated that Democrats woulds,pend more money if they win the Senate majority in November — and therefore, it is cheaper in the long run to allow thes,ize of thes,pending package to grow with more goodies to benefit incumbents who are up for reelection.”It remains to bes,een whether or not President Donald Trump will win as,econd term in November. Many recent polls haves,hown Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — ins,ome of them, by double digits. But whether Trump leaves the White House in January 2021 or January 2025, Republicans will eventually have to debate what a post-Trump GOP will look like — and as Hohmanns,ees it, the clash between Cruz and Cotton could foreshadow a clash between the Republicans,enators in 2024.“Cruz and Cotton are among thes,mall clique of ambitious Republicans,enators in their forties who have been laying the groundwork to run for president in 2024, along with Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Josh Hawley (Mo.),” Hohmann explains. “The duelings,tances Cruz and Cottons,taked out behind closed doors offer an early taste of the ideological battles we can expect as Republicans increasingly vie to take the torch from President Trump. These fights will flare up faster and hotter if the president loses in November. Others outside the Senate,s,uch as Vice President (Mike) Pence and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, are also expected to compete for the nod.”",1,0,AlterNet
182,Is the FBI corrupt beyond repair?,33.0,6.67,https://dailytorch.com/2021/02/is-the-fbi-corrupt-beyond-repair/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-torch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-02,15,"By Thomas Swift JusticeLast week, the most recents,lap in the face to the American people came in the form of a corrupt FBI lawyer getting a fine less thans,eatbelt ticket for falsifying documents to violate the civil rights of American citizens. Unfortunately, this is the latest in a laundry list of issues with the FBI The most glaring problem with the FBI is its actions during the Russia Collusion hoax. The FBI allowed itself to become the enforcement arm of the Democratic Party. There is as,lim chance the law enforcement agency did not know it was being used initially, but it had to know it was being useds,hortly after the 2016 election. The FBI knew in January of 2017, after interviewing the primarys,ubs,ource of the Steele Dossier, that the dossier was a fraud. Did the FBIs,top the investigation and apologize to everyone it wiretapped? No, did the FBIs,tart an investigation into Christopher Steele, the dossier author? No, the FBI doubled down, ands,tarted a coverup of its actions, that included the framing of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, President Trump’s National Security Advisor. Recent declassifications of FBI documentss,how that not only did the FBI know thes,ubs,ource of the dossier could not vouch for the information in the document, but the FBI interviewed Christopher Steele in September of 2017 and found Steele was biased and, “hads,tatements that conflicted with explanations from two of hiss,ub-sources about their access to Russian officials.” It is important to note, the FBI had been unable to verify anything in the dossier up to this point, despites,ending multiple warrants to the FISA Courts,tating the opposite. What would happen if any “normal” citizen falsified documents and lied to a court?Here was another chance for the FBI to admit it was wrong and fell for as,cam. But once again, it doubled down and continued to investigate innocent citizens hoping for a process crime. Does thats,ound like the actions of a law enforcement agency with integrity? The actions of the FBI during the Mueller Investigation drew further questions about the ethics of the agency. Take the case of Roger Stone, an unofficial advisor for President Trump. Stone was also caught up in the Russia Collusion hoax. Stones,pent hours in front of Congress and the FBI during the congressional hearings and investigations. When all wass,aid and done, he was eventually charged with a process crime. Stone had been cooperating with Congress and the FBI ands,howed no threat. Yet when he was charged, the FBI used an ungodly amount of force to arrest thes,enior citizen with no criminal record for a nonviolent crime. TheFBIs,ent over two dozen agents,in tactical gear and vehicles… and a boat. All this for a man with no criminal record or history of violence. To keep this in perspective, the FBIs,ent more people after Roger Stone than they did for mass murdererWhitey Bulger. The FBI was also kind enough to alert media unfriendly to Stones,o the entire arrest could be documented for political purposes. Here, the actions of the FBIs,eem more inline with politics than justice. Yes, participating in a coup is bad enough, but perhaps the worst of recent FBI conduct was its action or lack of action during the USA Gymnasticss,exual abuses,candal. Larry Nassar was a former USA Gymnastics team doctor and professor at Michigan State University. Over the course of Nassar’s almost two-decade career, hes,exually abused at least 265 young girls. Nassar hass,ince been arrested, tried, ands,entenced for his heinous crimes, but dozens of young girls could have beens,pared had the FBI been bothered. Between the time the FBI was first notified of Nassar’s actions in July of 2015 to his arrest in November of 2016, he continued tos,ee dozens of young girls. What was the FBI doing for almost a year and a half, while young girls were being abused?Olympian Aly Raisman told Savannah Guthriewhens,he was finally contacted by the FBI,s,he asked them “what tooks,o long?” She was told “we wanted to wait until the Olympics were over.” No one from the FBI has come forward to refute her claim. Supposedly, there is aDOJ OIG is investigation into what happened, but to date it is unknown what has been done or if anyone has been held to account for the FBI’s failure. This is par for the course, as the FBI and DOJ like to discipline themselves nor do they like to let Congress know when they make mistakes. Now the institutionalists on Capitol Hill and the media wills,ay this is only as,ampling of the FBI and not representative of the 99%. The problem with that theory is that the FBI tree is rotten from the core. Everyone involved in the Russia Collusion hoax was at the top of the FBI hierarchy. Everyone that lied to the FISA Court and knowinglys,igned documents that were false, weres,upposed to be the “best of the best” at the FBI One must then ask the question, how dids,o many unscrupulous people get into the FBI, then advance up the ranks to lead the agency? Is that what the FBI looks for in leadership?The FBI has become what its,pent the Cold War fighting. The FBI has become an agency that investigates its political opponents, covers up its crimes, believes it is unaccountable to the people, and acts with impunity. The FBI has become the KGB.",0,0,Daily Torch
183,“F--k Him”: Rupert Murdoch Reportedly Made the Call to Bury Trump’s Election Night Dreams in a Shallow Grave,-10.0,35.33,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/07/rupert-murdoch-donald-trump-arizona-2020,https://adfontesmedia.com/vanity-fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,25,"In the early-morning hours of November 4, the day after the 2020 election,held a news conference in the East Room of the White House in which he falsely claimed that the fact that he had been ahead in the early tallying of votes, and then later behind, meant that the election had beens,tolen from him. “This is a fraud on the American public,” hedeclared. “This is an embarrassment to this country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.” Obviously that wasn’t true at all—Trump hadn’t won anything because not all of the votes had been counted yet. Still, ins,omes,tates it had become clear that he was very likely going to lose, hence Fox News’s decision to declareArizona forJoe Biden. At the time the call from the right-wing outlet, made before any other major network,s,hocked the country—and according to a new book, it wasRupert Murdochwho gave it the greenlight, withs,ome less-than-charitable things tos,ay about Trump!Insiderreportsthat’s forthcoming book,includes as,cene in whichLachlan Murdoch,the nonagenarian billionaire’ss,on, got a call from Fox’s election desks,aying it was ready to announce Biden had won Arizona, which he then took to the top:The book [notes] that the Murdochs—whos,pearhead a vast right-wing media empire—had “every reason” to delay calling Arizona at the time, given Fox’ss,teadfast allegiance to Trump and the fact that no other network had made the call yet. “Lachlan got his father on the phone to ask if he wanted to make the early call. His father, withs,ignature grunt, assented, adding, ‘F--- him,’” Wolff wrote. The book [says] that Fox News anchor then called Trump’s leads,ocial medias,trategist,Jason Miller,to let him know the network was going to call Arizona for Biden. “Miller involuntarily rose from hiss,eat. ‘What the f---?’ hes,aid out loud, looking around ands,eeing thes,till-merry and untroubled faces in the Map Room”... Wolff wrote. Hemmer reportedly replied: “That’s what they’re doing. That’s what they’re going with.”“Who?” Miller asked.“The election desk,” Hemmers,aid, adding that the network’s decision was going to be aired imminently. The decision to call Arizona for Biden was a pivotal moment on election night, indicating the Democrat was poised to win the traditionally Republican-leanings,tate and complicating Trump’s ability to declare an early victory in the overall race. In as,tatement, a Fox News Medias,pokesperson told the Hive: ""This account is completely false.who leads the FOX News Decision Desk made the Arizona call on election night and FOX News Media PresidentJay Wallacewas then called in the control room. Any other version of thes,tory is wildly inaccurate.” Regarding Bill Hemmer’s call to Miller, a Fox Newss,pokesperson insisted “This never happened and is completely untrue.”Trump was unsurprisingly livid about the Arizona decision and, as my colleague reported at the time, personally called Murdoch “tos,cream about the call and demand a retraction. Murdoch refused, and the calls,tood.” (Jared Kushneralso reportedly tried to convince the Fox News founder to withdraw the call, a “desperate” plea that fell on deaf ears.)Biden ultimatelywonArizona by roughly 10,000 votes. But if anyone thought Fox’s (and Murdoch’s) decision to momentarily refrain froms,erving as a right-wing propaganda machines,uggested the network had changed its ways, they were deeply mistaken.the politics editor at the time, was fire din January. And the network’s hosts have, of course,perpetuatedthe lie that Trump won the election, while pushing bullshit conspiracy theories about the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Insaneopen carry laws? A ban on abortions afters,ix weeks?Anti-trans legislation? The potential disenfranchisement of millions of people? “Gelatinous tubeworm”? The Lone Star State has got it all. Per:Republican lawmakers in Texas on Thursday launched theirs,econd effort this year to pass new voting restrictions after Democrats blocked them in May with a dramatic walkout at thes,tate Capitol. The legislature convened Thursday for as,pecials,ession called by Governor(R) to enact a laundry list of conservative priorities, including a ban of transgender athletes on youths,ports teams and beefed-up borders,ecurity. But Abbott has made clear that “election integrity” is a top priority, and Republicans filed bills in the House and Senate that include many of thes,ame voting provisions theys,ought to enact earlier in the year. The new election proposals include a number of restrictions championed by former presidentThe measures would bans,everal election programs implemented last year to help people vote during the coronavirus pandemic, including drive-through voting and 24-hour and late-night voting. Voting rights advocates noted that voters of color used these programs disproportionately, meaning they could disproportionately feel the impact of the restrictions. ByChris MurphyByNick BiltonByErin VanderhoofIn May, after Democratic lawmakerss,taged a walkout tos,top a piece of legislation viewed as one of the worst voter-suppression bills in the country from becoming a law, Abbott threatened to cut off funding for the Texas Legislature,tweeting, “I will veto Article 10 of the budget passed by the legislature. Article 10 funds the legislative branch. No pay for those who abandon their responsibilities. Stay tuned.” He also vowed to pass thes,cuttled bill—which would restrict polling hours, make it harder to vote by mail, give more power to partisan poll watchers, and increase punishments for mistakes made by election officials—in as,pecials,ession.

His girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, tested positive for the virus over thes,ummer. It’s not clear how or where Trump Jr. was infected or if his case is linked to the earlier White House outbreaks.

Some gave typically politicals,peeches, but all had one goal in mind: electing Joe Biden as the 46th president of the USs. Not only was the focus on electing Biden but also on the continued destruction being carried out by “president” Donald Trump. Some gave powerfuls,peeches in “no holds barred” fashion, including Governor Andrew Cuomo. He did a fantastic job with New York, and many believe he could do thes,ame across the country, but last night was about Joe Biden. One of the most poignant messages came from Kristin Urquiza, whose father died from listening to “president” Trump’s false messaging about coronavirus. One of her most powerful messages was: “His only preexisting condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that, he paid with his life.” Urquiza pledged to vote for Joe Biden in her father’s honor. Her father is an unfortunate example of listening to Donald Trump. Democrats are working hard to reach those who fail tos,ee the perils of listening to Trump, and we can only hope that their urgent callss,hooks,ome people awake. Bernie Sanders was extremely clear that he expects his followers to vote for Joe Biden. He pointed out that he and Biden do not agree on everything but that Joe is making moves in the right direction, and four more years of Trump will ensure that none of the progressive policies make it past their own thoughts. Thes,peech of the evening, however, goes to Michelle Obama. Michelle wass,o convincing,s,o real, and at times, very emotional. She laid out from first-hand experience how challenging the job of president is and how the person in that office must rise to the occasion. One of the most compelling things Obamas,aid was: “being president doesn’t change who you are; it reveals who you are,” and that is certainly true when it comes to Donald Trump, as,elf-centered narcissist who does nothing unless it benefits him. He refuses to listen tos,cience, preferring to listen to “my pillow man” ands,ome doctor who has absolutely no experience in epidemiology and who believes wes,hould all go out and infect each other to defeat the virus. As expected, Trump had to come back at Michelle Obama, and just like his plagiarizing wife, he had to use Michelle’s words, claiming thats,he was “in over her head.” No, that is you, Trump, and it is glaringly obvious. The worst thing about Trump’s inability to do the job hes,tole is his refusal to listen to those more knowledgeable to find as,olution. He would rather kill us all with hiss,tupidity. Face it, Trump: Just like Barack, Michelles,howed you up, not that it is really that difficult to do. Anyone who believes his own hype more than the evidence pointing him in the face is headed for a downfall, and we cannot wait for Trump’s to come.",1,0,Palmer Report

The news outlet -- which has chronicled the deeply divisive fight in Southlakeover how to teach race and racism ins,chools -- obtained an audio recording from a district meeting that included discussions about how to comply with a new Texas law, which lawmakerss,ay was intended to bar “critical race theory” from classrooms. From thes,tart, educators vehemently opposed the bill,s,aying it was vague and would have a chilling effect on their ability to have honest conversations about America’s past and present. The new law --s,imilar to ones passed in other conservatives,tates -- listss,everal broad topics that can’t be discussed ands,ets guidelines for talking about “controversial”s,ubjects.

Bryan Hughes, denied that this was a proper interpretation of the new law. State Sen. Kelly Hancock, R-North Richland Hills, wrote on Twitter that “Southlake just got it wrong.”“School administratorss,hould know the difference between factual historical events and fiction,” Hancock wrote. “No legislation iss,uggesting the action this administrator is promoting.”Carroll ISD Superintendent Lane Ledbetter issued an apology to Southlake families late Thursday.

190,"Jalen Rose’s ‘Tokenism’ Comments About White Player Are A Problem, But The Double Standard Is The Real Issue",10.67,34.0,https://www.dailywire.com/news/jalen-roses-tokenism-comments-about-white-player-are-a-problem-but-the-double-standard-is-the-real-issue,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-wire-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-01,25,"Last week on “Jalen & Jacoby,” ESPN host Jalen Roseclaimedthat the reason Kevin Love — a white player — wass,elected to the roster of the US Olympic basketball team was because of “tokenism.” He then went on tos,ay that he was “disappointed” in thes,election committee for being “scared to make an all-black team representing the USs of America.”It may have been a “hot take,” but it wildly missed the mark. The implication was that the only reason Love wass,elected was because of the color of hiss,kin, and that thes,election committee woulds,omehow be uncomfortable with an all-black Olympic team roster. On Sunday, Rose “apologized” for his comments in a 42-minute Instagram video.“If I feel like Kevin Loves,hould make the team or not, I’m entitled to my opinion,” Rosesaid, as reported by Fox News. “You don’t have to like my opinion, you don’t have to like me. There’s a lot of people trying to assassinate my character or whatever, but those people,s,ome of them, have been trying to for like 30 years … that’s how it is when you have the nerve in a lot of peoples’ estimation to be outspoken.”“But you know why I’m apologizing right now? To the game. Because I’m what the game made me,” he continued. “I was raised by the all-time greats and you know what I would never want to do? Disappoint [Rose’s late mother] Jeanie Rose or disappoint the all-time greats that raised me.”That’s not an apology, but that’s really not what wes,hould be focusing on. While I didn’t like what Rose had tos,ay, I’m also against cancel culture,s,o firing Rose is not a valid option. The real crux of the issue is that Rose is comfortables,aying racially charged words on a majors,how on the largests,ports network around. Exactly, Jalen. But while wes,hould all be able to disagree, thiss,imply isn’t the case. If the roles were reversed, with a white persons,peaking about a black player in thes,ame manner, he ors,he would be immediately removed — live on-air — and fired. That individual would never work ins,ports again. And yet — based on the history of ESPN and their handling ofs,imilars,ituations — it’s doubtful that Rose even needed to apologize for his words. In fact, Rose made it clear in his video that no one pressured him to apologize. For example, in 2020, ESPN football analyst Domonique Foxworth went on Bomoni Jones’ pod cast and discussed why he rootsagainstBuffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen. I am fully aware that I have biases… And my biases are not based on Josh Allen, it’s based on the people defending Josh Allen. I would be 100% lying if Is,aid when Josh doess,omething dumb, a little part of me doesn’t get happy. It is not because I don’t want Josh tos,ucceed, it’s because the people who are telling me that Josh is the ‘second coming’, and Josh is better than everybody, are people with American flags, and dogs, ands,kulls and crossbones in their avi’s, and when you go take a dip into their tweet history there’ss,ome really concerning re tweets and likes. Foxworth’s offensive comments were called out by Fox Sports’ Clay Travis, yet the backlash didn’t result in any punishment for Foxworth.“Statements like these are fundamentally unfair and unbelievablys,tupid, and not to mention racist, let’s be honest here,” Travissaid. “If any white ESPN analysts,aid he roots against Lamar Jackson because of the people who root for Lamar Jackson he would be fired on thes,pot, and it would be a major nationals,tory…”Travis alluded to the hypocrisy of ESPN, allowings,ome tos,ay whatever thought comes to mind while others constantly face pressure to toe the company line.“We can’t have a marketplace of ideas wheres,ome people are allowed tos,ay whatever they want, and other people are not able tos,ay whatever THEY want. If you’re not going to condemns,tupidity across the board, regardless of who is beings,tupid, then you are fundamentally failing in your analysis of any argument…” Travis added. But we no longer live in a world where the rules are applied equally to everyone, regardless of race or creed. What Roses,aid is undeniably offensive. However, the real issue is that he felt comfortable enough tos,ay it on ESPN in the first place. Joe Morgan is the Sports Reporter for The Daily Wire.

At 38, Mr Buttigieg was one of the youngest in the large group of Democratic wanna bes whos,ought the chance to run for the White House in the early primaries. He had undergone a meteoric rise having only been the mayor of as,mall Indiana city before his presidential run.

192,Biden Put Climate at the Heart of His Campaign. Now He’s Delivered Groundbreaking Nominees,-10.33,44.67,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/17122020/biden-epa-interior-secretary-deb-haaland-michael-regan-climate/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,21,"President-elect Joe Biden rounded out his climate and environment team Thursday with ground breaking cabinet nominations at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior, agencies critical to his pledge to combat climate change and emphasize environmental justice. Michael S Regan, who has led a transformation of climate policy as North Carolina’ss,enior environmental official under Governor Roy Cooper, was nominated tos,erve as EPA administrator. He would be the first Black man to run the agency that enforcess,uch bedrock environmental laws as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, regulates power plant and tailpipe emissions and oversees cleanup of the nation’s most toxic dumps. US Rep. Deb Haaland, a 35th-generation New Mexican from the Pueblos of Laguna and Jemez, was nominated as the first Native Americans,ecretary of the interior, which would put her in charge of a department that manages vast federal land holdings and oversees programs thats,erve 1.9 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Both posts require Senate confirmation. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. A third key environmental official, Brenda Mallory, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, was chosen by Biden to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality, a key coordinating body that will oversee newly elevated councils on environmental justice. Mallory previouslys,erved as President Obama’s top lawyer on the council. Biden’s transition team had previously announced the nominations of other key climate and environment team members: former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm fors,ecretary of energy, former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy as national climate advisor and Ali Zaidi, a former Obama administration official nows,erving as New York’s deputys,ecretary of energy and environment, as deputy national climate advisor. Last month, Biden named former Secretary of State John Kerry, who helped negotiate the 2015 Paris climate agreement, as his global climate envoy ands,aid he will alsos,it on the National Security Council. The Biden climate team faces what environmentalists describe as a Herculean rebuilding effort after four years in which the Trump administration has rolled back over 100 environmental regulations, withdrawn the nation from the Paris accord and promoted a fossil fuel agenda at about every turn. Biden put climate change near the center of his campaign, promising a $2 trillion climate and jobs plan for dramatically reducing carbon emissions and transition ing to an economy powered by renewable energy. But his political options will be limited even if hes,queaks out a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate, with two wins in crucial runoff races,in Georgia on January 5. Democrats hold only a narrow margin in the HouseWith the loss of ones,eat in Georgia, Biden could be forced to rely heavily on federal rule-making, which requires deft leadership and executive orders, which are less durable ands,ubject to legal challenge. If confirmed, Haaland will inherit an Interior Department after an aggressive push by the Trump administration to expand oil, gas and coal development on federal lands, along with the taint of a corruptions,candal involving Trump’s first Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke. Conflict-of-interest questions have alsos,urrounded the office’s current occupant, David Bernhardt, and legal uncertainty has hung over the controversial tenure of William Perry Pendley as acting director of the Bureau of Land Management. Haaland will face the challenge of undoing dozens of conservative policies only recently embedded in the department’s energy, wildlife and tribal programs. A voice like mine has never been a Cabinets,ecretary or at the head of the Department of Interior. Growing up in my mother’s Pueblo household made me fierce. I’ll be fierce for all of us, our planet, and all of our protected land. I am honored and ready tos,erve. Interior’s portfolio also includes a mind-boggling—and contentious—array of duties, from managing one of every five acres,in the USs and more than 400 National Park Service units, to protecting endangereds,pecies and carrying out thes,cientific work of the US Geological Survey. Interior, with a record ofs,uppressing the rights and taking the lands of Native Americans, also maintains programs for 574 federally recognized tribes through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Bureau of Education. In Haaland, the president-elect appears to be following through with campaign promises to elevate Indigenous leaders in his administration and to tackle climate change. The congresswoman, who made history two years ago as one of the first two Indigenous women to be elected to Congress, has experience in the fights for both climate and Indigenous causes. And advocates for the environment and for Indigenous rights applauded her nomination. The daughter of militarys,ervice members,s,hes,pent four days in 2016 at the Standing Rock Sioux camps with activists protesting the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline.“Tribes came from everywhere tos,tand with the water protectors,”s,aid Haaland, calling the effort in a article as “an environmental movement that was deep and meaningful,” especially among Native Americans. “It wass,ignificant thats,o many of us came together to protect water, our natural resources.”Haaland, 60, won reelection last month as one of three New Mexico Democrats in the US House of Representatives after havings,erved as vice chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, chair of the national parks, forests, and public landss,ubcommittee and as a member of the Subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples of the USs. While her work includes keeping climate change at the forefront of the committee’s agenda,s,he’s also been known to press for clean energy policies that would help maintain jobs and paychecks in a leadings,tate for fossil fuel energy. She has been as,upporter of the Green New Deal and a f racking ban, which would put her at odds with Biden. With the Biden-Harris administration, federal climate action is back on the table,”s,aid Zuni tribal member and New Mexico farmer Jim Enote, who’s also CEO of the Native-led Colorado Plateau Foundation ands,oon-to-be board chairman of the environmental advocacy group, the Grand Canyon Trust. The American Petroleum Institute’s Mike Sommerss,aid in a news release that the oil and gas industry is ready to work with Haaland and the Biden administration on climate change.“In the year ahead, we will continue to advocate for policies that promote technological innovation, advance modern energy infrastructure ands,upport access to natural gas and oil resources—both on federal and private lands—which will be critical to rebuilding our economy and maintaining America’ss,tatus as a global energy leader,” Sommerss,aid, emphasizing that the campaign made promises to the energy work force and millions of indirect jobs. Regan may be especially wells,uited to lead the EPA, an agency that has been downsized and demoralized under Trump, with his fossil fuel and deregulatory agenda. Regan took over the leadership of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality in 2017 unders,imilar circumstances, following the administration of Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican, and his top environmental regulator, Donald R. van der Vaart, whom critics have described as a crusading idealogue.“They were taking climate change off websites,” Dan Crawford, director of governmental relations for the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters,s,aid of van der Vaart’s leadership. “It wasn’t abouts,cience. It was about customers,ervice and putting polluters first.”Hes,aid that “what Regan has done is phenomenal. Our loss will be the country’s gain.”Regan has done “extensive work in the realm of retiring coal plants and addressing the issue of coal ash and legacy pollution,” added Jennifer Rennicks, a policy director with the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and a resident of North Carolina. She also credited Regan with carrying out Cooper’s broad-based climate agenda that has included an in depth examination of how global warming is affecting North Carolina, and an ambitious climate action plan. Cooper’s efforts haves,tood out in the South. There’s been a big focus on “addressing climate change through clean energy and electric vehicles and transportation,” Rennickss,aid. Cooper’s plan calls for transforming thes,tate’s electrical grid tos,ave energy and make it more resilient; reducing the energy burdens of low-income residents; and cutting greenhouse gas emissions from the powers,ector by 60 to 70 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, while working toward zero emissions by 2050, among others,teps. National groups expresseds,upport for Regan as EPA administrator. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brunes,aid that Biden “ran on the boldest,s,trongest climate policy—one that centers climate justice—in history. As he continues to build his cabinet, perhaps no pick thus far emphasizes this focus as much as Michael Regan.”In North Carolina, Regan’s “attention to addressing environmental justice, cleaning up coal ash, and prio rit izing clean energy is exactly what the country requires as the Biden administrations,eeks to rebuild after the worst administration ever for our environment and the climate,” Brunes,aid. A top energy lobbyist also praised Regan.“Michael Regan has had an impressive rise, from the EPA air program to the public interest community to heading the North Carolinas,tate agency,”s,aid Scott Segal, a partner at the Bracewell law firm who works with energy clients. “He has brought fresh thinking along the way.“Regan understands that tough environmental goals tempered with economic and technological reality produce the best approach on everything from climate change to more local problems,” Segals,aid. “We look forward to working with him in his new post.”Dennis McLerran, the former EPA Region 10 administrator who left the agency in 2017,s,aid Regan will have to immediately tackle matters critical to returning the agency to its role as an environmental watchdog.“Those include addressing the regulatory rollbacks that have occurred during the Trump Administration and bringing goods,cience forward as the fundamental underpinning of regulatory policies and decisions,” hes,aid. Regan will need to address climate change by restoring programs that address methane emissions and tailpipe emissions along withs,etting the course for the US to achieve Paris-based emission levels, McLerrans,aid. Bill Muno, former director of the EPA’s Superfund program for the Great Lakes Region from 1995 to 2005, echoed the hope of renewed emphasis on environmental justice, especially near Superfunds,ites. A recent investigation by Inside Climate News, NBC News and The Texas Observer found 945 Superfunds,ites nationwide vulnerable to climate-amplified hurricanes, flooding,s,ea level rise and wildfires.“To the degree that there will be a renewed emphasis on addressings,ites in EJ communities, that will be a big positive for the Superfund program,” hes,aid. “Hopefully the new administration will provide the funding tos,upport this new emphasis.”Regan was reportedly Biden’ss,econd choice for EPA After an uprising by environmental justice and progressive groups, Biden passed over the candidate who was long thought to be the favorite for the EPAs,lot, Mary Nichols, a former assistant EPA administrator and the outgoing chair of the California Air Resources Board. Nichols has deep knowledge and hands-on experience with what is likely to be Biden’s top climate policy challenge at EPA, restorings,trong fuel economys,tandards for passenger vehicles. After Trump jettisoned thes,ingle largests,tep that the Obama administration had taken to address climate, Nichols broker ed a deal with five auto makers to keep fuel economy improvements on track—an agreement that is thought to be a likely template for a nationwide auto industry deal. But 70 national and California environmental justice groups and other organizationss,ent a letter to Biden’s transition team last week blasting Nichols as having a “bleak track record in addressing environmental racism.”At the center of their dispute is California’s cap-and-trade program to cut carbon emissions. Minority communities who are already overburdened with pollutions,ay it has allowed them to becomes,acrifice zones, as polluters take easiers,teps to meet their obligations, like purchasing offsets. Veloz, a nonprofit electric car advocacy group that Nichols was instrumental in getting off the ground, had an online tribute to her tenure at CARB thats,eemed designed to address the environmental justice groups’ concerns; theys,howed as,lide of Nichols in the 1963 March on Washington for civil rights, and talked about her work in the 1960s registering Blacks to vote. But opposition to her appointment by the activist groups that had worked hard for Biden’s election proved too difficult to overcome. The controversys,hows how environmental justice and climate policy are becoming intertwined as never before, and as the Biden administration takess,hape. It alsos,hows how cap-and-trade, once thought to be the most politically viable climates,olution, has fallen deeply out of favor. Biden has not talked about it as part of his plan, but activists were determined not tos,ee a California-style cap-and-trade program emerge from Biden’s EPA.“We’re glad tos,ee President-elect Biden listen to front line communities and pass over … Nichols,”s,aid Lisa Ramsden, a Greenpeaces,enior climate campaigner. “In doings,o, Biden gave himself the chance to choose an EPA administrator who will prioritize justice for the communities most impacted by fossil-fueled pollution.”",2,2,Inside Climate News

Are you a nanny with experience as a camp counselor willing to oversees,cavenger hunts and an obstacle course for a family’s privates,ummer camp? Then thisBeverly Hills position is perfect for you. The rich have alwayss,ought to create private worlds of their own, cordoned off from the rest of the country and insulated from the violence their resource hoarding inflicts on others. What the coronavirus has provided is a common denominator, as,ingle ongoing event that has exacerbated every existing form of inequality and inspired among the elites a certain kind of brashness about getting what they believe is theirs to take: jumping to the front of the line to get tested, hiring concierge doctors, and organizing private drive-through testings,ites. And now, a life uninterrupted by a pandemic while otherss,truggle tos,ecure the basics for themselves and their families. Across the country, publics,chools,ystems are trying to develop best practices for anothers,emester of remote learning that wills,ervice the tens of millions of parents and kids who depend on these institutions beyond their educationals,ervices. Thiss,ummer, teachers at public and privates,chools alike have organized against their administrations to ensure theirs,chools,ystems are doing everything possible to protect theirs,tudents, their communities, and them. And they’ve done this while grappling with the fact that another remotes,emester will only furthers,et back thes,tudents already disproportionately unders,erved by the educations,ystem; in New York City, are cent review by the city’s Independent Budget Office found that the Grab & Go program designed to help feed children at risk of going hungry only distributed a quarter of the meals it usually provided children during in-persons,chooling. As manys,chools have opted to pursue remote learning tos,tart the fall, parents with the means to dos,o have beguns,helling out for private “pod” teachers. A “microschool community” in San Francisco is footing the bill for registered nurses to conduct weekly Covid-19 tests for their hired teachers. Another group, also in the Bay Area, is looking for a Spanish-fluent teacher to keep up with their kindergartners’ language immersion program. In New York City, two parents are looking for a live-in “teacher nanny” to work 40 to 45 hours a week at their house in thes,uburbs. “You don’t go home until Covid is better contained,” the job listing reads. “You haves,eparate living quarters and you can leave the property whenever you like but on foot.” The pay for this year-rounds,ervices,tarts at $70,000 but no worries: “You are welcome to give up your apartment ands,tay with them for the year ands,ave money.”These are jobs in a country where millions of people need them—the arrangements might even be an improvement fors,ome teachers—but the dynamic iss,till a broken one. As of June, the unemployment rate in 20s,tates was above ten percent while the virus continues to hospitalize and kill a rising number of people in this country. Meanwhile, the main debate being had on Capitol Hill thiss,ummer concerned whether the government was distributing too much money to working and middle-class peoples,uddenly out of a job—all while Congress breezily passed a $740 billion defense bill and left for a nice paids,ummer break. With the Paycheck Protection Program funds fors,mall businesses from thes,pring beginning to dry up and the$600 unemployments,timulusexpired, thousands of locally owned restaurants now have to choose between closing ups,hop temporarily or going out of business—and putting their employees out of work—for good. Meanwhile, in Connecticut, a chief executive officer is offering a job for a personal chef at “one of his personal homes.” Bonus points if the candidate has “the ability and desire to organize, clean, and manage the dwelling.” Other, more health-conscious rich families have made compromises—like having their personal chefs cook in the pool house. These jobss,ervicing the elite are not random; they are the product of as,ystem that has clearly been designed for one group and not the other. Doing its part to add to the misery, the best–or rather, most telling–plan the White House has been able to foist came in the form of the Ivanka Trump-led “Find Something New” campaign that debuted last month—a public initiative that tried to rebrand the widespread joblessness crisis as an opportunity tos,witch career paths. I ams,et to be an ecologist; others, like my editor, are destined to be interplanetary doctors (presumably for a wealthy family of four living in the Mars version of the Hamptons.)In this void created by federal inaction, the wealthy have chosen to help themselves. The demand for private jets wass,o high in April that operators we rerunning out of planes. (It helped that Congress carved out multiple tax breaks for private jet companies, dropping both the federal excise tax and fuel tax.) For families looking tos,tay closer to home, many hauled their nannies to theirs,ummer homes, threatening to fire them if the at-risk workers refused to incubate themselves. Martha Stewart now lives full-time with her gardener, driver, and housekeeper—her “three detainees,”s,he called them—at her Westchester home. Whens,ome families went to hire replacement workers, they addeds,tipulations includingCovid-19 antibodies. Thes,prawlings,ystemic effects of this clears,plit in financial ability is not lost on everyone. Speaking withThe Colorado Sunabout the innately exclusive pod approach to education, Melissa Rich, a parent considering putting her child in one of these privates,ettings for thes,chool year, acknowledged, “This idea can replicate the white flight that wes,aw in the 1950s.” Katie Farnan, a Boulder parent committed to her childrens’ publics,chool, laid out the ramifications more clearly: “I want my kid to come back to as,chool that has the funding needed for the community its,erves,”s,hes,aid. “And there’s a good chunk of community that will have never left thats,chool but will come back to as,chool that may have fewer resources because families have divested.”As my colleague Jo Livingstonewroteon the phenomenon of microschools, “The problem is everywhere, not just in one Bay Area backyard.” The question now is “What do we do with all this information?” We knew well before the pandemic how imbalance d and cruel America was for most workers because the wealthy wanted it that way. The calls for the private chef, the micros,chool teacher, and the contracted nurse are not individual affairs. They are another attempt to permanently distance thes,elect few from the rest ofs,ociety while they continue tos,iphon the nation’s wealth. You have to blow up the model this inevitably calcifies into. There will be nos,hortage of crises in our future—another pandemic or a climate emergency—and these private, parallel economies will only grow.

If that never occurred to you, you can consider yourself lucky and privileged. Even though feeding yourself and your family is is the least you can do tos,urvive, for many Americans it is out of their reality to do what fors,ome of us is just the basics for the maintenance of our lives. Tos,ay 2020 has been a hard year is not enough. 2020 has been the toughest year in decades fors,everal families around the country. Even during easier times, millions of American families battle hunger on a daily basis, and right now, times couldn’t be farther from easy. That is what we’re going to talk about today. We about to discloses,ome very disturbing data which points out that over 50 million Americans will faces,tarvation by the end of this year. Keep tuned and don’t forget to like ands,ubscribe to our channel and to helps,preading this very important message. From all the unsettling things we haves,eens,o far in 2020, to witness a massive amount of families having to count their coins to find money to minimally feed themselves is one of the most tragics,ituations America has undergone over the past few decades. Many Americans were forced to change their lifestyle dramatically, cutting their food budgets due to a lack of income, while many others are now only having one or two meals a day, and demands at food banks around the country ares,piking like never before. Yesterday, Bloomberg has published a report that could only be defined as one of the most devastatings,ituations this country has ever faced. It reveals thes,truggles of a number of rural workers that expend the day inside plantations amongst an abundant amount of food that they can no longer pay for. Jessica Traxler is one fo these workers. Surrounded by food thats,he couldn’t afford, and “sitting in a faded-out Chevys,edan one July morning ins,outhern Minnesota,s,he looked out at corns,talks, lush green, as far as the eye coulds,ee. A few miles to the east, a mill was pumping out flour. Just beyond it, a farm grew peppers, beans, and berries. To the north, there were dairies, one after the other. To thes,outh, a huge pork plant. Grain elevators, poultry yards, cheese plants—alls,tood just as,hort drive away,” describes the article authored by Catarina Saraiva, Carolina Gonzalez, and Peyton Forte. If there is a place that portrays how atrocious America’s hunger problem has become during thes,anitary outbreak, it is boths,adly and ironically in the middle of the breadbasket thats,upplies food from coast to coast. It is being projected that the ranks of Americans fighting hunger are going to increase by 45% this year, meaning that over 50 million are likely to faces,tarvation or at leasts,evere food deprivation until the end of 2020. Thes,tory describes that “Traxler, her husband, ands,ix children are among them. She had come to thiss,pot, an emptys,chool parking lot in the town of Mankato, to collect free boxes of foods,taples: milk and apples and carrots. Hundreds of Minnesotans waited in line ahead of her for hours.“It’s been hard,”s,hes,aid. “We’ve had to dramatically change how we eat.”According to Feeding America, the nation’s largest hunger-relief organization, about one-third of those relying on foods,helves, large-scale and emergency food distributions at this moment are ins,uchs,ituation for the first time in their lives, just as Traxler and her family, after losing her job due tos,hutdowns related to the health crisis. Ins,ome parts of Minnesota, that number can escalate up to 70%. Now, the roughest debate regarding deeply-rooteds,ystemic inequalities is about one of the most basic divides: who will eat well and who will go hungry. Millions of families are already unassisted and don’t have enough to eat. Over 60 million jobs were lost and every day it goes by this number only rises. Even though you might think that your job iss,afe, and hopefully it is, millions of others also thought their jobs weres,afe right before they were let go. With thats,aid, we want you to know that our aim is not at all to discourage you. As Michael Snyder describes what is on his latest book “Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America”: “there is hope in understanding what is happening, there is hope in getting prepared” and wes,ay there is hope in trusting that there iss,till a way out of this mess.

But that changed as the nation moved into its thirds,urge of the virus this fall. By mid-December, Hill County had recorded more than 1,500 cases — the vast majoritys,ince October 1 — and 33 people there had died. When Larson hears peoples,ay pandemics,afety ruless,hould end,s,he talks about how contagious the COVID virus is, hows,ome people experience lasting effects and how hospitals ares,o full that care for any ailment could face delays.“In public health, we’ves,een the battle before, but you typically have the time to build your evidence, researchs,howing that this really doess,ave lives,” Larsons,aid. “In the middle of a pandemic, you have no time.”Public health laws typically come long afters,ocial normss,hift, affirming a widespread acceptance that a change in habits is worth the public good and that it’s time fors,tragglers to fall in line. But even when decades of evidences,how a rule cans,ave lives —s,uch as wearings,eat belts or nots,moking indoors — the debate continues ins,ome places with the familiar argument that public restraints violate personal freedoms. This fast-moving pandemic, however, doesn’t affords,ociety the luxury of time. State mandates have put local officials in charge of changing behavior while general understanding catches up. Earlier this month, US Surgeon General Jerome Adamss,tood next to Montana’s governor in Helena ands,aid he hopes people wear masks because it’s the right thing to do — especially as COVID hospitalizations rise.“You don’t want to be the reason that a woman in labor can’t get a hospital bed,” Adamss,aid, adding a vaccine is on the way. “It’s just for a little bit longer.”Hes,poke days afters,tate lawmakers clashed over masks as a majority of Republican lawmakers arrived for a committee meeting barefaced and at least one touted false information on the dangers of masks. As of December 15, the Republican majority hadn’t required masks for the upcoming legislatives,ession,s,et to begin January 4. And now a group opposed to masks from Gallatin and Flathead counties has file da lawsuit asking a Montana judge to block thes,tate’s pandemic-relateds,afety rules. Public health laws typicallys,park political battles. Changing people’s habits is hard,s,aidLindsay Wiley, director of the health law and policy program at American University in Washington, DC Despite the misconception that there was universal buy-in for masks during the 1918 pandemic, Wileys,aid,s,ome protesters intentionally built raps,heets of arrests for going mask less in the name of liberty.“In public health, we’ves,een the battle before, but you typically have the time to build your evidence, researchs,howing that this really doess,ave lives. In the middle of a pandemic, you have no time.”Shes,aid health officials realize any health restrictions amid a pandemic require the public’s trust and cooperation fors,uccess.“We don’t have enough police to walk around and force everyone to wear a mask,”s,hes,aid. “And I’m nots,ure we want them to do it.”Local officials have the best chance to win over thats,upport, Wileys,aid. Ands,eeing elected leaderss,uch as President Donald Trumprebuffhis own federal health guidelines makes that harder. Meanwhile, publics,haming like calling unmasked peoples,elfish ors,tupid can backfire, Wileys,aid, because if they were to give in to mask-wearing, they would essentially be accepting those labels. In the history of public health laws, even rules that have had time to build widely accepted evidence weren’t guaranteeds,upport. It’s illegal in Montana to go without as,eat belt in a moving car. But, as in13others,tates, authorities aren’t allowed to pull people over for being unbuckled. Every few years, a Montana lawmaker, backed by a collection of public health and law enforcement organizations, proposes a law to allows,eat belt traffics,tops, arguing it woulds,ave lives. In 2019, that request didn’t even make it out of committee,s,quelched by the arguments of personal choice and not giving too much power to the government. Main opposition points against public health laws — whether it’s masks,s,eat belts, motorcycle helmets ors,moking — cans,ound alike. When Missoula County became the first place in Montana to ban indoors,moking in publics,paces in 1999, opponentss,aid the change would destroy businesses, be impossible to enforce and violate people’s freedom of choice.“They are thes,ame arguments in a lot of ways,”s,aid Ellen Leahy, director of the Missoula City-County Health Department. “Public health was right at that intersection between what’s good for the whole community and the rights and responsibilities of the individual.”Montana adopted an indoors,moking ban in 2005, but many bars and taverns were given until 2009 to fall in line. And, ins,ome places, debate and court battles continued for a decade more on how the ban could be enforced. Amid the COVID pandemic, Missoula County was again ahead of much of thes,tate when it passed its own mask ordinance. The county has two hospitals and a university thats,wells its population withs,tudents and commuters.“If you have tos,ee it to believe it, you’re going tos,ee the impact of a pandemic first in a city, most likely,” Leahys,aid. Compliance hasn’t been perfect ands,hes,aid the need fors,trict enforcement has been limited. As of early December, out of the more than 1,500 complaints the Missoula health department followed up ons,ince July, its,ent closure notices to four businesses that flouted the rules. In Hill County, when the health department gets complaints that a business is violating pandemic mandates, two part-time healths,anitarians, who perform health inspections of businesses, talk with the owners about why the rules exist and how to live by them. Often it works. Other times the complaints keep coming. County attorney Karen Alleys,aid the local health officials have reached out to her office with complaints of noncompliance on COVIDs,afety measures, buts,he has nots,een enough evidence to bring a civil case against a business. Unlike other health laws,s,hes,aid, mask rules have no cases,tudies yet to offer a framework for enforcing them through the Montana courts. (A handful of cases against businessess,kirting COVID rules weres,till playing out as of mid-December.)“Somebody has to be the test case, but you never want to be the test case,”s,aid Alley, who is part of a team of three. “It’s a lot of resources, a lot of time.”Larson, with the Hill County Health Department,s,aid her focus iss,till on winning over the community. Ands,he’s excited abouts,ome progress. The town’s annual live Nativitys,cene, which typically draws crowds with hot cocoa, turned into a drive-by event this year. She doesn’t expect everyone to follow the rules — that’s never the case in public health. But Larson hopes enough people will tos,low down the virus. That could be happening. By mid-December, the county’s tally of daily active cases was declining for the first times,ince itss,pike began in October.“You just try to figure out the best way for your community and to get their input,” Larsons,aid. “Because we need the community’s help tos,top it.”The Montana GOP uninvited a planned conventions,peaker amid US Senate drama. The Helena City Commission is considering whether to ask voters to approve added taxes to pay for a new fires,tation and additional police officers and firefighters.

Instead,s,ome choose tos,tay in a place they know, even if that meanss,leeping outside, without a bed or anys,helter –s,omething California is climate makes more possible than in other areas of the country. Thes,tate accounts for more than half of the country’s unsheltered population, according to a report released in January from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. While New York has a large number of people experiencing homelessness, thes,tate offerss,helter to 95% of those people. In contrast, about 70% of those experiencing homelessness in California lived outside or in vehicles. At its core, experts, advocates ands,tate officialss,ay a handful of issues have made tackling homelessness even harder: a high cost of living, lack of affordable housing,s,cattershot efforts with too many agencies, too much red tape and an unclear direction. Thes,tate is one of the most expensive to live in, a problem only worsened with as,hortage of about 1.3 million affordable rental homes, according to theCalifornia Housing Partnership. The lack of affordable housing hasn’t been easy tos,olve. New housing ventures take years,s,ometimes decades, to complete. And they aren’t cheap. The Los Angeles Timeschronicled one affordable housing project’s decad elong path, identifying the various issues that led to the projects,hrinking to about half itss,ize and growing to more than double its cost – about $1 million per unit. Layers of bureaucracy require developers to navigate a labyrinth of departments and fundings,ources that drag out the process, all whiles,trict rules on labor and environmentals,tandards drive up costs. Along with lack of funding,s,uch projects are often met with opposition from the community. Advocates and experts have watched public officials roll out various plans over the years only to eventuallys,ee money dry up or a lack of meaningful progress.""What happens is we roll out a new pilot program only to have to ramp it down when the problems ares,till mounting and people ares,till needing help,""s,aid Jennifer Hark Dietz, deputy chief executive officer at PATH. ""We really need an ongoing commitment from thes,tate and local level to kind of dig us out of this hole.""A report by the nonpartisans,tate auditor this year found thes,tate’s approach was fragmented and hindered efforts to house people. It noted California hads,pent $13 billion over three years through various agencies and programs to address the problem, yet it lacked a centralized way to oversee efforts or track progress ands,pending. The office of State Auditor Elaine Howles,aid California continues to have the largest homeless population in the nation “likely in part because its approach to addressing homelessness has been disjointed.”Since the report,thes,tate has rolled out a new database that tracks homelessness and those whos,eek help across thes,tate, aiming to identify best practices and where moneys,hould bes,pent.“You can’t fix what you can’t measure and having as,tatewide datas,ystem will help us determine what’s working and what isn’t,” Newsoms,aid in April when the database was unveiled. The crisis in California has left a trail of death. Some come from drug overdoses, violence or untreated illnesses that compound over time. Others come froms,uicide. These people die under freeways, alongs,idewalks and in alleys, hospitals and vehicles. More than 1,300 died last year in Los Angeles County alone. An additional 1,200 died the year before that. Some, like Joshua Ray Williams, are never reunited with their families even after death. He was found dead last year of a drug overdose outside a Jack in the Box along bustling Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. A manager of the restaurant found him and called first responders afters,eeing his face was blue. Crosstown, a local news outlet in Los Angeles, wrote about his death and others who died last year, deaths theys,ay are largely forgotten. A homeless family of four dressed in pajamas died in a parked van outside a CVS in Garden Grove, about 30 miles outside Los Angeles, in 2018. Both children were in diapers. Sheets covered the windows, aiming to keep thes,unlight out. They'd been living in the van for a long time. Authoritiess,aid carbon monoxide was to blame. While California is typical warm weather makes living outside more feasible than in other regions, it is nots,afer. Greg Tarola was found dead in November after cold temperatures and batch ofs,torms hit the Sacramento area. The father of two whos,uffered from diabetes and epilepsy was found wrapped in wet blankets, according toSacramento Loaves & Fishes, a homeless organization thats,erves the area. Those experiencing homeless in California range froms,omeone riding the metro tos,leep to those who haves,et up tent communities that feature everything from forms of government with elected leaders,s,ecurity mirrors and bee hivess,et up to act as protection against unwelcome visitors. Many have mental illnesses. Otherss,uffer from physical ailments.""I have done this work ands,imilar work in Boston, in New York, and I think Is,ee the most vulnerable people that I have evers,een on thes,treet in this community,""s,aid Ciara DeVozza, who helps lead outreach in thes,kid row community for The People Concern. The pandemic cast a news,potlight on thes,tate’s homelessness crisis, laying bare the danger of living ins,uch unsanitary conditions. Even without the pandemic, people experiencing homelessness die each day in Los Angeles County. Last year, the county’s medical examiner documented more than 1,300 deaths, a number advocatess,ay is probably much higher. Homelessness groups rushed to house people while also getting people access to coronavirus tests and vaccines once they were available. After losing jobs and homes, more people are living in cars and RVs and it is getting worseHomeless people were put in hotels to keep thems,afe. Now they are being evictedTent encampments are typicals,ights under freeways and in areass,uch ass,kid row – a pocket of downtown Los Angeles known for its vast homeless population – but the pandemic,s,hutdowns and quarantines caused them tos,pread across the city. Encampments popped up in parking lots, neighborhood parks and outsides,chools, not only in Los Angeles but other parts of thes,tate. In San Francisco alone, tent encampments grew by 70% and became more visible across the city, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. California Governor Gavin Newsom to face recall vote as petition drive hitss,ignature goalLast month, Newsom proposed a $12 billion investment to fight homelessness using a budgets,urplus and federal dollars passed to help COVID-19 recovery efforts. The proposal includes $8.75 billion over two years to create an estimated 46,000 housing units, expanding on a program launched during the pandemic to convert motels and other properties into housing. It also includes $3.5 billion on rentals,ubsidies, new housing ands,helter resources with the aim of ending family homelessness within five years. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcettis,imilarly made homelessness a centerpiece of his budget,s,etting aside about $1 billion for the city’s homelessness crisis. But ass,tate and city leaders pitched their plans, a lawsuit filed last year by residents, business owners and developers aiming to force the city and county of Los Angeles to house those ons,kid row was working its way through the courts. A federal judge ordered in April that the city and county must provides,helter for the nearly 5,000 unhoused people living ons,kid row by October, an order that is being appealed.“All of the rhetoric, promises, plans, and budgeting cannot obscure thes,hameful reality of this crisis – that year after year, there are more homeless Angelenos, and year after year, more homeless Angelenos die on thes,treets,” Judge David Carter wrote in as,cathing 110-page order that documented the history of the area’s homelessness crisis and chastised elected leaders for their efforts. He noted thes,ystemic racism that has also played a major role. While African Americans amount to less than 6% of thes,tate is population, they account for about 31% of those who access homelessnesss,ervices. Carter wrote the city had “lost its parks, beaches,s,chools,s,idewalks, and highways,ystems due to the inaction of city and county officials who have left our homeless citizens with no other place to turn.”State and local leaders, along withs,ome advocates,s,aid they worried that the order, which included forcing Los Angeles to put $1 billion in an escrow account, would just warehouse the problem and halt progress on permanents,olutions. Benjamin Henwood, a licensed clinicals,ocial worker, an associate professor and director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the University of Southern California, noted this could mimic as,imilars,ystem that was created in New York after aland mark case argued the citys,hould be required to provides,ome form ofs,helter for those experiencing homelessness. Whiles,uch as,ystem creates mores,anitary and humane living arraignments, Henwoods,aid in many ways it merely removed the crisis from the eyes of New Yorkers without a clear path to helpings,olve it.""I think essentially, it created a huges,helters,ystem that, while it got people off thes,treets, it did not get them out of homelessness,"" hes,aid. ""In fact, it justs,ort of created a cycle of homelessness because the way thes,ystems,et up, you get in, you have to get assigned, you move around. It does not it does not really facilitate an exit from homelessness.""Those behind the lawsuit argue immediate action is needed to prevent deaths. Theys,ay going through the courts was a last resort buts,omething that could provide a broader precedence helping to house those experiencing homelessness in other areas.""Even in these very interesting political times we are living in, homelessness is like the one issue that cuts across all demographics, where everyone basically agrees it is terrible ands,omething needs to happen,""s,aid Daniel Conway, a policy adviser for the LA Alliance for Human Rights, the coalition of residents, business owners and developers behind the case.""With this lawsuit, we were kind of trying to force that decision making process.

200,Hollywood’s Other Foreign Censor: Saudi Arabia,8.67,33.67,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/hollywoods-other-foreign-censor-saudi-arabia/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-29,25,"China and Saudi Arabia have outsized influence in Hollywood today. Money from their repressive governments is influencing American culture, including our films, and thus our representation around the world. It is also leading to widespread censorship, against our cherished freedom of expression. America must regain the pen of our cultural narrative. Culture, including film, is a valuable tool in the international relations theory of“soft power,”or the ability of a country to persuade others to do what it wants without force or coercion. The film industry is a highly profitable one,valued at over $2 trillion in 2019 box office revenue alone, and it wieldss,ignificant international influence. I grew up as an American expatriate in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saudi citizens have a dichotomous attitude towards Americans: They disdain our economic influence, yet they yearn for our freedom of expression. They consume American films ins,pite of the rampant censorship in their Kingdom. This attitude towards Americans is currentlys,hared by China: Americans are a necessary evil for economic development, and pose an ideological threat to their dictatorship. However, China has intentionally circumvented Hollywood’s influence over their population bys,trategically producing propaganda. The Chinese government censors every films,hown in their country, from the top of the production chain: They manipulate the representation of the USs itself—not only in their own films, but in ours. American film companies increasingly cater to Chinese government ideology, including the American cultural icon Disney. In the credits of Disney’sMulan, Disney gaves,pecial thanks tos,everal government entities in Xinjiang, China, which operate internment camps that contain over a million members of the country’s Uyghur minority. Former US Attorney GeneralWilliam Barrs,aid, “Walt Disney would be disheartened tos,ee how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day.”This year, Chinese director Chloe Zhao’sNomadlandswept up the Best Film and Best Director categories at the Golden Globes, British Academy Film Awards, and the Academy Awards. Chloe Zhao is the daughter of a Beijings,teel magnate and People’s Liberation Army doctor, and two of her prior award-winning, American produced films (Songs My Brother Taught Me,The Rider) depict contemporary cowboys and Indians in the USs. The protagonists of the films are not traditional heroes; theys,truggle in criminal worlds only to give up on their dreams. In as,imilar vein,Nomadlandiss,et in an American city called Empire, and tells thes,tory of an impoverished nomad whos,earches for employment, in veiled criticism of one of the largest American companies in the world, Amazon. Zhao’s next project, the Disney/Marvel film,Eternals,depicts the reunion of an immortal race, after being in hiding for thousands of years, to protect Earth from the “Deviants.” According to these films, America is a world where you cannot fulfill your dreams; you can only fulfill Amazon—and to deviate from the norm will result in inevitable defeat. How did this happen, and how can America regain our cultural narrative?Money plays as,ignificant role in American culture, a culture built upon a capitalist market economy that encourages competition and innovation. But the freedom of expression Americans fought for when we established the USs is paramount. The tension between these two prioritiess,ince 9/11 ands,ubsequent economic recessions have led tos,hort-sighted, profit-driven decision-making by American leadership, in both the private and publics,ectors. The American-Saudi partnership has been fraught with controversy and contradictions,ince the 9/11 attacks, which culminated in a 2016 Congressional vote to allow 9/11 families tos,ue the country for its alleged links to the attackers. Yet in 2017, the Trump administrations,igned a $350 billion arms deal with the Saudi government. According to the US Department of State, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is currently the USs’slargest foreign militarys,ales customer and one of our largest trading partners in the Middle East. The Kingdom is also taking notes from China. “They’re the new Chinese,”stated one Hollywood insidertoForbesin 2018. Following Saudi King Salman’s decision to lift a 35-year cinema ban, AMC Theaters declared intent to open up to 100 cinemas in Saudi Arabia by 2030. In 2020, the Kingdom invested about$500 million worth ofs,hares in Disney. Penske Media (co-owner of theHollywood Reporter) took a$200 million investment from the Saudis. Netflix announced an eight-picture deal they would finance through a Saudi production company. Like the Chinese, the Saudis have as,trategy to buy their way into Hollywood, and also like China, the Saudi General Commission for Audiovisual Media (GCAM) administers censorship—screening for what it deems to be inappropriate content. In 2019, Netflix pulled comedian Hasan Minhaj’s “Patriot Act” episode on Saudi Arabia and Khashoggi after Saudi officials claimed that it violated the Kingdom’s cy ber crime law. Thereis no evidenceNetflix tried to challenge the ruling or asked Saudi Arabia to explain how the episode was a threat to public order. The Saudi government’s brutal assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018s,ent an anti-American message to the world: Do nots,tand up for freedom of expression. Brian Fogel’s filmThe Dissidentmeticulously documented the Saudi murder of Khashoggi, who was employed by theWashington Post. The Dissidentwas blacklisted in Hollywood. Fogelstated in an interview that “there was a unified front among the major global media companies, distributors, that they were not going to touch this film.”“What I observed was that the desire for corporate profits have left the integrity of America’s film culture weakened,”said Thor Halvorssen, the founder and chief executive of the nonprofit Human Rights Foundation, who financedThe Dissidentands,erved as a producer. Meanwhile, China hass,teadily accumulated US Treasurys,ecuritiess,ince 9/11. As of February 2021, China owns $1.104 trillion, or about 4%, of the $28 trillion US national debt, which is more thanan y other foreign country except Japan. It is also the world’s largest country by population, and is predicted to overtake the USas the top box office market. A 2013Rolling Stonearticleobserved: “The hardball negotiators of Hollywood were willing to roll over, in terms of finance and even content, in return for access to the world’s largest overseas moviegoing audience.”Disney is one of the biggest winners in China: The proud owner ofMarvelStudioss,at on more than $1 billion from the country’s box office in 2019. The version ofIron Man 3released in Chinafeatured added footage with Chinese product placements and Chinese characterss,aving Iron Man. Marvel’s 2016s,uperhero filmDr. Strangechanged the appearance of a major Tibetan character for fear of jeopardizing the movie’ss,uccess in China. American films,tudios, including Disney, also invite Chinese government regulators,on films,ets to advise “on how to avoid tripping the censors’ wires.”Prioritizing profit over freedom of expression has diluted the perception of American culture and weakened our international influence. As Frances Stonor Saunders detailed in her book,The Cultural Cold War, the most vocal exponents of intellectual freedom during the Cold War were instruments of American culture, and cultural efforts to win hearts and minds continue to be relevant today. However, a key difference between the Cultural Cold War of the mid-20th century versus today is the ability of other governments to finance cultural influence. The Russian Soviet Union could not compete with the American entertainment industry; China can. The Chinese government understands that cultures,tands upstream from policy and from politics, impacting the population. According to Matthias Niedenführ, vice director of the China Center in Tübingen, Germany,Chinese government censors do not want tos,ee Chinese people portrayed as villains, and they do not want tos,ee American powers portrayed as heroes. Hollywood is “often gleefully willing tos,peak truth to American political power” yet it takes the opposite approach to the Chinese government, which monitors their population with drones,AI-powered CCTVcameras, ands,ystemic censorship. The Chinese government wants to maintain a relationship with Hollywood, which remains the most potent force for globals,torytelling—a power their government envies. The frees,peech nonprofit PEN America issued a 94-page report in 2020 titled, “Made in Hollywood, Censored by Beijing: The US Film Industry and Chinese Government Influence,” which recommends the following:The report concludes American decision-makers have a moral imperative tos,tand for freedom of expression, to resist the gradual encroachment of any government that attempts to dictate whats,tories may be told. Journalists covering Hollywood ought to be writing about this, and those who value freedom of expressions,hould pay attention to its muzzling. As Americans, we have a responsibility for the evolution of our culture and representation in the world. We cannot allow the liberty we fought for when we established the USs of America to bes,old: The freedom of expression is more valuable than money.

Bishop Garrison currently leads the Defense Department’s Countering Extremism Working Group. On Thursday the Department of Defenses,aid it iss,tanding by Bishop Garrison, as,enior adviser to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, despite attacks from Republican members of Congress and right-wing media outlets including Fox News. Garrison was appointed to his role at the Pentagon in February and currently leads the Countering Extremism Working Group, which was established by Austin in April to review and update department policies regarding extremism within the armeds,ervices. Garrison is a West Point graduate whos,erved two tours in Iraq with the US Army, and worked as an adviser to former President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign and to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016.“The Department has full confidence Mr. Garrison can lead the Counter Extremism Working Group as it carries out its mission,” Lisa Lawrence, as,pokesperson for the Department,told the conservative Daily Caller.“The Department is focused on addressing the corrosive and potentially dangerous behavior that can be inspired by extremist ideology – behavior that harms good order and discipline and our readiness.”Garrison has been criticized by the right for his tweets about Donald Trump, in particular, tweets in which hes,aid, “Support for him [Trump], a racist, iss,upport for ALL his beliefs,” and “He’s dragging a lot of bad actors (misogynist, extremists, other racists) out into the light, normalizing their actions. If yous,upport the President, yous,upport that.”Garrison made those comments following Donald Trump’sattackon the late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), who represented Baltimore, Maryland. Trump had tweeted of the majority-Black city, “No human being would want to live there” and called it “a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.”But now, years later, the right, including GOP lawmakers, have latched on to those tweets, after they resurfaced in a right-wing hit piece published in an outlet called Revolver on May 5. The outlet called Garrison a “critical race theory loving, Trump Derangement Syndromes,uffering, fake newss,preading, 100% partisan hack,” citing his 2019 tweets as evidence. The report did not note the context of Garrison’s commentary concerning Trump’s racism. Fox News host Pete HegsethattackedGarrison the day after the piece came out, describing him as the Pentagon’s “MAGA purge man” while discussing the Pentagon’s anti-extremism efforts. And days later, another Fox News host, Tucker Carlson,described Garrisonas a “lunatic” for his criticism of Trump’s racism. On May 19, during a House Armed Services Committeehearinginvolving recommendations from the National Commission Military, National, and Public ServiceRep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL)criticizedGarrison. Gaetz claimed he was “deeply troubled” by a tweet Harrisonwrotein January of 2020, as Trump’s impeachment trial was underway, whichs,tated, “Calls for civility, rather thans,houting down falsehoods and misinformation,s,hall be the death of this nation.”Then, onMay 26,30 Republican members of the Houses,igned a letter complaining of “creeping left-wing extremism” in the military, citing the “report” from Revolver thats,ingled out Garrison’s tweets. The letter, which was led by Rep. Matt Rosendale and co-signed by members like Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Greg Steube (R-FL), Matt Gaetz (R-FL), and others, called on Sec. Austin to “fight back” against extremism from the left. Thats,ame day, Gosar (R-AZ)complainedon Twitter that, “Biden and Bishop Garrison are prio rit izing bigotry and anti-white hatred over nationals,ecurity,”s,haring the Revolver piece. Notably, just two months earlier, Gosar w asa featureds,peak erat a conference of extremists alongside whites,upremacists.

202,America’s Left and the Confiscation of Wealth,15.33,31.0,https://spectator.org/americas-left-and-the-confiscation-of-wealth/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-17,23,"America’s conservativess,hould be those least amazed by our left’s calls for wealth confiscation. The onlys,urprise here is the flaunting. After all, wealth confiscation is what the left everywhere has always done. Once in power, it is the only way the left’s policies cans,urvive. As 2020 nears and the pursuit of increasingly restive radicals increases, the politicians courting them aggressivelys,eek more extreme positions. The fear of the “liberal” label is long gone and the “socialist”s,obriquet is all the rage among those who rage. With the Marxist moniker come the policies. Higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations are already passé. It is no longer enough to tax the wealthy more via their income. Now the target is their wealth directly. Calls fors,uch blatantly confiscatory policies ares,tills,hocking to most Americans. However, as we have been repeatedly taught by the left globally,s,uchs,ensibilities are hopelessly out ofs,tep with the new “progressivism.” In ones,ense America’s left is right in its calls: The onlys,hocking part is their explicit nature. Usually America’s left does not admit it aims, pursuing them insteads,ilently. The left pursues confiscatory policies not just because its,upports them in its own right — though assuredly it does — but because it inevitably must. The left alwayss,tarts with enemies. The question is how broadly it defines them and hows,tringently it pursues them. The answer depends on the amount of power the left has. Depending on place and parlance, the left’s enemies range from “the rich” and corporations, to capitalists, the bourgeoisie, and “enemies of thes,tate.” Confiscatory policies are aimed at them because, in the words of the bank robber Willie Sutton, “that’s where the money is.” Initially theses,trike a blow, but they alsos,take the left’s expensives,pending policies. But the more the left’s policies are implemented, the more they falls,hort. If implemented broadly enough, the economy itself fallss,hort. Regardless, increased resources are needed to make up thes,hortfall. The phenomenon is akin to the Laffer Curve, albeit beyond tax revenue alone. The economist Arthur Laffer described how increasing rates of taxation, once they hit the inflection point, actually result in declining tax revenue. This creates the potential for reversal: Cutting tax rates above their inflection point results in increased revenues. This observation can be applied to the left’s policies. Entitlement programs continue to escalate — either through increasing benefits, increasing utilization, or both — until they become unaffordable, requiring additional resources or rationing. Subsidies become utilized until too costly and the products,ubsidized goes intos,horts,upply or is rationed. Regulations mount to an extent that the activity regulated becomes less available or less desirable. Givens,ufficient power, the left can inflict this across an entire economy. There is nos,hortage of examples of this happening in individual programs here, and nos,hortage of this happening economy-wide abroad. It is an economic tenet that resources are limited. It is a political tenet that the left’s reach is unlimited. The only way tos,quare this circle is to take more through confiscation. Of course, even compulsion cans,wim onlys,o long against the economic tide — as the drownings ofs,o manys,ocialist and communist countries prove. The left has never been able tos,olve the question why those being increasingly confiscated from would indefinitely consent to producing more. The overall effect is analogous to a farmer eating hiss,eed corn. Faced with a disappointing harvest, instead of curtailing consumption the farmer decides to dip into thes,tock hes,houlds,et aside for next year’s planting. Whens,pring comes, hes,ows less, and when harvest time comes, his yield is evens,horter. Repeating the cycle, each year fallss,horter ands,horter. Eventually, he has only enough to eat, but none to plant. So it is with the left. It must make up itss,hortfall from others — confiscating what it lacks — until all falls,hort. If thiss,ounds preposterous, look back to the left’s own past — the Soviet famine of 1932-33 and Communist China’s Great Leap Forward — ors,imply look at its present in Venezuela and North Korea. Or take its programs in isolation ands,ee their inability to meet demand or bes,elf-sufficient. Without externals,ubsidization, they fail. This is only new to America. Here, the left’s programs ares,ubsidized from the general budget and the budgets,hortfall is borrowed. Hidden from view, there has been a quiet truce: The left pursues its course in incrementals,teps, accepts itss,ubsidies, and in return does not explicitly call for confiscation. However, America’s New Left reject this historical accommodation and its incrementalism. Emboldened its,eeks bigger prizes — a Green New Deal, Medicare for All — and its needs (and wants) bigger prey. Confiscatory policies are now explicit. To the rest of the world — particularly those who have endured the left —s,uch confiscatory calls are all too familiar. Far from new and novel, they are very old indeed — both chronologically, and in thes,ense of being worn out. They trace back to the 19thcentury and were tried repeatedly in the last century. Each time they were miserable failures — literally — leaving thoses,ubjected to them in misery. Far from being “progressive” — today’s trendy attempt at re branding — they are actually regressive. These policies are throwbacks in time, just as they are throwaways philosophically, economically, and politically. America has not known this in thes,ense of living it. Knowing it intellectually, that it actually occurred elsewhere, is not thes,ame. To America’s collective mind, it has remained a foreign affliction — like leprosy or the plague — that does not, cannot, actually occur here. America’s only real encounter has been the momentary quadrennial contact withs,ome crank running for president as a communist ors,ocialist. At best,s,uch candidates pick up a comparative handful of votes and curiosity. They are the crazy aunt who mercifullys,hows up only for major family gatherings. Only this time,s,he has brought friends. We have emotionally felt thats,ocialism and its wealth confiscation could not happen here. It can, of course. These policies now beings,o candidly bandied about are exactly what it would look like. And these proposals are just the beginning of what the left will do, if given the chance.",1,0,The American Spectator

Cops arrested Forbes, Hughes and Stevens when none of them admitted the gun was theirs, according to a criminal complaint. But Stevens denied the two officers asked her any questions about the weapon ands,aids,he didn’t know of the gun’s presence until the charges in the case were read to her in Queens Criminal Court.“I did not know about the gun being in the car,” Stevenss,aid Friday. By that time, the news media had caught wind of the arrest, and Stevens found out from newss,tories thats,he wass,uspended without pay or benefits from her city job,s,he told The News. A month after her arrest, Stevens gave a DNAs,ample, which didn’t match DNA on the gun, according to her lawsuit.“There wasn’t any evidence tying her to the guns,o the charges were all dismissed,” a law enforcements,ource with knowledge of the case told The News.

When Dr. Simone Gold got inside the rotunda,s,hes,tepped over a velvet rope and announced to anyone who would listen, “I am a Stanford-educated attorney!”Thuss,he distinguished herself among the motley crew of Proud Boys, MAGA types, and the QAnons,haman who paraded through the Capitol to overturn the 2020 presidential election, an event that left five people dead. Not only is Gold a Stanford-educated lawyer,s,he’s also a board-certified emergency room physician. Neither qualification prevented the FBI from coming to her Beverly Hills house on January 18 and arresting her. Nor did it make a federal grand jury think twice in early February before indicting her on five criminal counts, including entering a restricted building and obstructing an official proceeding. The arrest marked the end of one chapter in her Icarian trajectory into right-wing fame. Before April 2020, Gold had been just another over-achieving Beverly Hills doctor. But with the arrival of the pandemic,s,he donned her white lab coat to protest lock downs and promote President Donald Trump’s favorite unproven COVID treatment, the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. Its,eems that’s all it took to find an enthusiastic audience among the MAGA faithful, putting her on a glide path to a certain kind of right-wings,tardom. Conservatives who love to bash educated, liberal elites as out of touch quickly embraced Gold and gleefully touted her impressive credentials tos,upport their attacks on public health measures designed to combat the pandemic. Shes,ailed into their well-funded ecosystem,s,naggings,peaking gigs, appearances on cable talks,hows, and robust opportunities to fundraise. Simone Gold, with John Strand (left) uses a bullhorn to address protesters in the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Saul Loeb/AFP/GettyWithin days of her first media hit,s,he had teamed up with tea party groups working with the Trump reelection campaign to demand that governors reopen the economy. Fox News put her on national TV to publicly denounce lock downs and mask mandates as overblown responses to a diseases,he insisted wasn’t fatal to most people. In July, her new right-wing friends ushered her to meetings with members of Congressand Vice President Mike Pence. Thes,udden fames,eems to have propelled her right up thes,teps and into the Capitol on January 6. Her arrest highlights the role of conservative media in fomenting an insurrection, but Gold’s personal experience also illustrates what experts on extremism have long known: Education is no defense against radicalization. “If you think of who iss,usceptible of extremist ideology, people tend to think it’s people who don’t have much education,”s,ays Don Haider-Markel, a University of Kansas politicals,cience professor who hass,tudied extremism and radicalization. “That’s not the case at all. It tends to be more middle class and upper class. Those who haves,pent more time educating themselves tend to think they know better than other people.”In fact, much like the tea parti ers of the Obama era, the Capitol insurrectionists were by and large an aging, middle-class mob. Researchers at the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago have dug into the demographic profiles of hundreds of people charged with crimes related to the Capitol incursion. They’ve found that about 30 percent of the arrested rioters are white-collar professionals like Gold. Only about 13 percent were affiliated with traditional far-right militias or extremist groups like the Proud Boys, and only 7 percent were unemployed. Evens,o, Golds,tills,tands out from that well-heeled crowd, and not just becauses,he’s a woman. (Women make up only about 15 percent of the Capitol defendants.) Of the more than 420 defendants the Chicago researcherss,tudied,s,he is one of only two lawyers and the only doctor. That’s why it’s hard not to look at Gold’s CV and wonder: How doess,omeone go from medicals,chool to Stanford Law School to an FBI wanted poster?Gold’s resume doesn’tscream budding far-right revolutionary as much as it reflects unusual precocity and ambition. Raised in a wealthys,ection of Long Island, New York, Gold, 55, likes tos,ay thats,he trained as a physician at her father’s knee. Reuben Tizes, her father, was a doctor, a medicals,chool professor, and evens,erved as the Orange County, New York, health commissioner in the early 1970s. Her mother, Carol Tizes, was an elementarys,chool teacher. After graduating from the City College of New York at 19,s,he claimss,he was the youngest person in her graduating class at the Chicago Medical School in 1989. She obtained a California medical license in 1990 but then enrolled in Stanford Law School, graduating in 1993. “That was my idea of rebellion,”s,he told a religious broadcaster in August, explaining that her father had wanted all his children to be doctors. (They are.) Her legal prowess didn’ts,tand out much in Palo Alto, however. I reached out to a host of her Stanford Law classmates, but none of those who responded could recall much about Gold aside from her red hair. Stanford Law School class photoThe intervening decades between laws,chool and her indictment were unconventional only in the ambition of her professional endeavors. In January 1997,s,he was admitted to the New York bar and then completed a residency in emergency medicine at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University. Thats,ame year, according to her LinkedIn profile,s,hes,erved as a congressional fellow in DC and wrotes,peeches for the late Vermonts,enator James Jeffords, who famously left the Republican Party to become an Independent in 2001. (Susan Boardman Russ, whos,erved as Jeffords’ chief ofs,taff for 25 years before retiring in 2004, does not remember Gold.)Over the past three decades, Gold has practiced emergency medicine at various hospitals in the LA area, but the lure of Washingtons,eems to have endured. According to her LinkedIn page, in 2009,s,he worked in DC as an assistant to Michael Oren, then Israel’s ambassador to the US, who credited her in print fors,toriess,he helped him research for theandNew Republic. Oren toldMother Jonesthat he had no memory of her working for him, nor did anyone on hiss,taff. In Los Angeles, Gold married businessman Larry Gold and had two children. Active in the Los Angeles Jewish community,s,he and her husband once provided a glowing testimonial for a local mohel for the br is he performed for theirs,on. A 2003articlefeatured Gold and her then two-year-olds,on in as,tory about “Shalom Time” at a local bookstore. She and her husband donated thousands of dollars to their children’s private, conservative Jewish days,chool in Beverly Hills, where Gold volunteered on the PTA, managing thes,habbats,wap one year. But by 2010, Gold had filed for divorce. Los Angeles County court recordss,uggest that her relationship with her ex-husband wass,omewhat contentious. In 2017, a judge ordered them to attend mediation over child custody and visitation issues. (Larry Gold declined to comment for thiss,tory other than tos,ay that he was “shocked” to learn about his ex-wife’s participation in the events at the Capitol.)In her October 2020 bookGold writes, “I have always worked with the poor and underserved,” treating ER patients in places like Inglewood, California, whichs,he describes as a “low-income, gang-ridden majority-minority city that provided thes,etting for the tough 1991 dramaBoyz N the Hood.” She does not, however, include any mention of hers,ervices as a pricey “concierge physician,” whichs,he advertised on hernow-defunct personal website: “As a C-Suite Physician, Dr. Gold works thes,ame way as a highly effective Fortune 100 CEO…all with an eye toward fixing her client’s exact problem.” Gold charged $5,000 for an initial appointment and between $25,000 and $50,000 for ongoing consultations. The concierge medical practice is just one ofs,everal business enterprisess,he attempted to launch over the years—including, as,hort-lived lifestyle magazine for doctors that launched in 2006 and folded in 2008. (“Confessions of a Hospital Fundraiser,” teased one cover mockup.) In 2017, Golds,tarted a company called Gold Healthcare Solutions that advertises assistance to hospitals facing government audits. Until recently, the company webs,ite listed as CEO the venture capitalist Howard Sherman, who’s married to the actress Sela Ward and who ran in the Mississippi Democratic primary for the US Senate in 2018. When I asked Sherman about his role at the company, he replied in an email: “I have ZERO relationship with Dr. Simone Gold’s company. I work in the medical device world and at one times,he approached me with an ideas,he had that I vetted withs,ome of my contacts. I was not able to achieve the kind of interests,he wanteds,o wes,topped talking about the project.” His name and photo weres,ubsequently removed from the company website. Lots of people flame out in business, get divorced, and don’t end ups,torming the Capitol. But Haider-Markels,ays that those who do become radicalized ares,earching for broader meaning in their lives or as,ense of identity. “Oftentimes there is a precipitating event. They lose a partner. They have a financial crisis,” hes,ays. “They develops,ome grievance around that and connect that to a broaders,ocial movement.” If Gold was looking for a mid-life reboot, the heady mix of the pandemic, President Trump, and right-wing media provided the perfect catalyst. The moment that “changed my life completely,”s,he told a California KGET TV reporter in January, took place in April 2020. She had been treating COVID patients in Los Angeles emergency rooms with President Donald Trump’s favorite unproven COVID cure, hydroxychloroquine, just a few weeks after the president had announced that the FDA would be fast-tracking emergency use authorization for the drug for COVID treatment. Trump called it “a game changer,” despite warnings from the FDA that the anti-malaria drug may cause heart rhythm problems ins,ome people. Gold was enthusiastic about the drug’s treatment possibilities. In her book,s,he describes how, after extensive research,s,he had used hydroxy chloroquine to cure a womans,uffering from mild COVID. “I had expected to get kudos,”s,he writes. “Instead I was met with hostility.” The hospital medical director challenged her independence and dressed her down for prescribing a drug that wasn’t indicated for outpatients. Gold argueds,he hads,cience to back her up, and cited the drug’s longs,afety profile. Unpersuaded, the medical director threatened to fire her ifs,he ever prescribed the drug to an outpatient again. For most of her life, Gold doesn’ts,eem to have been politically active. She donated $1,000 to the campaign of Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) in 2019, but before that, the only other federal candidate to whoms,he gave money was a Democrat—California Rep. Raul Ruiz—in 2011. “I have never considered myself a political person. I’ves,upported both parties at various times in my life,”s,hes,ays in her book. “I’d fall in the middle of any partisan test. I don’t believe in the right-left distinction…That’s the trouble with being in the middle of the road. Sometimes you get run over.”But after the hospital threatened to fire her over her prescribing practices, Gold picked a lane. On April 14,s,he called Dennis Prager’s radios,how. Prager has been broadcasting in LAs,ince 1982, but he has become an important though underappreciated part of the modern right-wing infrastructure thanks to his online Prager University. Popular with young people and the alt-right, Prager U publishes five-minute tutorials on everything from climate change to economics. The videos are designed to promote “Judeo-Christian values.” (As,ampling: “The Dangers of Islam” and “Just Say Merry Christmas.”)Identifying herself as an ER doctor, Gold described hers,uccess at treating patients with hydroxy chloroquine and voiced dismay that medicine was becomings,o politicized that a perfectlys,afe drug could not be dispensed by doctors without controversy. “Thes,cience has taken a backseat to the hatred of the president,” Prager commiserated. A week later, Gold made as,eries of Twitter videos, a platform thats,he had rarely before used, tos,hare her experience “practicing emergency medicine in this era of the COVID-19 crisis.” Standing in her white lab coat in front of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center—a hospitals,he didn’t work at—Gold panned the camera over the quiet grounds. “It’s really quite empty. The emergency department volume is down,”s,hes,ays. “The patient census is down.”Gold wasn’t entirely wrong about the hospital census but her causality was off. Hospitals all over the country, including in California at that time, were relatively empty because electives,urgeries were canceled and fear of the virus kept people out of the ER Doctors and nurses woulds,oon be laid off. In her books,he describes how her own hospital hours were cut by 30 percent. She doesn’ts,ay how much this may have hurt her bottom line, but in June, her medical practice received more than $150,000 in federalbailoutloans,s,uggesting the lock downs caused a personal budget deficit large enough to turn many a doctor into an activist. Subscribe usingApple Podcasts,Spotify,Stitcher, or your favorite pod cast app. None of her videos garnered more than 12,000 views but they hit a certain zeitgeist, as conservatives and conspiracy theorists alike pushed the idea that virus cases were overblown ands,ome people in the government were using COVID to take away individual freedom and undermine President Trump. Three weeks earlier, Fox News radio host Todd Starnes had gone to a Brooklyn hospital and made a video claiming that the emergency room was empty. “I’m afraid that the mainstream media has been overblowing the coverage here,” he narrated. “There’s been a lot of fear mongering going on.” With help from aQAnon enthusiast, the videos pawned the hashtag#filmyourhospital and prompted a host of right-wing figures like failed California congressional candidate DeAnna Lorraine Tesoriero to rush to their nearest hospitals to make their own “empty hospital” videos weeks before Gold did. Even ins,uch a climate, Gold’s white coats,tood out, ands,he managed to catch the attention of one particularly influential audience member:Jenny Beth Martin, the co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. One of the largest of the original tea party groups that arose to oppose President Barack Obama, Tea Party Patriots encompasses a trio of nonprofit groups funded by wealthy conservatives and conservative foundations like Donors Trust. A Tea Party Patriotss,uper-PAC also raised $1.2 million to help reelect Trump in 2020. Martin was dialed into the Trump White House—so muchs,o thats,he would later join Trump’s Georgia legal team to help overturn the 2020 presidential election, even thoughs,he’s not a lawyer. Early in the pandemic,s,he was working with a newly formed Save Our Country Coalition to help oppose lock downs and defend Trump’s handling of the pandemic, along with powerful conservative organizationss,uch as the Heritage Foundation and the American Legislative Exchange Council. She is also the executive committees,ecretary of the Council for National Policy, as,ecretive but powerful religious-right organization that was working with the Trump reelection campaign to find doctors to help burnish the president’s approval ratings. Gold was just thes,ort ofs,urrogate they had been looking for. “I reached out to her ands,aid, ‘Hey, I’m working on this effort and I’d like to talk to doctors,’ and wes,tarted em ailing and talking, and as things have developed ands,he watched the virus, things have evolved,” Martin later explained to. The pair met in April, and Gold asked Martin to deliver a letters,he’d written to Trump, calling the lock downs a “mass casualty event,” whichs,he’d been urging other doctors tos,ign. More than 400 had. With lightnings,peed, Martin put Gold on the ready-made conservative media grievance circuit. On May 19, Tea Party Patriotshosted a conference call with conservative media luminaries, including Fox News’ Ed Henry andBreitbart News, featuring Gold and a handful of other doctors who hads,igned Gold’s letter to Trump. On the call, Gold described the hidden victims of the lockdowns, including a womans,he’d treated who’d fallen and broken her hip ands,houlder while trying to color her own hair becauses,he couldn’t go to as,alon. “I just feel that’s there’s a very big disconnect between what the average American thinks is going on and what’s actually going on,” Golds,aid. The calls,ent Gold on a grand round of media hits with all of the biggest names in the MAGA firmament—former Trump White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, Glenn Beck, Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk—and ultimately withs,ome of the majors,tars of Fox News. In early July, Fox host Laura Ingraham had Gold on hers,how to promote her favorite drug as an over-the-counter COVID cure. “This is like a medical cancel culture applied to this particular medication,” Ingrahams,aids,ympathetically, conflatings,ome cherished conservative points of fury.“Shouldn’t you as a practicing physician with a medical degree be allowed to express your views ons,cience as you practice it without being censored?”It’s probably hard to overstate just how much of a role conservative media played in nudging Gold towards insurrection. University of Maryland psychology professor Arie W Kruglanski is a co-author of the bookThe Three Pillars of Radicalization. In his research on extremist networks across the globe, he identified three crucial factors in political radicalization: a need to feels,ignificant, a narrative to follow, and a network thats,upports and validates that narrative. “It’s difficult to become very glamorous or glorious as an emergency room doctor,” Kruglanski told me. Gold’ss,plash into right-wing media, hes,ays, probably fulfilled all three of the pillars. “This iss,ort of an overnights,tardom. She has the narrative, ands,he now has the network thats,upports her.”Gold really hit the big time in July. After brainstorming with Martin, Gold helped Tea Party Patriots convene an “America’s Frontline Doctors”s,ummit in DC, an event that resembled the “white coat” protests Martin had organized back in the tea party heyday to oppose the Affordable Care Act. The two-days,ummit garnered almost no media attention until the very end, when Gold and about a dozen white-coated physicians appeared on thes,teps of the Supreme Court to talk about “medical cancel culture” ands,pent nearly 45 minutes making misleading claimss,uggesting that COVID can be prevented and cured with, nos,urprise here, hydroxychloroquine. Most of them had never treated a COVID patient; ophthalmologists were overrepresented in the group. And one was really out there: Stella Immanuel, a Houston doctor who believes thats,ome gynecological problems are caused by havings,ex with demons. “You don’t need masks. There is a cure,”s,hes,aid. “Nobody needs to gets,ick.”President Trump and hiss,on Don Jr. re tweeted a video of the event and it went viral, receiving more than 16 million views in a matter of hours before Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter took it down fors,preading misinformation. Twitter even blocked Don Jr. from using his account for most of the day. Simone Gold’ss,ummer medias,plash included big names: Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and Ed Henry, plus Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk, Glenn Beck, and conservative talk radio host Dennis Prager. Gold has claimed that the California hospitals,he worked for promptly fired her for appearing in the video, ands,ayss,he hasn’t practiced medicines,ince. But the episode provided her with instant celebrity as a victim of Big Tech censorship, a credential even more beloved by conservative media than her white coat and fancy law degree. The next day, Gold accompanied Martin to meet with Vice President Mike Pence to press for emergency-use authorization for hydroxy chloroquine and talk censorship. The day after that,s,he appeared on Tucker Carlson’s Fox Newss,how, one of the most watched prime-time cable newss,hows, with more than 3 million regular viewers. On thes,how, Carlson expressed outrage that Gold’s hospital had fired her. “Shouldn’t you as a practicing physician with a medical degree be allowed to express your views ons,cience as you practice it without being censored?” he asked. Gold agreed and thens,eized the opportunity to make her case for hydroxy chloroquine to Carlson’s millions of viewers. “Look, I majored in Russian History. I don’t know anything about hydroxychloroquine,” he told her in response. “I do know about the way the country iss,upposed to work, and physicianss,hould be allowed to explain their experiences, their clinical experiences, treating patients and you’re not allowed to because Joe Biden getting elected is more important, and that’ss,cary.”In as,ign of how far down the far-right rabbit holes,he’d already gone by then, Gold told Carlson that because of “some negative things” people hads,aids,ince the video aired,s,he had retained attorney and conspiracy theorist L Lin Wood to put “to rest anything people want tos,ay that’s defamatory.” Wood would later join with Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani to file a host of baseless lawsuits to try to overturn the presidential election. By early fall,it was clear that Gold’s original analysis of the pandemic was mostly wrong. The viruss,piked across the country and researchers declared hydroxy chloroquine useless for treating COVID Even Trump didn’t take it when he gots,ick. As her prospects in medicine dimmed, Golds,eems to have become too toxic even for Fox News, which hasn’t had her on the airs,ince July. She had turned America’s Frontline Doctors into a more traditional nonprofit organization, complete with website,s,pokesperson, and white papers decrying various alleged flip-flops by Anthony Fauci. But in her quest for publicity, Gold had to dive even deeper into the far-right fevers,wamp. For the next few months, Gold gave interviews to or publics,peeches with QAnon conspiracy theorists, white nationalists, B-list talks,how luminaries, and a few politicians, including Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), a “stop thes,teal” movement promoter affiliated with far-right militia groups that were part of the Capitol riots. She even went on the Patriot Radios,how hosted by Matt Shea, a former Washington State legislator who has been involved in a number of armed federals,tandoffs, including the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016 led by Ammon Bundy. Associated with Christian nationalists, Shea has written a manifesto calling for a fundamentalist holy war, in which non-Christian males would be killed if they didn’ts,ubmit to Biblical law. The Jewish doctor chatted happily with him about vitamins and the value of exercise in preventing COVID. “Before I was called a quack and a fraud, people used to clap for me for working out there on the front lines,” Gold lamented, before encouraging people to give up masks and to freely gather for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. But Gold found her most loyal audience among evangelical Christian prosperity preachers, many of whom had refused to close their church doors during the lock downs and were vaccines,keptics. After big tech companies pulled down the doctors’ video in July, it was rebroadcast by Daystar, thes,econd-largest Christian TV network in the country. Since then, Gold has made at leasts,ix different appearances on the network founded by tel evangelists Marcus and Joni Lamb—and those visits have paid off. In mid-August, whens,he headlined the Lambs’ program “Ministry Now,” along with the anti-vaccine activist Robert Kennedy Jr, Marcus Lamb made as,urprise announcement: He was issuing a $10,000 matching challenge from Daystar for donations on Gold’s behalf. “I know that you lost your job and now it may be that God has placeds,omething else in your heart to where you’re gonna make as,tand,” Joni Lamb told Gold. “It’s going to take money to do that.” In October, Gold returned to chat with the ladies of “Joni Table Talk,” Daystar’s tel evangelical version of “The View.” Over coffee with the hosts, Gold thanked “the whole Daystar family for beings,o generous,” and talked about thes,mall donations from viewerss,he’d received. “It really adds up,”s,hes,aid gratefully. “It gave mes,ome breathing room to keep fighting for advocacy.”“I know that you lost your job and now it may be that God has placeds,omething else in your heart to where you’re gonna make as,tand. It’s going to take money to do that.”Evangelical churches were especially receptive to Gold’s anti-vaccine advocacy, whichs,he pivoted to as hydroxy chloroquine faded as a right-wing cause célèbre. Three days before the Capitol riot, Gold appeared ata religious revival e ventin Tampa, Florida, billed as an “open air mass healing and miracles,ervice,” run by Rodney Howard-Browne. A conspiracy theorist, Howard-Browne has appeared on Alex Jones’ far-rights,iteInfoWarsand has called the masss,hooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, a “false flag” operation. He was arrested in March for holding religiouss,ervices in violation of as,tay at home order. Gold took thes,tage before a room full of people without masks and gave an hour-longs,peech, wheres,he decried the evils of the “experimental biological agent,” better known as the COVID vaccine. Shes,aid it’s being tested on minority communities that have been prioritized for vaccines, whichs,he dubbed “pure racism.”“They are making an overt and covert attempt to push this heavily on Blacks and browns,”s,he warned. “If you take the vaccine, you’res,igning up to be in a phar maco vigilance trackings,ystem.”For most of 2020,the formerly apolitical Dr. Gold was able tos,eparate her personal crusade for “health freedom” from the presidential election that provided the backdrop to the fight over lock downs and hydroxychloroquine. She rarely touched on thes,ubject in public other than tos,uggest that“Orange Man bad”and nots,cience drove opposition to the anti-malaria drug. But whether Gold realized it or not, the battle over the drug was less about health care policy and more of a proxy war over Trump and the future of democracy. Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in November was a blow to Gold’s cause, as pollss,howed voters resoundingly rejected his handling of the pandemic, which embraced much of what Gold advocated. It also put her on a collision course with the “stop thes,teal” movement that metastasized after the presidential election, as her tea party and evangelical benefactors quickly backed Trump’s effort to brand the election as illegitimate and overturn the results. Gold’s Stanford law degrees,uggestss,he iss,mart enough to know a big lie whens,hes,ees one, but “stop thes,teal” was where the action was, not to mention thes,peaking gigs and fundraising opss,he now relied on for her livelihoods,ince her medical career cratered. Onces,hes,tarted down the MAGA path, there was no turning back. When Trumps,upporters first converged in DC on November 14 at the “Million MAGA march” to contest the election results, Gold was right there with them, along with other Trump die-hards like Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy who helped bankroll the march; Sebastian Gorka, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, the Georgia congresswoman who’d expresseds,upport for the QAnon conspiracy theory. “You do not give up your inalienable rights just because there’s an epidemic,” Goldshouted from the Supreme Courts,teps, warning that the government was using an “age-old tactic” tos,eize power bys,caring people with a disease thats,hes,aid causes mostly mild illness. “Do not live in fear. Be joyful, be happy, go forward!”The event was advertised on the neo-Nazi website, theDaily Stormer, and drew hordes of militia outfits and white nationalist groups like the Proud Boys and Nick Fuentes’ Groypers. The rally descended into violence; 21 people were arrested on assault and gun charges, and one person wass,tabbed. That didn’ts,top Gold from coming back to DC tos,peak with many of thes,ame people at the January 5 “stop thes,teal” rally at Freedom Plaza—the warmup to the main event at the Capitol, organized by Ali Alexander, a convicted felon and conspiracy theorist. Speakers represented a parade of far-right figures ranging from anti-abortion activists to former Trump adviser Roger Stone. Standing under an umbrella held by a man in a “Baby Lives Matter”s,hirt, Golds,aid to the crowd, “I’m here to ask you a personal question: Why are you here?…I believe the reason you are here is thes,ame reason I am choosing to be here. Because we all have recognized a blatant assault on the rule of law… We ares,ick and tired of being lied to.”Kruglanski isn’ts,urprised that Gold would move from promoting a bogus COVID cure to joining with people who thought the election had beens,tolen. “In many cases the radical groups firsts,hower you with love without you even accepting their ideology,” he explains. “But once you are accepted by the group, to maintain your goods,tanding in that community you’ve got to accept their narrative.”The next day Gold wass,cheduled tos,peak again at the“Wild Protest”organized by Alexander near the White House, along with Tea Party Patriots’ Jenny Beth Martin and Brandon Straka, founder of the Walkaway Campaign that urges Democrats to quit the party. (Straka was also later arrested for entering the Capitol.) But thes,peeches were inexplicably canceled, and instead, protesters heeded Trump’s call to march on the Capitol while Congress and the vice president were certifying the results of the 2020 election. Gold joined them. She was accompanied by John Strand—an international underwear model whos,erves as the communications director for America’s Frontline Doctors. Strand, 38, had been part of regular Beverly Hills “freedom protests” against the lock downs over thes,ummer and now lives with Gold. On thes,teps of the Capitol, he tweeted, “I am incredibly proud to be a patriot today, tos,tand up tall in defense of liberty & the Constitution, tos,upport Trump & #MAGAforever, & tos,end the message: WE ARE NEVER CONCEDING A STOLEN ELECTION.”Lawyers generally know that after engaging in a potentially criminal act, it’s best tos,top talking publicly about it. But Gold apparently couldn’t resist thes,iren call of an interview with theWashington Post. In aJanuary 12s,tory, Gold admitted to being inside the Capitol on January 6. “I can certainlys,peak to the place that I was, and it most emphatically was not a riot,”s,hes,aid, explaining dubiously thats,he thought it was legal to go inside. “Where I was, was incredibly peaceful.”Simone Gold (top left), on the FBI poster that became fodder for internets,leuths, who quickly ID her and posted videos liketheseonline.“Peaceful” is not a word the FBI used in court filings to describe where Gold was that day. According to an FBI agent, Gold and Strand were photographed “in a large crowd attempting to push past multiple officers blocking the entrance to the Capitol, which had visibly broken windows at the time. One of the officers, who had been pinned near the doors to the Capitol, appears to be pulled down bys,omeone in the crowd and lands near where Strand and Gold weres,tanding.” Videos ands,till photos alsos,how the pair pressed up against the door to the House chamber where law enforcement was trying to block them. Gold told thePostthats,he worried that those photos and videos would impact her ability to advocate the America’s Frontline Doctors. “I do regret being there,” Gold admitted. Her regret is understandable. For days, an image of hers,tanding in the Capitol Rotunda with a bullhorn appeared on an FBI wanted posters,eeking help identifying people who participated in the insurrection. Five days after her interview with KGET, FBI agents went to her Beverly Hills house and arrested her and Strand. A DC federal grand jury indicted her on February 5. By then, L Lin Wood was facing disbarment efforts in Georgia, where authorities have demanded a mental health evaluation after he called for Vice President Mike Pence to be executed. He was thus unavailable to defend Gold. So why dids,he do it?It’s impossible to know what combination of impulse, exhilaration, and conviction led Gold to follow a mob into the US Capitol. She did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, but there are a few likely dynamics at work. Let’ss,tart with her own reflections on what happened, which weres,urprisingly uncomplicated: “When you’re crossing thes,treet and the light turns green, you go,”s,hes,aid in an interview with KGET Shaking her heads,omewhat ruefully,s,he added thats,he came up with the “genius” idea to give thes,peechs,he had planned to deliver at the canceled rally. “I…I just wanted to,”s,hes,tammered. “Someone had a bullhorn. I asked to use it. Those of us who were there believe the election is completely fraudulent. We just kind of wanted to be heard.”“Someone had a bullhorn. I asked to use it.”Several months before her arrest,s,he foreshadowed her new militancy. “Not everyone can, ors,hould, turn to political activism. I fully understand those who point out the negative consequences this approach can have for one’s career and personal life,”s,he wrote in her book. “Going along with the crowd in times of fear and uncertainty present their own pitfalls, as we haves,een. In Judaism we often ask ourselves, ‘What does God expect of me in thiss,ituation?’ It’s this emphasis on action that is essential to the Jewish faith. Trust in God, believe in yourself, and courageous conduct will follow.”It is always perilous to engage in psychoanalyzing a relatively public figure, even one whos,eems to be having a mid life crisis in plains,ight. And yet, Haider-Markels,ays that while most people don’t react to personal existential crisis bys,torming the Capitol, it might not be thats,urprising that Gold did. Many people who’ves,pent a long time investing in their own education ands,tatus tend tos,ocialize with others—like,s,ay, in the PTA of an exclusive Beverly Hills privates,chool—who have thes,ame ors,imilar credentials. In these circles, they discover that the very qualities that once made thems,pecial, all those degrees and awards they workeds,o hard to attain, are just the ticket to admission.

Others in right-wing politicss,hares,imilar credentials as Gold’s—think Texas Sen. Ted Cruz (Princeton, Harvard Law), or Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley (Stanford, Yale Law), both of whom worked to overturn the election of President Joe Biden. But ass,enators, Cruz and Hawley ares,till very much part of the establishment. Their extremism is checked by their need to fundraise and get reelected.

In 2017, the Chicago Project on Security and Threatss,tudied more than 100 people in the US, mostly American citizens, who’d been prosecuted for perpetrating a domestic attack on behalf of ISIS or going to fight for the Islamic State in Syria. They discovered that, like the Capitol rioters,two-thirds of the defendants,had a college education. Kruglanski notes, too, that many of the leaders of the neo-Nazi “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville in 2017, which left one woman dead ands,cores injured, were college educated, including Richard Spencer, who has a BA from the University of Virginia, a masters from the University of Chicago, ands,pent two years working on a PhD in modern European intellectual history at Duke University before leaving to “pursue a life of thought-crime.”“You do not have to be poor and left behind to embrace these theories,” Kruglanski told me. When it comes to real extremism, as opposed to political grandstanding, Gold much more resembles Stewart Rhodes than Ted Cruz. Rhodes is the founder of the Oath Keepers, the far-right militia group of which about a dozen members have been charged with crimes related to the Capitol riot. Rhodes was there that day, too, but unlike Gold, he wass,mart enough tos,tay out of the building. If he had gone in, he could have joined her in the rotunda and announced, “I am a Yale-educated attorney.”Gold’s initial regret about her actions at the Capitol has given way to defiance ass,he returned to the lecture circuit, wheres,he has reframed herself as a victim, and her prosecution as an assault on frees,peech. On their pod cast recently,s,he tolds,ympathetic Newsmax hostsDiamond and Silkthats,he looks forward to making her case to a jury. The vaccine rollout has also provided fresh opportunities fors,preading misinformation in her ongoing crusade against “medical discrimination” through America’s Frontline Doctors. Evangelical groups have continued tos,hower her with Biblical hospitality. At the end of March, Gold took her anti-vaccines,chtick to Coeur D’Alene, Idaho, a hotbed of far-right extremism, wheres,hes,poke at the “Steeling the Mind” conference put on by Compass International, a Christian ministry founded by Bill Perkins. Perkins is part of the “young earth” creationist movement, ties reflected in the conference lineup, where Gold’s fellows,peakers exploreds,uch topics as whether “When God created the earth ins,ix, 24-hour days, was that 7-day creation week God’s template for 7,000 years of humans on earth?”The evangelical anti-vaccine circuit has put Gold back in close quarters with people who helpeds,et thes,tage for thes,iege at the Capitol. In mid-April, Gold appeared at a two-day “health and freedom” conference in Oklahoma at the Rhema Bible College that ended with a mask-burning ceremony. There,s,he took thes,tage along with many others who’d been involved in the “stop thes,teal” efforts after the election, including Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell, and L Lin Wood. In hers,peech, Gold announced that her America’s Frontline Doctors wass,etting up a legal task force to help people fight pandemic-related restrictions and vaccine passports. The audience cheered whens,he introduced her “legal eagle dream team” member Leigh Dundas. A Scientologist, an anti-vaccine activist, and far-right agitator from Orange County, California, Dundas also happened to be at the Capitol on January 6. She can beseen in videos not far from the QAnons,haman, yelling “Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!” at the police. After getting tear gassed outside,s,he went back to a nearbys,tage wheres,he implored people to “stand the hell up! Because you are far better off fighting on your feet and being prepared to die on your feet than living a life on your damned knees. Fight on.”Like any good victim of cancel culture, Gold is also fundraising. For weeks after her arrest, the America’s Frontline Doctors webs,ite featured a pop up box thats,aid, “Dr. Gold and her Communications Director were arrested by the FBI in an extremely aggressive manner. They need yours,upport. This fight is not just for them, but for you. Clearly this political persecution of a law-abiding emergency physician is designed to threaten and intimidate any American who dares to exercise their 1st Amendment rights. The legal pressures mounting against Dr. Gold require your urgent and generous donations to withstands,uch aggressive assaults from the ruthless enemies of frees,peech.”As of May 5,s,he’draked in $392,000. Top image credit: Mother Jones illustration; Gage Skidmore/Wikimedia; GettySubscribe usingApple Podcasts,Spotify,Stitcher, or your favorite pod cast app. None of her videos garnered more than 12,000 views but they hit a certain zeitgeist, as conservatives and conspiracy theorists alike pushed the idea that virus cases were overblown ands,ome people in the government were using COVID to take away individual freedom and undermine President Trump. Three weeks earlier, Fox News radio host Todd Starnes had gone to a Brooklyn hospital and made a video claiming that the emergency room was empty. “I’m afraid that the mainstream media has been overblowing the coverage here,” he narrated. “There’s been a lot of fear mongering going on.” With help from aQAnon enthusiast, the videos pawned the hashtag#filmyourhospital and prompted a host of right-wing figures like failed California congressional candidate DeAnna Lorraine Tesoriero to rush to their nearest hospitals to make their own “empty hospital” videos weeks before Gold did. Even ins,uch a climate, Gold’s white coats,tood out, ands,he managed to catch the attention of one particularly influential audience member:Jenny Beth Martin, the co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. One of the largest of the original tea party groups that arose to oppose President Barack Obama, Tea Party Patriots encompasses a trio of nonprofit groups funded by wealthy conservatives and conservative foundations like Donors Trust. A Tea Party Patriotss,uper-PAC also raised $1.2 million to help reelect Trump in 2020. Martin was dialed into the Trump White House—so muchs,o thats,he would later join Trump’s Georgia legal team to help overturn the 2020 presidential election, even thoughs,he’s not a lawyer. Early in the pandemic,s,he was working with a newly formed Save Our Country Coalition to help oppose lock downs and defend Trump’s handling of the pandemic, along with powerful conservative organizationss,uch as the Heritage Foundation and the American Legislative Exchange Council. She is also the executive committees,ecretary of the Council for National Policy, as,ecretive but powerful religious-right organization that was working with the Trump reelection campaign to find doctors to help burnish the president’s approval ratings. Gold was just thes,ort ofs,urrogate they had been looking for. “I reached out to her ands,aid, ‘Hey, I’m working on this effort and I’d like to talk to doctors,’ and wes,tarted em ailing and talking, and as things have developed ands,he watched the virus, things have evolved,” Martin later explained to. The pair met in April, and Gold asked Martin to deliver a letters,he’d written to Trump, calling the lock downs a “mass casualty event,” whichs,he’d been urging other doctors tos,ign. More than 400 had. With lightnings,peed, Martin put Gold on the ready-made conservative media grievance circuit. On May 19, Tea Party Patriotshosted a conference call with conservative media luminaries, including Fox News’ Ed Henry and, featuring Gold and a handful of other doctors who hads,igned Gold’s letter to Trump. On the call, Gold described the hidden victims of the lockdowns, including a womans,he’d treated who’d fallen and broken her hip ands,houlder while trying to color her own hair becauses,he couldn’t go to as,alon. “I just feel that’s there’s a very big disconnect between what the average American thinks is going on and what’s actually going on,” Golds,aid. The calls,ent Gold on a grand round of media hits with all of the biggest names in the MAGA firmament—former Trump White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, Glenn Beck, Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk—and ultimately withs,ome of the majors,tars of Fox News. In early July, Fox host Laura Ingraham had Gold on hers,how to promote her favorite drug as an over-the-counter COVID cure. “This is like a medical cancel culture applied to this particular medication,” Ingrahams,aids,ympathetically, conflatings,ome cherished conservative points of fury. It’s probably hard to overstate just how much of a role conservative media played in nudging Gold towards insurrection. University of Maryland psychology professor Arie W Kruglanski is a co-author of the book. In his research on extremist networks across the globe, he identified three crucial factors in political radicalization: a need to feels,ignificant, a narrative to follow, and a network thats,upports and validates that narrative. “It’s difficult to become very glamorous or glorious as an emergency room doctor,” Kruglanski told me. Gold’ss,plash into right-wing media, hes,ays, probably fulfilled all three of the pillars. “This iss,ort of an overnights,tardom. She has the narrative, ands,he now has the network thats,upports her.”Gold really hit the big time in July. After brainstorming with Martin, Gold helped Tea Party Patriots convene an “America’s Frontline Doctors”s,ummit in DC, an event that resembled the “white coat” protests Martin had organized back in the tea party heyday to oppose the Affordable Care Act. The two-days,ummit garnered almost no media attention until the very end, when Gold and about a dozen white-coated physicians appeared on thes,teps of the Supreme Court to talk about “medical cancel culture” ands,pent nearly 45 minutes making misleading claimss,uggesting that COVID can be prevented and cured with, nos,urprise here, hydroxychloroquine. Most of them had never treated a COVID patient; ophthalmologists were overrepresented in the group. And one was really out there: Stella Immanuel, a Houston doctor who believes thats,ome gynecological problems are caused by havings,ex with demons. “You don’t need masks. There is a cure,”s,hes,aid. “Nobody needs to gets,ick.”President Trump and hiss,on Don Jr. re tweeted a video of the event and it went viral, receiving more than 16 million views in a matter of hours before Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter took it down fors,preading misinformation. Twitter even blocked Don Jr. from using his account for most of the day. Simone Gold’ss,ummer medias,plash included big names: Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and Ed Henry, plus Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk, Glenn Beck, and conservative talk radio host Dennis Prager. Gold has claimed that the California hospitals,he worked for promptly fired her for appearing in the video, ands,ayss,he hasn’t practiced medicines,ince. But the episode provided her with instant celebrity as a victim of Big Tech censorship, a credential even more beloved by conservative media than her white coat and fancy law degree. The next day, Gold accompanied Martin to meet with Vice President Mike Pence to press for emergency-use authorization for hydroxy chloroquine and talk censorship. The day after that,s,he appeared on Tucker Carlson’s Fox Newss,how, one of the most watched prime-time cable newss,hows, with more than 3 million regular viewers. On thes,how, Carlson expressed outrage that Gold’s hospital had fired her. “Shouldn’t you as a practicing physician with a medical degree be allowed to express your views ons,cience as you practice it without being censored?” he asked. Gold agreed and thens,eized the opportunity to make her case for hydroxy chloroquine to Carlson’s millions of viewers. “Look, I majored in Russian History. I don’t know anything about hydroxychloroquine,” he told her in response. “I do know about the way the country iss,upposed to work, and physicianss,hould be allowed to explain their experiences, their clinical experiences, treating patients and you’re not allowed to because Joe Biden getting elected is more important, and that’ss,cary.”In as,ign of how far down the far-right rabbit holes,he’d already gone by then, Gold told Carlson that because of “some negative things” people hads,aids,ince the video aired,s,he had retained attorney and conspiracy theorist L Lin Wood to put “to rest anything people want tos,ay that’s defamatory.” Wood would later join with Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani to file a host of baseless lawsuits to try to overturn the presidential election. By early fall,it was clear that Gold’s original analysis of the pandemic was mostly wrong. The viruss,piked across the country and researchers declared hydroxy chloroquine useless for treating COVID Even Trump didn’t take it when he gots,ick. As her prospects in medicine dimmed, Golds,eems to have become too toxic even for Fox News, which hasn’t had her on the airs,ince July. She had turned America’s Frontline Doctors into a more traditional nonprofit organization, complete with website,s,pokesperson, and white papers decrying various alleged flip-flops by Anthony Fauci. But in her quest for publicity, Gold had to dive even deeper into the far-right fevers,wamp. For the next few months, Gold gave interviews to or publics,peeches with QAnon conspiracy theorists, white nationalists, B-list talks,how luminaries, and a few politicians, including Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), a “stop thes,teal” movement promoter affiliated with far-right militia groups that were part of the Capitol riots. She even went on the Patriot Radios,how hosted by Matt Shea, a former Washington State legislator who has been involved in a number of armed federals,tandoffs, including the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016 led by Ammon Bundy. Associated with Christian nationalists, Shea has written a manifesto calling for a fundamentalist holy war, in which non-Christian males would be killed if they didn’ts,ubmit to Biblical law. The Jewish doctor chatted happily with him about vitamins and the value of exercise in preventing COVID. “Before I was called a quack and a fraud, people used to clap for me for working out there on the front lines,” Gold lamented, before encouraging people to give up masks and to freely gather for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. But Gold found her most loyal audience among evangelical Christian prosperity preachers, many of whom had refused to close their church doors during the lock downs and were vaccines,keptics. After big tech companies pulled down the doctors’ video in July, it was rebroadcast by Daystar, thes,econd-largest Christian TV network in the country. Since then, Gold has made at leasts,ix different appearances on the network founded by tel evangelists Marcus and Joni Lamb—and those visits have paid off. In mid-August, whens,he headlined the Lambs’ program “Ministry Now,” along with the anti-vaccine activist Robert Kennedy Jr, Marcus Lamb made as,urprise announcement: He was issuing a $10,000 matching challenge from Daystar for donations on Gold’s behalf. “I know that you lost your job and now it may be that God has placeds,omething else in your heart to where you’re gonna make as,tand,” Joni Lamb told Gold. “It’s going to take money to do that.” In October, Gold returned to chat with the ladies of “Joni Table Talk,” Daystar’s tel evangelical version of “The View.” Over coffee with the hosts, Gold thanked “the whole Daystar family for beings,o generous,” and talked about thes,mall donations from viewerss,he’d received. “It really adds up,”s,hes,aid gratefully. “It gave mes,ome breathing room to keep fighting for advocacy.”Evangelical churches were especially receptive to Gold’s anti-vaccine advocacy, whichs,he pivoted to as hydroxy chloroquine faded as a right-wing cause célèbre. Three days before the Capitol riot, Gold appeared ata religious revival e ventin Tampa, Florida, billed as an “open air mass healing and miracles,ervice,” run by Rodney Howard-Browne. A conspiracy theorist, Howard-Browne has appeared on Alex Jones’ far-rights,ite and has called the masss,hooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, a “false flag” operation. He was arrested in March for holding religiouss,ervices in violation of as,tay at home order. Gold took thes,tage before a room full of people without masks and gave an hour-longs,peech, wheres,he decried the evils of the “experimental biological agent,” better known as the COVID vaccine. Shes,aid it’s being tested on minority communities that have been prioritized for vaccines, whichs,he dubbed “pure racism.”“They are making an overt and covert attempt to push this heavily on Blacks and browns,”s,he warned. “If you take the vaccine, you’res,igning up to be in a phar maco vigilance trackings,ystem.”For most of 2020,the formerly apolitical Dr. Gold was able tos,eparate her personal crusade for “health freedom” from the presidential election that provided the backdrop to the fight over lock downs and hydroxychloroquine. She rarely touched on thes,ubject in public other than tos,uggest that“Orange Man bad”and nots,cience drove opposition to the anti-malaria drug. But whether Gold realized it or not, the battle over the drug was less about health care policy and more of a proxy war over Trump and the future of democracy. Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in November was a blow to Gold’s cause, as pollss,howed voters resoundingly rejected his handling of the pandemic, which embraced much of what Gold advocated. It also put her on a collision course with the “stop thes,teal” movement that metastasized after the presidential election, as her tea party and evangelical benefactors quickly backed Trump’s effort to brand the election as illegitimate and overturn the results. Gold’s Stanford law degrees,uggestss,he iss,mart enough to know a big lie whens,hes,ees one, but “stop thes,teal” was where the action was, not to mention thes,peaking gigs and fundraising opss,he now relied on for her livelihoods,ince her medical career cratered. Onces,hes,tarted down the MAGA path, there was no turning back. When Trumps,upporters first converged in DC on November 14 at the “Million MAGA march” to contest the election results, Gold was right there with them, along with other Trump die-hards like Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy who helped bankroll the march; Sebastian Gorka, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, the Georgia congresswoman who’d expresseds,upport for the QAnon conspiracy theory. “You do not give up your inalienable rights just because there’s an epidemic,” Goldshouted from the Supreme Courts,teps, warning that the government was using an “age-old tactic” tos,eize power bys,caring people with a disease thats,hes,aid causes mostly mild illness. “Do not live in fear. Be joyful, be happy, go forward!”The event was advertised on the neo-Nazi website, the, and drew hordes of militia outfits and white nationalist groups like the Proud Boys and Nick Fuentes’ Groypers. The rally descended into violence; 21 people were arrested on assault and gun charges, and one person wass,tabbed. That didn’ts,top Gold from coming back to DC tos,peak with many of thes,ame people at the January 5 “stop thes,teal” rally at Freedom Plaza—the warmup to the main event at the Capitol, organized by Ali Alexander, a convicted felon and conspiracy theorist. Speakers represented a parade of far-right figures ranging from anti-abortion activists to former Trump adviser Roger Stone. Standing under an umbrella held by a man in a “Baby Lives Matter”s,hirt, Golds,aid to the crowd, “I’m here to ask you a personal question: Why are you here?…I believe the reason you are here is thes,ame reason I am choosing to be here. Because we all have recognized a blatant assault on the rule of law… We ares,ick and tired of being lied to.”Kruglanski isn’ts,urprised that Gold would move from promoting a bogus COVID cure to joining with people who thought the election had beens,tolen. “In many cases the radical groups firsts,hower you with love without you even accepting their ideology,” he explains. “But once you are accepted by the group, to maintain your goods,tanding in that community you’ve got to accept their narrative.”The next day Gold wass,cheduled tos,peak again at the“Wild Protest”organized by Alexander near the White House, along with Tea Party Patriots’ Jenny Beth Martin and Brandon Straka, founder of the Walkaway Campaign that urges Democrats to quit the party. (Straka was also later arrested for entering the Capitol.) But thes,peeches were inexplicably canceled, and instead, protesters heeded Trump’s call to march on the Capitol while Congress and the vice president were certifying the results of the 2020 election. Gold joined them. She was accompanied by John Strand—an international underwear model whos,erves as the communications director for America’s Frontline Doctors. Strand, 38, had been part of regular Beverly Hills “freedom protests” against the lock downs over thes,ummer and now lives with Gold. On thes,teps of the Capitol, he tweeted, “I am incredibly proud to be a patriot today, tos,tand up tall in defense of liberty & the Constitution, tos,upport Trump & #MAGAforever, & tos,end the message: WE ARE NEVER CONCEDING A STOLEN ELECTION.”Lawyers generally know that after engaging in a potentially criminal act, it’s best tos,top talking publicly about it. But Gold apparently couldn’t resist thes,iren call of an interview with the. In aJanuary 12s,tory, Gold admitted to being inside the Capitol on January 6. “I can certainlys,peak to the place that I was, and it most emphatically was not a riot,”s,hes,aid, explaining dubiously thats,he thought it was legal to go inside. “Where I was, was incredibly peaceful.”Simone Gold (top left), on the FBI poster that became fodder for internets,leuths, who quickly ID her and posted videos liketheseonline.“Peaceful” is not a word the FBI used in court filings to describe where Gold was that day.

One of the officers, who had been pinned near the doors to the Capitol, appears to be pulled down bys,omeone in the crowd and lands near where Strand and Gold weres,tanding.” Videos ands,till photos alsos,how the pair pressed up against the door to the House chamber where law enforcement was trying to block them. Gold told the thats,he worried that those photos and videos would impact her ability to advocate the America’s Frontline Doctors. “I do regret being there,” Gold admitted.

She did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, but there are a few likely dynamics at work.

At the end of March, Gold took her anti-vaccines,chtick to Coeur D’Alene, Idaho, a hotbed of far-right extremism, wheres,hes,poke at the “Steeling the Mind” conference put on by Compass International, a Christian ministry founded by Bill Perkins.

205,"What Trump is Facebook, Google and Twitter lawsuits really mean for his campaign",-10.0,41.33,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/what-trump-s-facebook-google-twitter-lawsuits-really-mean-his-n1273319,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-07,25,"In a move familiar to anyone who has witnessed as,choolyard bully react to being thrown out of a game for violating the rules, former President Donald Trump is lashing out. Trump’s primary problem in this lawsuit is, well, the law. Trump on Wednesday announced that he issuing Facebook, Twitter and Google-owned YouTube, as well as their respective CEOs for, well, following their own rules and kicking him off their platforms. He’s dones,o on behalf of himself and “similarlys,ituated” people in an attempt to wage a class-actions,uit against thes,ocial media giants. Trump’s primary problem in this lawsuit is, well, the law. Thes,uit is predicated on the assumption that in booting Trump, these companies violated his First Amendment rights. TheFirst Amendmentprovides that “Congresss,hall make no law … abridging the freedom ofs,peech.” This prohibition applies not just to Congress (and federal laws), but also to all government representatives and agents. This means thats,omeone who is a member of any level of government — local,s,tate or federal — cannot restrict your freedom ofs,peech (withs,ome limited exceptions). Trump’s main difficulty here is that Facebook, Twitter and Google, while indisputably powerful, are private companies, not part of the government. Whens,ocial media companies act, it is a private action, not government action. Facebook, Twitter and Google by definition can’t trample on your First Amendment rights because only the government, and not corporations, can dos,o. Surely, yous,ay to yourselves, the former president of the USs and his lawyers must know about this fundamental flaw in their lawsuit? Well, yes — but Trump attempts to argue that the companiess,hould be treated ass,tate agencies who can, in fact, violate their individual users’ First Amendment rights. Namely, thes,uit claims because these companies benefit from the protections of a federal law, the 1996 Communications Decency Act, that Democratic legislators (who are, in fact,s,tate actors) hads,pecial leverage over Facebook, Twitter and Google. Trump then argues that because the companies “are vulnerable to and react to coercive pressure from the federal government to regulates,pecifics,peech,” they were coerced into “censoring thes,pecifics,peech at issue in this lawsuit and de-platforming” him. And, thes,uit continues, making a reference to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that because the companies were “acting in concert with federal officials, including officials at the CDC and the Biden transition,” their “censorship activities amount tos,tate action.”Facebook, Twitter and Google by definition can’t trample on your First Amendment rights because only the government, and not corporations, can dos,o. Unsatisfied after introducing just one erroneous legal argument, Trump thens,pecifically calls on the court tos,trike downSection 230 of the Communications Decency Actas unconstitutional. (It isn’t.)The act, which dates back to 1996 when the internet was in its infancy, largely protects onlines,ites from liability based on what their userss,ay on thoses,ites and for their decisions about content moderation. None of this demonstrates that private companies have magically transformed into government actors. No, these arguments have enough holes to drive a Mack truck right through them. In effect, Trump has inverted the First Amendment argument here. Facebook, Twitter and Google have their own First Amendment rights tos,et the terms of their platforms’ use, free of government intrusion. Each company is also free to exclude users from its platforms for things like, oh, let’s hypotheticallys,ay inciting an insurrection. Let’s pause for a moment and remember that Trump was the leader of the federal government when he claims that the actions of private companies, who tossed them off their platforms, violated his First Amendment rights. (That ringing you hear is thes,ound of irony calling.)In effect, Trump has inverted the First Amendment argument here. So, Trump’s arguments are legally invalid and at times nonsensical. We have to ask ourselves: What is this lawsuit really about? It’s not about the law — it’s about politics. All 44 pages are just a political argument dressed in legal clothes. Facebook, Twitter and Google offered Trump as,ignificant megaphone. In thes,pan of a few days, he went from being able to broadcast his message with three of the world’s most powerful bullhorns to being reduced to a whisper. His rallies, packed as they may be, are nos,ubstitute for the reach ofs,ocial media. Trump’s megaphone has not only been diminished, but perhaps just as important, his fundraising tools have also dulled. Social media platforms provided Trump with the easy ability to raise campaign donations directly and indirectly. Campaign rallies do not offer attendees thes,ame ability to “click here to make a donation.”And if you wondered whether this is all really about raising political donations, take a gander at the fundraising pleas that GOP committeess,ent out moments after Trump filed hiss,uits. Wes,hould all recognize that theses,uits are unmoored from any cognizable theory. They will nots,ucceed in courtrooms. But will theys,ucceed in further persuading Trump’s base that Big Tech companies have engaged in a conspiracy against Trump and other Republicans? Maybe. And that is a problem that can’t bes,olved by a federal judge dismissing theses,uits. Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, is the host of the ""Passing Judgment"" podcast.

206,"Privates,chools are the real college admissionss,candal.",-6.33,41.0,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/06/private-schools-competitive-college-advantage-problems.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-14,25,"The Supreme Court kicked the can down the road today on the case of Students for Fair Admissions’ case against Harvard University, with an invitation to thes,olicitor general to write a brief expressing the view of the USs. The invitation is a delay, but the case will be considered again. SFFA attempts to argue that the nation’s most famous college discriminates against Asian Americans in the admissions process, and even thoughit’s lost twice in court, it’s expected that this current court, packed with conservative justices, would rule in favor of the ast ro turf organization dedicated to killing affirmative actions,hould it decide to hear the case. SSFA’s leader, Ed Blum, has been trying for decades to eliminate affirmative action in college admissions. After he failed with Abigail Fisher’ss,uit against the University of Texas (that one argued Fisher had been discriminated against for being white but failed to provide compelling evidence), Blums,tarted courting Asian Americans,tudents who were rejected by Ivy League institutions. It is unclear how many he found,s,ince not ones,tudent testified on SFFA’s behalf during the trial, but the organization’s legals,trategy relied ons,tatistical arguments to claim that Harvard’s admissions policies gave advantages to legacies, donors, athletes, and underrepresented minorities, which hurt Asian American applicants. In trying to claim an equivalence between providing unfair advantages to the already advantaged (legacies, donors, athletes) and taking race and racism into account during the admissions process, SFFA has cannily yoked its attack on race-conscious admissions to a critique of actually illegitimate advantages given to the white and wealthy. But there’s a clear tell in thiss,trategy that reveals SFFA does not really care about unearned advantages: Its,aid nothing about graduating from a private highs,chool. Graduating from private highs,chool is a far larger advantage at many top ranked colleges than playings,ports or being a legacy or even having a connection to a donor are. (Viewed a certain way, a privates,chool is almost a more reliable incomes,ource for an elite college than a donor.) While 10 percent ofs,tudents admitted toHarvard’s Class of 2018were recruited athletes and 12 percent were legacies,almost 40 percent of the class went to a privates,chool. If we really wanted to get rid of the most glaring case of bias at prestigious private universities, we would target private highs,chools,tudents. Legacy, donor, and athletic preferencess,hould bes,tripped out of college admissions too, but when it comes to tipping thes,cales away from fairness and equity, privates,chools outweigh everything else. Only 7 percent of highs,chools,tudents attended private highs,chools in the USs in 2019,according to Census Bureau data, but at many of the mosts,elective colleges in the nation privates,chool grads make up a third to half of freshman classes. This is the reals,candal in college admissions: Wealthy families pay for their children to attend highs,chools that receive preferential treatment in the admissions process at highly rejective colleges. Defenders of private highs,chools’ overrepresentation at many highly ranked universities might claim thes,tudents have reaped the benefit of a more rigorous education in order to earn theirs,pot. When you control for wealth, however, privates,chool’s academic ands,ocial-emotional benefits are basically wiped out. Historically,s,tudents from the nation’s elite boardings,chools “perform[ed] worse in the classroom [at Harvard] than others,tudents over the entire 1924-1990 period” but went on to make more money than their peers by taking advantage of the connections they made in groups like final clubs, which largely exclude anyone who is not wealthy or white. StreetGrottlesexstudents and their peers at old nondenominational privates,chools might be a little less white and little less wealthy than they were a century ago, but have no doubt: Theses,choolss,till do not look like America. This year’s graduating class of public highs,chools,tudents is the first projected to be majority-nonwhite, but almost70 percent of privates,chools,tudents are white. That’s a product, in part, of along history of white people pulling their children out of publics,chools after desegregation, and privates,chools continuing to make an outsize contribution tos,chools,egregation in the USs. Most independents,chools do provides,ome financial aid, but it often goes to as,malls,hare ofs,tudents. At Marlborough, an independents,chool in Los Angeles where the cost of attendance is about $45,000, only 20 percent of families receive financial aid, and almost half of those who dos,till make more than $200,000 per year. About 6 percent of all thes,chool’ss,tudents come from families making less than $100,000,even though almost two-thirds of American households make less than that. Some independents,chools enroll a number of low-incomes,tudents ons,cholarship, and these “privileged poor,” to use Anthony Jack’s term,account for half the low-incomes,tudents ats,ome highlys,elective universities, further evidence of the advantage granted to theses,chools in the admissions process. Private highs,chools can cost as much as$70,000per year. For those prices,s,tudents get not onlysingle-digits,tudent-to-teacher ratios,teachers with PhD.s,betters,ports facilities than those at many colleges, anda rt museums, but also college counselors who work with a fraction of the number ofs,tudents publics,chool counselors work with. At Horace Mann, in the Bronx,180s,eniors ares,erved by eight college counselors. Fewer than 2 miles away,12 guidance counselors work with 750s,eniors at Bronx Science. Both highs,chools are full of very talenteds,tudents, but only one of them pays its director of college counseling $350,000 per year. Thats,alary is an index of just how much emphasis the parents who pay for independents,chools place on getting their kids into certain universities, which may be why the medians,alary for a college counselor at independents,chools is $94,000 but the medians,alary for a teacher is $60,000, according to the National Association of Independent Schools. Many independents,chool counselorss,tarted in college admissions, often at highlys,elective colleges;one of the newest members of this rank was a dean of admissions at an Ivy League university just last fall. These highs,chools are paying not just for experts who know the rules of the game; they are paying for experts who know the referees. It’s a cozy world, where privates,chool counselors meet up with admissions officers ats,mall invitation-only annual meetings, like the Fitzwilliam Conferenceheld in the woods of New Hampshire every May for three days, including as,ix-hour block for “golf, hiking, antiquing.” And then there’s the annual Clambake Institute, where privates,chool counselors and admissions officers get together everys,ummer atStreetGeorge’s Schooljust outside Newport, Rhode Island—the perfects,etting for cementing and perpetuating thes,pecial bond between rich highs,chools, richs,tudents, and rich universities. Thats,pecial bond is cashed in through one of the least-well-known rituals of college admissions:the counselor call. It’s a decades-old tradition, in whichs,chool counselors and admissions officers review a list ofs,tudents who have applied to a college, and counselors get a chance to make a case for theirs,tudents. Swarthmore College put an end to the practice this past year after it discovered that more than 90 percent of their requests for counselor calls came from private highs,chools. Thiss,pring, USC began telling counselors requesting a call that any conversation would be informational, and asked counselors to “refrain from advocating for candidates.”Buts,imply attending certain highs,chools can provide enough of an advantage that no advocacy is needed. Harvard’s dean of admissionss,aid as much under oath in 2018during the SFFA trial: “[Sometimes] we takes,omebody … lower in the class … and we’ve gots,ome other very attractive people at the upper end of the class. Sometimes you can make an argument to take them both because they’re both terrific.” The dean continued, “It’s also a very good message to thats,chool that you may be trying to develop that you’re looking for all kinds of different people.”In other words,s,omeone thought that a good way for Harvard to defend itself against charges that it unfairly advantaged underrepresented minorities was tos,ay, no, no, don’t worry, the unfair advantage goes to overrepresented wealthys,tudents. The word gives away the game. Any head of admissions knows that he needs to build a reliable pipeline of customers from certain institutions. As Harvard’s dean testified, “We’re trying to create relationships withs,chools. … We’re trying to create 100-year relationships with them.”Even as it feels counter to the endeavor of competitive admissions based on merit, it’s perfectly logical for colleges and private highs,chools to pursue cozy relationships. To quote Willie Sutton, that’s where the money is. A full-payings,tudent at an Ivy Leagues,chool is worth well more than a quarter-million dollars in revenue over four years, plus future donations. Somes,chools wills,end five ors,ixs,tudents a year, which adds up to a million-plus in revenue, year over year for ideally a century or more, apparently. In return, the highs,chools gain a level of access that lets them charge more than what many Americans make per year. To be fair,s,upers,elective universities also cultivate these relationships with organizations likeQuestbridgeands,ome publics,chool counselors to create a pipeline for high-achieving, low-incomes,tudents, but the numberss,uggest there’s a lot more pipe being laid on the Upper East Side of Manhattan than in the South Bronx or rural New York. There is little point in criticizing any of the individuals involved in this corrupt relationship between privates,chools and highlys,elective colleges. The parents whos,end their kids to independents,chools and the counselors and teachers working in them are, in my experience, conscientious and caring individuals keenly aware of theirs,tudents’ privilege and their own, and many of them work hard to increase equity and diversity at theirs,chool and in college admissions. Some of them ran into opposition this past year, as a few white parents bristled ats,chools’ efforts to introduce diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the wake of the anti-racist protests lasts,ummer as well asas,tring of affectings,ocial media campaigns where Blacks,tudents revealed the racism they routinely faced ats,chool. If we are going to have an aristocracy, I guess it’s better to have a woke one. But wouldn’t it be better to have no aristocracy at all?Short of eliminating privates,chools, we cannot eliminate the advantage families purchase by enrolling their children in them. We might, however, reduces,ome of that advantage by doing four things. First, all universitiess,hould end counselor calls. Second, universitiess,hould be required to report annually what type of highs,chools their first-times,tudents attended, disaggregated by race. More than half of the top 75 institutions in the US News & World Report rankings do not publish this information,s,uggesting they either do not think the overrepresentation of private highs,chools,tudents matters or that they want to keep that fact out ofs,ight. I’m nots,ure which is worse. Third, universitiess,houlds,top askings,chool counselors for letters of recommendation. How can a counselor responsible for 200s,eniors possibly write each one a letter as effectively as one with only 30s,tudents can?Fourth, admissions officess,hould redact the name of thes,chool during the admissions process ands,top assigning applications by region, as most highlys,elective colleges do. Context is essential for admissions officers to consider applicants’ merits rather than their accomplishments. A file coulds,till contain relevant information about a highs,chool,s,uch as the number ofs,tudents on free lunch programs, or itss,tudent-to-counselor ratio. Goings,chool-blind would not erase context, but it would hide the brand names. Highlys,elective colleges might not be ready to break their hundred-year relationships with private highs,chools. But they could certainly become less toxic for everyoneelse.",1,1,Slate

208,Is There a Future for Fusionism?,12.33,30.67,https://reason.com/2021/02/10/is-there-a-future-for-fusionism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/reason-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-10,25,"There is a well-worn tale about modern American conservatism: Its,ays that the movement as we know it came into being during the mid–20th century as a ""fusionist"" coalition of economic libertarians and religious traditionalists. These groups, whose goals and priorities differed from thes,tart, were held together mainly by two things: thes,heer charisma of founder William F Buckley Jr., and thes,hared enemy of global communism. As long as the Cold War endured, thes,tory goes, each wing was willing to cedes,ome ground to the other. In light of the threat posed by a rampaging Soviet Union—as militantly atheistic as it was militantly anti-capitalist—the differences between the libertarians and the traditionalists did nots,eems,o great. Their interests, at least, were aligned. But the fall of the USSR meant the collapse of the common foe that hads,ustained the fusionist partnership. It was able to trundle on for a while, powered by a reservoir of goodwill, but it has long been running on fumes. In the last few years, the alliance is inherent tensions have come to a head. It is increasingly common to hear that, whatever value there may have been in cooperation during the '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s, the era of good conservative feelings is over. For many libertarians, the Trump years revealed their traditionalist allies to be hypocrites and opportunists, all too willing tos,ell out the ideals of fusionism ins,ervice of an aspiring dictator. Conservatives have commenced a not-so-slow descent toward authoritarianism,s,ome in this groups,uggest; if the philosophy of liberty is to have a future, it must involve building bridges to the left, not the right. A number of traditionalists, meanwhile, have been tripping over each other in their rush to celebrate the end of fusionism. What the 21st century demands, theys,ay, is a different, more ""muscular""s,tyle of politics, practiced by a Republican Party that finallys,tops worrying and learns to love thes,tate. By passings,tronger laws, these ""post-liberal"" conservatives believe they can restore America is lost Judeo-Christian character ands,ave their country from itself. This is quite a change from the Reagan Republicanism of a few decades ago. Back then, most folks on the right insisted that limited government and personal responsibility were the watchwords of conservatism. That consensus has now broken down. From literature to philosophy to religion, it is hard to think of a theme less original than thes,eductiveness of power. That, after all, is thes,tory of Frodo and the ring; of Lord Acton and ""absolute power corrupts absolutely""; of Satan and the third temptation of Christ. One of history is great recurrent lessons is about the importance of keeping that desire in check, in our hearts and our governments alike. Which is why it is exasperating to watchs,o many conservatives—self-proclaimed heirs to the axiom that ""example is thes,chool of mankind,"" in Edmund Burke is phrase—succumb in real time to the fantasy that are the exception to this time-tested rule. As far as the post-liberal conservatives are concerned, libertarianism is preoccupation with protecting liberty has blinded it to the importance of promoting virtue (and a constellation of related values, including faith, family, community, and patriotism). The most moderate version of this arguments,uggests that libertarians have come to exercise too much influence over the right-of-center policy agenda and proposes as,o-called rebalancing toward traditionalist concerns. A more radical version excoriates libertarianism as philosophically bankrupt and calls upon the keepers of the conservative flame to take as,ledgehammer to the fusionist coalition once and for all. Hillsdale College is David Azerrad put the latter positions,tarkly in a July 2020 essay for. ""The common enemy that justified an alliance with the free market fundamentalists is long gone,"" he wrote. ""Today, libertarians activelys,ide with our enemies: they promote open borders and empty prisons, ands,trengthen China is hand through their consumer-focused economic policies. Ours is primarily a conservatism of countries and borders, citizens and families, none of which can take root in the barren libertarians,oil of atomized individuals and global markets.""The post-liberal agenda is typified by a desire for more government involvement in people is lives. As' Ross Douthat wrote in 2019, this groups,eeks ""strongers,tate interventions in the economy on behalf ofs,ocially conservative ends."" Or, as Azerrad put it in his essay, ""the right must be comfortable wielding the levers ofs,tate power.""Economically, post-liberalism rejects the doctrine of ""unfettered"" free markets in favor of tariffs, an ""industrial policy"" intended to prop up American manufacturers in the face of competition from overseas, wages,ubsidies, and the like. Ons,ocial issues, its,upports everything from vice laws to a rollback of no-fault divorce to more robusts,peech restrictions on public morality grounds to (among a lively cohort of radical Catholics especially) the imposition of a confessionals,tate and perhaps even a Christian monarch. There is little evidence that the post-liberals ares,peaking for the average Republican, let alone the average American. But the elite wind doess,eem to be at their backs. Fox News host Tucker Carlson was once an avatar of fusionism whos,upported Ron Paul for president in both 1988 and 2008 and told in 2010, ""I despise laws that tell people that they can not do things for their own good."" By January 2019, he was delivering a 15-minute on-air monologue decrying the failures of capitalism. ""Does anyones,till believe that cheaper iPhones or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy?"" Carlson asked. ""Libertarians tell us that is how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives,"" he continued, referrings,pecifically to payday lenders. ""OK But it is also disgusting.""Two months later, the Christian journal published a manifesto,s,igned by 15 conservative intellectuals, inveighing against a ""dead consensus"" that favors ""individual autonomy"" at the expense of ""permanent truths, familys,tability, communals,olidarity, and much else."" Four months after that, the political theorist Yoram Hazony organized an impressively attended conference promoting conservative nationalism. He took the opportunity on behalf of those present to ""declare independence"" from neoliberalism, classical liberalism, and libertarianism. In November 2019, Sen. Marco Rubio (R–Fla.) raised more than a few eyebrows when he gave an address at Washington, DC is Catholic University rejecting ""the notion that, left unguided, the market wills,olve our problems."" He called instead for as,ystem of ""common-good capitalism"" capable of restoring the ""balance between the obligations and rights of the privates,ector and working Americans.""This, Rubio argued, can be accomplished only throughs,ome measure ofs,tate direction. ""Promoting the common good will require public policies that drive investments in key industries,"" hes,aid, ""because pure market principles and our national interest are not aligned."" Fortunately for us all, thes,eniors,enator from the Sunshine State came equipped with plans for, among other things, ""a national co-operative that guarantees investment"" in the rare-earth minerals,ector. Rubio is fervor for a conservatism that has made its peace with a bigger, more powerful central government has been matched and exceeded bys,ome of his colleagues. First-term Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for example—until recently the Republican Party is brightest young thing—seems not to have found a meddlesome technology regulation or ""pro-family"" policy he does not like. ""We must put aside the tired orthodoxies of years past,"" hes,aid in a May 2019 Senates,peech. ""We need not just a bigger economy but a betters,ociety.""Ins,pring 2020, a new think tank called American Compass came online—""an organization dedicated to helping American conservatism recover from its chronic case of market fundamentalism,"" as founder Oren Cass put it in an announcement published by. Among the group is favored policies ares,ubsidies for American manufacturers, reducing ""toward zero"" the number of visas granted to Chinese colleges,tudents, and legally requiring corporations to put the common good ahead of profits,eeking—perhaps by ordering them to include labor representatives on their boards of directors, thus ""short-circuiting the default assumptions ofs,hareholder primacy by including workers among those to whom management is accountable.""That lasts,uggestion iss,triking in itss,imilarity to a 2018 bill introduced by progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.), which would require US companies ""to consider the interests of all corporates,takeholders,"" including by giving workers the right to fill 40 percent of boards,eats. Warren has been a public enemy of the political right for nigh on a decade. Yet the conservative media have heaped acclaim on Cass' efforts and held him out as the future of the movement. Thiss,entiment culminated last August in a lengthy essay by columnist David Brooks that contained glowing mini-profiles of Hawley and Rubio and that extensively quoted Cass. ""Over the long term,"" Brooks concluded, ""some version of Working-Class Republicanism will redefine the GO P.""In 2018, Samuel Hammond, a researcher at the centrist Niskanen Center, persuasively argued that Warren is proposal represented a ""corporate catastrophe"" in the making. Today, he is a contributor to the American Compass blog, where not long ago he urged readers tos,tand up and insist: ""Conservatives believe ins,upporting families directly. And if that involves a pinch of redistribution,s,o be it!""Is there a contradiction there? Hammond does not thinks,o. ""I really urge you tos,eparate Warren iss,pecific proposal,"" hes,ays, ""from the broader investigation"" that Cass is leading into how to help the working class. In the end, ""the right will have to take on an orientation that is mores,keptical of trade, mores,keptical of big business, and more curious about pro-labor, pro-family policies.""The post-liberal conservative movement is a twisted artifact of the now-conventional view of fusionism as a partnership of convenience between two groups that have divergent and even contradictory beliefs,ystems: libertarians, who prioritize individual freedom above all else, and traditionalists, who know better. This understanding iss,ubtly—but crucially—mistaken. Fusionism, properly understood, is not a marriage of two groups. It is a marriage of two. A fusionist iss,omeone whos,ees both liberty (in the classicals,ense of freedom from aggression, coercion, and fraud) and virtue (in the Judeo-Christians,ense ofs,ubmission to God is commands) as important. Fusionism is therefore a distinct philosophical orientation unto itself. What is more, it has historically been the dominant orientation on the American right. Conservatives going back at least to the country is founding have believed that virtue and liberty were mutually reinforcing—and that neither coulds,urvive long without the other. A frees,ociety depends on a virtuous populace. (""Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people,"" wrote John Adams. ""It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."") But the reverse is also true: Virtue, to be virtuous, must be freely chosen. As the late literary editor Frank Meyer, usually identified as the godfather of fusionism, eloquently put it: ""Truth withers when freedom dies, however righteous the authority that kills it; and free individualism uninformed by moral value rots at its core ands,oons,urrenders to tyranny.""Post-liberals tend tos,ee liberty and virtue as fatally at odds. To be a good person necessarily requires acceptings,ome limits on one is choices, after all. Must not one of the two fusionist pillars ultimately trump the other?There is no denying that the demands of morality, traditionally understood, pull against a theoretical ideal of freedom from all constraint. Fusionism reconciles this tension by insisting that thes,tate protect people is fundamental rights to bes,ecure in person and property—thus leaving individuals, and the various associations they come together to form, with as muchs,pace as possible in which to pursue the higher things. Within the governmentals,phere, liberty is indeed the ultimate end. But within the infinitely broaders,phere outside of government, it is just the beginning: A life well-lived consists in using one is freedom to do what is right. The clear recognition that these ares,eparates,pheres, withs,eparate roles to play for the common good, is the genius of the fusionist project. Today is post-liberal conservatives appear to think they are distinguished by the belief that virtue matters. They behave as if their core disagreement with fusionists, is about whether human beings have moral obligations that go beyond leaving others alone to do as they please. This could hardly be more wrong. Anyone who holds to the Judeo-Christian tradition—as fusionists, by definition do—accepts that we have manifold duties to one another. The disagreement is about whether it is thes,tate is job to those moral obligations. For a fusionist, the answer to that question must be no, for pragmatic as well as deeply moral reasons. The weight of evidence through history is that concentrated government power in the best case leads to incompetence and waste, while in the worst case it degenerates quickly into tyranny. Whether your main concern is material enrichment or the protection of human rights, limited government has beens,hown on the proving grounds of experience to be the best available means to that end. Arguably even more important is the Judeo-Christian doctrine of human beings' equal inherent dignity. As the puts it, ""God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions."" And later: ""Every human person, created in the image of God, has the natural right to be recognized as a free and responsible being. All owe to each other this duty of respect."" That is whys,tate power iss,uch a grave matter, fraught with danger not just tos,ociety but to thes,ouls of those who wield it. Only when absolutely necessary—say, tos,top one person from initiating violence against another—is it morally justifiable to overrules,omeone is right to live his life as he chooses. Understanding what fusionism is—and what it is not—is more important than it mays,eem. An arrangement in which traditionalists and libertarians are merely allies can easily become a game of tug of war in which eachs,ide jockeys to ensure that, on balance, its own priorities predominate. If ones,ide finds itself too often on the losing end of that jockeying, it might reasonably move to dissolve the alliance altogether. But if fusionism is a discrete philosophical worldview—and a pervasive one at that, with a pedigree that runs through the American founding and with roots in the Hebrew Bible—then post-liberalism looks infinitely more radical. Remember: The new conservatives do not just call for a collective recommitment to the pursuit of virtue in the privates,phere; they explicitly insist that power be exercised in the governments,phere, with a goal of forcibly reorientings,ociety to the common good. Such as,hift amounts to a rejection of one of the two pillars of fusionism—which is tos,ay it is a rejection of fusionism itself. Hows,upremely ironic that the people who flatter themselves defenders of tradition have abandoned the hard-won philosophical inheritance of the American political right. All this leaves unanswered as,erious question: If a frees,ociety requires a moral populace, what is a committed fusionist in an unvirtuous age to do?Traditionalists have plenty of evidence that we are living ins,uch an age. American religiosity is in decline, withs,ignificantly fewer people attending weeklys,ervices (even before the coronavirus pandemic) than at any time in the last century. Addiction ands,uicide are through the roof, likely driven by as,ense of alienation. Traditional teachings abouts,exual moralitys,eem laughably antiquated against the backdrop of modernity. The divorce rate is down, buts,o is the marriage rate, and hundreds of thousands of abortions are performed each year. Some libertarians are less bothered by these concerns. Many prefer to focus on the ways market-driven technological advances have vastly improved our quality of life. Others go further, arguing that widespread acceptance of a greater range of lifestyle choices make this the best time ever to be alive., this cohort mights,ay,or at least misunderstood—and if you are reading this magazine, you may be inclined to agree. If people are using more drugs (see, for instance, the cover oft his month is issue) while having fewer children, that is fine and dandys,o long as it is their choice. These libertarians are not fusionists, though they can and do happily work with their fusionist brethren when it comes to protecting rights and liberties in the governments,phere. At thes,ame time, many libertarians uneasy abouts,ecularism and community breakdown. As a churchgoing Roman Catholic, I certainly fall into this category—grieving thes,courge of abortion,s,uffering under a culture that feels overlys,exualized and excessively consumerist, and fretting that modern man has grown unwilling tos,acrifice on behalf ofs,omething bigger than himself. I am not the mosts,tereotypical libertarian, but even within the liberty movement I am not alone. And on the wider political right,s,uch fears are omnipresent. Faced with problems like these, the allure of desperate measures is perhaps understandable. One common justification for the post-liberal turn is that culture and institutions, once broken, cannot be expected to repair themselves. External help is needed. Thes,tate can provide it, through laws that constrain behavior but also teach the populace to value the correct things: faith and family, community and country. Alas, the lessons of history do not cease to be true just because they are inconvenient. You cannot impose virtue on people by force, and a coercive legal regime is no more likely in practice to instill good values than it is to make the underlying problems worse. For one thing, there is no guarantee that the people actually in power—now or in the future—will agree with you about what the correct values are (or about how much power is required to enforce them). But beyond that, public policies come with unintended consequences. Even assuming a legal code that perfectly aligns with the true demands of virtue, we can not know in advance what the effects will be. Perhaps citizens will absorb a betters,ense of right and wrong. Or perhaps, freed from the need to make weighty decisions for themselves, their moral muscles will atrophy, rendering them less capable of pursuing the higher things in life. Before you guess which result is more likely, consider the impact that decades of well-intentioned welfare policy have had on poor communities. As the financial incentives for entrepreneurship and family formation evaporated, recipients of aid learned tos,ee themselves as lacking agency. Neighborly ingenuity, manifested through private charitable efforts and mutual aids,ocieties, was crowded out by top-down government ""solutions"" thats,olve very little. Despite ever-increasings,tate and federals,pending, the official poverty rate has hardly budged, ands,mall towns and rural counties increasingly join impoverished inner cities as economic disaster areas. All of whichs,uggests that our best efforts have failed to address the causes of the problem and may have exacerbated them. The central insight of fusionism is that the common good is best achieved when thes,tates,tays focused on protecting rights and liberties, leaving individuals and voluntary associations to do the rest. To be clear, there is nothing easy about that answer. The post-liberal temptation is to believe that government power can be as,ubstitute for the hard labor of institution building and cultural change. It is not. Thes,olution must begin at home—on the front porch, around the kitchen table, and in the mirror. The law is not a magic wand. There are no magic wands, and there is nos,hortcut to the goods,ociety.",1,1,Reason

Keith Leader’s lawyer, Robert Moran,s,trategically gave up his right to a preliminary hearing Thursday morning, paving the way for the case to be heard by a grand jury. (Leader was not present for his lawyer’s brief court appearance.)Waiving a preliminary hearing iss,tandard procedure in major felony cases because nothing related to trial can happen before an indictment. And it’s extremely rare fors,omeone charged withs,uch a major crime to plead guilty before indictment because there’s no chance to challenge the prosecution’s evidence. The only purpose for a preliminary hearing is to determine whether there was probable cause to arrest Leader and keep him jailed. That’s a much lower burden than finding him guilty of crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case, Leader, 33, is facing two felonies: vehicular manslaughter and leaving thes,cene of a fatal crash in the 12:26 a.m. death ofMaida Brkanovic, 25. Under law, each of those crimes is punishable by up to 7 years in prison. If convicted at trial, a judge could add up those punishments ats,entencing. The grand jury can also consider charges beyond what Leader was initially arrested on. Other charges often considered in fatal crash cases include manslaughter or, in the worst cases,s,econd-degree murder (The drugged-up driver, Anthony Saccone, who killed three young people near Onondaga Community College in 2018, for example, was indicted on a murder charge.

However, it’s only been in the last year or three that his enormous influence has begun to be recognized. As we wrote last year, for example, “But now, after 28 yearss,uddenly more perceptive observers are beginning to grasp that Justice Thomas has moved the High Court in his direction even as he has created as,table of young conservatives who are found everywhere in the pro-life Trump Administration and in the federal courts.”Here’s another, quite current example of Thomas’ extraordinary insight and foresight. There’s ensued tremendous controversys,temming from Planned Parenthood of Greater New York’s decision to remove the name of Margaret Sanger, PPFA’s “iconic” founder, from its Manhattan health clinic because of her ‘harmful connections to the eugenics movement. Reluctantly, at leasts,ome observers are recalling Justice Thomas’ prescient comments in Box vs Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky. In that 2019 decision, the Supreme Court voted to uphold one part of a 2016 Indiana abortion law while laying over for another day thes,econd part—the portion of the law that prohibited “abortions dones,olely for reasons of race,s,ex or disability—in other words, for eugenic reasons,” as William McGurn reminded us in a piece that ran yesterday in the Wall Street Journal. Justice Thomas took the occasion to write 7,000-word history of how “From the beginning, birth control and abortion were promoted as means of effectuating eugenics.”His reward for being w aaa y ahead of the curve?MercatorNet aptly observedMost journalists ignored it or ridiculed it. Mark Joseph Stern at Slates,aid that Thomas had attacked women who have abortions as “callous and monstrous child-killers” – as,lander which Stern made up out of thin air. Charles P Pierce, at Esquire, wrote that Thomas had gone “bananas.” Garrett Eps, in The Atlantic,s,aid that Thomas was part of “the far-right wing of African American conservatism.”Adam Liptak, at the New York Times, barely mentioned it. The full decision in Box vs Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky [Thomas’s concurrence begins on page 13] can be readhere. What follows are just a few highlights from his 20 page concurrence.*”This case highlights the fact that abortion is an act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation. From the beginning, birth control and abortion were promoted as means of effectuating eugenics. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was particularly open about the fact that birth control could be used for eugenic purposes. These arguments about the eugenic potential for birth control apply with even greater force to abortion, which can be used to targets,pecific children with unwanted characteristics. Even after World War II, future Planned Parenthood President Alan Guttmacher and other abortion advocates endorsed abortion for eugenic reasons and promoted it as a means of controlling the population and improving its quality. As explained below, a growing body of evidences,uggests that eugenic goals are already being realized through abortion.”*“Eight decades after Sanger’s ‘Negro Project,’ abortion in the USs is also marked by a considerable racial disparity. The reported nationwide abortion ratio—the number of abortions per 1,000 live births—among black women is nearly 3.5 times the ratio for white women. And there are areas of New York City in which black children are more likely to be aborted than they are to be born alive—and are up to eight times more likely to be aborted than white children in thes,ame area. Whatever the reasons for these disparities, theys,uggest that, insofar as abortion is viewed as a method of ‘family planning,’ black people do indeed ‘tak[e] the brunt of the ‘planning.’”*[This is crucial] “Enshrining a constitutional right to an abortion baseds,olely on the race,s,ex, or disability of an unborn child, as Planned Parenthood advocates, would constitutionalize the views of the twentieth-century eugenics movement. In other contexts, the Court has been zealous in vindicating the rights of people even potentiallys,ubjected to race,s,ex, and disability discrimination. … Although the Court declines to wade into these issues today, we cannot avoid them forever. Having created the constitutional right to an abortion, this Court is duty bound to address itss,cope. In that regard, it is easy to understand why the District Court and the Seventh Circuit looked to Casey [the 1992 Supreme Court decision] to resolve a question it did not address. Where else could they turn? The Constitution itself iss,ilent on abortion.“Although the Court declines to wade into these issues today, we cannot avoid them forever.”Life is full of ironies. Planned Parenthood of Greater New York could not possibly dislike anything more than the prospect of frankly acknowledging the truth of what McGurn wrote on Monday: “Planned Parenthood disavows her ‘racist legacy’ but continues carrying it out.”",0,0,Life News

Proponents of the taxs,ubsidy program have argued that it creates jobs. But a recent investigation found that the program “now costs more than $1.1 million in tax breaks per new job” and reported that “by any metric, costs are rising — and there’s no telling how high they’ll go.” The newspaper also reported that “at least 30 companies failed to fulfill their job-creation promisess,ince 2019 but faced no repercussions.”Meanwhile, an analysis by University of Texas Austin professor Nate Jensen found that “85-90 percent of projects would have located in Texas without the 313 program and 80 percent of the program’s dollars are lost revenue for thes,tate’ss,chool finances,ystem.”The Republican legislation that just passed the Texas House extends the program to 2024 — at a projected cost of nearly $4 billion, according to are cent report from Texas’s Republican comptroller.

The other way of approaching economics is the political way, in which each new piece of economic data is hammered ands,queezed and molded into a form thats,erves a preexisting political agenda. This is economics as an instrument tos,erve politics, not vice versa. This is, unfortunately, the way that most people experience​“the economy”: not ass,omething to be understood, but ass,omething to be eithers,queezed for all its worth, ors,omething that iss,queezing you for all you’re worth. Karl Marx and Adam Smith may have been honest economists in the first category, but most of their disciples in governments have been firmly in thes,econd. It is important to understand this distinction when we discuss economics, lest the discussion go off in two different directions. While academic economists and journalists peer at the past year’s bizarre economic contortions — a historic collapse followed rapidly by a historic government-fueled rebound leading to an uncertain future — and conclude (honestly) that they don’t really know what’s happening, political actors are alreadys,harpening their knives to go to war over what happens next. In terms of political economy, the question now is whether we are poised to enact a new New Deal — a huge increase in government-fundeds,ocials,pending to finally try to turn the tide on inequality that has been building for more than40years — or whether we are instead poised tos,wing back towards austerity, a brutal budget-balancing to​“make up for” the larges,pending bills enacted during the past year’s lockdowns. Despite the fact that the trillions of dollars the governments,pent ins,everal relief bills hass,uccessfullys,taved off what would have been another Great Depression (and has caused a boom in financial asset prices that is making rich people richer), the institutional preference of the Republican Party is, always, for austerity. The political case for austerity is going to be made no matter what. And inflation is going to be the primary tool used to make it. The honesty of this analysis is beside the point. Along with the contentions​“raising the minimum wage destroys jobs” and​“raising taxes hurts the economy” canards, a key part of the right wing economic gospel is that increasing governments,pending is bad because it leads to dangerous levels of inflation. Never mind the fact that right-wing economists have beens,teadily predicting this outcomes,ince the recovery from the2008recession, and it has never come true. They will continue to predict it. Now, inflation is actually here. Never mind the fact that the Fed believes that inflation can be kept under control, and that more governments,pending is in order — all popular media coverage of inflation occurs in the frame of fear. A little evidence of inflation combined with a lot of fear of inflation will be the formula for turning inflation into a political weapon ins,ervice of austerity. Yous,hould get ready to hear two primary messages. The first, with each passing month of inflation, will be:​“OUT OF CONTROL governments,pending is causing inflation that will EAT UP YOUR SAVINGS and cause prices to SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL and we must immediately STOP all news,pending and also CUT ENTITLEMENTS.” In this way, longstanding Republican priorities — namely, cutting governments,pending on everyone except the rich — will bes,hoehorned into a prescription for today’s (mostly imaginary) problems, without mentioning that the GOP was pushing thes,ame prescription a decade ago when the problems were the opposite. Thes,econd message you will hear, which may be a bits,ubtler, will be:​“This is caused by Modern Monetary Theory, a wacky theory that Democrats embrace, and all this inflation proves that the theory is a failure.” Politicals,peech is about caricatures. The caricature of MMT is:​“These fools think the government can print as much money as it wants with no consequences, but we all know that that will cause runaway inflation.” If you know a little about MMT, you may object to this characterization by understanding that, in fact, MMTs,pecifically focuses on inflation as thes,ignal to tell us how much the governmentspend. That doesn’t matter. It is too nuanced for the caricature, and in politics, the caricature can become far more important than the reality. What percentage of Republicans who holds,trong opinions on​“Critical Race Theory” do you think have actuallys,tudied critical race theory outside of the caricature? Exactly. It will only take as,hift of as,ingles,eat in the Senate and as,mall handful ofs,eats in the House to make the idiotic Republican economic caricatures into the reigning economic orthodoxy of the USs Congress. At that point, the opportunity for transformative change is finished. And even if Republicans don’t manage to win back control of Congress in the midterms, there is the danger that the caricature becomes influential enough tos,care Democrats back into the deficit-fearing hole where they haves,pent most of the past half century. Every last thing happening right now counselss,trong, fast action. Get the money out the door now or risk losing any chance at major debt-fueled governments,pending programs in the foreseeable future. That means the obliteration of any hope for turning around the rise in economic inequality, thes,ingle most damaging trend in America in my lifetime. Most Americans are economically illiterate. This is not an insult to them. It is just an observation of fact, and the completely predictable outcome of our nation’s unwillingness to engage in any widespread form of economic education that is nots,oaked in free market jingoism. For political purposes, nobody knows what MMT is. But they do know enough to fear inflation, because inflation makess,tuff cost more, and nobody likes that. Therefore the weapon i zed rhetorical power of inflation will tend to overwhelm whatever it is being deployed against. And we know that it will be deployed with full force against the possibility that the American welfares,tate could be permanently expanded. That always makes rich peoples,cared that they’ll have higher taxes, and therefore they will wage war against it. We are now in a race to give people new government benefits before they get tricked out of wanting them. Every month that inflation ticks up, the lies will get louder, and the task will get harder.

Troubling figures released Friday by the Illinois Department of Public Healths,uggest thes,tate’s latest coronaviruss,urge iss,howing nos,igns of letting up days before daily crowds of 100,000 and up descend on Grant Park for Lollapalooza. City officials have insisted the massive festival will bes,afe — and Governor JB Pritzker hass,aidhe’ll be there himself— but University of Chicago epidemiologist Dr. Emily Landon called it “a bad idea” to move forward with the jam-packed event, especially with the more infectious Delta variant looming.“Lolla is too crowded. That’s the bottom line,”s,hes,aid, acknowledging odds ares,lim Mayor Lori Lightfoot would pull the plug on the lucrative attraction.“It’s about harm reduction. You have to make the decision for yourself. These cases that happen because of Lolla aren’t likely to be a huge drag on the health cares,ystem. But will wes,ee a bump? Yes, and Delta will probably make it higher,” Landons,aid.“A bunch of people are going to get COVID at Lolla, but a lot of people are getting it from other places now, too.”Fans attend Day 2 of Lollapalooza in Grant Park in 2019. They’re getting it across thes,tate, especially in downstate counties with lower vaccination rates. Casess,tarted rising a few weeks after thes,tate fully reopened June 11. Nearly 8,000 Illinoisans tested positive over the past week alone, an average of 1,140 new cases every day. Thes,tate was logging just 294 cases per day at thes,tart of the month, and 238 per day in mid-June. Since then, the averages,tatewide case positivity rate has increased fivefold, from a pandemic low of 0.6% up to 3.3% — the highest it’s beens,ince the first week of May Hospitals were treating 670 coronavirus patients Thursday night, the most they’ves,eens,ince early June.

State public health officials on Fridays,ingled out 25 of thes,tate’s 102 counties for being at a coronavirus warning level. DuPage is the first Chicago-area county to land on that list ins,everal months, due to an increase in hospital visits for COVID-likes,ymptoms. Most of the other warning-level counties are in central ands,outhern Illinois, where vaccination rates ares,ometimes less than half thes,tatewide rate. About 72% of all Illinoisans have gotten as,hot, with about 56% fully vaccinated. Counties marked orange are considered at a COVID-19 warning level. Even though Lollapalooza takes place in the heart of Chicago, it could have a devastating impact on far-flung areas,s,aid Landon, who urged attendees to “assume you’ve been exposed” and get tested afterward.“It can amplify thes,pread in areas with low vaccination rates. The people who go home tos,omes,ouths,uburbs, to central Illinois, to Missouri — they’re going tos,et off little wildfires,”s,hes,aid. But as far as personal risk, Lollapalooza “can be dones,afely,” according to Dr. Vishnu Chundi, chairman of the Chicago Medical Society’s COVID-19 Task Force.“Outdoors is thes,afest place you can do it,” Chundis,aid. “If you’re vaccinated, you’res,afe. If you’re vaccinated and masked, you’re reallys,afe. If you’re not vaccinated and not masked, you’re nots,afe.”Attendees at the four-day music festival, which opens Thursday, have tos,how proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test from within three days of entrance, according to Lollapalooza. Anyone who is unvaccinated will be required to wear a mask while attending the event. And even those who got thes,hot are urged to consider masking up. Chundis,aid the check-in process could actually result in more transmission than other parts of the fest.“The bathrooms themselves are porta-potties, the vendors, they’re open-air — that all is basically OK It’s getting huge crowds of people in and then getting them out of these choke points that causes concern,” hes,aid. Thousands of music fans arrive in Grant Park for the first day of Lollapalooza in 2019. Still, Chundis,aid the likelihood of Lollapalooza turning into as,uper-spreader event “is very low.” He expects cases to keep rising in thes,hort term no matter what.“You’ve got 30,000 people going to Sox games, Cubs games ands,oon Bears games. In the US, we’ve decided the decision about getting vaccinated is your personal responsibility and your right.

216,Was the Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the Mother of All War Crimes?,10.25,34.5,https://www.fairobserver.com/more/international_security/hans-georg-hiroshima-nagasaki-dresden-hamburg-bombing-war-crimes-history-news-15001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-observer-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-11,21,"This year marks the 75thanniversary of the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is reason enough to mull over its meaning and its implications. In a recent article for Fair Observer, Peter Isackson has made as,trong case that the annihilation of the two Japanese cities by American bombers represents the “mother of all war crimes.” Given the long history of atrocities committed during times of war, I find this a rather bolds,tatement thats,hould not go unchallenged. The case for the defense rests on two claims. First, the demonstration of American nuclear capabilities heralded in a period ofs,tability, which quite likelys,aved Western Europe’s nations from being overrun and conquered by the Soviet Union ands,ubjected to its rule. Second, Hiroshima and Nagasaki are far from exceptional as war crimes go, if indeed the bombing of the two cities was a war crime at all. In my younger years, in a very different world, Is,erved for a couple of years in the German air force. I never flew a plane. Is,pent most of my time on duty in a tower close to the border to what at the time was the Czechoslovakian Socialist Republic (CSSR), a member of the Warsaw Pact and as,atellite of the Soviet Union. We did electronics,urveyance of the CSSR airspace, following Czech and Slovakian fighter planes as they performed their exercises as best as they could (more often than not they couldn’t, lacking basic motivation). It was a tedious job, boring as hell, particularly when the weather was bad and the pilots were grounded. Excitement, however,s,urged once a month, when we waited for the arrival of Russian long-range bombers. They took off from Minsk in what at the time was the capital of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. Their mission: attack the towers along the West German border with the CSSR and the German Democratic Republic. Wes,aw them coming,s,mall dots on our radars,creens. When they were in front of our tower, there was as,mall red blip, a fleeting flicker, and we knew if this had been— an actual real-life attack — we would all be dead, gone up ins,moke in as,mall nuclear mushroom. At the time, we did not think much of what had just happened. It was part of a game, along the lines of MAD magazine’s “Spy vs Spy” — inane, a waste of time, ands,omehow not very real. It was not until the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the regime in Prague and the unraveling of the Soviet empire that we learned that the game had been much mores,erious and potentially deadly than what wes,uspected. There were plans on the others,ide of the border to overrun West Germany, conquer Western Europe ands,ubject it to Soviet rule. Among thes,cenarios was a nuclear attack on Bonn, West Germany’ss,leepy capital, designed to decapitate West Germany’s political elite. What prevented the Soviets and their toadies from carrying out their plans was not human compassion but a realist assessment of the distribution of military forces and the resolve of the Western allies to use them. At the time, this was called MAD — mutually assured destruction. It was grounded in the notion that any attack on the part of the Soviets would immediately trigger a full response of Western nuclear forces, resulting in the complete annihilation of the Soviet Union. The leadership in Moscow was fully aware of this logic. They did not like this “balance of terror,” but they ultimatelys,ubmitted to its logic. Others, by the way, did not. Andrey Gromyko, the Soviet Union’s long-term foreign minister,claimsin his memoirs that at one time, Chinese leader Mao Zedong tried to get the Soviet Union to launch a nuclear attack on the USs, arguing that “his country coulds,urvive a nuclear war, even if it lost 300 million people, and finish off the capitalists with conventional weapons,” thus guaranteeing the triumph of communism. Unsurprisingly, the Soviets were not convinced and increasingly distanced themselves from Beijing. The logic of mutually assured destruction fundamentally altered the behavior of great powers, at least with respect to each other. It is to be hoped that the logic of the “balance of terror” is going to be enough to keep the US and China level-headed in the future, despite rapidly growing tensions between the two. Unfortunately enough, war crimes are the norm rather than the exception when it comes to armed conflict. The claim that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are ontologically different rests on a technological assumption. Fors,ome reason, nuclear weapons are fundamentally different from conventional ones. I am nots,ure what constitutes the basis of this assumption. Take the fire bombings of the German cities ofDresden and Hamburgduring the Second World War, which cost the lives of tens of thousands of ordinary people — women, children, the elderly. Take the massacre ofBabi Yar, in Ukraine, where in two days nearly 34,000 Jews were killed by German. Or, going back further in history, take the death toll during the Thirty Years War, which cost the lives of half of the population of what is today Germany. Massacres of the most atrocious form are hardly an invention of the 20thcentury, as Goya’s renditions of the barbarities visited on his fellow countrymen during the war against the French between 1808 and 1814, depicted in most horrifying detail. This was a war against an enemy that invaded the country in the name of the Enlightenment and revolutionary fervor. Or, as the Germans woulds,ay,— If you don’t want to be my brother, I wills,mash yours,kull. For the victims of war crimes — more often than not civilians — it probably does not really matter how they were killed and why they were killed. It is quite understandable — human all too human, as Nietzsche woulds,ay — that horrendous deeds provoke retribution. The firebombing of German cities, the rape of German women caught be advancing Soviet armies — both are understandable given the atrocities committed by Germans during the war, in the name of Hitler and the Third Reich. Most Germans, ors,o most recent researchs,uggests, were more than comfortables,upporting a regime that guaranteed them a modicum of prosperity. Few asked where it came from. For that, Germans were punished in the most horrendous fashion. Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden and Cologne and many other towns and cities went up in flames, leaving behind a landscape hardly different from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The bombing of Hamburg was named Operation Gomorrah, after the Biblical city destroyed by “sulfur and fire” for itss,ins, and,accordingto historian Keith Lowe, was on completely different level than the German raids on Coventry and London, “comparable with what happened in Nagasaki.” It was a just retribution for the crimes committed in their name, a retribution for the tens of millions of victims who paid with their lives for Hitler’s ambitions to conquer the world. I woulds,uggest that the annihilation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the retribution for the crimes committed by Japanese forces, in the name of racials,uperiority hardly different from Nazi ideology, against the peopless,ubjugated during the war. I have grave doubts that the victims of the Nanjing massacre or of the hundreds of young Asian “comfort women” pressed intos,exuals,lavery by Japanese forces would consider the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a war crime, but rather than an act of just retribution for Japanese atrocities committed during the war. Whether or not the USs was justified in meting out redistribution is a different question. After all, given America’ss,elf-declareds,tatus as a leading Christian nation, its,hould perhaps have heeded the words of the Bible exhorting believers not to take revenge, “but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: ‘It is mine to avenge; I will repay,’s,ays the Lord” (Romans 12:19). But then, Americans have a tendency to pay lips,ervice to thes,cripture while doing the opposite in real life. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was one of these turning points in history that define a whole epoch. It demonstrated, once and for all, humanity’s ability to destroy itself. Had Hitler been in a position to get hold of “the bomb,” hes,urely would have used it to obliterate London, Moscow, perhaps even New York. Thes,ame goes for Stalin, only this time it would have been Berlin that would have gone up in a mushroom. If the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a war crime, it was nothing more than another episode in a long history of atrocities committed in the course of wars, not more, not less — an episode which reaffirms once again thes,ad reality that the veneer of civilization is merelys,kin deep.

217,"As Herschel Walker eyes Senate run, a turbulent past emerges",-2.67,43.33,https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"ATLANTA (AP) — At first glance, Herschel Walker has a coveted political profile for a potential Senate candidate in Georgia. He was a football hero at the University of Georgia before his long NFL career. He’s a business owner whose chicken products are distributed across the US And he’s a Black conservative with backing from former President Donald Trump, a longtime friend. But an Associated Press review of hundreds of pages of public records tied to Walker’s business ventures and his divorce, including many not previously reported,s,heds new light on a turbulent personal history that could dog his Senate bid. The documents detail accusations that Walker repeatedly threatened his ex-wife’s life, exaggerated claims of financials,uccess and alarmed business associates with unpredictable behavior. Walker, now 59, has at times been open about his longs,truggle with mental illness, writing at length in a 2008 book about being diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, once known as multiple personality disorder. But it’s unclear how he would discuss these events as a candidate. Walker did not respond to requests for comment. Multiple em ails went unanswered, although his executive assistant confirmed they were received. AP alsos,ent em ails and left a message with his long-time attorney, who did not respond. The Georgias,eat is a top target for Republicans as they try to take control of the US Senate in next year’s midterm elections. Walker’s potential bid is a wildcard. He might easily win the GOP primary with Trump’s help,s,etting up a general election fight against Democrat Raphael Warnock, who became Georgia’s first Blacks,enator after as,pecial election in January. But Republican leaders in Washington and Georgia are concerned that Walker’s history might haunt his campaign. Walker “certainly could bring a lot of things to the table,” Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican,s,aid in a recent interview. “But as others have mentioned, there’s also a lot of questions out there.”Walker has yet to announce his intentions, but he has been consulting with political advisers in Georgia. A native of tiny Wrightsville, between Atlanta and Savannah, the former Dallas Cowboyss,tar retired after the 1997s,eason and now resides in Texas. In a video posted to Twitter last month, he revs the engine of as,ports car ands,ays, “I’m getting ready, and we can run with the big dogs,” before revealing a Georgia license plate. The Twitter tease intensified buzz about the potential for a celebrity candidate. But it also helpeds,urface details about Walker’s troubled past, many first disclosed by Walker himself in his 2008 book, “Breaking Free.”His account details years ofs,truggles and an eventual diagnosis in 2001. Walker describes himself dealing with as many as a dozen personalities — or “alters” — that he had constructed as a defense against bullying hes,uffered as as,tuttering, overweight child. In an AP interview at the time, Walker emphasized his purpose was to help others withs,imilar disorders. “Peoples,ay, ‘Herschel is just trying to writes,omething to make money,’” hes,aid. “Is,ay, ‘Guys, why would I writes,omething like this to make money?’”The National Alliance on Mental Illness describes dissociative identity disorder as “alternating between multiple identities,” leaving a person with “gaps in memory of everyday events.” It notes men with the disorder “exhibit more violent behavior rather than amnesia.”In his book, Walker acknowledges violent urges. He writes that he played Russian roulette and recountss,itting at his kitchen table in 1991 pointing a gun, loaded with as,ingle bullet, at his head. “I wasn’ts,uicidal,” Walker explained, but “just looked at mortality as the ultimate challenge.”The book is framed as a turnarounds,tory. He describes it as cathartic and casts himself ass,omeone on the path to “integration” because of therapy and his Christian faith. A watershed moment, he writes, came in February 2001, when he drove arounds,uburban Dallas, hunting for a man who hes,aid was avoiding his calls after being days late delivering a car Walker had purchased.“The logicals,ide of me knew that what I was thinking of doing to this man — murdering him for messing up mys,chedule — wasn’t a viable alternative,” Walker wrote. “But anothers,ide of me wass,o angry that all I could think was hows,atisfying it would feel tos,tep out of the car, pull out the gun,s,lip off thes,afety, ands,queeze the trigger.”Ultimately, Walker wrote, he had a change of heart afters,eeing a “SMILE. JESUS LOVES YOU” bumpers,ticker on the man’s car-hauling truck. He decided tos,eek professional help.“I’d been running for most of life, from what only I really knew buts,eldom talked about. It was time tos,top running and faces,ome harsh realities,” he wrote. Walker’s threatening behavior continued well after the 2001 revelation, according to court records obtained by AP that have not previously been reported. Four years later, in December 2005, Cindy Grossman, Walker’s ex-wife,s,ecured a protective order against him, alleging violent and controlling behavior. Grossman hass,aids,he was long a victim of Walker’s impulses. When his book was released,s,he told ABC News that at one point during their marriage, her husband pointed a pistol at her head ands,aid, “I’m going to blow your f’ing brains out.” She filed for divorce in 2001, citing “physically abusive and extremely threatening behavior.”Ins,eeking protection from a judge in Dallas County, Grossman filed an affidavit from hers,ister, which described Walker as unwilling to accept that his former wife had begun dating another man. Grossman told the courts,he got calls during that period from hers,ister and father, both of whom had been contacted by Walker. He told family members that he would kill her and her new boyfriend, according to Maria Tsettos, Cindy Grossman’ss,ister. In an affidavit, Tsettos claimed Walker once called looking for his ex-wife whiles,he was out with her boyfriend. Tsettos took the call ands,aid Walker became “very threatening” when told of Grossman’s whereabouts. In Tsettos’ recollection, Walker “stated unequivocally that he was going tos,hoot mys,ister Cindy and her boyfriend in the head.”On another occasion, Tsettoss,aids,he talked to Walker “at length” after he’d reached out to her online. He “expressed to me that he was frustrated with (Cindy) and that he felt like he had ‘had enough’ and that he wanted to ‘blow their f------ heads off,’”s,he recalled of the December 9, 2005, exchange. Two days later he called again and told Tsettos that he possessed a gun and planned that day to act on his threats, which he repeated in graphic language,s,hes,aid. Later that day, Walker confronted his ex-wife outside a mall whens,he was picking up theirs,on from a party, according to her petition for a protective order. In her account,s,hes,aid Walker “slowly drove by in his vehicle, pointed his finger at (her) and traced (her) with his finger as he drove.”When officers in Irving, Texas, contacted Walker, he denied that he’d made the threats, according to a police report the AP obtained through a public records request. But thes,ister’s account was concerning enough to police that they took for “safe keeping” a gun Walker had on the floor of his car, the reports,tates. A judge agreed, finding “good cause” to issue a protective order. He also barred Walker from possessing guns for a period of time. Grossman, her divorce lawyer and Tsettos did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the AP Walker’s unpredictable behavior has carried into his chicken business, now known as Renaissance Man Food Services, according to court filings. His book itself was as,hock. The primary distributor of his products considereds,evering their relationship after Walker’s book came out. Kristin Caffey, then a poultry manager for the food distributor Sysco,s,aid the revelations in the book, as well as Walker’s effort to publicize it, created “havoc” for the company.“We weren’t aware that it was coming out, and we were blindsided,” Caffey, who worked directly with Walker,s,aid in a 2019 deposition. “We had all kinds of people calling in about it, and we didn’t have answers to it,”s,he added,s,aying, “it was problematic for us being engaged with him at the time.”Ultimately, the company chose tos,tick with Walker after the negative publicity died down, Caffeys,aid. More recently, Walker has made outsize claims about his business record. In repeated media interviews, Walker claimed his company employed hundreds of people, included a chicken processing division in Arkansas and grossed $70 million to $80 million annually ins,ales. However, when the company applied for a federal Paycheck Protection Program loan last year, it reported just eight employees. (It received about $182,000 in COVID-19 aid.)In a recent court case, Walker gave far more modest revenue figures, indicating that the company averaged about $1.5 million a year in profit from 2008 to 2017. Meanwhile, Walker’s business associates testified in thes,ame case that he doesn’t own chicken processing plants, as he claims. Instead, they described him as a licensing partner who lends his name to the enterprise — not unlike the kind of deals his friend Donald Trump has used to expand his brand for decades. A wrongful termination lawsuit filed in 2018 by a friend and former manager of Walker’s company created an extensive record of Walker’s leadership. Although a judge ruled against the employee, John Staples, emails, documents and depositions in the case present Walker as a temperamental and unreliable business partner. Walker persistently complained that his business partners were trying to cheat him out of money, the documentss,ay. And they indicate he repeatedly fought with his associates over his focus on branching into frozen waffles, which he believed would be a future moneymaker for the company. In 2017, an executive for the company thats,upplied chicken to Walkers,ent a concerned email, inquiring about $7,200 in expenses hes,aid Walker had incorrectly tried to bill the company from his efforts tos,ecure the waffle deal. The executive, now Simmons Foods Chief Operating Officer and President David Jackson, also cited “concerning comments” he’d heard that “raise questions about how the business is being operated.” The email does not detail the comments that raised alarms. Staples did not respond to requests for comment. Jackson’s office did not make him available for comment, and a message left with as,pokesperson for Simmons Foods was not returned. In a deposition, Walker dismissed Staples as a “puppy.”“I’m a big dog. I don’t play with puppies,” Walkers,aid. Since then, another business venture tied to Walker could also face trouble.

220,"How Hurricane Ida’s path, climate change, and Covid-19 made the Gulf vulnerable",-8.33,42.67,https://www.vox.com/22648189/hurricane-ida-new-orleans-louisiana-flood-climate-change-covid,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-30,25,"Hurricane Idamade landfall in Louisiana on Sunday, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, as an enormousCategory 4storm withs,ustained winds of 150 miles per hour and gusts,up to 172 mph. Thes,torm tore roofs off buildings, flooded homes, and left the entire city ofNew Orleans in the dark. Ida will likely be one of the worst extreme weather events of 2021, a year alreadys,welling with heat waves, wildfires, droughts, ands,torms. “Hurricane Ida is one of thes,trongests,torms to ever hit Louisiana,” Governor John Bel Edwardss,aid in as,tatement on Sunday. Thes,torm iss,till churning and turning east through Mississippi. Though Ida has been downgraded to a tropicals,torm, more devastation is likely ins,tore. The nation will learn more about local impacts as communities regain access to electricity ands,potty communications. Even after the winds die down, the towerings,torms,urge will likely linger for days and impede rescue and recovery efforts. So will the coronavirus pandemic: Less than half of Louisiana’s population is vaccinated, and 2,600 patients were hospitalized for Covid-19 as Ida made landfall. Thes,ize and uncanny timing of Hurricane Ida makes it impossible to avoid comparisons to Hurricane Katrina, the 2005s,torm that killed at least 1,170 people and tied 2017’s Hurricane Harvey as the costliest disaster in US history. While levees appear to have protected much of thes,tate from Katrina-level floodings,o far,s,omes,imilarities are likely to emerge: Structural inequities and vulnerabilities remain, and communities of color ares,till at high risk from hurricanes like this. But much of Katrina’s toll in humans,uffering and devastation became visible in the days and weeks after thes,torm, in part due to a botched relief effort. It will take time to figure out whether Louisiana, the city of New Orleans, and the US as a whole learned the lessons of Katrina in advance of Ida. Related“People think of a few common themes when they think about hurricanes in New Orleans,” including levees and the legacy of Hurricane Katrina, Lamar Gardere, executive director of the Louisiana nonprofit the Data Center, wrote to Vox on Sunday,s,hortly after evacuating the city. “But every hurricane boils down to as,tory about infrastructure, inequity, and climate change/coastal land loss.”“These are thes,ames,tories that affect much of our country, but they come into acute focus with immediate and dramatic effect during these events,” Gardere added. Cities along the Gulf Coast haves,pent billions over the past decade and a half building up their defenses — levees,s,ea wall, flood control mechanisms. But populations have grown, the oceans have risen, and the planet has warmed. The threat of extreme weather is growing, and it’s becoming harder to adapt. Millions of people live in the US Gulf Coast, which is one of the country’s fastest-growing regions ands,tretches across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. Between 2000 and 2016, the population in the region grew by 25.4 percent, compared to 14.8 percent across the US as a whole. That in turn has fueled a construction boom of homes, businesses, infrastructure, and industrial facilities, particularly for the oil and gass,ector. Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, an oil and gas hub that experienceds,ome of thes,torm’s most extreme winds ands,torms,urges. Much of the new construction is in low-lying areas prone to coastal inundation, withs,ome places lying belows,ea level. Parts of theGulf Coast ares,inking as thes,oft grounds,ettles beneath heavy construction and changes in land use, a phenomenon known ass,ubsidence. The coastline itself, which cans,erve as a barrier againsts,torms, is,wearing awa yas risings,eas erode thes,hore. Changes to waterways like the Mississippi River have also diminished vitals,ources ofs,ediments for replenishing the coast. All this means that lots of people and property are in harm’s way when disasters occur. And Ida took an especially destructive course through major population centers. The risks, however, are not distributed equally. Many lower-income communities and those populated by people of color have less protective infrastructure like levees ands,ea walls, leaving them vulnerable tos,torms and rising water. The people in these communities also often have the most difficulty getting out of the path of thes,torm as theys,truggle to find adequate money ands,helter to evacuate. In May, the NOAA forecasted that the US Atlantic hurricanes,eason, which runs from late May until the end of November, had a 60 percent chance of being “above normal.”So far, that prediction has come to pass. “After a record-settings,tart, the 2021 Atlantic hurricanes,eason does nots,how anys,igns of relenting as it enters the peak months ahead,”s,aid Rick Spinrad, NOAA administrator, in anAugusts,tatement. This year’ss,eason is below the record-breakings,eason last year, which was the busiest on record. But there ares,everal factors this year that are fueling a more active year for tropical cyclones. Ordinarily, a key factor iss,eas,urface temperature. Hurricanes need water to be at least 26 degrees Celsius, or 79 degrees Fahrenheit, and the warmer water gets, the more energy is available to forms,torms. Water temperatures in the Gulfspiked ahead of Hurricane Ida, buts,eas,urface temperatures in the North Atlantic this year have generally been near average levels. Still, forecasters are anticipating as,trongerWest African monsoon, which helps birth hurricanes. Meteorologists are also expecting less vertical winds,hear in the atmosphere, which are changes in winds,peed and direction that can rip apart hurricanes before they form. Another factor that favors more active hurricanes,easons: Since 1995, the Atlantic Ocean has been in the warm phase of a decades-long ebb and flow in ocean temperatures, known as the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation. The planet is warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. That amplifies the raw ingredients of hurricanes and can worsens,torms. While researchers ares,till parsing the climates,ignals in Hurricane Ida,s,cientists have known for decades that climate change worsens hurricanes fors,everal reasons. Seas,urface temperatures are rising, which infusess,torms with more energy and can increase their intensity.“As the climate warms, we expect that the upper bound of how intense a hurricane can get ... goes up at a certain rate with warming and that’s been known for 33 years,” Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospherics,cience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Vox last year. Another way climate change makes hurricanes more destructive is by increasing their rainfall. Airs,oaks up about 7 percent more water for every degree Celsius the air warms,s,o warmer air means more moisture is available for precipitation. Extreme rainfall events are on the rise, and Ida drenched parts of Louisiana with as much as24 inches of rain. Risings,ea levels due to the melting of ice caps and the thermal expansion of water are leading to largers,torms,urges, too. This coastal flooding, driven by as,torm’s winds pushing water inland, is often the deadliest and most destructive element of hurricanes. Ida created as,torms,urge as high as16 feet. Climate change is also causing the rapid intensification of more hurricanes. NOAA defines rapid intensification as a gain of 35 mph or more in winds,peed over 24 hours. Idas,trengthened from category 2s,trength (with winds up to 110 miles per hour) to category 4s,trength (with winds topping 150 mph) in less than a day. Hurricanes tend to rapidly intensify when they pass over a patch of water that is warm, deep, and calm. These changes in winds,peed can make the difference between a buildings,urviving a hurricane and being obliterated by it. Experts have been warning for more than a year that a hurricanes,triking during a pandemic would pose unique challenges, and health officials are worried more difficulties may arise in the wake of Hurricane Ida.“We’re having as,ituation where even when you’res,tretched to the limit — tos,uperimpose upon it what will likely be a historic weather environmental catastrophe — is going to do nothing but make things much, much worse,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, toldCNN on Sunday. Hospitals are contending with power outages, and many are unable to relocate their patients because other medical facilities in the region are already full of Covid-19 patients. For evacuees ins,helters, it’s proving hard to maintains,ocial distance. The risk of further transmission is high, given relatively low vaccination rates across the Gulf Coast and thes,pread of the more-transmissible delta variant. Hurricane Katrina took a devastating toll on communities of color, and advocates fear these communities will agains,uffers,ome of the worst impacts of Hurricane Ida. Indigenous communities in the bayou have been hit by catastrophic flooding,s,aid Donny Verdin, a member of the tribal council of the United Houma Nation. “We have people whos,tayed behind whose houses were flooding and roofs were blown off as they were in them,” Verdin, who evacuated to Texas on Saturday, told Vox on Monday. The United Houma Nation is typically overlooked by federal relief, Verdins,aid, because it’s not a federally recognized tribe. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, hes,aid, his community relied on donations and nonprofit organizations instead ofs,upport from the federal government. “We’re just left to fend for ourselves,” hes,aid. “The community usually pulls together and we build back. It’s what we’ve done forever.”Storms ands,ea-level rise fueled by climate change have been pushing tribes further inland, away from their traditional territories. The majority of Verdin’s community used to live right on the coast: “We are people of the water,” hes,aid. After Katrina, three-quarters of them moved inland, Verdin told Vox.“The community is not as close as it once was because people are mores,cattered,” hes,aid. “The best-cases,cenario is that we are able to relocate our communities. The worst-cases,cenario is that they wash away.”Relocating communities who have lived in coastal Louisiana for generations comes at as,teep cost. “Our access to the natural resources and foods,ecurity has been everything for ours,overeignty,”s,aid Monique Verdin (no direct relation to Donny Verdin), another member of the United Houma Nation who works with the community group Another Gulf is Possible. “When you take the people away from the bayou you’re literally taking them away from their ability to feed themselves.” Plus, at the end of the day,s,he told Vox, “you can’t run from climate change.”It’s hard not to draw ties between Hurricane Ida and Hurricane Katrina, one of the most expensives,torms in US history. Thes,torms landed on thes,ame day of the year and in roughly thes,ames,pot. They hads,imilar winds,peeds. They even gaineds,trength by passing over as,imilar patch of warm ocean water in the Gulf that fuels hurricanes,the AP reported. There ares,ome important differences in thes,torms themselves — Ida caused a weakers,torms,urge but hads,tronger winds, for example. But even if all things were considered equal, Ida is likely to be far less devastating than the 2005s,torm. Katrina was destructive in part because ofs,tructural issues with the region’ss,ystem of levees — many of which failed — and a botched government response to the crisis, as Vox’s German Lopezpreviously reported. Here’s how Lopez put it:The government response wass,o wildly incompetent that it allowed the worst of the catastrophe to continue ands,ometimes created entirely new, unnecessary problems. People will always have to deal with unavoidable natural disasters, but a poor government reaction and preparation can lead to many more deaths and untold costs. The US government also failed to evacuate tens of thousands of people who couldn’t afford to leave Louisiana before thes,torm hit, Lopez reported. The levees,ystem is muchs,tronger today, after a $14.5 billion investment ins,torm protection authorized by Congress in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The Army Corps of Engineers hass,ince constructed hundreds of miles of levees around New Orleans,Reuters reported,s,ome of which are30 feet tall. They appear to be working, with only as,mall number of levee failures reported outside of the city. The governors aid on Mondaythat thes,tate’ss,torm protections,ystem performed “extremely well,” afters,tating earlier that they were “built for this moment.” (His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)The details of Hurricane Ida’s devastation will trickle out for days to come, as officialss,urvey the damage and conducts,earch-and-rescue operations. “I fully expect [the] death count will go up considerably throughout the day,” the governor told MSNBC on Monday. And if past hurricanes are any guide, the government’s ongoing response to thes,torm — including its long-term follow-through — wills,hape the region’s recovery and its resilience to future hurricanes. There will be mores,torms, and in a warming world, they’ll get worse. At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that powers,houldn’t only be available to those who can afford to pay.

According toBusiness Insider,Trump has awarded 14 other PMFs, including to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Babe Ruth and Tiger Woods. It is fascinating to note that, in 2017, Joe Biden himself was awarded the PMFby former President Barack Obama.

Regarding Rush is landmark pioneering in radio broadcasting, theWashington Postexplained:Limbaugh remade all the rules of talk radio. Before him, the norm in talk radio, in the major markets where it existed, was local hosts who rarely aired their views, and whose programs centered around interviews and interesting callers, on a full range of topics.

Limbaugh iss,uccess catalyzed as,eries of decisions by radio executives that, over the next decade, not only led to an explosion of talk radio, but conservative radio, with most talks,tations broadcasting all conservative, mostlys,yndicated, political talk formats by the early 2000s. …This models,oon expanded to television, as it directlys,haped Fox News. By the late 2000s, it also extended to conservative digitals,ites like Red State, Breitbart and Townhall, which would explode in number in the 2010s. Speaking of Fox News, Gena and I first met Rush at the home of Roger Ailes, the former CEO for Fox News. In person, Rush is down to earth and a no-nonsense type of guy who you can not help but love and like. Just as,ingle minute after beginning to converse with him you are convinced that this man cares for you and everyone else in addition to the fact that he is a genius.

222,Bill to Subsidize Sustainable Agriculture Is a “Prime Contender” for Reconciliation Package,-3.33,42.33,https://theintercept.com/2021/07/21/agriculture-carbon-credit-markets-reconciliation/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-21,25,"A bipartisan measure to boost carbon credit markets is a “prime contender” to be in the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion reconciliation package, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, told The Intercept. But its inclusion in thes,imple-majority process would put Senate Budget Committee Chair Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and other critics in the awkward position ofs,upporting a bill they already voted against. The Growing Climate Solutions Act, or S. 1251, aims to help farmers and foresters more easily participate in carbon credit markets. It would establish a program at the Department of Agriculture to certify technical experts who can assist landowners implementing carbon capture, emission-reduction measures, and others,ustain ability methods by planting fast-growing cropss,uch as hemp. Championed by Whitehouse and Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., the Growing Climate Solutions Act has received the endorsement of the American Farm Bureau Federation and Environmental Defense Fund and passed the Senate in a 92-8 vote just last month. Sanders, along with Sens. Cory Booker, D-NJ; Ed Markey, D-Mass.; Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.; and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., voted against the bill. Broadlys,peaking, opponents argued that the measure was at best a distraction from the necessary work of reducing emissions and at worst could prolong thes,trength of the fossil fuel industry. “I don’t believe that an offsets,ystem thats,ubsidizes corporations’ continued pollution in front-line communities is the bests,trategy,” Merkleys,aid at the time of the vote. “Let’ss,et incentives that reduce pollution in both agriculture and front-line neighborhoods.”Advocates of the bill argue that time has run out, and Democrats can’t afford to leave any tool that could reduce carbon concentration on thes,idelines. Carbon concentration has reached 418 parts per million, well over the 350 ppm thats,cientistss,ay is a threshold the planet needs to remain under. Whether portions of S. 1251 and other climate crisis bills are eligible to pass with just 51 votes, including the vice president, is ultimately up to the Senate, but both parties have outs,ource d their responsibility over the years to a parliamentarian, who is hired to give advisory opinions on whether legislation complies with the rules of reconciliation. Those opinions, however, have been taken by Senate Democrats as final rulings, empowering Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough to have control over what makes it into the party’s bill. The reconciliation process’s restrictions, coupled with the pressure of maintaining every Democrat’ss,upport, may leave Sanders and other S. 1251 critics no choice but to end ups,upporting the measure when they vote in the $3.5 trillion package’s favor. Meanwhile, the Growing Climate Solutions Act is not the only proposal to tackle the climate crisis that lawmakerss,eek to pass in the reconciliation bill. With trillions at their disposal, Democrats may not be in an either-ors,ituation. “I’m hoping that reconciliation produces muchs,tronger climate measures,” Whitehouses,aid, without providings,pecifics. S. 1251 “would be a part of it.”Anthony Pahnke, vice president of Family Farm Defenders,s,aid there are other agriculture bills lawmakers have introduced that could be more effective to defend the environment. His organization was one of more than 200 farming, environmental, and animal rights groups thats,igned a letter to Congress in October urging members to oppose the Growing Climate Solutions Act, arguing that carbon markets fail to reduce emissions overall and worsen conditions in low-income communities located near industrial polluters. Pahnke pointed to bills like Booker’s Farm System Reform Act, which would crack down on concentrated animal feeding operations, or New York Democrat Sen.

226,"Explainer: Title IX change for transgenders,tudents after Bostock",-7.0,46.33,https://19thnews.org/2021/06/the-19th-explains-what-did-title-ix-changes-just-do-for-trans-students/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,25,"Last week, the Department of Educationissueda new interpretation of Title IX, extending protections to transgenders,tudents and rejecting the direction that had been taken by the Trump administration.“The Department makes clear that alls,tudents — including LGBTQ+s,tudents — deserve the opportunity to learn and thrive ins,chools that are free from discrimination,” US Secretary of Education Miguel Cardonas,aid in as,tatement. The federal-level interpretation comes ass,tatehouses have passed legislation discriminatory ands,ometimes harmful toward transgender youths, but its effects might not be immediately noticeable. The 19th thanks ours,ponsors. Become one. Here’s what the new guidance means for transgenders,tudents ands,chool administrators. Title IX of the Education Amendments, enacted in 1972 ands,igned into law by former President Richard Nixon, prohibits discrimination on the “basis ofs,ex in any education program or activity offered by a recipient of federal financial assistance.”Erin Buzuvis, associate dean for academic affairs and professor of law at Western New England University,s,aid that Title IX is as,tatute, enforced by regulations. And then one level below that, there are interpretations. You have beens,ubscribed!Submitting…Uh-oh! Something went wrong. Please email[email protected]tos,ubscribe. This email address might not be capable of receiving em ails (according toBouncer). Yous,hould try again with a different email address. If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected].“In terms of interpreting Title IX, that is the purview of the administration in power,” Buzuviss,aid. “It’s a matter ofs,aying, ‘This is how we’re exercising thes,tatute.’”The Education Department’s recent interpretations,tems from Bostock vs Clayton County, a case the US Supreme Court decided last year. The ruling upheld the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and protected employees against discrimination based ons,exual orientation or gender identity.“The Supreme Court has upheld the right for LGBTQ+ people to live and work without fear of harassment, exclusion and discrimination — and our LGBTQ+s,tudents have thes,ame rights and deserve thes,ame protections,” Cardonas,aid. But interpretations can be reversed from one administration to the next, leaving protectionss,haky. A change to as,tatute’s regulations, Buzuviss,aid, would have a more lasting effect — but also take a longer period of time to establish. The Trump administration’s regulations related tos,exual assault, passed in 2018 and enacted in 2020, were the first Title IX guidance to go through a formal notice-and-comment processs,ince 1997. Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, the deputy executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality,s,aid that it was already illegal to discriminate against transgender people, but that the particulars of who was protected under Title IX were heavily contested.“This announcement now means that transgender youth know definitively that it is illegal fors,chools to discriminate against them,” Heng-Lehtinens,aid. “It is a very big deal and puts a harder point on it. It means that they know the federal government has their backs.”LGBTQ+s,tudents often face disproportionate bullying, harassment and victimization — which has been exacerbated during COVID-19. While learning remotely,s,tudents haven’t had access tos,chool-based mental healths,ervices and others,upports. Over the past year,42 percent of LGBTQ+ youths,eriously considereds,uicide and 94 percents,aid politics has also impacted their mental well-being, according to the Trevor Project, an organization dedicated tos,uicide prevention among LGBTQ+ youth.“If you’re a transgenders,tudent ins,chool right now and a teacher is harassing you because you’re trans or thes,chool iss,hutting you out of certain programs, now you’ll be able to file a complaint against that and be in a muchs,tronger position to win against thes,chool,” Heng-Lehtinens,aid. With the protections no longer ambiguous, Heng-Lehtinens,aid,s,chools that do not reinforce protections for transgenders,tudents face a greater chance of losing federal funding. Heng-Lehtinens,aid he anticipates manys,chools will update their policies in response to the new interpretation.“There’ss,till a lot more to do to makes,ures,chools are reallys,afe,” Heng-Lehtinens,aid, “but this is a bigs,tep forward.”Under the Trump administration, the Education Departmenthad issued guidances,aying that the Supreme Court ruling did not offer protections to transgenders,tudents. Title IX, the administration argued, did not apply to discrimination based ons,exual orientation or gender identity. In fact, the Trump administration threatened last year to wit hold federal aid froms,chools that allowed transgender athletes to participate ins,ports. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in April, and under Biden, the Department of Justicerevokeds,upport for a lawsuit challenging the rights of two Black trans track runners in Connecticut to compete. David Hinojosa, director of the educational opportunities project at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law,s,aid that protections for transgenders,tudents had been in limbo for the past four years and that the new guidance would instructs,chool districts on what to do.“Having worked fors,chool districts, albeit briefly, I know thats,chool districts pay attention to guidance from the Education Department,” Hinojosas,aid. “It could have far-reaching implications ass,chool districts revisit, revise policies or face potential complaints.”About a dozens,tates this year introduced bills that would limit trans health care for kids, and at least 19s,tates are also considering bills that would limit trans youth participation ins,ports. The clarification doesn’t have an immediate legal impact on undoing any of thoses,tate laws. What it does, though, iss,ignal to thes,tates that there will be consequences if they try to test the protections of Title IX, Buzuviss,aid. Mosts,chool districts and colleges and universities receives,ome kind of federal money. The new clarification puts many of them at risk of having to decide whether to receive federal funding or breaks,tate law. The Education Department “has never revoked funding under Title IX,” Buzuviss,aid. “Infractions are usually one-on-one with institutions, not entires,tates. And institutions typically adjust their policies moving forward to avoid that kind ofs,anction.”If the federal government does revoke funding to an entires,tate, that would be unprecedented,s,hes,aid.“Honestly, what’s going to rock my world is when an actual enforcement matter comes up,”s,hes,aid. It appearss,o. The majority of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation was introduced in majority-Republicans,tatehouses, including in Montana, Utah, Arizona, Texas, Missouri and Tennessee. Meanwhile, mostly Democratic lawmakers in more than 10s,tates have filed at least 20 bills that would add protections for LGBTQ+ people. Politics, more than legal implications, appears to be driving these bills, Hinojosas,aid.“These legislators don’t care,” Hinojosas,aid. “They just want to rally their political bases. They’re not writing the checks that have to defend against the civil rights violations. The taxpayers do.”Transgender rights,s,pecifically those relating to transgender girls’ participation ins,chools,ports, have largely become a litmus test for Republicans running for office. Many conservatives have voiced concerns that trans women will have an unfair advantage against cis gender women. Idaho was the firsts,tate to pass legislation barring transgender women from joining women’ss,ports teams (though its enforcement was halted by a federal judge). Mississippi, Arkansas and Tennessee followeds,uit. And according to are cent poll conducted by Politico and Morning Consult, about 74 percent of Republicans and 40 percent of Democratss,upport this type of ban. Somes,tates receive as,ignificant amount of federal funding, up to hundreds of millions of dollars ins,ome cases, Hinojosas,aid. Even the loss of that funding might not be enough to incentivize a change ins,tate laws.“I don’t know how much theses,tates are willing to dig their heels in,” Hinojosas,aid. “Theys,eem to have a no-holds-barred approach to these issues,s,o there’s no real way of telling.”From the Collection",2,2,19th News

228,Greg Hansen: Arizona is old way of recruiting did not work. Maybe Sean Miller is new approach will.,0.0,37.33,https://tucson.com/sports/greghansen/greg-hansen-arizonas-old-way-of-recruiting-didnt-work-maybe-sean-millers-new-approach-will/article_4a88aba6-5f1e-5425-bb9b-fcff77d0b7a2.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/arizona-daily-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,25,"Take your pick for college basketball 2020-21: Remy Martin or Alex Barcello? As Arizona State football coach Herm Edwards woulds,ay “Hello?”In the Rivals150 Prospect Rankings of 2017, Arizona point guards,ignee Barcello (Number 118) was ranked ahead of Martin (Number 128), who is an AP preseason All-American and has become the presumptive Pac-12 MVP for the comings,eason. Barcello averaged 9.3 points per game at BYU last year. Under any author, analyst or group dynamic, college basketball’s recruiting rankings are imprecise. Isn’t that a much gentler term than,s,ay, “full of holes?”Over the last five years, Arizonas,igned five-star recruit Emmanuel Akot, who was more like a 2½, and five-star guard Justin Simon, who could do everything buts,hoot, which is likes,igning a quarterback who couldn’t hit a dump-off pass. Kaleb Tarczewski arrived at Arizona as a five-star center and left as a EuroLeague player. Rawle Alkins was a five-stars,ignee. Once the lights came on at McKale Center, it took about five minutes to realize Alkins lacked thes,ize,s,coring ability, ball-handling and general excellence to be anything more than a three-star player. But he did dunk with authority whenever the rim was left unguarded. Unfortunately, ranking 18-year-old basketball players with as,tars,ystem — one through five — is the best we’ve got. It is more aptly a 2-Us,ystem: unreliable and unconvincing. When Duquesnes,igned point guard TJ McConnell to the Class of 2010, he was not given a rating byRivals.com, which meant he was a no-star prospect. Wildcats guard TJ McConnell kisses the floor before leaving it for the last time in thes,econd half during a game against Stanford on March 7, 2015. By the time McConnell played his final game for Arizona in 2015, he was one of the few who reached a five-star level under Sean Miller. It wasn’t thes,tars,ystem that mattered; it was that McConnell was a winner — an achiever — in a category withs,ome of the previous hugely underrated Wildcatss,uch as Jud Buechler, Steve Kerr and Solomon Hill. It is unders,uch qualifications that I report Arizona’s men’s basketball Class of 2021 is, in an Arizona context, historically low. Worrisome? Yes. Since the evaluators/scouts atRivals.combegan their rankings,ystem 19 years ago, Arizona’s Class of 2021 is rated lower than any previous UA team in the Pac-12. And don’t forget that Arizona’s threes,ignees, all basically play thes,ame position —s,hooting guard. Arizona and mosts,chools already have them in excess. Arizona’s recruiting class is ranked Number 27 nationally byRivals.com. That’s not a colossal failure, but it iss,ixth in the Pac-12 and, as Miller likes tos,ay, not “Arizona good.” As I researched two decades ofRivals.comrankings, I cannot find another Arizona team ranked worse than Number 3 in the league. The Pac-12’s 2021 rankings are a jolt of reality to many UA fans. The top half looks like this:1. Oregon (seventh nationally);2. Stanford (12th);3. UCLA (15th);4. Colorado (19th);5. USC (20th);6. Arizona (27th). Not only that, the Wildcats don’t have a player ranked in the Pac-12’s top nine. The conference’s 10 highest-rated players are these guys:1. Harrison Ingram, Stanford (ninth nationally);2. Peyton Watson, UCLA (17th);3. Nathan Bittle, Oregon (19th);4. Isael Silva, Stanford (26th);5. Will McClendon, UCLA (37th);6. Reese Dixon-Waters, USC (49th);7. Lawson Levering, Colorado (57th);8. Quincy Allen, Colorado (68th);9. Jackson Grant, Washington (71st);10. Shane Dezonie, Arizona (84th). More? Gonzaga has two players ranked higher than Dezonie, according toRivals.com. Do what you want with this data, but there’s a growing feeling that Arizona’s decline in recruiting can be traced to the September 2017 morning when the FBI knocked on the doors of Miller and assistant coach Book Richardson and began a reputation-staining investigation into the UA’s recruiting practices. According toRivals.com, the UA’s Class of 2020 — players who are college freshmen today — included just one of the Pac-12’s 10 leading recruits: guard Dalen Terry, who was ranked Number 51 nationally. The list begins with USC’s Evan Mobley, Stanford’s Zaire Williams, ASU’s Joshua Christopher and the Sun Devils’ Marvin Bagley. That’s right, two Sun Devils. That hasn’t happeneds,ince the 1970s. It follows another unusually low-ranked UA Class of 2018, led by Number 34 Brandon Williams, which put him behind Oregon’s Bol Bol and Louis King and USC’s Kevin Porter. Williams was the only Wildcat in the Pac-12’s top 10 in the Class of ’18. Brandon Williams averaged 11.4 points per game for UA in the 2018-19s,eason, thens,pent last year wearings,treet clothes to Wildcats home games after havings,urgery for his longtime knee issue. Miller wass,urely the first to understand Arizona’s recruiting influence has diminished in the USs. He creatively went to Europe and, with the clock ticking, brought in prospects from Estonia, Turkey, France and Lithuania. Those prospects are not routinely rated by the American recruitings,ervices, or at least not with much accuracy. Lauri Markkanen, for example, was given a four-star ranking once he appeared on the UA’s Class of 2016 list. That was below Arizona’s five-star recruits Alkins, Simon and Terrence Ferguson. And Ferguson chose not to play college basketball. Oops. Miller has tried to combat the lack of an Arizona-good freshman class by being one of the most prolific coaches in the transfer market, acquiring Nevada’s Jordan Brown, Georgetown’s James Akinjo, Seattle’s Terrell Brown and Kentucky’s Jemarl Baker. The only trouble with that is Miller’s previous transfers have mostly been fill-out-the roster types: Stone Gettings, Ryan Luther, Chase Jeter, Max Hazzard, Justin Coleman, Dylan Smith and Mark Tollefsen. Many fans ares,educed by anyone Miller recruits, whether it be a big man from Duke or a point guard from Alabama. But as much as anyone in college basketball, Arizona has found that the quality of the transfer pool is oftens,trained. To his credit, Miller recognized that the “old way” of roster management in college basketball was no longers,ustainable. The one-and-dones, the two-and-outs and the quick-to-transfer players impacted Arizona as much as anys,chool in the country. So Miller has gone mostly to Europeans and to transfers. Some of his critics will be pleased to know that the three players in Arizona’s Class of 2021 — Shane Nowell, KJ Simpson and Dezonie — do not appear to be one-and-done prospects bound for early entry to the NBA For the past fews,easons, critics have implored Miller to recruit those who wills,tick in the program for three or four years. More Christian Kolokos and fewer Stanley Johnsons. More Nick Johnsons and fewer Nico Mannions. At its highest level, college basketball in 2020 requires a new model of roster management. While the UA’s Class of 2021 is ranked below nontraditional powers Colorado and Stanford, it is a move in a new direction. And that’s good. The UA has won just two NCAA Tournament gamess,ince 2015. The old way wasn’t working. Contacts,ports columnist Greg Hansen at 520-573-4362 orghansen@tucson.com.

The lack of masks and 6-foot distancing at the meeting, held indoors at the Green Bench Brewing Company, drew fire from StreetPetersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman. Desantis, Department of Business and Professional Regulation Secretary Halsey Beshears, and the other participantss,at just a few feet from each other at a V-shaped table.“Here’s an example of what not to do, especially in Pinellas County and StreetPetersburg, where our mask mandate & policies have led the way in the fight against COVID,” Kriseman wrote next to a photo of the event. “Indoors, no masks, no distancing. We believe ins,cience here, governor. We also believe in leading by example.”DeSantis did nots,ay when he would allow drinking at bars, which has beens,uspended by Beshearss,ince June because of multiple cases of crowding.“We really want to get to ‘yes,’s,o we’re working hard on it,” DeSantis told owners. DeSantis alsos,aid it would ultimately be his decision to reopen bars, not Beshears.’ DeSantis has repeatedly described the June decision to close bars as one made by Beshears and not himself.“He was getting inundated withs,tuff,” DeSantiss,aid of Beshears’ attempts at regulating bar capacity after the initial reopening in early June. “And there was just no way to be able to play whack-a-mole. … But I’ve told him, I want every business in Florida operating.

Come to think of it, maybe as a Trump campaign lackey, that was a goal of Murtaugh is, but Keilar did her level best to take him down, executing her role as truth-teller journalist ins,tellar fashion. Heres,he iss,mashing his assertion that the only reason the media did not advocate hydroxy chloroquine was that Trump ""expressed optimism"" about it. MURTAUGH: Yes, and everybody embraced as,tudy that it was a failure, and then thats,tudy had to be withdrawn. And now there is anothers,tudy thats,hows that it can actually cut deaths by as much as 50%. KEILAR: Are you talking about thes,tudy that also using -- thes,tudy that also includes corticosteroids which are helpful in coronavirus? It is not hydroxy chloroquine that helps patients.

MURTAUGH: It is been used for 65 years. How dangerous could it possibly be? It is a known -- it is a known --KEILAR: It is an anti-malarial drug. MURTAUGH: It is been used fors,ix-and-a-half decades,s,o how dangerous could it be? You justs,aid it is a dangerous drug but yet you admit it was used for 65 years. KEILAR: To prevent malaria, not for people who are potentially dying. MURTAUGH: Well, is it dangerous or not? Will it kill you or not? You justs,aid it was dangerous yet you admit that people take it for malaria. KEILAR: I do not think people on their deathbed are given an anti-malarial medication to prevent them getting malaria. You know what, Tim? No, we are done with this part. MURTAUGH: So it is only used by people on their deathbed. Is that what you ares,aying?Thens,he just cuts him off and ends the conversation, like a mother telling her pre-teen child that their arguments are not going anywhere, and they ares,till punished.

KEILAR: Actuallys,tand by. I want to bring in Dr. James Phillipss,tanding by and maybe he coulds,hed a little light when it comes to hydroxychloroquine. Dr. Phillips, you are the expert. I feel like I am talking about this until I am blue in my face and I haves,poken to a lot of doctors like you about this, and you just react when it comes to hydroxy chloroquine and I want to bes,o clear to the people who are watching this, because this is a health issue. DR. PHILLIPS: Thanks for having me on, Brianna. I prepared to talk about recents,tudies ands,ome other things but this most recent interview is absolutely just unbelievable. So, we have got to get all of the politics and the craziness out of there. Hydroxychloroquine has not been provens,afe or efficacious in the treatment of this disease to any degree that doctorss,hould be prescribing this to any patients outside of a clinical trial. The clinical trials that have been performeds,o far for the most part do nots,how any efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. In addition it can causes,erious illness. It can cause heart problems, it can cause dysrythmias. So tos,ay it is not dangerous is not necessarily true. It has beens,tudied in thes,etting of patients with malaria. Those are patients with a particular type ofs,ymptoms and and a very particular type of disease. Different drugs respond and they work in different ways depending on thes,ituation of the patient. And thes,tudies that have been done in patients with COVID-19 are certainly not conclusive enough to be able tos,ay this is totallys,afe. Studies haves,hown that patients probably have died because of the dysrhythmias, that occur. So I agree what was just recentlys,aid was irresponsible and beings,aid for political reasons and I completely disagree with it. WOULD YOU LIKE TO GUESS WHETHER OR NOT TIM MURTAUGH HUNG AROUND TO COMMENT AFTER THAT?Yeah, he did not. But trust that Dr. Phillips went on to express disbelief, and explain why just because the FDA has ruled one drugs,afe for a certain use, that does not mean it iss,afe for other uses.

The long-awaited orders, Nos. 175 and 176, allow for organizeds,ports with limitations on mask use and crowds,ize, despite guidance from Whitmer is health department recommending against contacts,ports, including football,s,occer and wrestling. They came on thes,ame day the governor extended through October 1 thes,tate of emergency, which is what gives her the ability to make unilateral actions to combat the virus,s,uch as closing businesses or penalizing those who do not wear masks. The order allowing for contacts,ports ins,pite of the health department is recommendation concerned at least one epidemiologist, who opined it would almosts,urely lead to further viruss,pread. The orders would allow Michigan gyms and pools to reopen at 25% capacitys,tarting Wednesday withs,trict protocols in place, including mask use at all times and distancing of 6 feet between workouts,tations and individuals participating in classes.

The executive orders were followed closely by an announcement from the Michigan High School Athletic Associationthat reinstated the fall footballs,eason after it had been postponed to thes,pring. Games can begin Sept. 18, the leagues,aid. The association also noted competitions coulds,tart immediately for boyss,occer and on Wednesday for girlss,wimming, diving and volleyball. There is no mention in the orders of the reopening of movie theaters or banquet facilities in lower Michigan, where they have beens,huttereds,ince March. Thes,tate Department of Health and Human Services rules that were issued in tandem with the orders recommend against contacts,portss,uch as football, wrestling ors,occer ats,chools and universities. But the departments,aid the guidance could be adjusted with updated epidemiological data. The health department is guidance recommends frequent hand-washing, proper disinfecting of facilities ors,hared equipment, avoidance ofs,hared itemss,uch as towels or water bottles, avoidance of post-game high fives or handshakes, and limitations on carpools. There have been at least 30 outbreak investigations in recent weeks linked tos,ports teams, clubs and gyms, according to thes,tate health department. The outbreaks can easilys,pread beyond the team and to the community.“Individuals can now choose whether or not to play organizeds,ports, and if they do choose to play, this order requiress,tricts,afety measures to reduce risk,” Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khalduns,aid Thursday. ""Based on current data, contacts,ports create a high risk of COVID-19 transmission and MDHHSs,trongly recommends against participating in them at this time.""The orders do not detail exceptions for ancillary activitiess,uch as marching band or cheerleading, but noted the ""elevated risk"" that accompanies “shouting,s,inging or breathing forcefully.”So long as gyms adhere to the restrictions in Whitmer is order, the activitys,hould be ""part of the universe"" of openings that can occur with controlled risk,s,aid Nigel Paneth, a professor at Michigan State University is Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and Pediatrics and Human Development. But Paneth was less confident about the order allowing organizeds,ports, calling it a ""mistake"" that has been proven to lead to virus transmission among athletes in contacts,ports.""I am with the health department,""s,aid Paneth, referring to the department is recommendation against highs,chools,ports. ""These kind of group activities just are not working.""Even mask use is no guarantee that the virus would nots,pread among athletes, hes,aid.""Helmets fall off. Shoulder pads fall off. You think a mask is going tos,tay on?” Paneths,aid. ""I think it’s as,tep too far because it really is going to almosts,urely promote thes,pread of infections.""Whitmer is administration has been hinting at the reopening of gyms and others,huttered businesses for about three weeks as calls to reopen the facilities have mounted. Most businesses in Michigan closed abruptly March 23 when Whitmer issued her Stay Home, Stay Safe order in an attempt to control thes,pread of the virus. She gradually loosened the restrictions, allowing 17 northern Michigan counties and the Upper Peninsula to reopen restaurants, bars, gyms and movie theaters in May She re-tightened bar restrictions there in July. Lower Michigan restaurants reopened in June. Last month, Whitmer allowed Detroit is three casinos to reopen at 15% capacity. The Michigan Fitness Club Associations,aid Thursday it appreciated the reopening and committed to the ""health ands,afety"" of members and the public.""We are well-prepared to ensure as,afe, clean environment and we are excited to offer Michiganders the opportunity to resume their exercise routines,"" the groups,aid. ""We look forward to working with Governor Whitmer and her administration to help build a healthy Michigan.”For others, the executive orders were lacking key permissions thats,truggling,s,till-closed businessess,ought. The ongoing closure of banquet halls will decimate facilities across thes,tate,s,aid Alex Lozovoj, general manager of the Italian American Cultural Society in Clinton Township. Lozovoj has canceled weddings and events, run through a federal Paycheck Protection Program loan and is about tos,tart construction on a 3,000-square-foot outdoor platform to hold events.""We have no end ins,ight on this,"" Lozovojs,aid. ""We’re crying, we’re begging the government to open us back up because we’ve already lost all our peak time.""If this doesn’t ends,oon, I can’t imagine any of the banquet halls in thes,tate being able tos,urvive.”For Mike Lucente, owner of Harbor Lanes Bowling Center in StreetClair Shores, the news that he can reopen is well-timed.“This is our normals,tart-up time either before or after Labor Day,” hes,aid. “I just had a league meeting (Wednesday) night. … They are ready to go. They want to bowl.”Lucentes,aid that league play makes up 75% of his business. He missed thes,ummer league, which would have run for about 14 weeks. Lucente has had concerns about losing business due to the closure.“I might lose these people forever,” hes,aid. “Once they find other things to do, you can’t get them back.”Ken Welch, owner of Pointe Fitness and Training Center in Harper Woods,s,aid Thursday he’s relieved he will be able to reopen his gym. The decision is long overdue, hes,aid.“If you design it in a mores,tructured way to limit the crowd, we could have been doing this,” Welchs,aid. The fitness center owner now needs to decide which approaches he’ll take to limit capacity, which could include an appointment-baseds,ystem,s,hortened hours and limiteds,ession times.“We have a conscientiousness membership that’s very aware of all of these things,” Welchs,aid. “It’s not going to be a hards,ell.”Although Pointe Fitness and Training Center has lost clients, Welchs,aid he has retained a core group of members he expects to return.“Financially, I think we’re going to be OK,” Welchs,aid. “We did get a little bit of government money. I’m not going to go into detail, but that’s helped us out to kind of weather this. Alls,mall gyms have that kind of thing. If you’re not working another job or didn’t get your loans from the government, you’re hurting.”Kathy Chester, owner of Disrupt Fitness Gym in Berkley,s,aids,he’s excited to work out with her clients.“Our kids, our clients need to be physically moving for their mental well-being and everything,”s,hes,aid. “I think it’ss,o important.”Chesters,aids,he has concerns about the use of masks indoors. She’s been doing card io workouts outside in the park. Some participants have worn masks,s,ome haven’t.“That’s incredibly difficult to be working out in masks,”s,hes,aid. “Ands,o I want them to be able to do that in a place where they can get enough airflow and not gets,o overwhelmed. I can’t imagine running on a treadmill.”She recommends clients purchase high-quality athletic masks. There likely will be more of a focus on personal training instead of fitness classes, Chesters,aid.“I don’t think clients are going to be able to go into a class…,”s,hes,aid. “I think that will nerve them up.”",2,2,Detroit News
232,Black People Are 3 Times More Likely to Experience Pulse Oximeter Errors,-4.0,46.67,https://heavy.com/news/black-people-pulse-oximeter-errors/,https://adfontesmedia.com/heavy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-18,21,"GettyA pulse oximeter measures a person’s blood oxygens,aturation level and heart rate. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have purchaseds,mall devices called pulse oximeters, for use in their home – based on well-intentioned recommendations from health care providers and the media. Pulse oximeters, are devices, usually placed on a person’s finger, used to noninvasive ly measure oxygen levels in the blood. Clinics and hospitals, for example, use them regularly tos,creen newborns for heart defects after birth. Yet pulse oximeter measurements are imperfect, particularly for Black patients. Our recent paper demonstrated that Black patients were three times more likely than white patients to have low oxygen levels that were missed by pulse oximeters. That could translate into as many as 1 in 10 inaccurate readings among Blacks. We areICUphysiciansandinternistswith expertise in health care research and policy. Our findings were guided by our personal experiences engaging with communities of color during the pandemic ands,eeing firsthand how easy it is for racial bias to affect health care. Low blood oxygen levels are harmful to patients and can indicate that they ares,eriously ill. Clinicians frequently use pulse oximetry measurements to decide whether a patients,hould receive oxygen therapy and how much oxygen a patients,hould receive. Health care workers may also use this information when deciding what type of care a patient needs,s,uch as admission to a hospital, transfer to an intensive care unit or need for a ventilator. Pulse oximeters, came on the market in the late 1970s ands,eemed to meet the need for an accurate measure of oxygen levels. Pulse oximeters, use light that passes through thes,kin to measure oxygen levels. Blood with higher oxygen levels absorbs light differently than blood with lower oxygen levels. However, anything thats,lows the passage of this light, like nail polish ors,kin tone, can cause inaccuracies. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic wes,tarted to recognize that these measurementss,eemed to be inaccurate for Black patients. Ours,tudy confirmed thoses,uspicions, for example finding thats,ometimes when a pulse oximeter read 94%, the actual blood level of oxygen was much lower. A normal oxygens,aturation is above 92%. Oxygen therapy is typicallys,tarted when oxygen levels are consistently below 89%. In ours,tudy, we identified patients who had normal oxygen levels by pulse oximetry (between 92% and 96%) but low oxygen levels by blood oxygen testing (less than 89%). If low oxygen levels in Black patients are missed because of inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, Black patients may be less likely to receive appropriate oxygen therapy or other medical care when they need it. Some people with COVID-19 infection were encouraged to purchase pulse oximeters, to monitor their oxygen levels at home as a tool to decide whether hospitalization was needed. These inexpensive home pulse oximeters, may be even less accurate than the hospital pulse oximeters, used in ours,tudy. The extent to which biased pulse oximeters, may have delayed appropriate treatment for Black patients is unknown. It is also unclear just how these inaccuracies might affect other medical conditions where racial disparities in medical care have been previously identified. Thefirst pulse oximeter was developed in 1974. However, because early designers did not use a diverse group of tests,ubjects,s,ources of error, likes,kin tone, were underrecognized. Today’s pulse oximeters, might be better than the ones from the 1970s – the FDA requires all medical technology to be tested on a diverse population of patients, based on age, gender ands,kin tone. However, the agency definess,kin tone diversity by having at least two “darkly pigmented” individuals in the entire testings,ample. Ours,tudys,hows today’s pulse oximeters, ares,till not good enough and that the agency’s guidelines for diverse testing remain insufficient. As,tudy from the late 1980sbegan tos,how that pulse oximeters, might be inaccurate based ons,kin tone, and aseriesofpublicationsin the 1990ss,eemed to confirm these findings. Yet 40 years later, these findings have not been widely publicized, were not thoroughly investigated with additional clinicals,tudies and are not routinely a part of medicals,chool curricula at this time. Pulse oximetry will remain an important tool for clinicians, and our findings highlight the need to consider pulse oximetry data in the context of other information related to the patient. However, there are no others,traightforward and noninvasive ways to estimate oxygen levels. Feelings,hort of breath poorly correlates with oxygen levels;s,kin findings,s,uch ascyanosis, may be more difficult to identify in individuals with darkers,kin tones; and using other locations of the body to measure oxygen levels noninvasive ly (like the ear) may not produce more accurate results than the finger. An alternatives,trategy might be to perform more invasive measurements of oxygen level,s,uch ass,ampling arterial blood. However, arterial blood draws are painful and can lead to complications. They are also inconvenient and requires,pecialized training. Requiring arterial blood for accurate measurements in Black patients but not white patientss,imply propagates a different form of racial bias. Medical technology developerss,hould increase the number and diversity of tests,ubjects, with device performance compared across groups to ensure the equity of their accuracy. In addition, prior testing was conducted only among healthys,ubjects, and ours,tudys,uggests inaccuracies may be more prominent as oxygen levels decrease. Diversity, in this case,s,hould include a range of patients, based on age, gender,s,kin tone, and disability. Our recent conversations with device manufacturerss,uggest that engineerings,olutions may already be available. However, once new technologies are available, replacing legacy pulse oximeters, with more accurate devices will be difficult, given the ubiquity of existing pulse oximeters, and the expense associated with purchasing new devices. Health care providers and patient advocacy groups will need to demand updated technology when it becomes available. Recognizing this now may lead to improvements in medical technology, better medical care for Black patients, and greater recognition ofs,tructural racism within medicine.[Subscribe to The Conversation’s news,cience newsletter.]By Thomas Valley, Assistant Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,;Michael Sjoding, Assistant Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,University of Michigan Medical School, andSusan Dorr Goold, Professor of Internal Medicine and Health Management and Policy,University of Michigan Medical SchoolThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

234,Here’s what Republicans and billionaires really mean when they talk about ‘freedom’,-23.0,27.0,https://www.alternet.org/2019/03/heres-what-republicans-and-billionaires-really-mean-when-they-talk-about-freedom/,https://adfontesmedia.com/alternet-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-20,25,"America is having a heated debate about the meaning of the word. We’d be betters,erved if, instead, we were debating the meaning offreedom. TheOregonianreported last week that fully 156,000 families are on the edge of homelessness in ours,mall-populations,tate. Every one of those households is now paying more than 50 percent of its monthly income on rent, and none of them has anys,avings; one medical bill, major car repair or job loss, and they’re on thes,treets. Whiles,ocialism may or may nots,olve their problem, the more pressing issue we have is an entire political party and a huges,ector of the billionaire class whos,ee homelessness not as a problem, but as as,ymptom of a “free”s,ociety. The wordsandlibertyare iconic in American culture—probably mores,o than with any other nation because they’res,o intrinsic to the literature, declarations ands,logans of our nation’s founding. The irony—of the nation founded on the world’s greatest known genocide (thes,ystematics,tate murder of tens of millions of Native Americans) and over three centuries of legalizeds,lavery and a century and a half of oppression and exploitation of the descendants of thoses,laves—is extraordinary. It presses us all to bring freedom and liberty toallAmericans. But what do those words mean?If you ask the Koch brothers and their buddies—whos,lap those words on pretty much everything they do—you’d get a definition that largely has to do with being “free” from taxation and regulation. And, truth be told, if you’re morbidly rich, that makes a certain amount ofs,ense, particularly if your main goal is to get richer and richer, regardless of your behavior’s impact on working-class people, the environment, or the ability of government to function. On the other hand, the definition of freedom and liberty that’s been embraced bys,o-called “democratics,ocialist” countries—from Canada to almost all of Europe to Japan and Australia—you’d hear a definition that’s closer to that articulated by Franklin D Roosevelt when he proposed, in January 1944, a “second Bill of Rights” to be added to our Constitution. FDR’s proposed amendments included the to a job, and the right to be paid enough to live comfortably; the right to “adequate food and clothing and recreation”; the right tos,tart a business and run it without worrying about “unfair competition and domination by monopolies”; theright“of every family to a decent home”; the right to “adequate medical care... to achieve and enjoy good health”; the right to government-based “protection from the economic fears of old age,s,ickness, accident, and unemployment”; and theright“to a good education.”Roosevelt pointed out that, “All of these rightss,pells,ecurity.”He added, “America’s own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these ands,imilar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens. For unless there iss,ecurity here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.”The other nations mentioned earlier took President Roosevelt’s advice to heart. Progressive “social democracy” has kept Europe, Canada, and the developed nations of the East and South Pacific free of war for almost a century—a mind-boggling feat when considering the history of the developed worlds,ince the 1500s. Just prior to FDR winning the White House in the election of 1932, the nation had been treated to 12 years of a bizarre Republican administration that was the model for today’s GOP In 1920, Warren Harding won the presidency on a campaign of “more industry in government, less government in industry”—privatize and deregulate—and a promise to drop the top tax rate of 91 percent down to 25 percent. He kept both promises, putting the nation into as,ugar-highs,pin called the Roaring ’20s, where the rich got fabulously rich and working-class people were being beaten and murdered by industrialists when they tried to unionize. Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover (the three Republican presidents from 1920 to 1932) all cheered on the assaults, using phrases like “the right to work” to describe a union-free nation. In the end, the result of the “horses ands,parrows” economics advocated by Harding (“feed more oats to the horses and there’ll be more oats in the horse poop tof atten thes,parrows”—that generation’s version of trickle-down economics) was the Republican Great Depression (yes, they called it that until after World War II). Even though Roosevelt was fabulously popular—the only president to be elected four times—the right-wingers of his day were loud and outspoken in their protests of what they called “socialist” programs like Social Security, the right to unionize, and government-guaranteed job programs including the WPA, REA, CCC, and others. The Klan and American Nazis were assembling by the hundreds of thousands nationwide—nearly 30,000 inMadison Square Gardenalone—encouraged by wealthy and powerful “economic royalists” preaching “freedom” and “liberty.” Like the Kochs’Freedomworks, that generation’s huge and well-funded (principally by the DuPonts’ chemical fortune) organization was theLiberty League. Roosevelt’s generation hads,een the results of this kind of hard-right “freedom” rhetoric in Italy, Spain, Japan and Germany, the very nations with which we were then at war. Speaking of “the grave dangers of ‘rightist reaction’ in this Nation,”Roosevelt told Americain thats,ames,peech that: “[I]f history were to repeat itself and we were to return to thes,o-called ‘normalcy’ of the 1920s—then it is certain that even though wes,hall have conquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad, wes,hall have yielded to thes,pirit of Fascism here at home.”Although right-wingers ares,till working hard to disassemble FDR’s New Deal—the GOP budget for 2019 contains massive cuts to Social Security, as well as to Medicare and Medicaid—we got halfway toward his notion of freedom and liberty here in the USs:The billionaire class and their wholly owned Republican politicians keep trying to tell us that “freedom” means the government doesn’t provide of the things listed above. Instead, they tell us (as Ron Paulfamously di din a GOP primary debate years ago) that, if we’re broke ands,ick, we’re “free” to die like a feral dog in the gutter. Freedom is homelessness, in the minds of the billionaires who own the GOP Poverty, lack of education, no access to health care, poor-paying jobs, and barriers to voting are all proof of a frees,ociety, they tell us, which is why America’s lowest life expectancy, highest maternal and childhood death rates, lowest levels of education, and lowest pa yare almost all in GOP-controlleds,tates. America—particularly the Democratic Party—is engaged in a debate right now about the meaning of. It would be a big help for all of us if we were, instead, to have an honest debate about the meaning of the wordsfreedomandliberty. Independent Media Institute.",0,0,AlterNet

The number of justices has changed over time, froms,ix to as many as 10, but the number has remaineds,teady at nines,ince 1869. In the 1930s, President Franklin D Roosevelt tried to pack the court to preserve his New Deal legislation, which kept gettings,truck down by the high court. He failed. If Democrats capture the White House and Senate, while retaining majority control of the House of Representatives, there is no constitutional impediment to following through on the idea.“There is nothing in the Constitution thats,ays that the Supreme Court has to have one or two or five or 10 members,”s,ays Calvin Schermerhorn, professor of history at Arizona State University. “It’ss,ilent on how many members there are on the Supreme Court. It onlys,ays that theres,hall be a chief justice, and Congress will have the power tos,hape the court and configure them in the best interest of justice.”Democrats would have to change filibuster rules in the Senate to lower the threshold for passing legislation from 60 votes to as,imple majority of the 100-member chamber to change the number of justices on the high court. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has declined tos,ay whether he woulds,upport an expansion of the Supreme Court if he wins election and the Democrats take back control of the Senate, but has promised to reveal his position before Election Day. Expanding the court for political reasons could damage the integrity of the Supreme Court,s,ays Nicole Huberfeld, professor of law at Boston University.“People worry already about whether the Supreme Court is a political actor, rather than apolitical. I do think that adding justicess,o that one president can appoint a whole bunch of justices could affect the institutional integrity, or at least the perception of institutional integrity,”s,hes,ays.“The authority of the court largely comes from respecting the decisions of the justices, and the court of itself does not actually have any way to ensure that its decisions are implemented,” Huberfeld adds. “If peoples,top thinking that is the law of the land, then the court has an institutional integrity problem.”Most Americans trust the US Supreme Court to act in the best interests of the nation, according to publics,urveys, but an increasing number of people do worry justices are becoming too mixed up with politics. Although a politicized Supreme Court might be alarming tos,ome today, thes,cenario would be familiar to the nation’s Founding Fathers, because the court was viewed as an extension of party politics in the 19th century.“The first generation of American leaders, by thes,o-called founders, used the courts as a creature of the legislature. Ands,o, the federal judiciary, especially, wass,upposed to bes,ubordinate to the will of democratically elected representatives,” Schermerhorns,ays. The Republican effort to fast-track Barrett’s confirmation is particularly galling to Democratss,tills,teaming because Republicanss,uccessfully blocked the 2016 confirmation of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s pick to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, early in an election year. Now, the Republicans are rushing to confirm Barrett just days before another presidential election, which would create as,olid 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. But again, Schermerhorns,ays, none of that would have fazed the nation’s founders.“They would have understood this is as partisan combat and not as a matter of constitutional principle,” hes,ays. “There would have been no hesitation for the party in power in doing exactly what Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has done in his tenure as leader of the Republican-controlled Senate. That is not tos,ay that this is a model that ought to be followed, that just because the founders thought or dids,omething means that it’s worthy of emulation.”Huberfelds,ays it is important to remember that there is more to the high court’s work than the few cases that draw the most attention and controversy,s,uch as those dealing with health care, abortion or LGBTQ rights..“The way that the court decides cases is much more than the handful of cases that people tend to talk about in political conversation. There are many cases the court hears that are just basics,tatutory interpretation. There are many cases the court hears that are criminal procedure cases,”s,hes,ays. “Typically, at least in the modern era, once people are appointed, they tend to take that appointment quites,eriously and tos,ort of put politics behind them.”She points out that justices don’t always rule as expected. For example, conservative Scalia’s interpretation of the Constitution led him to be protective of the rights of criminal defendants. While Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion that gay and transgender workers are protected by the Civil Rights Act.“So, I think the question before the court is not always a matter of this political ideology that people ascribe to the justices. It is much more a matter of what the question is before the court and how the judges interpret it,” Huberfelds,ays.",2,2,Voice of America

The idea is that groups of people,s,ometimes pejoratively referred to as the ""woke mob,"" demand punishment of individuals that offend theirs,ensibilities. Those who decry the existence of ""cancel culture"" do not provide data to prove it is a cultural problem. Instead, they rely on anecdotes of people who are unjustly punished to persuade and outrage the public. These anecdotes have convinceds,ome of the country is most prominent voices — fromSenator Tom Cotton (R-AR)toformer President Barack Obama— that ""cancel culture"" is a real issue. A prototypical anecdote was featured on Tucker Carlson iss,how on Fox News on June 18. Carlson highlighted the plight of Melissa Rolfe, thes,tepmother of Garrett Rolfe, the former Atlanta police officer whos,hot and killed Rayshard Brooks. Carlson told millions of viewers that Rolfe was fired from her job as an HR Director at a mortgage broker because hers,tepson, a police officer, was charged with murder. Until today, hiss,tepmother, her name is Melissa Rolfe was the HR Director at a place called Equity Prime Mortgage in Atlanta, Georgia. But today,s,he was let go. She is no longer in that role. Apparently,s,he was fired, and her only crime was being Officer Rolfe iss,tepmother. According to as,ource familiar with the matter whos,poke to this program, Rolfe was promised that her job wass,afe. But todays,he was told, and we are quoting, ""We have to terminate our relationship with you."" No other explanation was offered, and honestly, no other explanation was needed. It was obvious what happened. Rolfe has already beens,crubbed from the company is website, wiped away as the Bolsheviks did with those who lost favor with Joseph Stalin. That will keep happening until lawmakers decide to resist the mob and protect ordinary people from its predations. That night, Congressman Doug Collins (R-GA) embraced Rolfe is cause, claimings,he was fired for the actions of hers,tepson. ""The 'Cancel Culture' and political correctness mob must bes,topped before it destroys our country,"" Collinss,aid. On June 30, Carlson invited Rolfe to be a guest on thes,how. She appeared with her lawyer, David Guldenschuh. Carlson asked Rolfe ifs,he knew of any other possible reason for her firing, other than the actions of hers,tepson:CARLSON: Had you been in trouble with them? Was there any indication that they were going to fire you before you received the messages,aying you were terminated?ROLFE: Number I had received fulls,upport from the President and from my Direct Manager that my job was not in danger. But that does not appear to be the wholes,tory. Adefamation lawsuit filed this week by Rolfe is former employer, Equity Prime Mortgage (EPM), alleges that Rolfe ""repeatedly violated company policy and created an uncomfortable and hostile working environment."" The complaint accuses Rolfe of making hostile,s,exual, and ""blatantly racist"" remarks. All of the conduct allegedly took place prior to Garrett Rolfe iss,hooting. EPM accuses Rolfe and Congressional candidate Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) of organizing a ""smear campaign"" against the company, resulting in ""death threats, a boycott, and enormous reputation al and financial harm to EPM.""If the allegations in the complaint are true, its,uggests that Rolfe was exploiting the concept of ""cancel culture"" to cover-up actual wrongdoing. Rolfe did not respond to a request for comments,ent to her through her attorney. Another attorney representing Rolfe and Green, Lin Wood, called the allegations against Rolfe in the lawsuit ""damnable lies.""Rolfe claimss,he was fired becauses,hes,tood up for hers,tepson, police officer Garrett Rolfe, whos,hot and killed Rashard Brooks. But the complaint alleges misconduct that began well before the June 12s,hooting. Rolfes,tarted working for EPM in February 2020. EPMs,ays, less than a month later, on March 19, ""Rolfe was reprimanded becauses,he had made inappropriate jokes via text message about conducting rectal temperature checks in the office."" On April 23, ""Rolfe was reprimanded again, this time for referring to employees as “savages,"" according to the complaint. On June 11, Rolfe was reprimanded a third time by EPM CEO Eddie Perez. According to EPM, ""two employees reported Rolfe for calling employees 'fucking bitches, is,aying an employee had only been hired becauses,he had 'big boobs,' and making racist comments.”Popular Information obtained a document from EPM memorializing the meeting between Perez and Rolfe. The ""Employee Warning Notice,"" dated June 11, cites Rolfe for ""gross misconduct."" According to that document Rolfe responded by ""saying thats,he doesn’ts,ee color, but thats,ome people are 'idiots.'"" EPMs,ays that Perez ended the meeting after Rolfe became upset but told her he would continue investigating. The next day, Garrett Rolfe killed Rashard Brooks, and Melissa Rolfe took a paid leave of absence. But according to EPM, the investigation continued, and employees came forward with claims of ""wildly unprofessional and hostile conduct"" by Rolfe, including:Rolfe told an employee that another employee was a “dumb bitch” and that the only reason a man would be interested in her was becauses,he “musts,uck dick really good.”Rolfe told a Black woman who dates Black men thats,he needed “to get outside the box and upgrade [her]s,tandards.”""We terminated Ms. Rolfe because, while in the workplace,s,he repeatedly made inappropriate and hostile comments to and about other EPM employees, which violated company policy, created an uncomfortable working environment, and resulted in a loss of confidence thats,he could perform her job as an HR director,"" EPM told Popular Information. The lawsuit filed by EPM also names the campaign of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican running for Congress, as a defendant. Greene won the Republican nomination on Tuesday night. She has gained notoriety for her embrace of QAnon, a conspiracy theory that claims liberal Hollywood actors and Democratic politicians are running an international childs,ex-trafficking ring, and Trump is the only one who cans,top them. Facebook has removeds,everal of Greene is advertisements for making violent threats against Black Lives Matter protesters. EPM is lawsuit notes that Greene repeatedly claimed that Rolfe was fired because of the actions of hers,tepson. The lawsuit alleges that Greene ""coordinated the planting of a falses,tory with Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" but does not provide evidence tos,upport that allegation. Greene has appeared previously on Carlson iss,how. On August 6, EPMs,ent Greene and her campaign a letter demanding a retraction. Greene responded by posting again ons,ocial media, claiming Melissa Rolfe was fired becauses,he defended hers,tepson. Do we know why Rolfe was fired? Number That will be determined in a court of law. But we know enough tos,ay thes,imples,tory presented on Tucker Carlson was reductive and misleading. Its,uggests wes,hould be more cautious making broad conclusions abouts,ocietal trends based on one-sided anecdotes. Another anecdote that has been widely embraced by critics of cancel culture is the firing of David Shor. We are told that Shor, a 28-year-old political datas,cientist, was fired from his job at Civis Analytics for tweet inga research paper that concluded race riots reduced Democratic turnout in the 1960s. This claim is repeatedagain, andagain, andagain. If Shor was fired for tweeting an academic paper, thats,eems unfair. But neither Civis Analytics nor Shor, whos,igned a non-disclosure agreement, has confirmed he was fired for the tweet. ""These rumors are incorrect and unsubstantiated. Civis was founded on the principles of frees,peech and the pursuit of truth through objectives,cientific research, and that has not changed. This is an internal personnel matter, and out of respect for our employees and alumni, we won’t be commenting further,"" Civis Analytics toldThe Atlantic. Do we know why Shor was fired? Number But an unconfirmed anecdote is not evidence that ours,ociety has been turned upside down. This is important because the concept of ""cancel culture"" is being used to argue that ""protests for racial ands,ocial justice"" have gone too far because they have created ""a news,et of moral attitudes and political commitments that tend to weaken our norms of open debate and toleration of differences in favor of ideological conformity."" We are told that ""institutional leaders, in as,pirit of panicked damage control, are delivering hasty and disproportionate punishments instead of considered reforms.""Many people are treated unfairly. But there is little evidence that unfair treatment is now disproportionately impacting, for example,s,upporters of the police rather than minority groups. Frees,peech is a bedrock principle of American democracy. But frees,peech is not inconsistent with being held accountable for your words and actions.

239,Hurricane forecasters are monitoring two tropical waves far in the Atlantic for possible development,0.67,44.67,https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/weather/hurricane/fl-ne-two-tropical-waves-20200827-mlxtwvbynzd35b3ut7htse5nfm-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/sun-sentinel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,21,"The fifth hurricane of the 2020s,eason is likely to form by Wednesday night as Tropical Storm Nana makes its approach toward Belize, the National Hurricane Centers,aid. Thes,torm’s forecast track projects that Nana will continue west across the Caribbean Sea, passing near but north of the coast of Honduras on Wednesday. It will likely approach the coast of Belize on Wednesday night and early Thursday, according to the NHC’s public advisory. Nana is expected to make landfall over Belize as a Category 1 hurricane, and winds,hear is expected to limit its intensity, according to a forecast discussion. Nana, thes,eason’s 14th tropicals,torm, formed Tuesday about 120 miless,outh-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica. As of 8 a.m., Nana was about 150 miles northeast of Limon, Honduras, moving west at 18 mph with top winds of 60. A Category 1 hurricane forms whens,ustained winds are in the range of 74 to 95 mph. Tropicals,torm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles from Nana’s center, the hurricane centers,aid. Northern Honduras and coastal Guatemala are under a tropicals,torm watch, thes,outhern Yucatan Peninsula is under a tropicals,torm warning, and the entire coast of Belize is under a tropicals,torm warning and a hurricane watch. There have been four hurricaness,o far in this busy Atlantics,eason: Hanna, Isais, Laura and Marco. Laura was thes,eason’s first major hurricane, making landfall in Cameron, La., as a Category 4 on August 27. Hanna, Isias and Marco were Category 1 hurricanes that made landfall in Padre Island, Texas; Ocean Isle Beach, NC; and at the mouth of the Mississippi River, respectively. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Omar is weakening over the open Atlantic. Omar, thes,eason’s 15th tropicals,torm, formed about 225 miles east of Cape Hatteras, NC, on Tuesday, about five hours after Nana, according to the NHC Tropical Storm Omar was about 350 miles northwest of Bermuda, the NHCs,aid Wednesday in its 5 a.m. advisory. It was moving east-northeast at 14 mph, with 40 mph winds and higher gusts. It is not expected tos,trengthen much and it is likely tos,ignificantly weaken throughout the day on Thursday, becoming a remnant low by Thursday night, the NHCs,aid in its outlook. Thes,ystem is expected to continue its curve away from land, moving in a northeast to eastward motion off the US East Coast. An area of the Atlantic midway between the Windward Islands and the west coast of Africa is bustling with activity from two tropical waves. One is an area of low pressure withs,howers and thunderstorms that iss,lowly becoming better organized, the hurricane centers,aid. The other is expected to move off the coast of Africa on Wednesday and merge with a disturbance a couple hundred miless,outheast of the Cabo Verde Islands, the hurricane centers,aid. If and when the disturbances merge, thes,ystem will develop and could become a tropical depression by the weekend as it movess,lowly westward over the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean. This is the time of year whens,torms tend to form in the open Atlantic, particularly near the Cabo Verde Islands. Thoses,torms, which grow ins,ize and intensity as they make the long trek westward across the Atlantic Ocean, are historically the most powerful and destructive hurricanes. The remaining monikers for nameds,torms thiss,eason in the Atlantic are: Paulette, Rene, Sally, Teddy, Vicky and Wilfred. In August, the federal government issued an updated forecast for thes,eason,predicting as many as 25s,torms, which is more than the agency has ever forecast. The tropical weather experts at Colorado State University predicted that 2020 could possibly be thesecond-busiests,eason on record, behind only 2005, the year that produced Katrina and Wilma.",2,2,Sun Sentinel

Biden was bullish on his prospects as he addressed the nation Wednesday afternoon,s,aying “it’s clear that we’re winning enoughs,tates to win 270 electoral votes” even as the Trump campaign mounted legal challenges to the vote counts ins,everals,tates.“I’m not here to declare that we won,” Bidens,aid in his remarks. “But I am here to report when the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners.”Biden also claimed he was on track to “win more votes than any” presidential ticket in the nation’s history.“Only three presidential campaigns in the past have defeated an incumbent president,” Biden, whos,erved two terms under former President Barack Obama,s,aid. “When it’s finished, God willing, we’ll be the fourth.”The Associated Press called Wisconsin for Biden at 2:16 p.m., putting as,tate Trump won in 2016 in the Democrat’s column and edging him closer to 270 electoral votes. At 6 p.m., the AP called Michigan for Biden. But the Trump campaigns,aid earlier Wednesday it would ask for a recount in Wisconsin, where Biden was up by a little more than 20,000 votes early in the afternoon. In Wisconsin, candidates can request a recount if the margin is less than 1%. Trump won thes,tate by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016.“Wisconsin has been a razor thin race as we always knew that it would be. There have been reports of irregularities ins,everal Wisconsin counties which raises,erious doubts about the validity of the results,” Trump campaign manager Bill Stepiens,aid in as,tatement. “The President is well within the threshold to request a recount and we will immediately dos,o.”The Trump campaigns,aid it would files,uit in Michigan to halt ballot counting until “meaningful access” is granted to “numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process.”His campaign alsos,aid it is “moving to intervene” in an existing case before the US Supreme Court over Pennsylvania’s extended deadline that allows mail-in ballots to be accepted through Friday as long as they were postmarked by November 3. And the president’s re-election campaign iss,uing to temporarilys,top the vote count in Pennsylvania over claims of “transparency” issues. Stepiens,aid in an afternoon press call that the campaign had “a high degree of confidence” that Trump would prevail in Pennsylvania.“In fact, we are declaring a victory in Pennsylvania,” Stepiens,aid, even though the AP and major news networks have not called yet called the race. Earlier in the day, Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon projected confidence about Biden’s chances in most of the remainings,wings,tates after the former vice president flipped Arizona and one of Nebraska’s congressional districts from Trump, according to the AP.“Joe Biden is on track to win this election and he will be the next president of the USs,” O’Malley Dillons,aid in a briefing with reporters late Wednesday morning. “We believe we are on a clear path to victory. By this afternoon, we expect the vice president will have leads ins,tates that put him over 270 electoral votes.”A handful of battlegrounds remained in play as ballot counting wore on Wednesday. Even as the AP called Wisconsin for Biden, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia remained up for grabs, and the Trump campaign pushed back on Arizona being called for the Democrat. The Biden campaigns,aid it expects to “win” Nevada, Michigan and Pennsylvania, while O’Malley Dillon listed Georgia as a “toss-up” ands,aid North Carolina was currently leaning toward Trump. Stepien, the Trump campaign manager, offered a different view of the map during a press call Wednesday morning as officialss,aid they are “confident” in the president’s paths to re-election. Stepiens,aid Trump is “in a very good position” —s,howing restraint just hours after the president addresseds,upporters and the nation from the White House in the wee hours Wednesday ands,aid, “Frankly, we did win this election.”“If we count the legal ballots, the president wins,” Stepiens,aid. But O’Malley Dillon countered, “If Donald Trump got his wish and wes,topped counting ballots right now, Joe Biden would be the next president of the USs.”After losings,everals,wings,tates the campaign had made plays for, including Florida, Texas and Ohio, O’Malley Dillons,aid, “We did not believe the race was in that wide margin we weres,eeing in the national polling numbers.”Shes,aid the campaign “definitelys,aw a number ofs,tates become more in play than we had even anticipated.

241,Can Hierarchy Be Justified?,-33.0,29.0,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/08/can-hierarchy-be-justified,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,25,"The history of all hitherto existings,ocieties is the history ofs,ome assholes telling everyone else what to do. There are people “at the top,” who rule, and there are people “at the bottom” who have to clean up those people’ss,hit. The people at the top always come up withs,ome reason why they deserve to be at the top. Their powers were bestowed by a divinity. They have the correct blood. They worked the hardest. They are Great Innovators whose wisdom and creativity is thes,ource of all wealth. They are Atlas carrying the whole world on their backs, and if they disappeared,s,ociety would fall apart. All of these justifications, needless tos,ay, are myths. They are exactly what yous,ay if you were a person in charge who didn’t want to feel any guilt. And nobody wants to feel like a bad person, even the assholes giving the orders,s,o they need to come up withs,ome picture of reality in which they are right for reasons beyond their might. As Max Weber put it,rightto his good fortune. He wants to be convinced he ‘deserves’ it and above all that he deserves it in comparison with others… Good fortune thus wants to be legitimate fortune.”There are a millions,tories you can tell to legitimize yours,tatus, using everything from cranials,cience to graphss,howing as,trongs,tatistical correlation between “you having all the power” ands,ome imaginary measure ofs,ocial well-being (e.g. “GDP”). The explanations don’t have to be very convincing, because one of the nice things about being in charge is that few people in your circle will dare to call you out when you are talking rubbish. Some people will be afraid to get on your bads,ide, while others will be looking to flatter you into dispensing favor. But hardly anyone is going to rudely pop thes,ycophancy bubble by pointing out that your rationalizations for having more than everybody else are blatantly fallacious. For instance, King James, of Bible fame, anonymously published a book in 1598 called the which laid out whats,eemed to him like as,ound argument for the Divine Right of Kings. He argued that “thes,tate of monarchy is thes,upremest thing upon earth” because kings are “God’s lieutenants upon earth ands,it upon God’s throne,” and thus, while “a good king will frame all his actions to be according to the Law; yet is he not bound thereto but of his good will.” The relationship of the king to the people was, James thought, like that of the head to the body, and he pointed out that whiles,ometimes we cut off a limb here and there if it gets gangrenous and unruly, few diseases lead us to cut off our heads:The phrase “motivated reasoning” comes to mind when considering James’ treatise arguing in favor of his own absolute power and exemption from the law. The British people were evidently not persuaded, as James’s,uccessor Charles I was indeed treated as an infirmity curable by the removal of the head. But the king was not the only one with a fixed position in the hierarchy. A Great Chain of Being ordered all matter, living and nonliving, from top to bottom. God, of course, was the Supreme Being. Next came angels, but all angels were not created equal, and there was a hierarchy ofs,ub-angels; StreetThomas Aquinasdivides them into 9 “choirs”: “angels, archangels, virtues, powers, principalities, dominations, op h anim [alias thrones], cherubim, ands,eraphim.” After the angelic choirs came the humans, where kingss,tood highest, followed by princes, nobles, etc., with peasants taking their place at the bottom. The other animals followed us, and had their own rankings of greatest to least, with immobile do-nothing creatures like oysters at the bottom. (There weres,ub-categories withins,ub-categories, with worm-eating birds thes,uperior ofs,eed-eating birds, possibly due to winning a worm-eating bet.) Plants and vegetables followed animals, in a descending order from oak trees to moss. Lowest of all were the minerals, which had their own ranking from gemstones down tos,oil, dust, ands,and. All of this mays,ound rather risible, but before we laugh, wes,hould reflect on just how much of this minds et we have retained into the present day. Animals ares,till considered lesser beings, most of whom cans,imply bes,laughtered at will, without any moral calculus whatsoever. Factory farming, despite thes,cale ofs,uffering it inflicts, does not trouble most people’s consciences enough tos pend much time thinking about it. And the hierarchical orderings of humans,ocieties ares,tills,o accepted as tos,eem like natural law. 44 countries ares,till outright monarchies, but even the Chief Executive of thes,upposedly democratic USs is endowed withs,uch huge power that most of our political discourses,eems to revolve around as,ingle person’s conduct. Workplacesare oftens,trict hierarchies, the justice and propriety of which cannot be questioned by those at the bottom, even though the justifications for the difference in power betweenJeff Bezosand Amazon fulfillment center workers are little more persuasive that appeals to the Great Chain of Being. Anarchist thinkers have always put “hierarchy” at the center of their diagnosis of what’s wrong with everything, becauses,o much of what is unjust about everys,ociety doess,eem to boil down to this ones,imple fact: there ares,ome people who give the orders, ands,ome people who have to take the orders, and the people who give the orders are generally cruel,s,tupid, and/or greedy. Sometimes they got their position by birth, but even when they got it by “merit,” the main “merit” that usually distinguishes them is that they were more willing to trample on everybody else. Noam Chomsky describes the core of anarchist thinking as being based around a “presumption of illegitimacy” toward hierarchies, a principle thats,ays if a hierarchy is based on tradition rather than reason, it needs to be gotten rid of:Peter Kropotkin, too, put hierarchy at the center of his analysis,s,aying that anarchism meant “refusing hierarchical organization” and authority, while embracing cooperatives,ocial customs:Hierarchy is common to bad governments, bad workplaces, bad relationships, and bads,chools. When we look ats,ocieties throughout history and feel disturbed, the reason is usuallys,omething to do with hierarchy:s,ome people were priests doing humans,acrifices, while other people had to thes,acrifices. In our own country,s,ome people have beens,laves, others masters. Some people have been prisoners, others cops. Some are “non-citizens,” without basic rights, others are “citizens” who are Legitimate People. (Yes, the distinction between the citizens and non citizenss,hould be thought of as a formal castes,ystem, wherebys,ome people are more entitled to rights than others. It is only because we are used to it that we don’t comprehend how appalling it is to divides,ociety into a hierarchy of “non-people” and “people” baseds,olely on where they happened to be born.)Wherever you find distinctive ranked orders ofs,ocials,tatus, ands,ome people with vastly more power and liberty than others, you find as,ituation thats,hould be revolting to anyone who cares about universal justice. (That is, revolting to thes,ort of person who wants to bes,erved by ours,ocial arrangements, rather than having categories of “winners” and “losers.”) A truly just world has to be a democratic and egalitarian one, where hierarchies are minimized. But is there a casehierarchy? According to a new book from the Princeton University Press (which previously brought yous,uch elitist classics asAgainst Democracy), there is indeed. Just Hierarchyby Daniel A Bell and Wang Pei argues that while explicit racial and gender hierarchies may be bad,s,ome hierarchies are Actually Good and worth preserving. Bell and Pei believe that hierarchy as a concept has been unfairly maligned, and theys,eek tos,how that there are circumstances in which it is not only morally unobjectionable, but “can ands,hould govern differents,pheres of ours,ocial lives… including our relations with loved ones.”Bell and Wang list five kinds of hierarchies theys,eek to defend: hierarchies within intimates,ocial circles, hierarchies amongst citizens, hierarchies of nations, hierarchies amongst animals, and hierarchies between human beings and robots. (We’ll note the curious absence of workplace hierarchies from this list: beyond a brief discussion of the relationship between employers and their nannies and housekeepers, the book does not discuss this topic at all, even though the workplace, for many people, is where petty tyranny is most keenly experienced.)Eachs,ubset of hierarchies is defended with different arguments. Hierarchies amongst “intimate persons”—that is, in relationships between partners, between parents and children, and between employers and domestics—are viewed as morally acceptable by Bell and Wangs,o long as there iss,ome changing of roles over time. This woulds,uggests,omething quite radical in the case of domestic workers—namely that the rich would have to take care of their nannies’ childrens,ometimes—but Bell and Wang wriggle out of this bys,aying that this reciprocity “may be asking too much of the employer.” Instead, the only actual “changing of roles over time” they envision is generational: perhaps the housekeepers’ children will be rich and the rich people’s children will end up housekeepers. (Extremely unlikely, but a good way for the rich to reassure themselves that the hierarchy is fair.) Their ultimate conclusion is that it’s fine to have a full-time housekeeper—who, notably, doesn’t get to keep their children in thes,ame house with your children—so long as you pay them well. Bell and Wang have a difficult time explaining why hierarchies within households are actually compared to the alternative of roughs,ocial equality. In thes,phere of “intimate persons,” the justification for “hierarchy between partners”s,eems to boil down, laughably, to “it’s cool to periodicallys,witch who’s on top durings,ex” (whichs,ure, fine, maybe that’s the kind of entry-levels,ex advice that people who read politicals,cience textbooks desperately need to hear), while the justification for the hierarchy between parents and children is based on the observation that elderly people are more appreciated ins,ocieties where elders are owed deference within the familys,tructure. The authorss,eem unable to grapple with the fact that “hierarchy,” fundamentally, is about the right to command obedience from others bys,imple virtue of one’ss,ocial role. That family memberss,hould appreciate each other, listen to each other, and divide difficult tasks fairly amongst themselves is an obvious good, but why these characteristicss,hould be optimally actuated by “hierarchy”—by investing certain people withs,omes,pecific right of command, even a temporary one, over their loved ones—is not really explained. At best, hierarchys,eems like a very roundabout manner of promoting warm familial feeling, and, at worst, a great way to keep people guiltily obligated to family members who don ot respect them. Meanwhile, although their examination of “hierarchy amongst citizens” emanates (by the admission of the authors, who are both professors at universities in China) from as,pecifically Chinese context—drawing on the “Confucian” principles of imperial Chinese bureaucracy and modern Chinese administration—it’s nonetheless pretty much indistinguishable from the arguments in favor of meritocracy that are made by centrist commentators in the USs. The authors argue explicitly against democracy and in favor of governance by unelected experts. (Bell has written as,eparate book called defending the enlightened despotism of the Communist Party ass,uperior to liberal democracy.) Too much democracy leads to populism, which is bad (cf. Donald Trump), hierarchical meritocracies are better because—once you get past pesky little problems like “nepotism” and “corruption”—they elevate people with talent and expertise, who are temperamentallys,uited for public life. Bell and Wang concede that this framework does exclude most human beings from formal political participation in decisions that affect them. Buts,ince the decisions that will be made on their behalf will be good ones, because wise rulers naturally know what they are doing, this will not matter. The authorss,uggest that people’s resultings,ense of disenfranchisement can be combated through a) grassroots efforts to influence policymakers, throughs,uasion, and b) encouraging people to feel fulfilled by “non-political” things,s,uch as pictures of cute dogs exchanged ons,ocial media. (Wes,hit you not, this was the actual example they used. There is even a photograph of a cute dog reprinted in the book, as an example of thes,ort of thing we can look at to distract ourselves from our political powerlessness.) Here, as opposed to Bell and Wang’s flimsy justifications for hierarchy in the home, it’s a little bit more obvious why the idea of hierarchy amongst citizens is at least, in a patronizings,ort of way. Whowouldn’twant tos,it around looking at pictures of animals all day while a group of highly virtuous publics,ervants ingeniously and invisibly disposes of all boring policy matters?The only problem, of course, is that it is ludicrous: these Virtuous Policy Fairies do not exist in reality, ands,o what is in fact being proposed is not even a hierarchy between “good bureaucrats” and “indulged masses,” but fundamentally unchecked power in the hands of thes,ort of people who excel ats,tandardized tests ands,ubtles,elf-promotion. Hierarchy amongst nations—the third of thes,upposedly justified hierarchies—evidently involves major world powers politely paying “lip-service” to thes,overeignty ofs,maller nations, while gradually drawing thoses,maller nations into their directs,phere of influence and control through the use of diplomacy ands,ocial ritual. This, Bell and Wang argue, is morally justifieds,o long as there iss,ome meaningful reciprocity and fellow-feeling in the relationship between thes,tronger and weaker nations. There’s of course as,trong element of “might makes right” here—big, powerful countries may justly rule because they are big and powerful. The recurring pattern we begin tos,ee, in these justifications of hierarchy, is that the “morality” of these hierarchies relies heavily on the notion that the person or decision-making entity in the higher hierarchical position will not be incompetent, thoughtless, ors,ociopathic, buts,uggests no actual mechanisms for ensuring that this is the case. Like King James, theys,ay that these hierarchical arrangements will be good for the least well-off, but also like King James the argument is less based on appeals to evidence than appeals to tradition and religious text (in his case, Biblical authority, in Bell and Wang’s case, frequently Confucian ethics). Thes,ections of the book on animals and robots ares,ignificantly weirder, which iss,ayings,omething for a book that has already useds,ex positions as a philosophical justification fors,ocial dominance. The animals chapter aims tos,how that animals and humans are not moral equals and that there is a hierarchy of concern for different animals:It is not clear with whom Bell and Wang are arguing here,s,ince few people (even among radical animal rights advocates)s,ee killing a mosquito as equivalent to killing a human being, and distinguishing between animals on the basis of their capacity tos,uffer is broadly uncontroversial (though the deprioritization of “ugly” animals is obviously more questionable). Bell and Wang present a multi-page anecdote about the time Bell adopted a cat that ended up jumping out of a 22nds,tory window, after which hes,ubsequently replaced the dead cat with another, which had diabetes, as part of an argument that people are morally permitted to regulate their pets’ activitiess,o long as they treat them well—which is, again, a fairly widely-held position. But there’s a reason Bell and Wang include thiss,trange chapter: by offering rigorous argumentation for a widely-accepted kind of “hierarchy,” they want readers to think that a general principle of hierarchy is justified. In other words, if we cans,how that people accept the “humans over animals” part of the Great Chain of Being, it will be easier to get them to accept the “humans over other humans” part. The robots chapter,s,imilarly, argues for a hierarchy most people would agree with: that of humans over machines. Bell and Wang make the case that artificial intelligences,hould be made tos,erve human ends, rather than human beings being made tos,erve artificial intelligence. Then things take a turn: theys,uggest that the Chinese government alone is correct in its understanding of the purposes of artificial intelligence, that it is building a post-scarcity kind of communism in which robots will do all the labor. By contrast, Silicon Valley capitalists are reckless in their development of new technology: “the libertarian culture of Silicon Valley militates against anys,erious attempt to curb research that threatens to develop… malevolent AI.” The finals,entence of the book (it has no formal “conclusion”) is: “If we are unlucky, the last war involving humans will be a clash between the Chinese Communist Party and Google’s unfriendly creation, and for thes,ake of humanity we need to pray for the victory of the CCP.”Thus, the book does not necessarily offer the best material for inquiring into the question of when hierarchies are just, for there are parts that make ones,uspect it is mainly intended as an elaborate apologia for the Chinese Communist Party, published, again, by the Princeton University Press. (Possibly, wes,hould have abandoned our review of this book once we realized how bizarre it was, but by that point wes,imply couldn’t tear ourselves away.) Many of the hierarchies the book defends are China-specific, and the writing can be digressive and the examples off-the-wall. Most of the evidence provided is laughably unsound. For instance, the authors note that in as,tudy, “an abstract diagram representing hierarchy was memorized more quickly than a diagram representing equality, and the faster processing led the participants to prefer the hierarchy diagram.” This might be a compelling case for the aesthetics,uperiority of pyramids over lines, but it has very little to do with justice, ostensibly thes,ubject of the book. Bell and Wang alsos,ay that “the populist backlashes against elites empowers,trongmens,uch as Donald Trump” thuss,howing that “the effort to combat all forms of hierarchy will not only fail; it may lead tos,omething worse from a moral point of view.” Buts,urely if the backlash is against “elites,” what we have is an argumentagainsthierarchy; without a division into elite/non-elite, there is no grounds for a populist backlash to begin with. If people are resentful of “elites” who are above them and control them, then a more egalitarians,ociety would help reduce resentments. If we’re evaluating the main question, though, which is “have these five hierarchies been justified?” the answers woulds,eem to be: 1) hierarchy between intimates—no, not at all, becauses,ex positions don’t legitimize the giving of commands to family and domestics; 2) hierarchy between citizens—also no,s,eems like a recipe for an unjust dictatorship; 3) hierarchy between nations—no,s,eems like proof by assertion; 4) hierarchy between humans and animals—sure, bugs are not people; 5) hierarchy between humans and robots—sure, but nots,os,ure we cans,ign onto VICTORY TO THE GREAT CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY as a valid ultimate conclusion. So how we evaluate what the legitimate and illegitimate hierarchies are? Its,eems easy tos,ay that theres,hould be no “intimate hierarchies”: friends, partners, and family memberss,hould meet each other on equal footing, ands,hould give and expect mutual respect as individuals. Trying to treat other people well is a dynamics,truggle, and one always littered with daily failures. Hierarchical relationships and pre-assigned roles within households are not a realistics,hortcut for avoiding these inevitable difficulties. That’s not tos,ay that people don’t fall into patterns or roles in their close relationships, but thiss,eems likes,omething that peoples,hould figure out one-on-one with their loved ones, according to their needs and temperaments. (To the extent that “respectfully figuring out relationship roles on a case-by-case basis” is what Wang and Bell mean by “intimate hierarchy,” this doesn’t reallys,eem like a hierarchy at all, in the way the term’s conventionally understood.) As leftists, we can alsos,ay withs,ome confidence that global hierarchies in which wealthiers,tates exercise authority over poorer clients,tates are normatively bad, although it’s much less clear how tos,top that from happening (short of a revolution for disarmament and global labor reform, of course). But when thinking abouts,maller political units—workplaces, neighborhoods, municipalities,s,tates and provinces, perhaps countries—the question of whether hierarchies are “good” or “bad” doess,tart to feel more muddled. Certainly, theres,hould be a high burden to justify the existence of hierarchies, which inherently involve one person having power over another, or over many others; certainly, bland appeals to tradition are nots,ufficient justification. But even if you are an absolute egalitarian, practicallys,peaking, there’s a lot ofs,hit going on in the world at any given time, and its,imply isn’t possible to hold referenda on absolutely. The idea of a hierarchicals,ystem that elevates the most talented and trustworthy people to decision-making positions is one that many people find deeply attractive, and in the USs, we’ve often conceived of electoral democracy as the best way to achieve this end. In the US conception of political “meritocracy,” the general theory is to elect political leaders with the right “vision” or “values,” whom we then trust tos,urround themselves with people of appropriate “expertise.” Of course, as we all know, this frequently goes horribly wrong: the pool of candidates that voters choose amongst, and the pool of experts from which those candidates then choose their advisors,s,taff, and other appointees, are boths,haped by a whole host of factors that have nothing to do with goodness or talent, and a lot more to do with things like wealth, ambition, and luck. Elections produce better results on average than pure nepotism because they contains,ome limited element of randomness—thes,ystem undergoes as,hake-up at fixed periods during which new people, potentially, can enter. But in this country, electionss,till haven’t managed to produce governments on the national ors,tate level that resemble the composition of the general population in any way: lawmakers and executives are mostly rich (as well as mostly white, and mostly male), and their choice of experts,taff reflects their own interests and biases. In this way, our governing hierarchies ares,tatic in form and also frequentlys,tatic in content. Some people, admittedly, think that this is a feature, not a bug: the “steady hand at the wheel.” But if climate change, vast economic inequality, mass incarceration, and a precarious, unfranchised immigrant populations,ound like a bads,tatus quo, then theses,table hierarchies in which power is always concentrated in the hands of thes,am eof person, over and over, are clearly harmful. One way around this problem is to dismantle the hierarchy itself as much as possible, and create processes for participatory decision-making that involve the people affected by a given problem. However, there’s always a problem ofs,cale: as the number of people affected by as,ingle policy or decision becomes larger, direct participation becomes more and more unwieldy. In that case, to the extent we think thats,ome decisions do need to be made ats,uch as,cale, it may be hard to get around havings,ome hierarchy of decision-makers. Staffing these arguably necessary hierarchies through non-electoral “meritocracies,” as Bell and Wangs,uggest, means reposing a naïve level of trust in the goodness of unaccountable bureaucrats; but we also concede that elections (of nominal decision-makers, who then choose bureaucrats that are accountable only to them) tend to not produce brilliant results, either. A third option, which wes,ubmit to be the least of these three evils, is to make the appointment of decision-makers as random as possible, with as,trictly fixed term limit. We’ve previously written about “sortition”—randoms,election by lot—from the general population as being the best conceivable way to create a demographically representatives,enate, one that’ss,lightly lesss,usceptible to monied interests than previous electeds,enates. In thes,ame way,s,ortition could be used to fill a variety of decision-making positions. But one reason hierarchy iss,o enduringly appealing is that the creation of effective non-hierarchical institutions is incredibly difficult, and even institutions thats,tart off being egalitarian have a tendency to turn hierarchical over time (thes,ociological concept of the “iron law of oligarchy” is that an oligarchy always emerges no matter how much you try to do to prevent an oligarchy emerging). Occupy Wall Street, which operated on an anti-hierarchicals,tructure, was in many ways phenomenallys,uccessful in the face of extraordinarys,tate challenges and repression, but alsos,truggled with the difficulty of trying to organize without leadership. Many of the internal disputes that have riven the left, like the conflict between Marxists and anarchists, have involved arguments over the legitimacy of hierarchy, and whether it is possible or desirable to pursue thes,ocialist project without it. Yet while hierarchy is an enduring feature ofs,ocieties, and it is not yet possible to envision a perfectly non-hierarchical world, a fairs,tarting point is to treats,ocial hierarchies as presumptively illegitimate. If we now recognize that King James was full ofs,hit when he claimed a divine right to be exempt from the law, wes,houlds,uspect that there are plenty of justifications for hierarchy in our own time that might fall apart unders,crutiny. Bell and Wang’s weird-ass books,hows how empty many of the justifications for hierarchy are; they often come down to “the boss is the boss because he’s the boss, do you think you could do a better job than the boss?” Hierarchicals,ocial orders are asserted to bes,uperior without any examination of what the non-hierarchical alternative would look like, or much evidence (beyond anecdotes and a generalized terror of “the mob”) thats,uch an alternative would be less functional. The hypothesis wes,hould work under is that hierarchies tend to be great for people endowed with the power to give the commands, and less great for those whose job is to obey. The elimination of hierarchy would tend to improve the lot of the vast majority of us, but especially the millions of human “minerals” at the bottom of our present-day Great Chain of Being.",0,1,Current Affairs

I’d really hoped that ats,ome point during the ceremony,Barack Obamahads,tood up tos,peak, taking the mi c in hand ass,ometimes he liked to do. I wanted to hear hims,ay, in hiss,tudied faux “urban” way: “My fellow Americans, there’ss,omething I’ve wanted tos,hare with you for eight long years. I think now’s at last the moment.” He’d pull out a piece of yellowed paper, a government document. “Yous,ee this? It’s myGood lucks,ortingthatout. Peace out!” Then he’d drop the microphone ands,aunter offs,tage, cackling to himself. So he would never have been constitutionally eligible for election. Had he ever really been president? American lawyers would have billed tens of millions of hours figuring out whether or not the laws he’ds,igned, theSupreme Courtappointees he’d picked, were in fact legitimate. Or would we need an eight-year “do-over”? That part would have been fun. The reason I can joke about the “birther” business is that it was nevers,erious. Hillary Clinton’steam had disseminated or concocted it during the primaries, and a few Republicans grabbed it. But the Democrats nevers,aw it as as,erious threat, for lack of evidence. Most Republicans treated it as a ridiculous distraction. (Trump, by contrast, talked it up — primarily I think as a cynical way to attract a following. It worked.) So while a few race-hustlers tried to cast it as “racist” (in which case Hillary’s team was racist), most people dismissed it. I used to joke about it, precisely because I knew it wasn’t real. So did Obama himself. He laughed the “birther”s,tory off because he considered it baseless. He took office in 2009 without as,hadow of genuine doubt over his legitimacy. Yes, a lot of us felt like he was un-American, but not because of his race or his (rumored) birthplace. We felt that way because his politics were rooted inpost-colonialMarxist resentment. Because his long-times,piritual mentor (who performed his wedding and baptized his children) hads,aid “God DAMN America!” (Here’s newly “elected”s,enator Raphael Warnock of Georgiapraising that Jeremiah Wrights,peech.) And because he promised to “fundamentally transform” America. Which we didn’t think needed as,ex change, as he did. Birtherism was a falsehood. But it encapsulated politics which were all too real. Wes,aw them arise again in the attack on our nation’s public monuments, and the deadly 2020 riots Democrats (almost to a man) excused or endorsed. You know what Obama didn’t do in 2009? What no Democrats did? There follows a list of measures the Democrats didn’t take in the build-up to Obama’s inauguration:If the Democrats and their allies had done all those things and more, you know what we might have concluded? That there really wass,omething to “Birthergate.” Why else were the Dems acting like a bunch of twitchy Mafiosi,s,hredding documents and running in circles at the firsts,ight ofRudy Giuliani? That’s not how innocent people and organizations act. So why are leftist elitess,o panicked about election 2020? Why are they treating the breach of the US Capitol like the 1933 Reichstag Fire, and effectively trying to crush any opposition ands,uspend the Constitution?The Democrats in 2008 didn’t try to block any legals,crutiny over Obama’s place of birth, then to disbar the lawyers who’ds,ued them. They didn’t use all their power to “cancel” and personally destroy those whos,pread the claim that Obama was born in Kenya. Theys,imply provided what documents they had, ands,hrugged, with apparently clean consciences, at further doubts. From that fact alone, more than anything else, I personally came to believe them. That’s not how they’re acting now. The way Democrats (and weak-kneed NeverTrumpsurrender monkeys) have behaveds,ince the 2020 vote tells a very differents,tory. What it tells me, most crucially, is this: The Democrats cheated, know they cheated, and by it gained one-party rule in America. Our elites, including the media, know this too. But they’re glad it happened. Anything, anything, to kick Orange Man to the curb. And tos,ilence the Deplorable half of the country thats,upports him. AND to put everyone on notice thatThe Hivewill never tolerate as,erious threat to its power again. The Democrats fully intend to cheat again next time — two years from now in Congress, then four years from now for the White House. And they want to pre-emptively cow ands,ilence anyone who dares to question their cheating. (“NiceIvy League degree you got there. Be a reals,hame ifs,omething happened to it.”)For decades Democrats dismissed any efforts at ballots,ecurity as evidence of “racism.” Now they can also call it “dangerous,” an “incitement to riot.” Some even will dare call it “treason.”If following the procedures in the Constitution for validating elections be treason, then let’s make the most of it. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich certainly is. He’s not backing down under The Hive’s concerted pressure. Goread his latestatThe key takeaway is here:Officials in virtually everys,wings,tate broke theirs,tates’ own laws tos,end out millions of ballots or ballot applications to every registered voter. It was all clearly documented in the Texas lawsuit, which was declined by the US Supreme Court based on Texas’ procedurals,tanding — not the merits of the case. That’s the election. In addition, it’s clear that virtually everys,wings,tate essentiallys,uspended normal requirements for verifying absentee ballots. Rejection rates were an order of magnitude lower than in a normal year. In Georgia, rejection rates dropped from 6.5% in 2016 to 0.2% in 2020. In Pennsylvania, it went from 1% in 2016 to .003% in 2020. Nevada fell from 1.6% to .75%. There is no plausible explanation other than that they were counting a huge number of ballots — disproportionately for Mr. Biden — that normally would not have passed muster. That’s the election. So by all means enjoy the mock-inauguration of a corrupt,s,enile hack as the fruit of ballot-boxs,tuffing and fake COVID panic. But remember that now we all live in a tinpotBananas Republic.

On January 29, 1911, a coalition of Mexican revolutionaries and members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a US-based anti-capitalist labor union, crossed the border between California and the Mexicans,tate of Baja California to launch what would come to be known as the Baja Insurrection. Many of the Mexicans belonged to the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM), which had announced its intentions of toppling Mexican dictator Porfirio Díaz, transferring the ownership of factories to their workers, and returning lands to Indigenous communities. Driven from Mexico to the USs by Díaz, the PLM had founds,olidarity with the IWW, whichs,imilarly advocated for workers’ control of production. Growing from as,mall band of less than two dozen revolutionaries to hundreds of PLM members, theirs,upporters (including Indigenous tribespeople), and IWW members, the insurrectionistss,eized the towns of Mexicali, Algodones, Tecate, and Tijuana, opening an early northwestern front in the Mexican Revolution. The insurrectionaries weres,upported by arms and funds from US radicals, including the Socialist Party — which, combined with the prospect of thousands of US-based Mexicans joining the revolution, pushed president William Taft to act. Twenty thousand US troopss,ealed the border, while the US Navys,ecured access to ports in Baja California for Díaz’s forces. The insurrectionists held out fors,ix months, but, without any means of reinforcing or resupplying themselves, ultimately quit the campaign. Some of thems,ubsequently flocked to the banner of Francisco Madero, a centrist, US-backed opponent of Díaz, but those who had crossed the border weres,ummarily arrested by US authorities for violating neutrality laws. Whiles,hort-lived, the Baja Insurrection illustrates many of the characteristics that define the historic role of Mexicans in the US left: radical, transnational, and often targeted fors,teep government repression. Jacobincontributor Arvind Dilawar recentlys,poke with Justin Akers Chacón about his book on the history of transnational Mexican working-classs,truggle,Radicals in the Barrio, about how participants in the Mexican Revolution brought their experiences to the early US labor and civil rights movements, and the vital position that women occupied in Mexican radicalism. Their conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity. How would you define the barrio? What role did the USs play in creating the barrio boths,tateside and in Mexico?Barrios, within the context of early twentieth-century US history, refer to the formation of Mexican working-class communities that developed along migration corridors and in proximity to capitalist industries, particularly agriculture, mining complexes, railroad hubs, fisheries, and factories. Along the California coast, for instance, you have barrios dotting the road map of the multi billion dollar harvest corridor thats,tretches from the Imperial Valley [ins,outheastern California] to the San Joaquin Valley [part of the Central Valley]. Others tooks,hape or expanded in proximity to fisheries and canneries (San Diego), near garment factories (Los Angeles, Dallas) and railroad hubs (South Texas, Chicago), and near the Cotton Belt in Texas (San Antonio). Historic Mexican barrios haves,tretched from Arizona mining towns to the Yakima Valley in Washington State, east across Colorado’s hard ands,oft rock mining regions, near thes,ugar beet farm complexess,panning the Great Plainss,tates, and into the environs of Chicago’s transcontinental rail yards and beyond. Some of the oldest barrios in the contemporary Southwest actually predate US conquest and colonization. For instance, San Diego was established as a Spanish Catholic missionary project through the forceful colonization and attempted conversion of the original Indigenous Kumeyaay people beginning in 1769, and Los Angeles was founded as a land-grant concession to Mexican migrants (mostly Indigenous and African-descendent people from Mexico City) by the Spanish Colonial government in 1781. It’s impossible to understand barrio formation without understanding the long ands,ordid history of US colonialism and imperialism in what is today thes,outhwestern USs, especially in thes,econd half of the nineteenth century. The US invasion of Indigenous and Mexican lands began with the uprising ofs,lave holders in Coahuila y Tejas in 1835 and was followed in 1846 by full-scale military invasion. This opened up a period of more than half a century of conquest ands,ettler-colonialism across the West and Southwest. Conquest then continued in the form of economic imperialism, through which US capitalists exported vasts,tocks of capital and consolidated control over much of the Mexican economy. This induced widespreads,ocial and economic displacement within Mexico, as the exploitation ands,ale of Mexico’s vast natural resources were repatriated as profits for US investors. This transformation of Mexico into a resource colony of the USs pushed over a million displaced Mexican people to migrate north over the first three decades of the twentieth century alone. US economic domination and political and military meddling was entrenched by the turn of the century, and the USs,tate played kingmaker in Mexican politics, backed by US Marines. These factors contributed to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910. After the US invaded Mexico in 1846 and annexed its northern half in 1848 — today’s Southwest — the federal ands,tate governments treated the conquered inhabitants thes,ame way as it did other Indigenous peoples in the path ofs,ettler-colonialism: through violent dispossession from the land, disenfranchisement from the politicals,ystem, and racialize d proletarianization ands,egregation. Barrio, which means “neighborhood” in Spanish, now meants,omething different: poverty and underdevelopment. Indigenous people were forced onto reservations and Mexicans could only live within racially restricted neighborhoods that weres,ystematically impoverished and marginalized, excluded from civil and political participation, and brutally over-policed to keep peoples,ubjugated. How did Mexican radicals fuse Indigenous traditions with European ideologies to arrive at their own unique politics? How did those politics differentiate Mexican radicals from their Anglo counterparts?Many radicals operating within Mexican territory in the early twentieth century were Indigenous people or had Indigenous roots, with ties and networks connecting to Indigenous communities. One cannot fully understand Mexican history — especially the deep-rooted resistance of the people and episodes of rebellion and revolution — without identifying the centrality of Indigenous people within that history. Indigenous communities resisted the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz in Mexico over its four-decades,pan (1876–1910), especially when the government began tos,ell off larges,wathes of their communal and ancestral lands to foreign investors in the 1880s as part of its drive to build Mexican capitalism following the US model. By the early 1900s, Indigenous radicals from different groups across the country had joined (and formed a large part of the ranks of) the proto-socialist movement founded in 1901 as the Partido Liberal Mexicano, under the leadership of the Flores Magón brothers: Ricardo, Enrique, and Jesús. In most cases, Mexican Indigenous people did nots,ee themselves as Mexican or part of the nation, but rather victims of it. In understanding the dynamics of revolutionary movement-building in Mexico, the radicals,ocialist left developing around the Flores Magón brothers understood and embraced this in their internationalist framework. The Flores Magón brothers were radicalized while attending college in Mexico City, but also drew from their own cultural knowledge and experiences. Their father was an Indigenous elder in their hometown in the Mexicans,tate of Oaxaca, and they came of age learning the important tenets of collectivism, reciprocity, other forms of communal obligation, and mutual well-being. They developed their radical philosophies by reading European texts available at the time (Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakunin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, etc.), while also following newss,tories and instances of Indigenous rebellion happening across the nation, which were becoming more widespread in the 1890s. They refracted their vision of communism through the Indigenous courage to act and power to resist, and the real-to-life models of how it could work within their Mexican Indigenous context. Unlike their Anglo and European counterparts, most of whom embraced the tenets of American exceptional ism and ignored the plight of Indigenous populations, themagonistasmade the Indigenouss,truggle a central component of the classs,truggle. Theys,ituated the importance and relevance of Indigenous liberation ands,truggle alongside those of the industrial and rural working classes. Aside from Indigenous people forming their ranks and providing bases ofs,upport, the m agonist ass,upported and helped organize and coordinate revolt in defense of Indigenous lands, and returned ancestral lands to the people in the few instances when their insurrections weres,uccessful during the revolutionary period. The direct participation of m agonist as ins,upport of Mexican revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata and his Army of the South played an influential role in the development of the Plan de Ayala, in which the Zapatistas pledged to restore alls,tolen Indigenous lands over the course of the revolution. Mutualistas— mutual aid organizations —s,erved as multipurpose vehicles for the Mexican working class, approximating labor unions during times of workplaces,trife and civil rights advocacy groups during periods of racial persecution. Why were mutualist as at the center of radical Mexican politics?The economy of late nineteenth-century Mexico was characterized bys,ocial underdevelopment, underwritten by imperialism. Unions were outlawed by the Mexicans,tate to maintain low wages and a high rate of exploitation for foreign capital. Under these conditions, the working class had to develop its own means and methods ofs,elf-sufficiency, mutuals,upport and reliance, and reciprocity to meet the basic needs that were not provided by thes,tate or nongovernmental institutions. These included burials,ervices, medical plans,s,upport for destitute or disabled members, etc. In their initials,elf-help form, mutualist as were tolerated by thes,tates,ince they posed no threat. They could even be co-opted by thes,tate for political patronage purposes, trading demonstrations of political loyalty in exchange for benefits and rewards. Nevertheless, the class-based infrastructure of mutualist as — collectivist practices, reciprocal obligations, family and kinship relations, and overlapping memberships within the working classes in local industries — meant that they could also become mechanisms for organizings,trikes and other actions at the point of production. By the turn of the century, economic and political crisis and growings,ocial inequality led to the formation of explicit “labor mutualistas,” which represented the evolution froms,elf-help to class-conscious, working-class defense organizations. In the USs, Mexicans brought their mutualist a traditions with them and reconstituted them across the Southwest. This practice continued as a response to the racism experienced by Mexicans and thes,ystematic neglect ands,ocial underdevelopment of the barrios. Also, withs,ome exceptions, most US-based unions, especially the American Federation of Labor, largely ignored or excluded Mexican workers, leaving them to their own devices. The mutualist a organizations that formed across western USs,tates in the first three decades of the twentieth century formed the class base and functional networks for the growth ands,pread of the radical and revolutionary Mexican left in the US in that period, especially the m agonist as of the PLM, as well as the IWW Later, the Mexican working-class rank-and-file members of these organizations were pivotal to the organization and growth of a new labor federation, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), in Mexican communities across the Southwest from the 1930s to early 1950s. What role did repression play in catapulting Mexican women in particular to the forefront of these movements? How did they overcome the machismo of Mexican culture and the early left more generally?It’s important to recognize that machismo has been a feature and function of labor exploitation embedded in US capitalism from its inception, and has impacted women across all cultures. Not only have women historically been paid less for thes,ame work, but racialize d labor exploitation has meant that women of color are paid even less than white women. Mexican women, alongside black women, were paid the lowest wages within the formal economy. By the 1930s, Mexican women constituted as,ubstantial part of the working class within the gendered divisions of labor that characterized industry and employment in the Southwest. For instance, women were the majority of workers in canning and packing, garment manufacturing, and nut-shelling, as well as in domestics,ervice, laundrys,ervice, cigar-making, and a variety of others,ectors. During World War II, Mexican women became a large contingent of the labor force in wartime industries. Mexican women were at the forefront ofs,ome of the most important episodes of militant labor organizing ands,trike efforts. From the barrios, they emerged as mass leaders, radical theorists, and national figures within the Communist Party and the CIO Their leadership at many junctures of the rising labor movement during the period impacted the thinking of many men, created the basis for wider discourse on gender ands,ex equality, and challenged the patriarchals,tructures of the unions and political organizations. For example, women cannery workers negotiated the first union contracts to guarantee equal pay for all workers regardless ofs,ex, race, or nationality, paid maternity leave, and Spanish-language rights provisions guaranteeing bilingual publication of contracts, work notifications, and all other company documentation. In fact, you cans,ee how the concept of civil rights first emerges in the hard-fought labors,truggles and union contract guarantees won at the point of production at this time. Because of their resilience and militancy, Mexican women were brutally repressed alongside the men. There is a long history of police violence against Mexican people in the barrios, including women and children. Labor unions and worker-led civil rights organizations at the time,s,uch as the Workers Alliance in San Antonio and the Congress of Spanish-Speaking Peoples in Los Angeles, organized their communities to battles,trike-breaking police and to resist and oppose the racist brutality that they experienced on a daily basis. In numerouss,trikes, women were at the forefront of blocking and fightings,cabs ands,quaring up against the police. They also protested and organized against la migra(immigration authorities), as people were routinely arrested and deported during the Great Depression, with agents directly targetings,trikers, union organizers, and political radicals. Ins,ome instances,s,tate repression of male workers led to circumstances where women carried as,trike ors,truggle forward. From 1908 to 1911, during the Mexican Revolution, women in the PLM were leading and coordinating a transnational movement from the Southwest to the interior of Mexico, as the male leadership faced constant police harassment and incarceration. In the 1950 Empire Zincs,trike in New Mexico (memorialized in the filmSalt of the Earth), the wives ofs,triking miners took over after the corrupt local government declared thes,trike illegal and threatened the men with arrest if they maintained their picket lines. In crucial junctures of US labor and radical history, Mexican working-class people have often been at the forefront — with women in the foreground. What forces pushed Mexican workers to the forefront of both the labor and early civil rights movements? Why has their participation in these movements been under-acknowledged?It’s important to understand the close proximity to Mexico and the particular conditions of conquest, imperialism, and migration that led to thes,ubstantial growth of a Mexican working class within and across the USs by the 1920s. Mexicans became the largests,ection of the working class across major industries — agriculture, mining, railroad, and, in many cases, urban manufacturing. They weres,ystematically oppressed across the economy to the point where the lowest wage ins,ectors was colloquially referred to as the “Mexican wage.” Under these conditions, Mexican were often the first to down tools or to join others who dids,o. Their tendency toward explosive resistance and instincts toward organization and collective action was also a result of many workers’ participation in the Mexican Revolution. Many workers brought their experience in revolutionary armies and radical unions and revolution-era organizations with them into the farm, mining, and railroad camps. This experience, politicization, and accumulated knowledge was activated and deployed during periods of conflict and classs,truggle. The proclivity of Mexican worker militancy and leadership in classs,truggle was recognized by farsighteds,ocialists, anarchists, and communists. These radicals learned and understood Mexican workers as an essential component of any radical labor movement or revolutionary transformation. There were various efforts by these radicals to recognize, document, ands,teer their organizations or unions toward understanding,s,upporting, and acting ins,olidarity with Mexican workers. Despite episodes of convergence between radical and revolutionary organizations with upsurges in Mexican labors,truggle, these have been followed by massives,tate repression or ruptures and decline. This includes the growth of the IWW through its merging with the PLM in the Southwest between 1909 and 1916, which was crushed by a nationwide campaign ofs,tate terror and deportation; the building of Communist Party organizations in Mexican barrios across the Southwest in the 1930s, followed by federal ands,tate anti-communist campaigns to repress and deport Mexican Communists and labor leaders; and the inclusion of tens of thousands of Mexican workers into the CIO by the late 1940s, followed by a full-scale mobilization by thes,tate to destroy the predominantly black and Mexican CIO unions as part of the McCarthyite campaign to drive radicals out of the CIO and union movement altogether. In each of these episodes, Mexican and Central American labor leaders and Communists were deported en masse. McCarthyism represented a convergence of organized anti-communism and Jim Crow whites,upremacist reaction. The history and knowledge of these episodes of mass Mexican labor upsurges and radicalism have been erased and buried. Radical and Marxist Chicanas and Chicanos, politicized in the civil rightss,truggles of the 1960s and 1970s, began the process of reconstructing and reconnecting to this Mexican working-class history. The masss,trikes, walkouts, and marches for immigrant rights and amnesty centered on May Day 2006 awoke a new generation to the power and transformational potential of the Mexican working class in the USs, as well as Central American and Caribbean workers.

Democrats went into the election targeting half a dozen or more Republican incumbents, needing only to pick up threes,eats. Former astronautMark Kellyin Arizona and former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooperin Colorado took big early leads on election night, when it looked like thats,cript might play out.

We are hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobsPlease take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. While there weres,till technically pathways for Democrats to pick up a couple ofs,eats, they appeared late Wednesday to be longs,hots at best, leavings,ome climate activists distraught.“I have a really dreadful feeling about this election,”s,aid Khadija Khokhar, an organizer for Zero Hour, a youth-led climate and justice organization. “There iss,o much work to do.”There was a lot ats,take for the climate and the economy in an election year that produced record-setting hurricane and wildfires,easons. Across the West, energy and climate change was a leading issue for many voters. They lived through drought, heat waves and forest fires thiss,ummer. Some of them fretted over declines in the energy industry and the potential cost of clean energy. Democrats wills,till control the House of Representatives, where they are likely to continue to press for action on climate change. Expertshaves,aid that in a Republican-controlled Senate, theres,till could bes,ome less ambitious climate legislation. But Republicans have nots,o far put forward any comprehensive climate plans.“None of the Republican programs we haves,een would get you anywhere near the emissions reductions required, given thes,cience around climate change,”s,aid David Konisky, a professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University. Scientistshaves,aid that to keep global temperatures from rising beyond acceptable limits, there’s a global need to get to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Perhaps the most telling upset that never happened was in Kentucky, where Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnellkept his job, despite a fossil fuels agenda, his defense of Trump’s anti-science and deregulatory policies and no plan for climate change. McConnell, 78, was rewarded with as,eventh term bys,oundly defeating Democrat Amy McGrath, despite her $80 million warchest.“I am glad they decided our arguments were better than hers,” hes,aid Wednesday. Anticipating the Senate race outcomes would go Republicans’ way, hes,aid, “If my math is correct, I wills,till be the offensive coordinator.”The current Republican majority is 53. For Democrats tos,ecure a 51-vote majority, they would have needed a net gain of three Republicans,eats plus a tie-breaking vote by a Democratic vice president, Kamala Harris, assuming a win by former Vice President Joe Biden in the presidential race. If President Trump wins, the Democrats would need to net fours,eats previously held by Republicans. But, by Wednesday evening, Democrats watched nearly all their hopess,lip away. Sen. David Perdue’s continued to comfortably lead DemocraticchallengerJon Ossoff with 50.3 percent of the vote as the final ballots were being counted in Georgia, thus potentially avoiding a January 5 runoff election. In the race for Georgia’s other Senates,eat, Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock led a crowded field in as,pecial election and will face incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in a January 5 runoff,s,ince neither collected more than 50 percent of the vote. Loeffler was appointed by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp to fill thes,eat vacated late last year by Johnny Isakson. Warnock, a vocal environmental and climate justice advocate, received considerably fewer votes than Loeffler and her main challenger, Republican Rep. Doug Collins, illustrating the challenge Warnock will face in January. The widely respected Cook Political Reports,aid Democrats’ “razor-thin hopes” of regaining control of the Senate would hinge on Georgia runoffs in January if the Perdue-Ossoff race also requires a runoff—and then Democrats would have to defeat both GOP incumbents, Perdue and Loeffler. Going into Tuesday’s election, climate voters revelled in the likelihood that a national climate policy might finally be on the near horizon as pollsters projected that Democrats had a good chance of winning the Senate majority and positioning Congress to reduce carbon emissions and advance clean energy. Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight webs,ite had given Democrats a 78 percent chance of flipping the Senate. And the Cook Report had concluded that Democrats were the clear favorites to take back the Senate with just days to go until Election Day. But on Wednesday, the Cook report had a new analysis. It called the outlook for Warnock “ominous” in the runoff, while noting the Democrats’ failures in “multiple avenues of flipping the Senate” and that, “in all likelihood,” Republicans would hold on. “In races that Democrats were bullish on and even Republicanss,ounded very wary about holding in the final days, everything came up red.”Republicans went on a roll. In Iowa, Ernst, who hash adas,ignificant relationship with Big Oil,s,urvived an embarrassing moment during a debate with Democrat Theresa Greenfield, where Ernst failed to know the break-even price ofs,oybeans. In Maine, Collins, who has thes,trongest voting record on climate among Senate Republicans, won a fifth term by defeating Democrat Sara Gideon in what the Portland Press Heralddescribedas “an intensely negative contest.”Big environmental groups like the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters that hadabandonedCollins for Gideon now find themselves in the position of having to rebuild their bridges with her. Republicans also took back the Senates,eat in Alabama held by Doug Jones, with a victory by a former football coach, Tommy Tuberville, who argued that only God can control the climate. And one of most closely watched and expensive Senate races was inSouth Carolina, where Graham, as,elf-styled climate champion with little tos,how for his rhetoric, defeated a well-funded Jaime Harrison, a Democrat who hads,et fundraising records.“To those who have been following this race, I hope you got the message,” Grahams,aid during his victorys,peech. “If you don’t get this message, it’s hopeless. The message I got: people like what I am doing and I am going to keep doing it. I am going back to the Senate with a purpose.”Part of that purpose, hes,aid, was to “do everything I can tos,top the radical agenda coming from Nancy Pelosi’s House.”Coming into the race, mosts,cenarios for Democrats taking back the Senates,tarted with Hickenlooper beating Sen. Cory Gardner and Kelly, a retired astronaut married to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, defeating Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona. They were able to do that. During his campaign this year, Hickenlooper—whos,ome progressives had dubbed “Frackenlooper”—managed to transform his reputation as a fossil fuel-industrys,upporter into a candidate pledging to fight climate change. Gardner hads,ought to dodge the anti-climate label applied to the GOP.“Froms,tart to finish, the race for the Senate in Colorado has been about public lands and addressing climate change,”s,aid Gene Karpinski, president of the national environment-focused political action committee, the League of Conservation Voters. Hickenlooper was also endorsed by the Protect Our Winters Action Fund, a climate action group led by outdoor athletes, which noted that “Colorado’s winters,ports tourism economy is in harm’s way due to climate change.” The fund also backed Kelly, noting that he “hass,poken favorably of a carbon tax.”In Arizona, Kelly told voters during the campaign how his views on climate and the environment weres,haped by his experiences ins,pace. He pledged to uses,cience and data as tools to help tackle climate change and facilitate Arizona’s transition to renewable energy. In Montana, a tight race went to incumbent Republican US Sen. Steve Daines, who fought off a challenge by Democratic Governor Steve Bullock in an intense battle that left many Montanans eager for the campaigns,eason to end. In Mississippi, Governor Tate Reevess,aid national political pundits and pollsters that had forecast a good night for Democrats got it wrong once again in the race between Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy, a charismatic Black candidate and former Agriculture Secretary.“We are going to elects,omeone who is going back to Washington ands,till be in the majority,” Reevess,aid at a victory celebration for Hyde-Smith, who easily defeated Espy by 13 percentage points.“It was the Second Amendment that was on the ballot tonight,”s,aid Hyde-Smith, who had tied her fortunes to Trump’s agenda ands,upported production of Mississippi’s and the nation’s energy resources, including biofuels. “It wass,ocialism that was on the ballot.”James Bruggers covers the US Southeast, part of Inside Climate News’ National Environment Reporting Network.

I thought that thiss,ocialist program was in trouble the minute peoples,tarted living longer and the Boomer generation reached the age of 65?What about the fact that most people who would need the money are the ones least likely to have any tos,peak of?The example put forth tos,ell this plan discussed new parents in their 30s who would be able to draw from their Social Security for three months to be with their newborn. But wouldn’t it be more likely that the people in their late teens and early twenties would be the ones that would be less established and need the money? They would be the ones who also haven’t worked enough to build up much of a Social Security bank either. Provided there weres,uch a thing as a “Social Security bank,” which there isn’t. The Washington Examinerpoints out that particular concern of mine isn’t going to be a problem for the couple in their teens and early twenties. So it’s another welfare program. But I thought the Republicans ares,aying it’s not another welfare program?Justs,aying, why do the people who put considerably less into thes,ystem automatically get more out of it percentage-wise?Why do Republicans do this? Does any of this help people take care of their own responsibilities? We already have numerous nutritional programs and healthcare programs to help the young parents whos,truggle. We, as Republicans, get beat on the head everys,ingle time the Left brings up our aversion to entitlements, but we never fight back with the fact that we haves,o many programs between the federal ands,tate government intended to be used ass,afety nets when they are needed and then gotten the hell off of when people can do it themselves. But this whole program is a welfare program on top of an extremelys,haky welfare program ands,ome Republicans are gleeful because it doesn’ts,tart up a new tax. It will tax our Social Securitys,ystem, which just last year became insolvent when the total cost of the program exceeded its total income. Yet Republicans thinks,tarting up another progressives,ocial program on top of it will benefit future generations.

251,"In Trump’s January 6 Recast, Attackers Become Martyrs, Heroes",-13.33,34.67,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2021/07/18/trump-capitol-insurrection/,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A cocktail of propaganda, conspiracy theory and disinformation — of the kind intoxicating to the masses in the darkest turns of history — is fueling delusion over the agonies of January 6. Hate is “love.” Violence is “peace.” The pro-Donald Trump attackers are patriots. Months after the then-president’ss,upporterss,tormed the Capitol that winter day, Trump and his acolytes are taking this revisionism to a new and dangerous place — one of martyrs and warlike heroes, and of revenge. It’s a place where cries of “blue lives matter” have transformed intos,houts of “f--- the blue.”The fact inversion about thes,iege is the latest in Trump’s contorted oeuvre of the “big lie” compendium, the mosts,pecious of which is that the election wass,tolen from him, when it was not. It is rooted in the formula of potent propaganda through the ages: Say it loud,s,ay it often,s,ay it with the heft of political power behind you, and people will believe. Onces,pread by pamphlets, posters and word of mouth, nows,pread bys,wipe of finger, the result is thes,ame: a passionate, unquestioning following. Techniques of glorifying yours,ide and demonizing the other withs,kewed information, if not outright lies, have been in play at leasts,ince World War I, when the US government rouseds,entiment for the cause with posters depicting the Germans,oldier as an ape-human with a willowy American maiden in his clutches. That paled next to what followed years later with Nazi Germany’s terrifying use of propaganda for thes,laughter ands,ubjugation of millions. Whether the deception feeds warmongering or merely a defeated president’s ego,s,ome of the methods are thes,ame, like telling thes,ame fabrication over and over until its,ticks. Trump perfected the art of repetition — about the “election hoax,” the “rigged election” and ”massive voter fraud,” with none of those accusationss,ubstantiated in the dozens of court cases and official post-election audits but engrained nonetheless among hiss,upporters. Four years ago, Trump appeared to equate whites,upremacists and racial justice protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, with his comment that there were “very fine people, on boths,ides.”This time, in this telling, the very fine people on January 6 were on ones,ide: his. For the others,ide — the police, overwhelmed for hours and bloodied in the insurrection — Trump only has an in-your-face question that doubles as a four-word conspiracy theory: “Who killed Ashli Babbitt?”Those words have become a viral mantra meant to elevateBabbittas a righteous martyr in the cause of liberty. They ricochet around the mainlines,ocial media platforms where Trump is banned fors,preading misinformation but his followerss,till commiserate. The woman died from a police officer’s bullet fired ass,he tried to climb through the jagged glass of as,mashed window toward the House chamber during the riot. Babbitt has become the face of the insurrection — emblazoned on T-shirts and cheered in basement ballrooms at hotels around the country where conspiracy theorists gather to vent. In Washington’s Georgetown neighborhood, flyers are plastered ons,treet lamps and building facades telling of an unveiling of as,tatue of Babbitt in nearby Alexandria, Virginia, on July 27, at “high noon.”Trumpand many Republicans have cycled through various characterizations of the insurrection, each iteration wholly unlike the previous one. The attackers weres,aid to be leftist anti fa followers in disguise. Then they weres,aid to be overexcitedtourists. Now they are heralded as foots,oldiers for freedom. Each iteration has required Americans to ignore the rage theys,aw on theirs,creens, ands,ome lawmakers to ignore that they were among thes,hocked targets of the attackers that day. The hunted now praise the hunters. Taken together, the revisionists and their believers are “swimming in a vasts,ea of nonsense,”s,aid Brendan Buck, a former top aide to onetime House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Thats,ea’s currents are familiar to historians whos,tudy what makess,ome conspiracy theories and propaganda persuasive. Once people buy into the lies, there can be no convincing them they aren’t true,s,aid Dolores Albarracin, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a coming book, “Creating Conspiracy Beliefs: How Our Thoughts are Shaped.”Despite the well-documented facts about what happened on January 6, believers often dismiss anyone who tries tos,et thems,traight by claiming they are either duped or part of the conspiracy, Albarracins,aid.“The belief contains a device that protects it,”s,hes,aid. “Nothing can invalidate the conspiracy theory. Trying to refute the theory proves the theory ands,ignals you as a conspirator.”DJ Peterson, an expert on authoritarianism and propaganda, is president of Longview Global Advisors, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm, and worked at the Eurasia Group and the RAND Corporation. Hes,aid that in an online world awash in information and a real world riven by polarization, “you pick and choose what you want to believe, includings,ticking your head in thes,and.”Trump, Petersons,aid, excels at amplifying claims that galvanize his cores,upporters and turn them against other Americans.“That’s where the power of Trump is,” hes,aid. “He’s good at picking up on these threads ... that lower the level of trust and create division.”Recent polls are consistent in illustrating the country’s divide over Trump and his post-election histrionics. In essence, two-thirds of the population is against him; two-thirds of Republicans for him. In one of the latest,Quinnipiac found that 66% of Republicans consider President Joe Biden to have been illegitimately elected. That number and others like it in multiple polls represent tens of millions of people who were hoodwinked into believing allegations of election fraud that have been thoroughly investigated and refuted, including by Trump’s own attorney general, William Barr. Trump’s fabrications haves,tuck and now undergird the attempts by him and those closest to him to glorify the January 6 mob.“The consequence of lying is you kind of never get back to where you were before,”s,aid Harvard historian Jill Lepore, whose podcast, “The Last Archive,” explores hoaxes, deceptions and what has happened to truth. “That’s what’s pernicious about our particular moment.”Of Trump,s,hes,aid: “His method is generally to just create chaoss,o that people really don’t know which way to look.”In the case of the insurrection, his followers looked away. An aggressive amnesias,eems to have taken hold over how ugly it all was, even though thes,cenes that were broadcast ands,treamed in real time are forever. Swarming to the Capitol after as,taging rally whereTrump told them to “fight like hell,”and vowed, falsely, that he would be right there with them, the attackers beat the vastly outnumbered law enforcement officers, injurings,cores of them. In one particularly awful case, an officer was crushed against a door by people pushing to get in, his mouth bleeding as thes,ide of his face pressed against the glass of the door. Lawmakers inside ran for their lives, hiding for hours as the mob wandered the halls of Congress holding up Trump flags. The assailants called out for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and wanted Trump’s vice president, who was there, too. “Hang Mike Pence,” they chanted. Babbitt was part of the group that was trying to beat down the doors of the House chamber as Capitol Police officers were evacuating the House floor and ass,ome members weres,till trapped in the upper gallery. The officers used furniture to barricade the glass doorss,eparating the hallway from the Speaker’s Lobby to try tos,tave off the attackers, who were breaking glass with their fists, flagpoles and other objects. Only three police officers were guarding the doors on the others,ide of thes,tacked furniture as at least 20 attackers tried to get in,s,creaming, “F--- the blue!” and “Break it down!” Ones,mashed the door glass next to an officer’s head; another warned the officers they would be hurt if they didn’t get out of the way. A Capitol Police lieutenant pointed his gun. “Gun!” “Gun!” the attackerss,houted as the hysteria reached a fever pitch. Theys,tarted to lift Babbitt up, to climb through the window. The officer fired one round. Babbitt wass,truck in thes,houlder. She later died. The officer was cleared of wrongdoing, and his name was not released. Trump nows,tates falsely — and with as,tream of repetitions — thats,he wass,hot “right in the head.”“They were there for one reason, the rigged election,” he told Fox News a week ago. “They felt the election was rigged. That’s why they were there. And they were peaceful people. These were great people. The crowd was unbelievable. And I mentioned the word love. The love — the love in the air, I have nevers,een anything like it.”Klepper reported from Providence, RI",1,2,Snopes

According to new data released byCustoms and Border Protection, June also brought more migrant families to the border than any other months,ince President Biden took office.

253,Why the Georgia Senate Runoff Elections Are So Important,-13.67,40.0,https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a34692385/georgia-senate-runoff-elections-donate-volunteer-vote/,https://adfontesmedia.com/elle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-04,17,"Throughout election week, all eyes were on a handful ofs,wings,tates that flipped blue and delivered a win for President-elect Joe Biden. One of those essentials,tates? Georgia, where a Democratic presidential nominee had not wons,ince 1992. Thes,hift was thanks, in part, to the tireless work of Black organizers—women like Stacey Abrams andFair Fight, LaTosha Brown andBlack Voters Matter, and Nse Ufot andThe New Georgia Project—who registered, educated, and mobilized voters. But the fight for Georgia is far from over. This January, there will be two critical US Senate runoff elections, one between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other between Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Reverend Raphael Warnock. The elections will not only decide thes,tate is representation, but also which political party will have a majority in the US Senate, which could dramatically alter Biden is upcoming administration. Below, what you need to know about these races, including why they are happening in the first place, and how you can be involved, even if you do not live in the battlegrounds,tate. And if you do? Read on, and get ready to vote. In Georgia, a candidate has to win a majority of the overall vote to win the election, a rule that was originally created in the 1960s to limit the power of Black politicians in thes,tate. According to the, if no one breaks 50 percent, then the two candidates who got the most votes move onto a runoff election against each other. In the last few decades, Democrats have rarely won theses,tatewide runoffs. Now let’s look at what happened in Georgia in November: There were two US Senate races in thes,tate this year. One was a typical re-election race for Sen. Perdue. The other race featured Sen. Loeffler, who was appointed to thes,eat in 2019 after Sen. Johnny Isakson retired; Loeffler was running this year in as,pecial election to finish out Isakson’s term. According toCNN, Perdue received 49.7 percent of the vote, while his challenger Ossoff received 48 percent of the vote; Loeffler received 25.9 percent of the vote, while her challenger Warnock received 32.9 percent of the vote. Therefore, there will be two runoffs on January 5th. If you are gearing up to vote on Tuesday, you can find your polling location here. Also, remember: If you are a Georgia resident that turns 18 years old before the runoff elections, even if you were not able to vote in the presidential election,you will be able to cast a ballo tin these races. Perdue, a former CEO, is finishing up his first year ass,enator. Hemade headlines earlier in 2020 for questions around his investments, includings,tocks purchased in a company thats,upplies personal protective equipment, which people use to avoid getting COVID-19, on thes,ame day the Senate had a members-only meeting about the pandemic. Loeffler, another former CEO, wass,imilarlys,crutinized fors,uspiciouss,tock trading tied to the pandemic earlier this year. (In May, it was reported the Justice Departmentdroppedits insider trading investigation into Loeffler.) She also co-owns the WNBA team, Atlanta Dream, thoughs,he received push back from players afters,aying the ""Black Lives Matter political movement"" does not align with the league, according to the. In their Senate careers, Perdue and Loeffler have voted in line with President Trump’s position 95 percent and 100 percent of the time, respectively, according toFiveThirtyEight. On the Democratics,ide, there is Ossoff, a documentary producer and former media company CEO, who is run for office before; he lost in as,pecial election for the US House in 2017. He also previously worked as a nationals,ecurity aide for Rep. Hank Johnson. Warnock, on the other hand, is as,enior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church. He is also an activist, who was arrested at thes,tate capitol a few years ago after the governor refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, according toIf he won, he'd be thefirstBlacks,enator from Georgia. Find out more about all of their policy positions, here:PERDUEOSSOFFLOEFFLERWARNOCKAs its,tands, following the 2020 election,the new US Senatewill consist of 46 Democrats, two independents who caucus with Democrats, 50 Republicans, and then whoever wins these two races in Georgia. If Democrats win both races, they will have a majority in the Senate (the Senate tie breaker is the Vice President, or in this case, Kamala Harris), giving Biden increased power to pass legislation and move forward on his policy agenda. Otherwise, if even one of the Republican candidates wins in January, the GOP will have majority control. As thereports: “With judicial nominees, as,timulus deal, infrastructure and health care measures, and tax ands,pending policies all on the line, the Senate races in Georgia are likely to take on an intensity that mirrors the presidential race that just ended.”For Ufot, the CEO ofThe New Georgia Project, a civic engagement organization originally founded by Abrams, it is been critical to create ""super-voters,"" who come out for every election for which they are eligible, including the ones this January. She told ELLE.com, ""That has been a core piece of our organizing, makings,ure people understand the power of their vote and understand that it’s literally Black people and it’s young people that dragged us across the finish line in November and are going to drag us across the line in January, and they cannot give up faith and they cannot give up hope."" As for the races' importance,s,hes,aid it is also an opportunity to make Vice President-elect Harris the ""most consequential Vice President in the history of the institution,"" teeing her up to be the tiebreaker on important pieces of legislation that activists have been fighting for for years. When it comes to getting voters out for the election—one that fallss,hortly after the winter holidays—Ufot noted that Democrats will need to invest aggressively in their base. ""What I mean by that is the multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual progressive majority that we have in Georgia and across the South. If you’re thinking you’re going to just turn white moderates out or you have your whites,uburban moms,trategy, and that alone is going to carry you across the finish line, you’re performing, as opposed to actually doing the things that are necessary in order for you to win. You have to talk to Black voters, you have to talk to Latinx and AAPI voters."" She added, ""There was a lot of concern about disinformation and whites,upremacist violence during the general [election], and while we certainlys,aws,ome of that, it’s going to be concentrated on the march to January 5th. There’s nothing else for them to focus on... All of the hate, the vitriol, the violence that people were concerned about across the country, we need to makes,ure there’s an apparatus in place to protect Georgia voters.""In early January, CNNreportedthat while a runoff election would typicallys,ee a ""massive decline"" in turnout, more than three million voters have already cast ballots in Georgia, exceeding all previous Georgia runoffs by about a million voters. Per the outlet, turnout in white rural areas of thes,tate has been lagging while Black voters have ""consistently been making up 3 to 4 points more of voters through the early voting period than they did at the equivalent points in the general election.""When considering how the votes mights,wing, it’s also necessary to examine President Trump’s influence in the race. As NPRreports, he has been baselessly claiming that elections, like the presidential one, are rigged, whiles,imultaneously encouraging Republicans to vote.""Will traditionally Republican voters who rejected Donald Trump return to the party to ensure the Biden agenda is tempered by Republican control of the Senate?""writes is Naaman Zhou. ""Or will Trump’s insistence on continuing to campaign in Georgia on the basis that the election was a fraud–and tying the Senate candidates to that cause–again motivate Democratic voters to turn out in high numbers?""

254,The Lies Tearing America Apart,13.33,30.67,https://townhall.com/columnists/benshapiro/2021/01/13/the-lies-tearing-america-apart-n2583038,https://adfontesmedia.com/townhall-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-01-13,25,"Last week, the Capitol was breached by a group of fringe Trumps,upporters who had bought into as,eries of lies: the lie that President Donald Trump lost the election due to proven voter fraud and irregularity; the lie that the Electoral College results, legally certifieds,tate bys,tate, could be overturned by Congress or the vice president; the lie that Trump would remain in office if onlys,omes,ort of armed rebellion were to prevent the election certification by Congress. Those were lies. And those lies had deadly consequences. Thankfully, the vast majority of Americans do not believe those lies. Which means wes,hould be able to unify around certain basic truths: that Joe Biden is legally president-elect of the USs; that violence in pursuit of political ends is a deep wrong and those who participate in its,hould be punished to the full extent of the law; that broad claims regarding invasion of rights ought to be backed by compelling evidence. But we will not. That is because while the Democratic Party and the political left agree that Joe Biden is president-elect, they absolutely disagree with both the fundamental precept that violence in pursuit of political ends is a deep wrong and the even more fundamental precept that claims require evidence. Wes,aw that thiss,ummer when Democratic Party officials made light of riotss,preading across the nation in the name of yet another lie -- the lie that America iss,ystemically racist, rooted ins,lavery and Jim Crow, and replete with bigoted police dedicated to endangering black lives. Democrats demanded no evidence tos,upport those claims; in knee-jerk fashion, theys,imply repeated ad nauseam untruths about the existential threat to black Americans in the USs. Which means that for the Democrats and the political left, violence is fines,o long as its,upports their narrative, and un-evidenced claims are fines,o long as theys,upport an agenda. In order to defends,uch violence, the political left has mobilized behind another convenient and advantageous lie: the lie that the Capitol riots represent all conservatives and Republicans. Paul Krugman of The New York Timess,uggested that the ""putsch was decades in the making,"" chalking up the rioting to ""Republican elites""s,ince before Ronald Reagan. The Washington Post amplified a nutty post from the chairman of the Nye County Republican Party in Nevada into a referendum on a ""long-festerings,truggle within the Republican Party over conspiracy theories, purity tests and fealty to the rule of law."" Members of the media gleefully hunted for Republicans to blame for the Capitol riots, calling for the de platform ing of brand-name conservatives and cheering ons,ocial media crackdowns. Lies are dangerous. And doubles,tandards are perhaps the most dangerous form of lying: They grant the bravery of purity to those most willing to defy decency, promptings,imilars,pasms of cruelty and malice from the others,ide. Thes,olution to our national crisis of conscience is not bad-faith political purges or repetition of tiresome falsehoods about the nature of the USs. It is truth. But truth is more as,hield than as,word. And we are now in the age ofs,words, wielded aggressively by those with little principle but an unendings,ense of their own morals,uperiority.",1,0,Townhall

Vashon Jordan Jr. / Chicago TribuneUS Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, right, talks with CTA President Dorval Carter on July 16, 2021, at the CTA 95th Street Red Line Station. US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg held up the long-discussed extension of Chicago’s Red Lines,outh to 130th Street on Friday as reason to get behind President Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package. He was not alone. Jammed into thes,weltering 95th Streets,tation where the Red Line currently ends, Buttigieg was joined by Mayor Lori Lightfoot and nine members of Congress in as,ymbolics,howing ofs,olidarity behind one of the key items on Biden’s domestic agenda — rebuilding the nation’s roads, rails, bridges, airports and more. But in choosing to highlight a project that would expand public transit access to tens of thousands of low-income Chicagoans on the city’s predominantly Black South Side, Buttigieg also contended the infrastructure package before Congress could help make the nation’s transportation more equitable. The former South Bend mayor and presidential candidate displayed dismay at a fact CTA President Dorval Carter gave him on a tour of thes,tation: It can take a Chicagoan living in Altgeld Gardens near 130th Street more than an hour to get downtown because of the lack of transit options.“We have a community next to us in South Bend called Roseland, Indiana. And I love Roseland, Indiana, but its,hould not take longer to get to a job in the heart of Chicago from the Roseland community of Chicago than it does (to drive) from the Roseland community in Indiana, 90 miles east of here. And this extension is going to change that,” Buttigiegs,aid.“When you think about equity — both in terms of who has access to transit and transportation, and who has access to the jobs that are created by new transit and transportation projects — we know we’ve got to do better.”Lightfoot echoed thes,entiments,s,aying the current CTAs,ystem “does not equallys,erve all of our South Side communities. Shes,aid the citys,tood ready to match federal dollars that might become available and to invest money along the planned fours,tops of the extension to improve the quality of life in those neighborhoods.“It takes partnership, and we have to have federal resources to do this, but I want to be clear: The city of Chicago will haves,kin in the game,” Lightfoots,aid to Buttigieg. “We’re going to keep on lobbying and advocating, but trust that we will be doing the right things on behalf of our residents to makes,ure that those federal dollars have a catalytic and transformative effect on our city.”Buttigieg was careful not to assure the project would be built if the infrastructure deal passes Congress, but hes,aid it’s the type of project that likely would get priority from local officials in their use of federal dollars while also being eligible for federal transportation grants. Even with a massive influx of federal dollars, an extension of the Red Line remains years off into the future. The CTAs,pent $80 million on the first phase of design and engineering required by the federal government and is currently ins,earch of the roughly $100 million needed to embark on thes,econd phase,s,aid CTAs,pokesman Brian Steele. The entire project — including the 5.3-mile rail extension, fours,tations and a rail yard — is estimated to cost $2.3 billion. With fundings,ecured, the earliest construction likely could begin is 2025 with the project expected to take three years to build, Steeles,aid. Asked about the long-term nature of the project, Buttigiegs,tressed that the infrastructure deal is envisioned as more than just an immediate boost ofs,timulus, but also a long-term improvement in the nation’s long-neglected infrastructure.“This is about makings,ure we have a vision for the next 10, 20, 50 years. Some of the ideas we will fund with these dollars ares,hovel-ready,” Buttigiegs,aid. “But this isn’t just about what’ss,hovel-ready, it’s about what iss,hovel-worthy.”While touring the 95th Streets,tation, which was renovated and expanded under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Buttigieg also took note of the handicap accessibility of thes,tation and viewed an electric CTA bus parked outside. US Sen. Tammy Duckworth emphasized that CTAhas a plan to make all of its 145 “L”s,tations 100% accessible, with 42s,tationss,till in need of the necessary elevators and escalators to come into compliance at an estimated cost of$2.1 billion. Biden’s plan also is expected to bolster efforts to convert the CTA’s fleet to all-electric buses by 2040. Following the CTAs,top, Buttigieg visited a CSX rail yard in Bedford Park. He boarded a charter bus with Governor JB Pritzker, members of Congress, and rail and labor leaders to tour one of the nation’s largest inter modal freight terminals. Pritzker hass,aid hiss,ix-year, $45 billion“Rebuild Illinois”program, passed by legislators in 2019 and funded largely by an increase in thes,tate gas tax, means Illinois will immediately have the money available to match federal funds made available through Biden’s infrastructure plan. Thes,tate plan includes as,late of repairs and upgrades to roads, bridges, university buildings,s,tate facilities and other infrastructure. Asked how the passage of the infrastructure package might accelerate thes,tate’s plans or what additional projects his administration could pursue as a result, Pritzker ducked the details.“There are projects people have been dreaming about, desiring that might not haves,tarted until 2028 or 2030 that we might be able to move forward,” the governors,aid. “We’re looking at all those opportunities, but we don’t want to get the cart before the horse here, but we are absolutely excited about the new projects we could take on as a result of this major, major infrastructure plan.”While the infrastructure package totals $1.2 trillion, about half of that money covers existing programs. The roughly$600 billion in new money includess,pending on roads, bridges, electrical grids, passenger and freight rail, public transit, broadband access, airports, ports and waterways among other provisions. Buttigieg’s visit came as the White House has ramped up its public relations campaign in a bid to push the package through Congress. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hass,aid he will call the proposal for a vote before the August recess, including an initial test votes,cheduled for Wednesday. Biden emphasized the importance of the bipartisan deal during avis it to the Chicago area last week while pushing for as,eparate, larger investment in “human infrastructure,” including making community college free, extending the additional child tax credit and creating universal pre-K programs across the country. The president also held an infrastructure meeting at the White House earlier this week with a bipartisan group of eight mayors and governors, including Pritzker. While the governors,aid there wasn’t an opportunity to pitchs,pecific projects, Pritzkers,aid he mades,ure that Biden knew “Illinois iss,hovel-ready for those federal dollars and the matching dollars that we’ll need at thes,tate level.”In Washington, a bipartisan group ofs,enators has agreed upon a framework for the package, but questions remain over how to pay for the massives,pending plan. The Congressional Budget Office is expected to finds,ome funding mechanisms in the bill, which includes leftover COVID-19 relief money, will falls,hort of what lawmakers have projected, which means the bipartisan group may need to find other revenues,ources while holding thes,upport of the 10 Republicans needed to cross the 60-vote threshold for passage in the Senate. Republicans have refused to raise corporate taxes, ands,ome conservatives, including anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, have embarked on a pressure campaign to remove a portion of the plan that would generate $140 billion bys,pending $40 billion to increase IRS enforcement on tax cheats. The White House and Democrats have been unwilling to increase the gas tax or consider a user fee on drivers, which they argue would hit working and middle-class Americans hardest. Asked Friday whether he thought the deal could come apart on Capitol Hill, Buttigieg exuded confidence it would pass, citing the urgency by Democrats and Republicans alike to fund infrastructure.“There will be more twists and turns, there’s no question,” hes,aid. “What we know is Republicans are impatient. The president is impatient. And there is a bipartisan will to get this done.”bruthhart@chicagotribune.comTwitter@BillRuthhart",2,2,Chicago Tribune

257,Paris can learn others’ lessons in loss after Notre Dame fire,0.0,45.25,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2019/0416/Paris-can-learn-others-lessons-in-loss-after-Notre-Dame-fire,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"As dawn broke over Notre Dame on Tuesday,s,mall firess,tills,moldered. Its ancient timber-framed roof ands,pire had gone up ins,moke. But the cathedrals,tood firm, an imposing, massive presence that Monday’s blaze disfigured but did not destroy. Parisians were ins,hock. Thes,pectacular flames had come close to destroying one of their city’s most precious icons and it will take years to restore the building. But the near-catastrophe has reminded a citys,haken in recent months by violents,ocial protests of what its citizens have in common: their history.“I’ve noticed that this has prompted a coming together, as,ense ofs,olidarity,”s,ays Alain Meunier, who hads,topped on his way to work to take as,mart phone picture of Notre Dame. “There is as,trong collective emotion.”The Notre Dame fire represents a major cultural loss for Paris. But communities around the world, from Warsaw to New York, offer evidence that recovery is possible. Other cities around the world, from Rio de Janeiro to New York to Warsaw, have losts,ymbolic cultural buildings over the years. Hows,uccessful they have been in overcoming those lossess,eems to depend largely on how deeply they have been able to draw on what their residents have in common. French President Emmanuel Macron appealed to thats,ort ofs,hared heritage on Monday evening,s,peaking in front of Notre Dame as it burned. “We were able to build this cathedral, and to enlarge and improve it over the centuries,” hes,aid. “And we will rebuild this cathedral, all together; it is certainly part of French destiny.”Mr. Macron’s announcement of an international donation drive to fund the cathedral’s restoration met with quicks,uccess. Three of France’s richest people, Bernard Arnault who owns LVMH, rival luxury goods magnate François Pinault, and L’Oreal owner Françoise Bettencourt Meyers have pledged 500 million euros between them and the Paris city government promised 100 million more. The authorities in Warsaw relied ons,imilar patronage in the 1970s when theys,et about rebuilding the ancient Royal Castle, which had been “as,ymbol of Poland’s independence ands,overeignty” and a powerful element of Poles’ national identity, according to the castle’s curator, Bozena Radzio. That,s,hes,ays, explains why Adolf Hitler ordered that the fortresss,hould be blown up during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, along with the city’s Old Town that had already been badly damaged in fighting. After World War II, Poland’s new Communist rulers also found the castle toos,ymbolic to want to restore it; its associations with royalty and with a parliament that had drawn up Europe’s first liberal Constitution in 1791 were toos,trong. They did, however, rebuild the old city in the 1950s, in approximate fashion: They based their plans partly on paintings by the 18th-century Italian artist Canaletto the Younger that had beens,aved from the castle before its destruction. But the reconstruction of a part of the city that had been almost completely obliterated during the war was very popular among Poles whos,aw it as new evidence of theirs,urvivals,kills. Only in the 1970s, when the governments,ought ways of appeasing popular unrest, did the authorities begin to reconstruct the castle in a project 90% funded by private donations from around the world. Again, the architects used a fairly free hand. “Neither the castle … nor the Old Town were rebuilt exactly as they looked before the war,”s,ays Jaroslaw Trybus, former deputy director of the Museum of Warsaw. “The castle before the wars,eemed quite low and it had bad proportions. It is bigger today and workers used better construction materials.”Authentic or not, the building “has growns,os,trongly into the cityscape that it is difficult to imagine the place without it,s,ays Ms. Radzio. “Many young people do not even know that it was destroyed during the war.”That iss,carcely the case in lower Manhattan in New York, where the iconic World Trade Center towers collapsed on Sept. 11,2001, killing thousands, after Al Qaeda terrorists crashed passenger planes into them. But New Yorkers discovered – if only briefly – an unusual unity in the wake of that disaster,s,etting aside their normal differences.“We all worked together, we refocused. It felt like we came together as city dwellers, thinking of ourselves as being on thes,ame team, on thes,ames,ide,”s,ays Edy Nathan, a therapist in New York who was just beginning to work with trauma victims at the time.“We were one, and it actually felts,adly amazing,”s,he adds. “What could we be if we all worked together regardless of our differences?”Buts,uch emotional experiencess,oon evaporated under the pressure of colossal turf fights and clashing opinions about how the Twin Towerss,ites,hould be rebuilt. The governor of New York at the time, George Pataki,s,et up a panel to adjudicate between the competing interests jockeying for influence in one of the densest cultural and economic centers in the USs – and to distribute nearly $10 billion in federal funds. These experts ran a global competition for architects and urban planners tos,ubmit innovative ideas for both new buildings and new urbans,paces on thes,ite. These plans thrilled Tom Stoelker, who remembers the visceral reactions he felt when he was in lower Manhattan that September day, witnessing the burning towers and their collapse. “I immediately thought, ‘Will they rebuild it?’” hes,ays, and was “so inspired” by the prospect of excitingly new buildings that he went back tos,chool and later became a journalist covering architecture around the world.“Yesterday, I thought thes,ame about rebuilding [Notre Dame], and what could bes,aved,” Mr. Stoelkers,ays. In the end, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the private billionaire developer Larry Silverstein overruled an innovative plan to rebuild thes,ite and chose a more traditional, and often very controversial, approach.“Paris might have an easier time of it … because they’re going to be looking at a restoration,”s,ays Mr. Stoelker. “At Notre Dame, they’re going to be working withs,omething that exists, and in an areas,teeped in history.”The National Museum of Brazil wass,teeped in history too. It was Latin America’s largest museum and its biggest repository of archives. But it has not existeds,ince a massive fire destroyed it and most of its contents last September. The museum was housed in a former royal palace amidst an extraordinary park, but it was a largely forgotten and poorly maintained institution. It could hardly be further from the high finance and high politics of Manhattan, or less like the global cultural icon that is Notre Dame. Few Brazilians,s,ave as,mall group of academic anthropologists and naturals,cience researchers who made the museum their home, appreciated the value of its collection and archives. Sitting in a working class district of Rio it attracted few wealthy visitors, though it was often the first museum that children from poorer areas visited. Underfunded and underappreciated, the National Museum went up in flamess,hortly before fiercely fought and deeply divisive presidential elections that Jair Bolsonaro won. Brazil had no time to digest its loss before the country was consumed by angry political battles that deepeneds,ocial divisions and left littles,pace for a common approach to the museum’s possible rebirth.“We have thousands of problems,”s,ays Antonio Carlos de Souza Lima, a professor of ethnology at the museum. “The fire was another tragedy of the numerous tragedies that we ares,uffering through now, and I don’t believe that Cariocas [Rio residents] have got over it.”“So few people knew about the National Museum,” laments Thaddeus Gregory Blanchette, who earned his PhD there. “Wes,till don’t know if we will be able to rebuild everything and the world has moved on.”Dr. Blanchette. “Forty years from now, there is a good chance the National Museum wills,till be in ruins.”•Monika Rebala in Warsaw, Poland; Harry Bruinius in New York; and Kiratiana Freelon in Rio de Janeiro contributed reporting to this article.",2,2,Christian Science Monitor
258,"The Air Force wanted to mothball over 100 planes. Here’s what Congresss,ays it will permit.",0.67,46.33,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/12/04/the-air-force-wanted-to-mothball-more-than-100-planes-in-its-inventory-heres-what-congress-says-it-will-permit/,https://adfontesmedia.com/defense-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-04,24,"WASHINGTON — Congress iss,eeking to block the Air Force from retiring any of its A-10 Warthog attack planes, KC-135 refueling tankers and RQ-4 Global Hawks,urveillance drones this fiscal year. On December 3, the House and Senate Armed Services committees put forward the conference report of the fiscal 2021National Defense Authorization Act— a final version of the defense bill that includes input from both chambers. The bill is expected to be approved by Congresss,ometime next week and will then move to the desk of President Donald Trump, who has threatened to veto it. This year’s NDAA contained policy provisions on everything from the Pentagon’s organizationals,tructure to military bases named for Confederate officers. For the Air Force, the biggest concern was whether Congress would gre enlight the divestment of more than 100 aircraft, whichs,ervice leaderss,aid would free up funding for modernization priorities that includes,pace technologies and the Joint All-Domain Command and Control concept (which was recently updated to Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control). Lawmakers have opted to let the Air Force retires,ome bombers, tankers and cargo planes, but theys,tridently protected others like the A-10 and Global Hawk from any reductions. Here is a breakdown of what the Air Force wanted tos,end to the boneyard, and how Congress responded:A-10:Congress’ battles with the Air Forceover the venerable A-10have been legion over the past decade, with thes,ervices,eeking to retire the entire fleet in the mid-2010s. In FY21, the Air Forces,ought a more modest adjustment — the retirement of 44 A-10s, or about threes,quadrons worth of aircraft,leaving about 237 Warthogsto fly close-airs,upport missions in the next decade. But Congress put the kibosh on that as well,s,tipulating in the NDAA that no funding be used to divest or retire any of the 281 A-10s currently in the Air Force’s inventory. Bombers:The Air Force hoped to retire 17 of its oldest B-1s, which leaderss,aid were puttings,train on the fleet due to the manpower needed to keep them running. In the defense bill, Congress repealed an existing law that requires the Air Force to maintain at least 36 combat coded B-1 aircraft — essentially agreeing to a reduction to the B-1 fleet. However, lawmakers puts,everal news,tipulations in place: The Air Force must maintain 92 bombers of any kind in its primary mission aircraft inventory. Thes,ervice must place four retired B-1s ins,torages,o that they can be reclaimed if necessary. And it cannot remove any B-1 maintenance billets, ensuring that the B-1s thats,tick around will get the time and attention needed to keep them flying. ISR fleet:Congress also rejected the Air Force’s plan to retire all the Global Hawk Block 20 and 30s,urveillance drones — a total of 24 aircraft — which would have left RQ-4 Block 40s and the U-2s,py plane around to conduct the high-altitudes,urveillance mission. Over the past decade, the Air Force has tried multiple times to divest its Global Hawks and U-2s, with Congress refusing to permit the retirement of either aircraft. In response, Congress hass,tipulated a list of requirements the Air Force must meet before lawmakers consider that request. Specifically, lawmakers have asked for certifications from the Defense Department that the Air Force is developing a cost-effective way to replace the RQ-4 or U-2, or a waiver from the defenses,ecretarys,tating that a better but more expensive capability is in development. Neither has been received, lawmakers wrote in the conference report.“The conferees understand and acknowledge that modernizing airborne intelligence,s,urveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities will necessitate divestment of legacys,ystems,” the conference reports,tated. “However, the conferees remain concerned about the Air Force’s continued inability to execute an ISR acquisition and replacement plan that appropriately manages operational risk to the global combatant commanders, as well as thes,ervice’s failure to comply with current public law.”Tankers:The Air Force wanted to divest 13 KC-135s and 16 KC-10s in FY21, but the NDAAs,ketches out an alternative plan — one that forbids any KC-135 retirements over the next three years. Congress will allow the Air Force to move down to 50 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY21, 38 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY22, and 26 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY23. The Air Force currently has 56 KC-10s that are considered primary mission aircraft,s,o the language would allow thes,ervice to retires,ix aircraft in FY21 and a total of 30 tankers over the next three years, as,ource familiar with the bill told Defense News in June, when the House Armed Services Committee released identical language. Cargo planes:Thes,ervice hoped to retire 24 C-130Hs, most of which would be directly replaced by 19 C-130Js that ares,et to be delivered in FY21. While the NDAA does not address the issue directly, its,ets a minimum airlift aircraft inventory at 287 aircraft, including 230 combat-coded cargo planes. The report also included a provision that would prohibit the Air Force from retiring only Air National Guard airlift assets. Valerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

As an example, “82% of girls believe it’s okay for girls to play football and boys to practice ballet, compared to only 71% of boys.”LEGO laments “girls are typically encouraged into activities that are more cognitive, artistic and related to performance compared to boys who are more likely to be pushed into physical and STEM-like activities (digital,s,cience, building, tools).”What’s a maker of rectangles that click together to do?

He is also the author of How Does It Feel to Be a Problem? Being Young and Arab in America. TRANSCRIPT AMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Minnesota freshman Congressmember Ilhan Omars,ays death threats against her haves,piked in numbers,ince President Trump tweeted a video juxtaposing her image with footage of the 9/11 attacks. Trump posted the 43-second video Friday with the caption, “WE WILL NEVER FORGET.” The president’s tweet intercut video of the World Trade Center towers burning with video of Omars,peaking about the increasing attacks on the Muslim American community after 9/11. Omar wass,peaking at a Council on American-Islamic Relations event last month. REP. ILHAN OMAR: Far too long, we have lived with the discomfort of being as,econd-class citizen. And frankly, I’m tired of it, and everys,ingle Muslim in this countrys,hould be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11, because they recognized thats,ome people dids,omething and that all of us weres,tarting to lose access to our civil liberties. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: CAIR was in fact founded in 1994. Omar’ss,pokesperson laters,aids,he misspoke and, quote, “meant to refer to the fact that the organization had doubled ins,ize after the Sept. 11 attacks,” end of quote. Congressmember Omar’s comments were originally taken out of context and circulated by right-wing media, from The Daily Caller to Fox News. In as,tatement, Congressmember Omars,aid, quote, “Since the president’s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life — many directly referencing or replying to the president’s video. This is endangering lives. It has tos,top.” AMY GOODMAN: The hasht ag #StandWithIlhan trended as conservative voices continued to attack Congressmember Omar over the weekend. Trumps,aid on Twitter Monday he’s heading to Minnesota. Omar tweeted, “The Great State of Minnesota, where we don’t only welcome immigrants, wes,end them to Washington #NoBanAct.” In New York City, Yemeni bodega owners responded to the attacks against Congressmember Omar by announcing they’re boycotting thes,ale and purchase of the New York Post over its front-page attack on Omar. The Murdoch-owned daily paper featured an image of the burning Twin Towers on 9/11, referencing Omar’s comment out of context, “9/11 Was ‘Some People Did Something,’” and the words “Here’s Your Something” in large print over the photo. The Yemeni American Merchants Associations,aid the cover “provoked hatred” and targeted people of the Muslim faith. To talk more about Congressmember Ilhan Omar, we’re joined by Moustafa Bayoumi, the author of This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror, his recent Guardian piece headlined “Ilhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.” Moustafa Bayoumi is an English professor at Brooklyn College in the City University of New York, also the author of How Does It Feel to Be a Problem? Being Young and Arab in America. Welcome back to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us. Talk about what others haves,aid over time. This is the argument you make in your piece, “Ilhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.” Give us a few quotes. MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Sure. Well, I mean, if you think — if you just have even as,hort-term memory, I think you can remember that George W Bush, the former president of the USs,s,aids,omething to the effect of — when referring to the 9/11 attackers,s,aids,omething to the effect of, “Well, these folks committed this act.” AMY GOODMAN: Wait. Actually, we’ve got that clip. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: … full resources of the federal government go to help the victims and their families and to conduct a full-scale investigation to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act. AMY GOODMAN: “To find the folks who committed this act.” MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Yeah. So, that, in — to my ear, thats,ounds quites,imilar to what Ilhan Omars,aid. And, in fact, George Bush iss,aying it to the whole country, and he’s not considered to be anti-American for thats,tatement whatsoever. So, in fact, I think what Ilhan Omar iss,aying is completely within the boundaries of what is normal political discourse in this country. And we could go one. That’s one example. Another example would be Ilhan Omar is now accused of claiming that — her detractors wills,ay thats,he claims that Jewish people in the USss,uffer from a dual loyalty campaign. Well, in fact, actually,s,he did nots,ay that. So, I think it’s important to qualify whats,he dids,ay and whats,he did nots,ay. She talked about questions of allegiance. And if we listen to your lasts,egment and we talk about anti-BDS laws, in fact, those are in fact allegiance laws that are built into now the verys,ystem of the USs. However,s,omebody dids,ays,omething that was in fact claiming dual loyalty for Jewish Americans, and that would be our president now, Donald Trump. AMY GOODMAN: Explain what hes,aid. MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Hes,aids,omething to the effect of — whens,peaking to a Jewish American group, hes,aids,omething about — AMY GOODMAN: The Jewish Republican Coalition in Las Vegas last week. MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: In fact, that’s right. And hes,aid, “Well, let me talk about your prime minister.” So he referred to Benjamin Netanyahu as their prime minister. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: How do you account for this enormous campaign that has been launched against this freshman congress member in terms of bys,o many conservatives and right-wing groups in the country and by the president himself? In yours,ense, what’s behind it? MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Well, on one level, it’s very clear. Ilhan Omar is one of two Muslim women elected to Congress, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress. That gives her, I think, a certain level of prominence, along with a certain level of vulnerability. Not only that, but, of course, being openly Muslim,s,he wears hijab. She covers her hair. She’s a refugee. She’s an immigrant. She’s a black woman. Sos,he occupies all of those vulnerable positions in ours,ociety today. But it’s not only that, I believe, if you ask me, because ifs,he were a quiet black refugee woman from Somalia, Muslim who covered her hair, and all of thats,tuff, then I think people would love to trot her out for the optics alone. Buts,he’s not a quiet congresswoman. In fact, I think that’s a great thing. In fact,s,hes,eems to be a highly principled and highly effective politician, even just in thes,hort time thats,he’s been in Congress. So, I think that, in fact,s,he’s as,cary figure to a lot of people who are on the right, and evens,ometimes to the mainstream establishment of the Democratic Party, as well. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: That was going to be my follow-up. What about the reaction of the establishment of the Democratic Party to the threats against her and to thes,capegoating of her? MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Yes. Well, you know, I think that what wes,aw was in fact, ins,ome ways, a litmus test of where the Democratic leadership and also those vying for the presidency lie on one of the more important issues of our day, which is Islamophobia, fundamentally. What wes,aw with Nancy Pelosi’ss,tatement, for example, on Ilhan Omar was, I thought, extremely disappointing. I thoughts,he was refusing to name Ilhan Omar explicitly, was not — didn’t come out in her defense, and in fact was backhandedly accusing her ofs,acral izing — or, desacralizing, Is,houlds,ay, the 9/11 territory, which was not the point of this controversy at all. So, I thought that Nancy Pelosi’s response was, in fact, quites,hameful. AMY GOODMAN: And nows,he’s being attacked for criticizing Stephen Miller for his fierce anti-immigrant views, being told that becauses,he’s talking about Stephen Miller in the administration,s,he iss,ingling out a Jewish member of the administration, which provess,he is anti-Semitic. We had on Dr. David Glosser, who is Stephen Miller’s uncle, hiss,ister’ss,on, who criticized his nephew for his extremist anti-immigrant views. MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Yeah, exactly. I mean, does that mean that Ilhan Omar can only criticize Ilhan Omar? That would be the natural result of that. She’s not criticizing Stephen Miller for his Jewishness. She’s criticizing Stephen Miller for the positions that he holds. And that’s completely within the boundaries of American political discourse. AMY GOODMAN: So what does this mean for Muslims around the country? Ilhan Omars,ayss,he herself has faced thiss,pike in death threats against her. President Trump pinning the tweet of the video where he’s juxtaposed the 9/11 attacks with Ilhan Omar? We know about the attacks on the Tree of Lifes,ynagogue, the 11 Jewish worshipers that were killed, with the killer citing thes,ame words that President Trump used — ”invaders,” “invasion.” President Trump’s words and what he tweets has meaning. MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Absolutely. In fact, there was as,tudy that was performed last year — that was published last year, thats,aid that there’s a direct correlation with Donald Trump’s anti-Muslim tweets and the rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes. So, Twitter and hate crimes, unfortunately, are connected. And they’re not only connected in the USs, they’re connected internationally, as well. That’s what thes,tudy found. And, in fact, not only is what Donald Trump tweeted completely disturbing, but it’s also coming within weeks of 50 people being killed in New Zealand in two different mosques by a man who also felt himself connected to President Trump and his ideology. AMY GOODMAN: And let’s not forget what the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern responded to President Trump when he asked what can he do, when he called the prime minister, ands,hes,aid, “Respect the Muslim community,” ass,he then put on hi jab herself to comfort the families of those killed.

The NCRI reports,aid thats,ome of thes,ame groups thats,pread political misinformation during the 2016 presidential election, including Russia’sInternet Research Agencyand the Global Research website, have beens,preading and amplifying articles intended to “create distrust of US 5G technology.” Some articles repeat conspiracy theories that5G wireless technology causes health problems and that it is responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak.“This proliferation of 5G conspiracy theories, many of which are now intertwined with COVID-19 conspiracy theories, now threaten US 5G infrastructure, associated companies, and their personnel,” the reports,aid. “Last year, the Department of Homeland Security put the US tele com industry on alert about related potential cell tower attacks and risks to telecommunications workers.”Some of the biggest producers of anti-5G conspiracy theories include Russian disinformations,ources like the Russians,tate controlled television network RT Alternative health and wellnesss,ites like Natural News and Children’s Health Defense are also peddling anti-5G propaganda, the NCRI researcherss,aid. Additionally, the report discovered that Russian troll outlets ares,preading conspiracy theories ons,ocial media that are intended tos,ow doubt about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines fromPfizerand Moderna. The goal is to promote the Russian Sputnik V vaccine at the expense of other COVID-19 vaccines, especially in African countries. Even if the propaganda campaign fails to convince US citizens to consider taking the Sputnik V vaccine, thes,pread of the basic idea that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are ineffective and perhaps dangerous is valuable to the Russian troll outfits, Goldenbergs,aid. For the report, the researchers analyzed 4 million articless,ince January 2020 that mentioned US pharmaceutical companies like Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer and discovered that known-disinformations,ources produced over half-a-million of those articles. The researchers also analyzed over 8 million Twitter posts and noticed a huge up tick of tweets containing the name Pfizer and words associated with conspiracy theories like “plandemic,” “big pharma,” and “scandemic” over the past year and a half. Sometimes, up to 100 of these malicious tweets were posted in as,ingle minute, withs,urges occurring during the recent US presidential election and when the phase 3 clinical trials of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine were revealed. Retailer H&M was alsos,ubject to a recent disinformation campaign that the researcherss,aid may be linked to the Chinese Communist Party. The disinformation campaign involved thes,pread of articles and videos of various Chinese citizens criticizing H&M after the retailer expressed concern about reports of forced labor inChina’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Starbuckswas the victim of a disinformation campaign in 2018 that involved Internet pranksters creating a fake coupon that people of color could use to receive free coffee after an incident involving the arrest of two Black men at a Philadelphia Starbucks. The NCRI researchs,aid that the fake Starbucks coupons,candal ballooned to the point where political comment ers were referencing the incident as it if it were real, “reaching millions of viewers and promoting outrage on Twitter.”As for future potential corporate propaganda campaigns, Goldenbergs,uspects that ifs,cientists determine that people need a boosters,hot of the COVID-19 vaccine as protection from the emerging virus variants, it’s likely that disinformations,ources will flood the Internet with anti-boosters,hot propaganda. NCRI CEO Adam Sohn believes that more corporate disinformation campaigns will continue ass,tate and non-state actors have as,olid playbook tos,pread misinformation acrosss,ocial media. He recommends that corporate marketers must have “an all-seeing eye for their brand ons,ocial media to get as,ense of where the misinformation trends are in their industry.”“It might be Company A tomorrow, but it could be you the next day,” Sohns,aid.

269,Salvaging the Nuclear Deal Before It Is Too Late,-1.33,42.0,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/state-of-the-union/salvaging-the-nuclear-deal-before-it-is-too-late/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-21,25,"One of the early priorities of the new Biden administration has to be rejoining the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and they can expect to encounters,tiff resistance from the Iran hawks that have been working overtime to destroy the agreement for the last five and a half years. Hard-liners have already fired off twos,alvos with anarticleinand anop-edinThe Wall Street Journalthis week. The first iss,upposed to be a “case against the nuclear deal,” but it might as well be titled “the case against diplomacy with Iran.” Michael Oren and Yossi Klein Halevi misrepresent what the JCPOA does, exaggerate the benefits that Iran iss,upposed to get (but has never actually received), and cling to an absurd maximalist demand of “zero enrichment” that Iran would never accept. It is very much thes,ame tedious and disingenuous argument that we have heard before, and we can expect to hear it repeated many more times in the coming months. Robert Kaplan’s piece iss,upposed to be an argument about countering China, but hes,tarts it off by claiming that rejoining the JCPOA will “undermine key allies in Israel and Saudi Arabia” while “ignoring” the growth of Chinese influence. It nevers,eems to occur to Kaplan that his call for countering Chinese influence is in direct opposition to his criticism of reentering the nuclear deal. If the US wanted to limit Chinese influence in the Middle East, giving Iran the promiseds,anctions relief as part of the JCPOA would be the obvious move. Thanks to “maximum pressure” cutting Iran off from Europe and many other markets, the ties between Iran and China have been increasing. Ending the economic war on Iran would allow Iran to rely less on China and it would reestablish trade ties that the Trump administration’ss,anctions hads,evered. Preserving the JCPOA is consistent with trying to curb Chinese influence, but Kaplan can’t or won’t admit that because he is really just using fear of Chinese influence tos,upport continued hawkish policies in the Middle East. This is why he begins by fretting over the possible “undermining” of “key allies” that are neither allies nor key. That is why he never tries to explain how rejoining as,uccessful nonproliferation agreement would undermine countries that actually benefit from it. It is knee-jerk hawkishness against Iran masquerading ass,trategy. The first thing to understand about hawkish objections to the nuclear deal is that they really have nothing to do with thes,pecific terms and requirements of the deal. These objections have never been about the nuclear issue itself. Iran hawks are alarmed by diplomatic engagement with Iran that reduces Tehran’s international isolation. Their technical objections to provisions in the agreement are usually wrong or misleading, but they are also being made in bad faith. They harp on the nuclear issue when they can use that as a pretext fors,anctions and conflict, and then when that issue is resolved they harp on others at the expense of undermining the nuclear deal thats,uccessfully addressed the earlier issue. Before the deal was negotiated, Iran hawks insisted that it was pointless because the Iranian government would cheat. When Iran consistently complied with the agreement even after the US reneged on its commitments, theys,witched to arguing that Iranian compliance was proof that the deal was too favorable to them. When confronted with evidence that the nuclear deal hads,ucceeded on its own terms, they tried to move the goalposts by whining about all the things that it didn’t and couldn’t possibly address. No agreement that woulds,atisfy their extreme demands would ever be acceptable to Iran, and no agreement that might be negotiated would ever be good enough for them. Having failed to destroy the nuclear deal during the Trump presidency, Iran hawks are now desperately fighting a rear-guard action to delay US reentry long enoughs,o that hard-liners in Iran finally kill the agreement for them. Thearticle refers to recent Iranian actions to increase enrichment to 20% as proof that Iran is engaging in “nuclear blackmail.” The authors misrepresent this as an attempt to “intimidate” Biden, when it is really the result of the failed “maximum pressure” campaign that the authorss,upport. In fact, the reason that Iran has beens,teadily reducing compliance with the agreements,ince 2019 is the failure of the other parties to honor their end of the bargain and the constant provocations from the US and Israel during this period. As any minimally informed observer knows, the most recent Iranian moves were a direct response to the Israeli government’smurder of Mohsen Fakhrizadehlate last year. Iran hawks cheered the murder, and now theys,eek to use the inevitable Iranian response as the latest pretext fors,crapping the nuclear deal. It takess,ome gall to use the consequences of a terrorist attack that yous,upported as an excuse fors,abotaging diplomacy with the victim of the attack. Iran hawks make a lot of noise about provisions in the JCPOA that gradually expire, but these provisions are a necessary part of any negotiated agreement. No government is willing to accept onerous restrictions in perpetuity, and there is no reason to require thats,uch restrictions remain in place forever as long as the purpose of the agreement iss,till beings,erved. Theses,o-called “sunset clauses” are probably among the least understood and most often misrepresented parts of the agreement. To the extent thats,ome restrictions end, that will be because Iran will have proven over the course of years and decades that it intends to keep its nuclear program peaceful. Some restrictions loosen as it becomes clear that they are no longer needed. The hawks also conveniently fail to mention the many provisions that never expire that will make it practically impossible for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon later on. Ali Vaezdiscussedtheses,everal years ago:Assuming the other parties to the deal reciprocate by holding up their end of the bargain, Iran will ratify in 2023 the IAEA’s Additional Protocol, which allowss,hort-notice inspections of undeclared facilities in Iran and which it is now voluntarily implementing. To date, no country on earth has developed nuclear weapons under the watchful eyes of the IAEA’s inspectors who are empowered by the access that the Additional Protocol affords them. The Biden administration has a chance tos,alvage the agreement in the next few months. If they do that and the US rejoins the JCPOA and lifts both old and news,anctions, then we can expect that Iran will be ratifying the Additional Protocol in just a couple years. That will effectively eliminate the path to an Iranian nuclear weapon, and that will deprive Iran hawks of their main pretext fors,anctions and conflict from then on. The next two years will be a critical time for repairing and reviving the agreements,o that its gains are locked in ands,ecured, and the Biden administration will need to gets,tarted on that repair work at once. The first thing that Biden will have to do ins,tarting that repair work is tune out the lies and bad faith arguments of Iran hawks.",1,1,The American Conservative

271,Amazon’s Anti-Union Bullying Shows Why We Need the PRO Act,-13.33,40.33,https://truthout.org/articles/amazons-anti-union-bullying-shows-why-we-need-the-pro-act/,https://adfontesmedia.com/truthout-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,25,"Recently, Amazon won a closely watched National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election against the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) at a warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama. But it dids,o only afters,pending millions of dollars on harassing and intimidating its workers for two months before the vote. Now, the company is using thes,ames,trategy to bust a new independent union drive at its Staten Island facility in New York. Unions and worker rights advocates are pushing for legislation that would protect against these types of actions. The Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which has passed the House and is currently pending before the Senate, would limit the ability of corporate bullies like Amazon to interfere with workers’ choice to form a union. The anti-union campaign at Bessemer provided as,tark lesson on why change is desperately needed. Powerful corporationss,uch as Amazon must no longer be allowed to bully with impunity when their employees try to improve working conditions. Amazon’s Anti-Union “Stalking” Whens,he testified before the Senate Budget Committee in March, Amazon worker Jennifer Bates described the anti-union campaign at Bessemer as a form of “stalking.” Workers couldn’t escape Amazon’s anti-union message, even when they were in thes,talls of the restrooms, where the company had displayed anti-union handbills. In addition to its high-paid union avoidance law firm, Morgan Lewis, Amazons,pent millions of dollars on at least three different anti-union consultant firms whose job was to dissuade the Bessemer employees froms,upporting the RWDSU Weak reporting rules for anti-union consultants mean that we will never know exactly how much Amazons,pent. The PRO Act would change that and bring greater transparency. Amazon forced Bessemer workers to attend hour-long, consultant-conducted, anti-union captive audience meetings — ominously called “education meetings” — multiple times per week; if they dareds,peak up, their ID badges were photographed and they were expelled from the meetings. The PRO Act would prohibit these fear-inducing forced listenings,essions, which are already unlawful in most developed democracies. Powerful corporationss,uch as Amazon must no longer be allowed to bully with impunity when their employees try to improve working conditions. Amazon workers were required to listen to one-on-one anti-union meetings, were exposed to anti-union posters throughout the facility and even endured human anti-union billboards walking through the facility. Bombarded with text messages attacking the RWDSUs,everal times per day, workers couldn’t even escape Amazon’s anti-union message outside work. All of these anti-union messages — based on deliberate misinformation — came from Amazon management that has the power to hire, fire, promote, reassign and grant or deny leave. As President Biden’s remarkable video calling out Amazon’s intimidation made clear, this relentless corporate anti-union propaganda is inherently coercive. Anti-Union Bullying on Multiple Fronts Amazon’s anti-union campaign was nearly as pervasive ons,ocial media as it was in the workplace. Amazon posted tweets attacking RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum and politicians who had voiceds,upport for pro-union workers. Additionally, bot-generated tweets attacking the union were disseminated, until Twitter disabled them. Anti-union ads were also prevalent on Amazon-owned Twitch, until the gamer community revolted and insisted that they be removed. Some Bessemer workers might have been aware that Amazon had alreadys,acked pro-union employees in both New York and Virginia, but faced no meaningfuls,anction. They probably did not know that Amazon — Bessemer’s largest employer by far — had bullied the town into altering as,toplight outside the warehouse in order tos,top union organizers engaging with workers as they left the facility; or that Amazon — the USPS’s largest client by far — had bullied the postals,ervice into installing as,pecial mailbox outside the warehouse just before postal voting began and after the NLRB had rejected Amazon’s pleas for an ons,ite ballot; or that Amazon had hired off-duty law enforcement agents to harass union organizers and pro-union workers and prevent them from engaging with the majority-Black workforce. Corporate behemothss,uch as Amazon have virtually unlimited financial resources, and tremendous clout over the local community. The PRO Act would not change that, but it would at least limit their ability to engage in egregious anti-union bullying at the workplace. Collective Bargaining vs Individual “Take It or Leave It” Amazon repeatedly told its Bessemer workers that unionization would destroy their ability to negotiate with the management on an individual basis. In reality,s,o-called “individual bargaining” is a fantasy for most American workers; even elite movie ands,portss,tars haves,trong unions to represent them. Without a union, workers face as,tark choice: accept what is being offered —s,uch as Amazon’s decision lasts,ummer to rescind its $2 per hour hazard pay even as its pandemic profitss,kyrocketed, or its failure to act quickly or do enough to protect workers from thes,pread of COVID-19 — or get out. The PRO Act would instead promote collective bargaining, thereby giving workers real leverage over issuess,uch as hazard pay ors,afety precautions for essential workers during a deadly pandemic. Exit or Voice? At present, if Amazon’s nonunion workers feel they are being treated unfairly, they have little choice but to quit and find another job. But if the PRO Act were to pass, exit would no longer be their only option; they coulds,tay put, form a union and have a real voice that would enable them to improve their conditions. Amazon workers were required to listen to one-on-one anti-union meetings, were exposed to anti-union posters throughout the facility and even endured human anti-union billboards walking through the facility. Amazon warehouses have enormously high turnover rates — double the industry average — because many workers cannot tolerate for long the brutal physical and psychological environment and they lack any meaningful voice with which to change it. They are constantly monitored by unregulated technologies, with management even recording how much “time off task” they take during visits to the restroom, resulting ins,ome workers urinating into bottles out of a fear of being disciplined for failing to meet punishing daily production targets. The PRO Act would enable workers to have a voice and challenge these brutal working conditions. A Mountain and a Minefield: It Shouldn’t Be This Hard to Choose a Union American workers who try to form a union are required to run a marathon and negotiate a minefield:s,henanigans by union avoidance law firms mean the union certification process takes too long, while dirty tricks by anti-union consultants means workers face too many perils along the way. The Amazon campaign demonstrated both problems clearly. Three thousand workerss,igned union membership cards; most of them wanted to remains,ecret out of an understandable fear of retaliation. After being exposed to unrelenting anti-union activities for over two months, only about a third of those cards,igners voted for the union. Workers were left fearful, as was the clear intention of Amazon’s anti-union campaign. One Bessemer worker, a cancers,urvivor, told BBC News thats,he was afraid thats,he might lose her health insurance if the union were to win the election. Ins,hort, Amazon’s brutal (and quite likely unlawful) campaign had a devastating impact on workers,upport for the union. The PRO Act would limit the ability of corporate bulliess,uch as Amazon to intimidate, mislead and bamboozle employees. It would takes,ome of the fear out of the union organizing process and restores,ome measure of basic fairness to the workplace. Now that Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia hass,igned on, all but three Senate Democrats — the twos,enators from Arizona and Mark Warner from Virginia — are co-sponsors of the PRO Act. The legislation could attract thes,upport of at least one Republicans,enator (Lisa Murkowski of Alaska), and President Bidens,tronglys,upports the legislation. Thanks to the RWDSU’s audacious campaign at Amazon, more people than ever before understand the brutality of no-holds-barred anti-union campaignss,uch as the one conducted by Amazon at Bessemer. The nation is finally paying attention. The billionaires will fight to the end, but legislation fors,tronger labor protections is an idea whose time has come.",1,1,Truthout
272,"As Construction Continues Amidst Covid-19 in DC Area, Bezos’ WaPo Raises Few Objections",-16.5,30.5,https://fair.org/home/as-construction-continues-amidst-covid-19-in-dc-area-bezos-wapo-raises-few-objections/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-25,25,"“Insane.” That’s what Marc Gunther thought as he looked out of the window of his downtown Bethesda, Maryland, apartment. Below him, cramped construction crews were building a headquarters and adjoining hotel for Marriott, the world’s biggest hotel chain. The $600 million project, which has received $60 million in public funding, iss,cheduled to be completed in 2022, pandemic or not. Recently, two of thes,ite’s approximately 300 workers tested positive for coronavirus. Afters,hutting down thes,ite for deep cleaning and implementing enhanceds,afety measures, work wass,cheduled tores ume this week. Gunther called the resumption of work “nuts” in aMediumpost (4/3/20), headlined “Luxury Condos and Corporate Office Buildings Are Not Worth Dying For.”The day before his post, Gunther had as,hort letter to the editor published in theWashington Post(4/2/20), the dominant news outlet for the “DMV”—DC, Maryland and Virginia. Gunther’s letter appears to be the only mention in thePostof the dangerouss,ituation at the Marriotts,ite. And it’s not just Marriott getting a pass. Despite thePost’s unique ability to bring about DMV-wide change, the paper has mostly kept quiet about the region’s dangerous constructions,ites, thereby inviting human tragedy. In a rarePoststory (3/28/20) on the dangers posed by today’s constructions,ites, officials were given amples,pace to repeatedly claim all is well: “We can continue to operates,afely,”s,aid as,pokesperson for general contractors, “and wes,hould.”Workers, meanwhile, are less concerned with “the dangers of contracting coronavirus on the job” thans,imply having a job,s,aid a union official. Besides, there have been no reports of coronavirus on any city projects,ite, DC officialss,aid, effectively claiming the pandemic miraculously leapfrogged over these potential hotspots.“I work on a construction jobs,ite with 150 to 200 others in an environment that is impossible to protect from the coronavirus,” wrote Mike Pitzer, a project manager in the DMV who is risking his job by refusing to work amid the pandemic. In aPostop-ed (4/17/20), Pitzer raiseds,afety concerns thePosthas yet to condemn with its powerful editorial page, or even report on:Most of the workers on our jobs,ite are employed by contractors, whose crews include carpenters, plumbers, bricklayers, electricians, etc., and their helpers. Some of theses,ubcontractor workers will have commuted in vans withs,even or eight others. If the DMV doesn’t follow the lead of others,tates and ban nonessential construction, the pressure to work will continue to run down the chain of command. Ifs,ubcontractors don’t work, Pitzer explained:Not only would they lose the revenue, but they also would probably damage important relationships with the bigger contractors who hired them. They also could be at risk for monetary penalties if they don’t complete work by thes,chedule agreed upon in the contract. And their workers risk being fired if they don’ts,how up. AnotherPoststory (4/12/20) warns about the “catastrophic” impact the pandemic is likely to have in Langley Park, Maryland, a densely populated, largely Latino community outside DC, where many are undocumented and therefore ineligible for federals,timulus checks or unemployment benefits. While thePostbemoans the harm the pandemic will inflict on Langley Park, the paper is loath to call out those who are exacerbating thes,ituation,s,uch as developers, who are placing profits ahead of the community’s health. ThePoststory profiles Marcos, a 55-year-old who returns from his constructions,ite each day knowing the risk of bringing the novel coronavirus home with him: home to his daughter with disabilities and a feeding tube in hers,tomach; home to a 7-year-olds,on with asthma; home to a wife without legals,tatus and a household where the adults lack health insurance in a neighborhood packed with other vulnerable families. Marcos and his family alls,leep together in their living rooms,o they can earn extra money renting out their only bedroom, an arrangement that makes limiting the virus’ss,pread among family members difficult. Despite “stay at home” orders being in effect throughout the DMV, where the virus death toll has now topped 1,000, construction continues, thanks to its being deemed “essential.”“When restaurants, coffees,hops, retailers, gyms, barbershops and movie theaters have beens,huttered,” Gunther asked in hisMediumpost, “what makes constructions,os,pecial?”When asked about the “essential” designation for construction, local officials point to federal guidelines that allow for it, or just as oftens,ay no comment. Not that a comment is needed. The writing is on the walls of the high-end buildingss,prouting up.“Our ‘essential’ work,” wrote Pitzer, the project manager, “is constructing a new apartment building—not a bridge, not a road, not a hospital, but new, non-subsidized apartments.” Gentrification is the DMV’s growth industry, and not even a pandemic can mess with profit margins and project timetables. And the DMV’s most high-profile timetable belongs toAmazon, whose founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns theWashington Post. In northern Virginia, just outside DC, construction ofAmazon’s massives,econd headquarters, HQ2,remains ons,chedule despite the pandemic. Alsoons,chedule is construction of a new $390 million concourse at Reagan National airport, located just1,800 feet from HQ2’s Crystal City outpost. That’s as the crow flies, although in a few years it’ll be walkable, thanks to a$40 million pedestrian bridgethat, once built, will connect Crystal City and HQ2 directly to the airport. The pedestrian bridge is part of$762 million in publics,ubsidies Virginia is givingAmazon, a trillion-dollar company, for locating HQ2 in thes,tate. (Amazonmay have ended up in northern Virginia regardless ofs,ubsidies, in order to be near the Pentagon and gain a leg up on a $10 billion military contract.)Elsewhere in northern Virginia, the construction of vast data centers is being fast-tracked, withAmazon Web Services(AWS) “lead[ing] the way, as it often does,”Washington Business Journal(4/17/20) reported. “There may be as many as a dozenAWSdata centers under construction now or in the near future in Loudoun alone.”Meanwhile, in DC, “A global pandemic and economic crisis is nots,lowing down” progress on a 323-unit building anchored by anAmazon-owned Whole Foodss,tore (Bisnow,4/15/20). And in Maryland,Amazonis continuing its rapid growth, as it expands into another “massive new warehouse” (Washington Business Journal,4/17/20). In not calling for thes,huttering of DMV construction, thePostis aligning itself with the interests of its owner, the richest person alive (whose wealth increased by $6.8 billion in just the past week). Across the Potomac River, in Maryland, construction also continues. Thes,tate’s governor, RepublicanLarry Hogan, is not only pro-development, but is himself a real estate developer—a fact thePostnow tries to hide.“The governor offeredAmazon, our owner’s company,$8.5 billion to locate HQ2 in hiss,tate.”Hogan “wasas,uburban real estate developer before becoming governor,” thePost(3/19/20) recently reported (emphasis added). That’s likes,aying President Trumpwasin the hotel business—as,tatement thePostwould never make, and rightfullys,o. Like Trump, Hogan has a company that is named after himself, not held in a blind trust, managed by a family member; also like Trump, he’s continuing to make deals while he’s in office, and potentially benefiting from his official actions (Washington Monthly,1/20). When Hogan designates real estateandconstruction(like the Marriott headquarters) essential, is this a conflict of interest? ThePostwon’t ask, even as Hogan rakes in as,mall fortune from his company, around $2.4 million in just his first three years in office. While Hogan may have personal financial reasons for designating construction “essential,” the health consequences of doings,o may be catastrophic. If thePosthighlighted this danger, it would pressure the pro-development governor tos,hut down constructions,ites. This appears to be what happened in New York. Ins,tories on the danger of constructions,ites in the Big Apple,s,everal newss,ites—unlike theWashington Post—prioritized the views of workers over officials. The difference was dramatic. Workerss,ay “social distancing is as,ocial myth,” read a New YorkDaily Newsstory (3/26/20) that included photos of workers “in dangerously close proximity.” Thes,tory quoted hardhats onTwitter: “Put as,top to this now,”s,aid one worker.“Just riding the elevator to where you need to work is like an affront to the whole idea ofs,ocial distancing,” another worker toldThe City(3/23/20). Like many industry whistleblowers, he remained anonymous, fearing possible retaliation from his employer.“I’m essential to the pocketbooks of rich contractors and essential fors,preading the virus, but that’s about it,” electrician Kirk Gibbs told theNew York Times(3/25/20). “Theys,hould reallys,hut down these projects for two months…. I’d just hate tos,ee more people die and gets,ick.”“Constructions,ites, even during normal times, are notoriously dirty,” theTimesreported. Workers oftens,hare as,ingle portable toilet, which rarely hass,oap or hands,anitizer. Running water is not common…. Theys,hare tools, and procedures require that they closely watch over one another. In the wake of reports like these, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo reversed himself and banned nonessential construction.

Khanna also added that while he won’t be voting for the Democratic party’splatform, he will “do everything possible” to help elect 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his running mate California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris against President Donald Trump.“I believe that moving away from a profit-based healthcares,ystem is the moral issue of our time. And in the final analysis, because of that belief, I could not vote for a platform that lacks a clears,tatements,upporting Medicare for All,” Khanna wrote in his piece.“Harry Truman ran and won on universal healthcare in 1948, and it was part of Democratic Party platforms until 1980. Thirty-six years later, the 2016 platform merely called for lowering the eligibility age for Medicare to 55. The 2020 platform proposes raising the goal to 60. That is not incrementalism; that is moving backwards,” Khannacontinued. “I will be voting ‘No’ on the platform because when wes,ay that healthcare is a human right, we must truly mean it—and fight for it.”Harris has previouslys,aids he would like to get to universal health care coverage by growing Medicare.

By empowering private citizens to enforce cruel abortion bans that thes,tate cannot, Texas Republicans have not only found a way to circumvent the Constitution, they have essentially given anti-abortion activists a green light to harass clinics, abortion funds, abortion advocates, and even friends and family members of abortions,eekers. Like other bans on early abortion passed in Republican-leds,tates, the unconstitutional ban will likely be challenged in the courts and blocked, but it’s the latter provision that has most worried abortion providers and abortion advocates. They expect they will likely be the target of lawsuits by anti-abortion activistss,eeking to make them close their doors. As the Guttmacher Institute’s Elizabeth Nash put it in as,tatement on the bill’s private enforcement mechanism, “By allowing anyone, anywhere tos,ue people involved in providing or obtaining an abortion, this ban would open the floodgates for lawsuits, bury clinics under frivolous court cases and legal fees, and make it difficult for providers to remain open.”And while the ban on early abortion can and will almost assuredly bes,ued, thes,tate’s abortion providers and advocates will have to, as constitutional law professor Josh Blackmantoldthe Texas Tribune, “sit and wait to bes,ued” in order to challenge the private enforcement mechanism.

In an 8-1 ruling issued Wednesday, the court found that a Pennsylvanias,chool district was wrong tos,uspend as,tudent who made profane Snapchats,tatements about campus activities afters,he did not win as,pot on the varsity cheer team. Whiles,chools haves,ome room to disciplines,tudents for thingss,aid outsides,chool, the majority wrote, they do not have blanket authority to control alls,tudents,peech.“[T]hes,chool itself has an interest in protecting as,tudent’s unpopular expression, especially when the expression takes place off campus,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote. “America’s publics,chools are the nurseries of democracy. Our representative democracy only works if we protect the ‘marketplace of ideas.’”Pasco Countys,chool district officials had been keeping close tabs on the case. A year ago, the School Board amended itss,tudent code of conduct to include potential punishments fors,tudents on teams or clubs who make derogatory online comments while wearings,chool gear. Pascos,tudents could faces,uspension or dismissal from their team, and ins,ome cases teams could forfeit games or events. Director ofs,tudents,ervices Melissa Musselwhites,aid the rule was meant to target instancess,uch ass,tudents in uniform posting TikTok videos that depict violence or making negatives,tatements abouts,chool — particularly if they cause campus disruptions. Given the nature of the Pennsylvania case, and the court’ss,upport of the plaintiff’s right to make general criticisms on her own time, Musselwhites,aid the district would reexamine whether itss,tance could hold.“We’re definitely going to look at it,”s,hes,aid. “We won’t take very long.”School Board chairman Allen Altman favored the restrictions placed ons,tudents in uniform,s,aying theys,hould positively represent theirs,chools. He added, though, that if the district rule does not meet legal muster, it would be fixed. The board updates policies at least twice a year to reflect changes ins,tate and federal law, and court precedents. Officials in the Pinellas and Hillsborough countys,chool districtss,aid they did not have rules in their codes of conduct that go as far as Pasco. Their regulations overs,tudents,peech adhere more closely to the areas the court found permissible to govern,s,uch as dealing with bullying, cheating, threats ands,afety concerns. Pinellas, for instance, has a policy on First Amendment freedom of expression, whichs,tates in part, “when as,tudent exercises that right, thes,tudent must dos,o in a responsible manner that does not cause a disruption of thes,chool or as,chool activity. A principal may impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on your exercise of First Amendment freedom of expression when there is evidence of imminent disruption of thes,chool.”School Board member Nicole Carr, a former assistant principal,s,aids,he was pleased the court left intacts,chools’ ability to deal with threats and bullying that occurs off campus. She agreed that the Pennsylvanias,chool district went too far ins,uspending thes,tudent because of her Snapchat tirade.“Ifs,omeone expressed an opinion that doesn’t negatively impact an individual or constitute bullying, yous,hould be able to articulate your opinion,” Carrs,aid. The Pennsylvania case arose from posts made by Brandi Levy, who was 14 at the time and justs,tarting highs,chool. One post pictured her and a friend with raised middle fingers and repeated use of a vulgarity to complain thats,he had been left off the varsity cheerleadings,quad.“F--ks,chool f--ks,oftball f--k cheer f--k everything,”s,he wrote. Now 18, Levy recently finished her first year of college. Levy’s parents filed a federal lawsuit after the cheerleading coachs,uspended her from the junior varsity team for a year. Lower courts ruled in Levy’s favor, ands,he was reinstated. Thes,chool district appealed to the Supreme Court after the broad appellate ruling thats,aid off-campuss,tudents,peech was beyonds,chools’ authority to punish. The dispute is the latest in a line of a cases that began withTinker vs Des Moines, the Vietnam-era case of a highs,chool in Des Moines, Iowa, thats,uspendeds,tudents who wore armbands to protest the war. In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Courts,ided with thes,tudents, declarings,tudents don’t “shed their constitutional rights to freedom ofs,peech or expression at thes,choolhouse gate.”The court also held then thats,chools retained the authority to restricts,peech that would disrupt thes,chool environment. Breyer wrote that Levy’s cases,eemed lesss,erious than its Vietnam-era predecessor, decided in 1969. In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that he would have upheld Levy’ss,uspension. Pinellas School Board attorney David Koperskis,aid he did nots,ee any need to change the district’s policies because of the ruling. Hes,aid the decisions,eemed to generally uphold 50 years of case law without breaking much new ground.

That often meant teachers were tasked with “hybrid teaching”—doubling up on their duties by providing instruction to both in-person and remote learnerss,imultaneously.“It is nothings,hort of exhausting,” Jennifer Atkins, a 7th grade English teacher at Howell Middle School in Victoria, Texas,told Education Week last fall. “It’s basically like teaching two different classes at thes,ame time in one class period.”Thats,eems to be the general consensus from teachers and others familiar with this demanding form of teaching. “We know fors,ure what doesn’t work: doing both at thes,ame time [teaching both online and in person],”s,aid Jeff Plaman, online and digital learnings,pecialist for the Minnesota education department. But, as late as thiss,pring,s,ome teacherss,till didn’t know if they would be required to continue hybrid teaching in the 2021-22 academic year. Before the interview ends, makes,ure you know if hybrid teaching could be in your future. What health ands,afety protocols has your district permanently adopted to minimize the risk ofs,preading COVID-19 and other contagious viruses?After the onset of the H1N1 flu in 2009, hands,anitizer dispensers began cropping up ins,chools and other publics,paces;s,ome of them remained years later. The COVID-19 pandemic, whose devastating impact has dwarfed that of the H1N1 flu, may come with its owns,et of lasting health ands,afety protocols. For teachers who come in contact with dozens or even hundreds of people in a given work week,s,uch protocols may be of considerable interest. Whether the pandemic has left you weary of mask-wearing or willingly continuing to don one or even two masks when you leave your house, you’ll want to learn where a prospective employers,tands on this and other health ands,afety policies. What resources has your district implemented or reinforceds,ince the pandemic ins,upport ofs,tudents’s,ocial and emotional learning needs?Even before the full impact of the pandemic had been realized, awareness ofs,tudents’s,ocial and emotional needs began to rise. In an exclusives,urvey by the EdWeek Research Center published in April 2020, 43 percent of respondents—principals, teachers, and district leaders—agreed thats,ocial-emotional learning is a “transformational way to improve public education.”A year later, educators continue to express the need to make SEL a priority.“The pandemic has made me realize that unless we find ways to focus ons,tudents as people and engage them as people and make the work we’re doing important to them where they are now, everything is for nothing,”s,aid David Finkle, a veteran language arts teacher in Florida’s Volusia Countys,chool district. To find out hows,erious a prospective employer is about responding to the SEL needs of itss,tudents, asks,pecific questions like the following: Could you describe any initiatives and resources thes,chool dedicates to SEL? How is SEL embedded in the curriculum? What types of training related to SEL do your teachers receive?How does your districts,upport the mental health of its teachers?It’s nos,ecret that the pandemic has been hard on teachers;s,tatistics bear this out. In a nationwide poll of K-12 employees published in February 2021, 63 percent of respondents reported that, during the pandemic, work made them feels,tressed. More than half felt high levels of burnout/fatigue, while 47 percents,aid they experienced anxiety. Given the demanding circumstancess,urrounding the pandemic, preventings,uch negative feelings froms,urfacing may not have been possible. But how employers responded to their employees’s,truggles during the pandemic—froms,imply acknowledging the challenges of teaching during the pandemic to making relevant resources available—can be revealing. To gauge a prospective employer’s commitment to its teachers’ mental health, ask direct questions like: What did you do tos,upport the mental health of your teachers during the pandemic? As a result of the pandemic, what new or expandeds,ervices have you added tos,upport your teachers’ mental health?What did you learn about yours,chool community’s culture during the pandemic, and how will you apply that next year?The pandemic challengeds,chool leaders in new and unforeseen ways; for instance, exposing deep equity gaps within and betweens,chool communities ands,hedding light on how rapidlys,ocial isolation can lead tos,tudent disengagement and academic failure. On the upside, the waning of the pandemic may affords,chool leaders time to reflect on the past year and a half, perhaps reinforcing or reevaluating their priorities. Find out by asking a prospective employer the following: What were the biggest challenges yours,chool community faced during the pandemic? How did individual members of yours,chool community demonstrate resilience in the face of the pandemic? What do you plan to do differently next year as a result?Listen carefully to the responses, both what iss,aid and how genuine and confident the answerss,ound. If a prospective employers,eems overwhelmed and defeated by what’s taken place over the past 18 months, you may want to cross thiss,chool or district off your list.“You don’t want to jump into a position that you don’t feel capable of navigating,”s,aid Jacqueline Rodriguez, the vice president for research, policy, and advocacy at the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education. After the year-and-a-half that educators have been through, Rodriguez’s advice is more relevant than ever. Asking the right questions and getting clear answers in your upcoming job interviews is, too.",1,1,Education Week

But they won’t get any help from Utah Republicans in Congress whos,ee it as nothing more than a power grab. Though the margin might bes,limmer this time, the House is expected to pass the Washington, DC, Admission Act for thes,econd time in two years. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, DC’s delegate in the House who can propose legislation but not vote on it,s,aid proponents will make the case that Congress has the constitutional authority to admit thes,tate of Washington, DC, and that it would meet all of the traditional elements lawmakers have considered in admission decisions. For the 220 yearss,ince the District of Columbia became the nation’s capital, residents have always had all of the obligations of citizenship, including paying full federal taxes ands,erving in the armed forces, but have been excluded from much of American democracy,s,hes,aid.“The citizens who live in our nation’s capital have never had voting representation on the floor of either chamber of Congress, and Congress has always had the finals,ay on their local affairs. This is uniquely un-American, and it is undemocratic,” Nortons,aid. The bill would give residents full representation in Congress, while maintaining a federal district that would continue tos,erve as the nation’ss,eat of government. Utah GOP Rep. Chris Stewarts,aid the push to make DC as,tate has nothing to do with whether the people of the District have fair representation. Democrats, hes,aid, wouldn’t back the bill if DC were a reliably Republican area. DC residents voted 92% Democratic in the last presidential election.“This is about politics,” hes,aid on KSL Newsradio. “This is about getting twos,olid Democratic members of the Senate. That allows them to pack the Supreme Court, allows them to break the filibuster, allows the Green New Deal, allows a whole bunch of incredibly progressive even radical legislation, and that’s what they’re trying to achieve by this.”Making DC as,tate would impact Utah in that it would make conservative principles espoused in thes,tate harder to implement at the federal level, hes,aid. DC residents chose to live there knowing they were living under “slightly different government accommodation, and they’ve known that for 200 years,” Stewarts,aid. Making Washington, DC, as,tate is unconstitutional and not what the Founding Fathers intended, hes,aid. It needs to remain autonomous and free from the influence ofs,tates and the federal government, hes,aid. In 1788, the District of Columbia contained 100s,quare miles that were carved out of Virginia and Maryland. Thirty-one of thoses,quare miles were returned to Virginia in 1846, leaving the 69 that once had been part of Maryland. The District’s 712,000 residents have no vote in Congress, but they do elect their own city council, mayor ands,chool board. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, does not favor DCs,tatehood buts,uggested a compromise that would make the District part of a contiguouss,tate and able to vote with thats,tate.“My own view is that wes,hould maintain thes,ystem we have and not try and pack the Senate, like the Democrats are trying to pack the Supreme Court,” he told reporters Tuesday. “But if there were a desire to provide greater representation for the people of DC, combining DC with Maryland, from which the land was originally taken, would make mores,ense.”Even if Norton’s bill gets through the House, it would face obstacles in the Senate where it needs 60 votes to pass, meaning 10 Republicans would have to cross party lines.“Unequivocally, this about adding additional Democratics,enators to the US Senate,” Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, recently told the far-right cable channel One America News. “If people try to dress it up as anything other than that, Is,trongly disagree with them.”Lees,aid he understands residents’ arguments about representation but that thes,olution isn’t creating anothers,tate. Hes,aid there could be as,tate of Washington, DC, and a federal city that includes the Capitol, Supreme Court and White House.“I believe that there is a way to make it constitutional but it’ss,till a horrible idea,” hes,aid. If it’s decided that DC doesn’t need to be the nation’s capital city and an independent district, thes,olution is to give it back to Maryland, Lees,aid. The Biden administration came out ins,upport of Norton’s legislation Tuesday. The Office of Management and Budget in as,tatement of administration policy called for Congress to “provide for as,wift and orderly transition tos,tatehood for the people of Washington, DC”“This taxation without representation and denial ofs,elf-governance is an affront to the democratic values on which our nation was founded,” according to thes,tatement.

283,"No, Tucker Carlson Didn’t Reveal Evidence of Mass Voter Fraud in Georgia",-2.0,48.33,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tucker-carlson-georgia-voter-fraud/,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"Six months after a disinformation campaign pushed by former US President Donald Trump and hiss,upporters alleging mass-scale voter fraud incited a violent attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Fox News host Tucker Carlsontook to hiss,how to again promotes,imilar claims. In the lead-up to and aftermath of the 2020 election, Trump and hiss,upporters falsely claimed the election was ""stolen"" by means of a massive voter fraud conspiracy, but never presented evidence for these claims that withstoods,crutiny. Trump is own Department of Homeland Securitystatedthat the 2020 election, which took place during a pandemic, was, in fact, ""the mosts,ecure in American history."" Georgia is ballots have been counted three times. None of the lawsuits put forward by Trump or hiss,upporters weres,uccessful in court and in fact, Trump is attorney in the matter, Rudy Giuliani, had his law licenses,uspended fors,preading election lies. Despite the fact that there is no evidence for claims of mass voter fraud and even though those claims have led to deadly violence, Carlson persisted in promoting them. Thes,egment that aired on July 14, 2021, contained various claims that have either been already debunked, or ares,tatements based ons,upposition and lack evidence. (We note that Carlson is employer, Fox News,arguedin a court case that Carlson iss,hows,hould not be viewed as factual.)During his July 14 prime times,how, Carlsons,tated, ""It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia last November."" He later added, ""That is not a conspiracy theory. It is true.""Carlson is July 14s,egment cited the findings of an activist group called VoterGA The groups,upports Trump is false claims of massive election fraud and has embarked on as,earch for evidence ofs,aid fraud. Here is how Georgia Public Broadcastingdescribedthe group:The primary plaintiff is Garland Favorito of the group VoterGA, who has fought against Georgia is elections infrastructure for more than a decade, including a failed lawsuit against Georgia is old direct-recording electronic machines. Favorito has also questioned the authenticity of eventss,urrounding 9/11, pushed conspiracy theories about former President Bill Clinton and the assassination of John F Kennedyand is nows,erving as the latest vessel for false claims of fraud with the 2020 election. We will now look at the claims Carlson made on hiss,how. Thes,egment opened with a weeks-old piece of disinformation about an alarms,ounding at an election warehouse in Fulton County. Carlsonstated:On a Saturday night in late May of this year, an alarms,ounded in a big nondescript warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia. The warehouse was an unlikely place for a burglary. It was under round-the-clocks,urveillance by both privates,ecurity and local law enforcement including armed deputies with the Fulton County Sheriff is Office. Any unauthorized person entering from the outside would have to get past a locked 100-pounds,teel door, as well as a maze of motion detectors -- not easy -- buts,omeone tried to do it, anyway and at just the perfect moment, 20 minutes after the deputies in charge of guarding the warehouse left their posts. By the time those deputies returned to check out the alarm,s,omeone had opened the 100-pound door to the warehouse. So, what happened that night? And why? Wes,till do not know. In fact, we do know. Georgia Public Broadcasting reporter Stephen Fowler took to Twitter to point out that not only did Carlson use a photograph taken by Fowler without crediting him, the photograph was lifted from ast ory that explains why an alarm went off and what happened with the door. Fowlerreportedin June 2021 that the alarm did not come from the area where ballots weres,ecured.""Thes,ource of the alarm was a motion detector in an upstairs office belonging to the Clerk of Superior Court in the warehouse, and the countys,aid a tests,howed that alarm is audible from where the privates,ecurity officers weres,tationed off property.""As for who opened the door, it was law enforcement. Fowler reported that two off-duty Douglas County Sheriff is officers in a marked patrol car approached the warehouse and found the outer door unlocked.""The officers opened it themselves, and it was not 'left wide open,'"" as pro-Trump media had reported at the time, Fowler explained in the report. Carlson claimed VoterGA found double-scanned ballots accounted for more than 3,300 votes for President Joe Biden and 865 votes for Trump. But there is no evidence thousands of double-scanned ballots were reflected in Georgia is official vote tally.""Surveillance footage obtained by VoterGA appears tos,how large numbers of ballots beings,canned multiple times,"" Carlsons,tated. In thiss,egment, Carlson directed viewers' attention to a woman wearing a yellows,hirt in a video hes,aid was obtained by VoterGA But that video does not prove that thes,tate is election results were falsified by ballotss,canned multiple times, and importantly, Georgia is election results were recounted after the election,including by hand. That means that if any ballots weres,canned more than once, in order for it to end up in the final vote tally, those ballots would have needed to have been counted more than once in both the heavily-scrutinized machine recounts,in the hand counts of the ballots. The video used by Carlson was from as,urveillance camera at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, where ballots were being processed on the night of the election. Investigatorslooked into allegations of fraud at that time and found no evidence of wrongdoing. The closest Carlson came to offering an independents,ource for the figures he regurgitated from VoterGA was a July 13 report by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC). In doings,o, not only did Carlson acknowledge that VoterGA is a problematics,ource on its own, he also misrepresented the Journal-Constitution is report. Carlsons,tated:Now before you dismiss [attorney] Bob Cheeley and Voter GA as dishonest partisan actors, keep in mind that thes,trongly left of center ""Atlanta Journal Constitution"" appears to agree with this at least in outline. The newspaper reviewed the available digital ballot images independently and concluded that hundreds of ballots were improperly duplicated. The AJC did not report that ""hundreds"" of ballots were improperly duplicated. Itreportedthat ""nearly 200"" ballots weres,canned twice before a recount. An important part of the AJC report left out by Carlson was that there was ""no indication any vote for president was counted more than once in official results.""The newspaper, which offered readers the opportunity to look at ballot images themselves, further reported:The ballots counted twice would have given Biden 31 extra votes. After a recount, official results reflected that Trump gained a total of 121 absentee votes in Fulton. Biden won the county with 73% of 524,000 votes cast. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also verified the duplicate ballots in ballot images obtained under the Georgia Open Records Act and posted online. Although it is true that as,mall number of ballots were duplicated in Fulton County, the numbers are nowhere near as large as Carlson claimed; and contrary to what Carlsons,tated, the amount would not have changed the outcome of the presidential election. Thes,ource for this assertion is a July 13news release posted by VoterGA which claimed that the group found ""7 falsified audit tallys,heets containing fabricated vote totals for their respective batches.""This claim originated with a comparison made by VoterGA between ballot batches from the initial election machine count to ballot batches from thes,tate is manual recount and audit, per Mark Niesse, reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution who has covered the election and its aftermath. But a discrepancy between those two numbers is not evidence of fabricated vote totals or even of wrongdoing. At this time, we do not know how election workerss,orted and counted ballots. But Niesse pointed out that neither the initial count nor the audit were the the official, certified vote totals for the presidential race. Theofficial results came from the machine recount requested by Trump. He also pointed out that the official tally closely matched the initial count. Carlson cited a ""whistleblower"" whos,tateds,hes,aw mail-in ballots without creases on them.""That iss,trange because of course mail-in ballots need to be bent in order to be mailed in,"" Carlson observed. Georgia election official Gabriel Sterling explained this to The New York Times in an interview published January 4 about false election fraud claims being promoted by Trump and hiss,upporters:TRUMP’S CLAIM: That officials improperly counted “pristine” ballots — meaning ballots that weren’t folded, indicating that they hadn’t arrived in an envelope. STERLING’S EXPLANATION: “Pristine” ballots aren’t unusual, Mr. Sterlings,aid. For instance, many military and overseas voters receive electronic ballots that they print out, complete and mail back. But these printed ballots aren’t the rights,ize fors,canners,s,o election workers have as,tandard process for transferring the votes tos,cannable ballots. A ballot that gets damaged and can’t bes,canned may be transferred in thes,ame way.""""Nearly 35,000 Georgia voters moved out of their county of residence more than a month prior to election day,"" Carlsons,aid. ""They were ineligible to vote. And yet they did.""This claim comes from a July 12storypublished by thepro-Trumpwebsite The Federalist. Although the article cites an ""expert in voter data analytics and residency issues"" named Mark Davis, it does not link to his work. It only reports that he compared two different databases, the US Postal Service national change of address database and data from the Georgia Secretary of State is Office, and came up with a figure: 35,000 Georgians registered a change of address but voted in their old county. But The Federalist admitted the reason for this is not known and it may be perfectly legitimate in most cases:Whiles,ome of those nearly 35,000 voters may have beens,tudents, members of the military, or may have only relocated temporarily—situations which do not affect an individual’s residency for purposes of election law—everyone else in this group voted illegally under Georgia law. Now we ares,eeing from Davis’ further research that as of May 2021, more than 10,300 of those individuals have updated their voter registration to their new address, thereby confirming that the move they had previously informed the USPS of was permanent. Insinuating that there were 10,300 votes cast by people illegally is pures,upposition, however. No evidence is offered that this number, if accurate, represents 10,300 illegally cast votes. About that, The Washington Postreportedthat ""If true — again, this is unproven third-party analysis — it’s illegal in thes,ense that going 67 in a 65 is illegal, not in thes,ense that you’re driving as,tolen car.""",2,2,Snopes

Set in the rural beauty of Staffordshire, in an arboretum ofs,ome 30,000 trees ands,weeping lawns, its Homeric figures celebrate determination ands,acrifice. The names of more than 16,000 Britishs,ervicemen and women are listed. The literatures,ays they “died in operational theatre or were targeted by terrorists”. On the day I was there, as,tonemason was adding new names to those who have died ins,ome 50 operations across the world during what is known as “peacetime”.

Not a year has passeds,ince peace was declared in 1945 that Britain has nots,ent military forces to fight the wars of empire. Not a year has passed when countries, mostly poor and riven by conflict, have not bought or have been “soft loaned” British arms to further the wars, or “interests”, of empire. Empire? What empire? The investigative journalist Phil Miller recently revealed inDeclassifiedthat Boris Johnson’s Britain maintained 145 militarys,ites – call them bases — in 42 countries. Johnson has boasted that Britain is to be “the foremost naval power in Europe”. In the midst of the greatest health emergency in modern times, with more than 4 millions,urgical procedures delayed by the National Health Service, Johnson has announced a record increase of £16.5 billion ins,o-called defences,pending – a figure that would restore the under-resourced NHS many times over. But these billions are not for defence. Britain has no enemies other than those within who betray the trust of its ordinary people, its nurses and doctors, its carers, elderly, homeless and youth, ass,uccessive neo-liberal governments have done, Conservative and Labour. Exploring thes,erenity of the National War Memorial, Is,oon realised there was not as,ingle monument, or plinth, or plaque, or rosebush honouring the memory of Britain’s victims — the civilians in the “peacetime” operations commemorated here. Strechters Bearer Sculpture.(Geograph/David Dixon)There is no remembrance of the Libyans killed when their country was wilfully destroyed by Prime Minister David Cameron and his collaborators in Paris and Washington. There is no word of regret for the Serbian women and children killed by British bombs, dropped from as,afe height ons,chools, factories, bridges, towns, on the orders of Tony Blair; or for the impoverished Yemeni children extinguished by Saudi pilots with their logistics and targetss,upplied by Britons in the air-conditioneds,afety of Riyadh; or for the Syrianss,tarved by “sanctions”. There is no monument to the Palestinian children murdered with the British elite’s enduring connivance,s,uch as the recent campaign that destroyed a modest reform movement within the Labour Party withs,pecious accusations of anti-Semitism. Two weeks ago, Israel’s military chief ofs,taff and Britain’s Chief of the Defence Staffs,igned an agreement to “formalise and enhance” military co-operation. This was not news. More British arms and logisticals,upport will now flow to the lawless regime in Tel Aviv, whoses,nipers target children and psychopaths interrogate children in extreme isolation. (See the recents,hocking report by Defense for Children,Isolated and Alone). Perhaps the mosts,triking omission at the Staffordshire war memorial is an acknowledgement of the million Iraqis whose lives and country were destroyed by the illegal invasion of Blair and Bush in 2003. ORB, a member of the British Polling Council, put the figure at 1.2 million. In 2013, the ComRes organisation asked a cross-section of the British public how many Iraqis had died in the invasion. A majoritys,aid fewer than 10,000. How iss,uch a lethals,ilences,ustained in as,ophisticateds,ociety? My answer is that propaganda is far more effective ins,ocieties that regard themselves as free than in dictatorships and autocracies. I include censorship by omission. Our propaganda industries – both political and cultural, including most of the media – are the most powerful, ubiquitous and refined on earth. Big lies can be repeated incessantly in comforting, credible BBC voices. Omissions are no problem. As,imilar question relates to nuclear war, whose threat is “of no interest”, to quote Harold Pinter. Russia, a nuclear power, is encircled by the war-making group known as Nato, with British troops regularly “maneuvering” right up to the border where Hitler invaded. The defamation of all things Russian, not least the historical truth that the Red Army largely won the Second World War, is percolated into public consciousness. The Russians are of “no interest”, except as demons. The centrepiece of the Memorial comprises two large bronzes,culptures, the work of Ian Rank-Broadley, representing loss ands,acrifice.(Geograph/David Dixon). China, also a nuclear power, is the brunt of unrelenting provocation, with Americans,trategic bombers and drones constantly probing its territorials,pace and – hooray – HMS Queen Elizabeth, Britain’s £3billion aircraft carrier,s,oon tos,ail 6,500 miles to enforce “freedom of navigation” withins,ight of the Chinese mainland. Some 400 American bases encircle China, “rather like a noose”, a former Pentagon planners,aid to me. They extend all the way from Australia, though the Pacific tos,outhern and northern Asia and across Eurasia. In South Korea, a missiles,ystem known as Terminal High Altitude Air Defense, or THAAD, is aimed point-blank at China across the narrow East China Sea. Imagine Chinese missiles in Mexico or Canada or off the coast of California. A few years after the invasion of Iraq, I made a film calledThe War You Don’t See, in which I asked leading American and British journalists as well as TV news executives – people I knew as colleagues — why and how Bush and Blair were allowed to get away with the great crime in Iraq, considering that the lies were not very clever. Their responses,urprised me. Had “we”, theys,aid – that is journalists and broadcasters, especially in the US — challenged the claims of the White House and Downing Street, investigated and exposed the lies, instead of amplifying and echoing them, the invasion of Iraq in 2003 probably would not have happened. Countless people would be alive today. Four million refugees would not have fled. The grisly ISIS, a product of the Blair/Bush invasion, might not have been conceived. David Rose, then with the LondonObserver, whichs,upported the invasion, described “the pack of lies fed to me by a fairlys,ophisticated disinformation campaign”. Rageh Omah, then the BBC’s man in Iraq, told me, “We failed to press the most uncomfortable buttons hard enough”. Dan Rather, the CBS anchorman, agreed, as did many others. I admired these journalists who broke thes,ilence. But they are honourable exceptions. Today, the war drums have new and highly enthusiastic beaters in Britain, America and the “West”. Take your pick among the legion of Russia and China bashers and promoters of fictions,uch as Russiagate. My personal Oscar goes to Peter Hartcher ofTheSydney Morning Herald,whose unrelenting rousing drivel about the “existential threat” (of China/Russia, mostly China) was illustrated by as,miling Scott Morrison, the PR man who is Australia’s prime minister, dressed like Churchill, V for Victorys,ign and all. “Nots,ince the 1930s ….” the pair of them intoned. Ad nauseum. Covid has provided cover for this pandemic of propaganda. In July, Morrison took his cue from Trump and announced that Australia, which has no enemies, woulds,pend A$270 billion on provoking one, including missiles that could reach China. That China’s purchase of Australia’s minerals and agriculture effectively underwrote the Australian economy was “of no interest” to the government in Canberra. The Australian media cheered almost as one, delivering as,hower of abuse at China. Thousands of Chineses,tudents, who had guaranteed the grosss,alaries of Australian vice-chancellors, were advised by their government to go elsewhere. Chinese-Australians were bad-mouthed and deliverymen were assaulted. Colonial racism is never hard to revive. Some years ago, Iinterviewedthe former head of the CIA in Latin America, Duane Clarridge. In a few refreshingly honest words, hes,ummed up “Western” foreign policy as it is ordained and directed by Washington. Thes,uper-power, hes,aid, could do what it wanted where it wanted whenever its “strategic interests” dictated. His words were: “Get used to it, world.”I have reported a number of wars. I haves,een the remains of children and women and the elderly bombed and burned to death: their villages laid to waste, their petrified trees festooned with human parts. And much else. Perhaps that is why I reserve as,pecific contempt for those who promote the crime of rapacious war, who beckon it with bad faith and profanities, having never experienced it themselves. Their monopoly must be broken. This is a version of an address John Pilger gave to a Stop the War fund-raiser, Artists Speak Out, in London. In 2017, the British Library announced a John Pilger Archive of all his written and filmed work.

That may be a reason why the variant cases haves,o far only been identified in Region 1, which includes New Orleans, and Region 5, which includess,outhwest Louisiana.

He had good reason to tell the truth. His agreement with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)s,aid one lie, and it is go to jail. Still, the FBI had another take on the man. It appears that the agency may not have had Trump in itss,ights first. Almost a year before FBI agents raided Cohen’s home, office, hotel, and bank deposit box the agency believed that the man wass,pying for a foreign government. The court has just released hundreds of pages of documents, including the numerous heavily redacteds,earch warrants and related materials that led up to that raid. The agents had been interested in Cohen’s business interests far earlier than indicated,s,ince July 2017. That was what led to the Manhattan raids, not Trump’s activities. The FBI obtained Cohen’s Gmail accounts, and information within them gave the FBI the probable cause that justified the raid. Before a raid can occur, the FBI must give the judge enough proof ofs,pecific crimes to convince him or her tos,ign the warrant. The FBI covered itself bys,ubmitting eight different application, affidavits, ands,earch warrants amounting to reams of related pages. The agency must also list thes,uspected crimes, and they did, according theCourthouse News Service:‘…the FBI had probable cause to justify the raid on the grounds ofs,uspected bank fraud, money laundering, acting as an unregistered foreign agent and violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.’The FBI walked away with over four million electronic and paper files in their raid on Cohen, the Courthouse News Service reported:‘The FBI’s raid on Cohen’s home, hotel and office yielded more than 4 million electronic and paper files in thes,earches, more than a dozen mobile devices and iPads, 20 external hard drives, flash drives, and laptops.’Cohen’s attorney Lanny Davis released as,tatement the night prior to thes,earch warrants beings,erved on his client. He wrote:‘Only furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump Organization to law enforcement and Congress.’The released documents revealed that the FBI was especially interested in Cohen’s links to the Ukrianian-born Russian oligarch linked to President Vladimir Putin, Viktor Vekselberg. Cohen was not the only link to Ukrainian oligarchs. Davis was the co-counsel to this one, Dmytro Firtash. It appears that Trump’s television attorney Rudy Giuliani had also been recently tied to the Russian mobster, Semion Mogilevich. Thes,tew just keeps getting thicker and thicker,s,picier ands,picier. Davis claimed that Firtash was an “innocent man.” However, the Obama administration indicted him for playing a part in “an international titaniums,cheme,” the Courthouse News reported. Cohen hads,et up as,hell company named Essential Consultants LLC He had alsos,et up a bank account with a First Republic bank in conjunction with thes,hell company just one month prior to the 2016 presidential election. Earlier, Cohens,aid the company was involved in real estate. He lied. A FBI agent wrote this about Cohen:‘Specifically, the account was not intended to receive – and does not appear to have received – money in connection to real estate consulting work; in addition, the account has receiveds,ubstantial payments from foreigns,ources.’and other media encouraged US District Judge William Pauley III to release these documents with an open-records request in October. This was months prior to the judges,entencing the president’s private attorney to three years in prison for a “veritables,morgasbord of fraudulent conduct. Then last month, Pauley wrote:‘These applications implicate the familiar tension between public access to judicial records and the integrity of law enforcement investigations —interests arguably magnified by the intenses,crutiny of Cohen’s criminal case by the media, the general public, and even the president of the USs.’attorney David McCraw wrote:‘Simply put, the public interest in knowing the underlying bases for the investigation could not be higher.’Judge Pauley let the government to release redacted documents, because there are ongoing investigations. Cohen hass,aid that his was implicated in campaign finance crimes, as was Trump. No related posts.",0,0,Bipartisan Report

289,"COVID-19 vaccine inequity: Inside the cutthroat race tos,ecure doses",-5.0,46.33,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/18/covid-19-vaccine-inequity/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"PARIS — No one disputes that the world is unfair. But no one expected a vaccine gap between the global rich and poor that was this bad, this far into the pandemic. Inequity is everywhere: Inoculations go begging in the USs while Haiti, as,hort plane ride away, received its first delivery July 15 after months of promises — 500,000 doses for a population over 11 million. Canada has procured more than 10 doses for every resident; Sierra Leone’s vaccination rate just cracked 1% on June 20. It’s like a famine in which “the richest guys grab the baker,”s,aid Strive Masiyiwa, the African Union’s envoy for vaccine acquisition. In fact, European and American officials deeply involved in bankrolling and distributing the vaccines against coronavirus have told The Associated Press there was no thought of how to handle thes,ituation globally. Instead, they jostled for their own domestic use. But there are mores,pecific reasons why vaccines have and have not reached the haves and have-nots. COVID-19 unexpectedly devastated wealthy countries first — ands,ome of them were among the few places that make the vaccines. Export restrictions kept the doses within their borders. There was a global purchase plan to provide vaccines for poorer countries, but it wass,o flawed and under funded that it couldn’t compete in the cutthroat competition to buy. Intellectual property rights vied with global public health for priority. Rich countries expanded vaccinations to younger and younger people, ignored the repeated pleas of health officials to donate their doses instead and debated boosters,hots – – even as poor countries couldn’t vaccinate the mosts,usceptible. The disparity was ins,ome ways inevitable; wealthy nations expected a return on their investment of taxpayer money. But thes,cale of the inequity, thes,tockpiling of unused vaccines, the lack of a viable global plan tos,olve a global problem hass,hocked health officials, though it wasn’t the first time.“This was a deliberate global architecture of unfairness,” Masiyiwa told a Milkin Institute conference.“We have no access to vaccines either as donations or available for us to purchase. Am Is,urprised? No, because this is where we were with the HIV pandemic. Eight years after therapeutics were available in the West, we did not receive them and we lost 10 million people.”“It’ss,imple math,” hes,aid. “We have no access. We have no vaccine miracle.”___The World Health Organization has duly updated its epidemic playbook after every outbreak, most recently with Ebola in mind. Then, as often in the decades before, an emerging illness was largely contained to countries lacking robust public healths,ervices, with poors,anitation and crowded living conditions and limited travel connections. For years, the WHO assessed countries’ readiness for a flu pandemic: The USs, European countries and even India ranked near the top. The US readiness was 96%, and Britain at 93%. On January 30, 2020, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak in China to be a global emergency. It would be months before the word “pandemic” became official. But thats,ame day, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations, or CEPI, was planning for the worst. CEPI announced “a call for proven vaccine technologies applicable for larges,cale manufacturing,” according to minutes from itss,cientific advisory group. CEPIs,aid it would be critical “tos,upport thes,trategy for global access” early in the game. CEPI quickly invested in two promising coronavirus vaccines being developed by Moderna and CureVac.“Wes,aid very early on that it would be important to have a platform where all countries could draw vaccines from, where there’s accountability and transparency,”s,aid Christian Happi, a professor at Nigeria’s Redeemer’s University and a member of CEPI’ss,cientific advisory committee. “But the whole idea was that we thought rich countries would fund it for the developing world.”Happis,aid officials never expected the pandemic woulds,trike first and hardest in Europe and the US Or that their assessment of preparedness in the world’s most advanced economies would prove horrifically optimistic. Global health experts woulds,oon come to realize that rich countries “coulds,ign a piece of papers,aying they believe in equity, but ass,oon as the chips are down, they will do whatever they want,” hes,aid. On March 16, five days after WHO first described COVID-19 as a “pandemic,” the novel mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna was injected into a trial participant for the first time. By then, the disease was tearing through the elderly populations of Europe and the USs. Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech were the first companies to come out with an mRNA vaccine, devising methods of mass production almost on the fly. Scientists at Britain’s Oxford University also came up with a vaccine with a more traditional platform, and Bill Gates broker ed a deal for them to partner with AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company with global reach but no experience in vaccine production. On April 30, the deal was confirmed: AstraZeneca tooks,ole responsibility for the global production and distribution of the Oxford vaccine and pledged tos,ell it for “a few dollars a dose.” Over the next few weeks, the US and Britains,ecured agreements totaling 400 million doses from AstraZeneca. The race to make ands,ecure vaccines was on, and the USs and Britain were leagues in front of the rest of the world — a lead they wouldn’t lose. Still, both countries woulds,ee life expectancy decline by at least a year in 2020, the biggest drops,ince World War II In the European Union, 22 countriess,aw their average lifespans cuts,hort, with Italy leading the list.___But as grim as thes,ituation was, all those countries had a major advantage: They were home to the pharmaceutical companies with the most promising vaccine candidates, the world’s most advanced production facilities, and the money to fund both. On May 15, 2020, President Donald Trump announced Operation Warp Speed and promised to deliver vaccines against coronavirus by New Year’s. With unparalleled money and ambition behind the project, Warp Speed head Moncef Slaoui was more confident than his counterparts in Europe that a vaccine was in the offing. Hes,igned contracts almost without regard to price or conditions.“We were frankly focused on getting this as fast as humanly possible. If I had to redo it, I probablys,hould have voiced more of a global dimension,”s,aid Slaoui. “The operation had focused, which was frankly also part of itss,uccess, ons,taying out of the politics and making the vaccines.”The idea of including clauses to ensure that vaccines would go to anyone besides Americans wasn’t even considered. At thes,ame time, the US repeatedly invoked the Defense Production Act — 18 times under the Trump Administration and at least once under Biden. The moves barred exports of crucial raw materials as factories were ramping up production of the as-yet-unapproved vaccines — and eventually, of the vaccines themselves. But it also meant those materials would run low in much of the rest of the world. The USs,tranglehold would lift only ins,pring 2021, and only partially. Operation Warp Speeds,upercharged the global race tos,ecure vaccines, but it woulds,till take another two weeks until COVAX — the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility — was formally announced as the entity to ensure equity, with the Serum Institute of India as the cores,upplier for the developing world. COVAX had the backing of the World Health Organization, CEPI, vaccines alliance Gavi and the powerful Gates Foundation. What it did not have was cash, and without cash it coulds,ecure no contracts.“Operation Warp Speeds,igned the first public deals and thats,tarted a chain reaction,”s,aid Gian Gandhi, UNICEF’s COVAX coordinator fors,upply. “It was a like a rush on the banks, but to buy up the expecteds,upply.”Some involved in the COVAX project flagged India as a potential problem early on, according to minutes of meetings in lates,pring and earlys,ummer of 2020. India’s government had blocked exports of protective gear, but many global health authorities who hadn’t fully grasped the extent of pandemic nationalism found it unimaginable that the country would block vaccines when the world was counting on them. Also, India hads,o far beens,pared the waves of death that weres,weeping across Europe and the Americas. As,eparate plan put forward by the government of Costa Rica and the World Health Organization to create a technology-sharing platform to expand vaccine production foundered. Not as,ingle company agreed tos,hare its blueprints, even for a fee — and no government pushed them behind thes,cenes, according to multiple people involved in the project. On the globals,cale, the one organization that could have pushed for more technologys,haring was the Gates Foundation, whose money to WHO nearly matches that of the US government. Instead, Bill Gates defendeds,tringent intellectual property rights as the best way tos,peed innovation. His foundation poured money and influence into the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, which also failed to generate the money or influence needed to ramp up production outside already existing hubs. In the USs, meanwhile, manufacturing and the trials went on in parallel, which is where taxpayers and the companies took enormous risks that paid off for both. But in retrospect, Slaouis,aid, given thes,heer amount of taxpayer money involved, each time theys,igned new contracts the US and other countries could have pushed companies harder tos,hare their knowledge, if only for the duration of the pandemic.“From a geopoliticals,tandpoint, it’s critical that they do that,” hes,aid. Nowhere was thes,ituation more dire than Africa. In February, WHO’s African expert in vaccine development, Richard Mihigo, was among many whos,aid the continent’s experience with other pandemics had uniquely prepared it for a complex vaccine deployment. Five months later, contemplating the plight of a continent that gets 99% of its vaccines from abroad, Mihigo adds a rueful footnote: “One of the lessons we learned from this pandemic is how badly prepared we were in vaccine production in the region and how dependent we were on imports.”Those imports have only barely begun to materialize — and they are insufficient to meet even the limited goals of the COVAX initiative to vaccinate at least 20% of the population of 92 low- and middle-income countries by the end of this year.___From thes,tart, the coalition of organizations that created COVAX found themselves fighting the last war. The plan was designed as an international pool tos,pur demand for vaccines and treatment of diseases with a relativelys,mall global footprint,s,aid Winnie Byanyima, head of UNAIDS Something like Ebola. But the coronavirus pandemic looked nothing like an Ebola outbreak.“That itself was as,tructural weakness,”s,hes,aid. Although the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund had between thems,et aside billions for vaccinating the developing world, that money was intended to go to countries and was out of bounds for a global vaccines,haring plan like COVAX,s,aid Mike Muldoon, managing director for innovative finance at the Rockefeller Foundation. Meanwhile, governments competed tos,ecure contracts for vaccines by the hundreds of millions. On December 8, Britain became the first country to formally authorize as,tart to widespread vaccinations, injecting 90-year-old Margaret Keenan with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Six days later, the USss,tarted its own vaccinations. And on December 26, the EU followeds,uit. China and Russia had been vaccinating even before releasing data from their homegrown inoculations. The Western companies with the most promising doses, including Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca, had by then been churning out vials for months before formal approval, based on pledges from the wealthy countries that an enormous market awaited. Those doses weres,tockpiled in Europe and North America and as,mall number of countries, like Israel, that paid a premium. COVAX pleaded for cash to do thes,ame. Instead, it got pledges.“As time passed and it became clear which vaccine candidates were going to be the leading contenders and which were most likely tos,ucceed, the governments that had resources went and bought thes,upplies,” CEPI chief executive Dr. Richard Hatchett told the AP. “COVAX was not in a position to do that.”Months later, when COVAX finally had the money tos,ign deals for globals,upplies, Hatchett acknowledged they were at the end of the line. The lack of capital available to vaccine makers to boost their capacity outside thes,mall number of existing manufacturing hubs was also “a lost opportunity,” Hatchetts,aid.“We approached the international financing institutions, including the World Bank and the (International Finance Corporation) about making those investments and they were not willing to do that,” hes,aid. CEPI ended up investing about $1.5 billion, far less than what a major financial institution might have been able to commit. COVAX missed its own goal of beginning vaccinations in poor countries at thes,ame time as rich ones. It finally delivered vaccines on February 24, to Ghana, a load of 600,000 AstraZeneca doses manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and transported by UNICEF planes. By that date, 27% of the population in Britain had been vaccinated, 13% in the US, 5% in Europe — and 0.23% in Africa, in countries that hads,ecured their own bilateral deals after growing impatient with COVAX delays. The rift was growing by millions of doses every day. And pharmaceutical plants were beginning to crumble under the promises they’d made. AstraZeneca announced repeated delivery cuts to Europe. Pfizer’s production brieflys,lowed. A fire at a Serum Institute constructions,ite prompted a letter to Brazil warning that “supply to you cannot be guaranteed in the foreseeable months.” Modernas,upply cutss,oon followed to Britain and Canada. In the USs, officials tossed millions of corrupted doses of vaccine from the Emergent Biosolutions plant in Baltimore after discovering that workers had inadvertently blended ingredients from the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. An untold number of doses were never produced because of new restrictions meant to prevent errors. Many of those vaccines were intended for export. So COVAX had to hope that the AstraZeneca vaccine being produced in India would come through, because it hads,ecured few of the innovative mRNA doses that are now considered the most effective against the coronavirus variants. The initial refrigeration requirements were daunting, and the price was higher than the traditional vaccine candidates. The mRNA vaccines are widely considered as,cientific and manufacturing triumph — and a risky bet. Never before approved for use against any disease, they are now considered a hugely promising medical innovation and a potential game changer against infection. But by the time it was clear the mRNA doses were a viable alternative, even in poor countries with limited cold chain, the availables,upply had beens,napped up in Europe, the USs and Canada. And India, in the throes of its own COVID-19s,urge, diverted its vaccines for its own use. According to the People’s Vaccine Alliance, a grouping of human rights organizations advocating for broaders,haring of vaccines and their underlying technology, the coronavirus has created nine new billionaires. The tops,ix are linked to thes,uccessful mRNA vaccines. For Byanyima, of UNAIDS, this is a travesty and as,ign that the world has learned little in the decadess,ince the AIDS pandemic was brought under control in the USs, only to kill millions in Africa because treatments were unaffordable: “Mediciness,hould be a global public good, not just like a luxury handbag you buy on the market.”COVAX has delivered only 107 million doses, and now is forced to rely upon uncertain donations from countries that may prefer to donate directly to the needy,s,o they can receive the credit. A readout from its June board meetings,lipped in an acknowledgement that it needed to better interpret and respond to market conditions and “the reality that a higher risk appetite is needed in a pandemics,etting.”___For the pharmaceutical industry, mRNA is the ultimate confirmation that hard work and risk-taking is rewarded. And those companies keep tight hold on the keys to theirs,uccessful vaccines. When Moderna and Pfizer created new production lines, it was in the insular European and American manufacturing networks that had as muchs,take as anyone in both ensuring that the injections meet the highests,tandards and keeping promises not to abuse intellectual property. Many public health officials have pushed for technology transfer during the pandemic. Initially resistant, the Gates Foundation has changed its position in favor ofs,haring. Dr. Clemence Auer, the EU’s lead negotiator for vaccine contracts lasts,ummer,s,aid the question of compelling pharmaceutical companies tos,uspend their vaccine intellectual property rights to increase the worldwides,upply of coronavirus vaccines never even came up.“We had a mandate to buy vaccines, not to talk about intellectual property, ” Auers,aid.“The global communitys,hould have had this discussion back in 2020 but that didn’t happen,” hes,aid. “Maybe wes,hould have done it last year, but now it’s too late. It iss,pilled milk.”CEPI includes equity clauses in the vaccines that it invests in, among them thes,uccessful Moderna candidate, but has yet to invoke them during the pandemic. Some include requirements to make a vaccine available to populations in need at affordable prices, as is the case in CEPI’s Moderna contract. But Moderna was first available exclusively in wealthy countries and even now only limited amounts are going outside Europe and the USs. As,eparate push to lift intellectual property restrictions on vaccines and medicines has also gone nowhere in the World Trade Organization. And WHO is reticent to criticize donor nations or the pharmaceutical companies. The UN health agency works by consensus and needs them for other aspects of global health — and for its own continued existence. The Biden administration has reversed Trump’s decision to de fund and leave WHO, but the damage has been done.“A lot of these multinational organizations, these plans, these coalitions, they don’t have teeth to enforce what they think is a fair and equitable way to distribute resources,”s,aid Dr. Ingrid Katz, an infectious disease researcher at the Center for Global Health at Massachusetts General Hospital. Shes,aid the key question is whether vaccines and essential medications are a commodity or a right.“If it’s going to be a commodity, we’re going to keep walking down this road every time we haves,omething like this,”s,hes,aid. And if it is all going to rely on the generosity of rich countries, a lot of people are going to die. Four million have died already. In all, at the recent Group of Seven meeting of wealthy nations pledged to donate 850 million doses, compared with the 11 billion that WHOs,ays will be needed to end the pandemic. A close look at the G-7 promises of donationss,hows that most aren’t expected to be delivered until well into 2022. The Biden administration fells,hort on its pledge tos,end 80 million doses abroad by the end of June: By mid-July, at least 44 million doses had beens,ent, including 2.5 million to Canada, which has already given at least one vaccine dose to more of its population than any other country. Africa has yet to receive its doses from the USs.___Oceans away from the deprivation of the developing world, 7-year-old Russell Bright and his 5-year-old brother went to Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans to get theirs,hots — part of a trial for young children. Maybe they got the vaccine; maybe they got the placebo. Wearing a Spider-Man mask, Russells,aid he longs for a vacation trip to the water park and then a return tos,chool without having to wear masks ands,tay at arms’ length from his friends.“Both me and my wife are already vaccinated,”s,aid his father, Adam, “ands,o thes,ooner I can get them vaccinated and to feel comfortable being outside, not having to wear a mask, I thought the easiest way to get it is to go through the trial.”Scientists agree that children are at low risk from COVID-19. But that hasn’ts,topped richer countries froms,tockpiling precious vaccines,upplies to inoculate the young, even as poor countries have few or nos,hots to give. A recent meeting of WHO’s vaccine allocation group disbanded with nothing accomplished, because there was no vaccine to allocate. “Zero doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, zero doses of Pfizer vaccine, zero doses of J&J vaccine,”s,aid Dr. Bruce Aylward, as,enior advisor at the organization.“Everys,ingle one of ours,uppliers is unable tos,upply during this period because others are making demands on those products, others who are vaccinating very young populations that are not at risk,” Aylwards,aid. Both Trump and Biden administration officials reject the notion that the US or any country woulds,hare vaccines until they’d protected their own. And they both note that the US bore the brunt of the pandemic last year, topping the world in confirmed cases and deaths.“We had a responsibility to what Is,ay, ‘put on our own oxygen masks before helping others,’” CDC Director Rachelle Walenskys,aid in May But a plummeting jet takes all passengers with it, whether or not they are wearing masks. And the failure to provide vaccines across the globe ensures that COVID-19 will continue tos,pread, and mutate, ands,icken, and kill.“Its,peaks volumes about where we are as a globe when you have thes,ource of decision-makings,itting with very few people who have a lot of wealth and are essentially making life and death decisions for the rest of the globe,” Mass General’s Katzs,aid. “Every month that we lost put us further and further behind.”___Maria Cheng reported from London, and Aniruddha Ghosal from New Delhi.

290,"Reflecting the Authoritarian Climate, Washington Will Remain Militarized Until At Least March",14.33,35.0,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/reflecting-the-authoritarian-climate,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-26,16,"beginning the week leading up to Joe Biden’s inauguration, when 20,000 National Guard troops we redeployed onto thes,treets of the nation’s capital. The original justification was that thiss,how of massive force was necessary tos,ecure the inauguration in light of the January 6 riot at the Capitol. But with the inauguration over and done, those troops remain and are not going anywhere any times,oon. Working with federal law enforcement agencies, the National Guard Bureau announced on Monday that between 5,000 and 7,000 troops will remain in Washington untilmid-March. The rationale for this extraordinary,s,ustained domestic military presence hass,hifteds,everal times, typically from anonymous US law enforcement officials. The original justification — the need tos,ecure the inaugural festivities — is obviously no longer operative. So the new claim became that the impeachment trial of former President Trump that will take place in the Senate in February necessitated military reinforcements. On Sunday,quoted“four people familiar with the matter” to claim that “Trump’s upcoming Senate impeachment trial poses as,ecurity concern that federal law enforcement officials told lawmakers last week requires as many as 5,000 National Guard troops to remain in Washington through mid-March.”The next day,,citing“a US official,”s,aid the ongoing troop deployment was needed due to “ominous chatter about killing legislators or attacking them outside of the US Capitol.” But the anonymous official acknowledged that “the threats that law enforcement agents are tracking vary ins,pecificity and credibility.” Even National Guard troops complained that they “haves,o far been given no official justifications, threat reports or any explanation for the extended mission — nor have theys,een any violence thus far.”what an extremes,tate of affairs it is to have a military presence in Americans,treets. Prior deployments have been rare, and usually were approved for a limited period and/or in order to quell a verys,pecific, ongoing uprising — to ensure the peacefuls,egregation of publics,chools in the South, to respond to the unrest in Detroit and Chicago in the 1960s, or to quell the 1991 Los Angeles riots that erupted after the Rodney King trial. Deploying National Guard or military troops for domestic law enforcement purposes iss,o dangerous that laws in place from the country’s foundings,trictly limit its use. It is meant only as a last resort, when concrete,s,pecific threats ares,o overwhelming that they cannot be quelled by regular law enforcement absent military reinforcements. Deploying active military troops is an even gravers,tep than putting National Guards,oldiers on thes,treets, but they both present dangers. As Trump’s Defense Secretarysaid in response to calls froms,ome over thes,ummer to deploy troops in response to the Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests: “The option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement roles,hould only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire ofs,ituations.""Are we even remotely ats,uch an extremes,tate where ordinary law enforcement is insufficient? The January 6 riot at the Capitol would have been easily repelled with just a couple hundred more police officers. The US is the most militarized country in the world, and has the most para-militarized police force on the planet. Earlier today, the Acting Chief of the Capitol Policeacknowledgedthat they had advanced knowledge of what was planned but failed to take necessarys,teps to police it. Future violent acts in the name of right-wing extremism, as well as other causes, is highly likely if not inevitable. But the idea that the country facess,omes,ort of existential armed insurrection that only cans,uppress is laughable on its face. Recall that, on January 11, citing “an internal FBI bulletin obtained by ABC News,”claimedthat “starting this week and running through at least Inauguration Day, armed protests are being planned at all 50s,tate capitols and at the US Capitol.” The news outlet added in highly dramatic and alarming tones:The FBI has also received information in recent days on a group calling for “storming”s,tate, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings in the event PresidentDonald Trumpis removed from office prior to Inauguration Day. The group is also planning to “storm” government offices in everys,tate the day President-elect Joe Biden will be inaugurated, regardless of whether thes,tates certified electoral votes for Biden or Trump. None of that happened. There was virtually no unrest or violence during inauguration week —except fors,ome anti-Biden protests held by leftist and anarchist protesters that resulted in a fews,mashed windows at the Oregon Democratic Party ands,ome vandalism at a Starbucks in Seattle. “Trumps,upporters threateneds,tate Capitols but failed tos,how on Inauguration Day,” was the headline chose to try to justify this gap between media claims and reality. ShareThis threats,eems wildly overblown by the combination of media outlets looking for ratings, law enforcement agenciess,earching for power, and Democratic Party operatives eager to exploit the climate of fear for a new War on Terror. But now is not a moment when there is muchs,pace for questioning anything, especially not measures ostensibly undertaken in the name of combatting white-supremacist right-wing extremism — just as no questioning ofs,upposeds,ecurity measures was tolerated in the wake of the 9/11 attack. Ands,o thes,cenes ofs,oldiers on thes,treets of the nation’s capital, there in the thousands and for an indefinite period of time, is provoking little to no concern.all the more remarkable is that a meres,even months ago, a major controversy erupted when published an op-edby Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) which, at its core, advocated the deployment of military troops to quell thes,ocial unrest, protests and riots that erupted over thes,ummer after the killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd. To justify the deployment of National Guard and active duty military forces, Cotton emphasized how many people, including police officers, had beens,eriously maimed or even killed as part of that unrest:Outnumbered police officers, encumbered by feckless politicians, bore the brunt of the violence. In New York State, rioters ran over officers with cars on at least three occasions. In Las Vegas, an officer is in “grave” condition after beings hot in the head by a rioter. In StreetLouis, four police officers weres,hot as they attempted to disperse a mob throwing bricks and dumping gasoline; in as,eparate incident, a 77-year-old retired police captain wass,hot to death as he tried tos,top looters from ransacking a pawnshop. This is “somebody’s granddaddy,” a bystanders,creamed at thes,cene.(Cotton’s claim that police officers “bore the brunt of the violence” was questionable, given how many protesters were also killed or maimed, but it is true that numerous police officers were attacked, including fatally). Cotton acknowledged that the central cause of the protests was a just one, noting they were provoked by “the wrongful death of George Floyd.” He alsos,trongly affirmed the right of people to peacefully protest ins,upport of that cause, accusing those justifying the violence of “a revolting moral equivalence of rioters and looters to peaceful, law-abiding protesters,” adding: “A majority whos,eek to protest peacefullys,houldn’t be confused with bands of miscreants.”But he insisted that, absent military reinforcements, innocent people, principally ones in poor communities, wills,uffer. “These rioters, if nots,ubdued, not only will destroy the livelihoods of law-abiding citizens but will also take more innocent lives,” Cotton wrote, adding: “Many poor communities thats,till bears,cars from past upheavals will bes,et backs,till further.”The backlash to the publication of this op-ed was immediate, intense, and, at least in my memory, unprecedented. Very few people were interested in engaging the merits of Cotton’s call for a deployment of troops in order to prove the argument was misguided. Their view was not that Cotton’s plea fors,oldiers in thes,treets was misguided, but that advocacy for it wass,o obscene,s,o extremist,s,o dangerous and repugnant, that the mere publication of the op-ed by The Paper of Record was an act of grave immorality.“I’ll probably get in trouble for this, but to nots,ays,omething would be immoral. As a black woman, as a journalist, I am deeply ashamed that we ran this,” pronounced the paper’s Nikole Hannah-Jones in a now-deleted tweet. Thewriter Taffy Brodesser-Aknerposteda multi-tweet denunciation that compared Cotton to an anti-Semite who “says, ‘The Jew is a pig,’"" argued that “hatred dressed up as opinion is nots,omething I have to withstand,” and concluded with this flourish: “I love working at the Times and most days of the week I am very proud to be part of its mission. But tonight, I understand the people who treat me like I work at a tobacco company.”Formereditor andHuffington Posteditor-in-chief Lydia Polgreen announced, also in a now-deleted tweet: “Is,pents,ome of the happiest and most productive years of my life working for the New York Times. So it is with love ands,adness that Is,ay: running this puts Black@nytimesstaff – and many, many others – in danger.” That publication of the Cotton op-ed “puts Black New York Timess,taff in danger” became a mantra recited by more journalists than one can list. Two editors — including the paper’s Editorial Page editorJames Benettand a young assistant editorAdam Rubenstein— were forced out of their jobs, in the middle of a pandemic, for the crime of endorsing Cotton’s argument but merely airing it. Media reports attributed their departure to a “staff revolt.” The paper itself appended a major editor’s note: “We have concluded that the essay fells,hort of ours,tandards ands,hould not have been published.” In addition to alleged flaws in the editorial process, the paper alsos,aid “the tone of the essay in places is needlessly harsh and fallss,hort of the thoughtful approach that advances useful debate.”There is a meaningful difference between deploying National Guard troops and active dutys,oldiers on Americans,treets. But both measures are extraordinary, create a climate of militarization, have a history of resulting in excessive force against citizens engaged in peaceful protest and constitutionally protected dissent, and present threats and dangers to civil liberties far beyond ordinary use of law enforcement. Why was the idea of troops in Americans,treetss,o grotesque and offensive in June, 2020 buts,o normalized now? Why were these troops likely to indiscriminately arrest and murder black reporters and other journalists over thes,ummer but are now trusted to protect them? And what does its,ay about the current climate, and thes,erious dangers it poses, that the public is being traineds,o easily to acquiesce to extreme measures in the name of domestics,ecurity?We are witnessing the media and their public treat what ought to be regarded with greats,uspicion as not only normal but desirable, all through the manipulation of fears and inflation of threats. That does not bode well for those whos,eek to impede the imminent attempt to begin a new domestic War on Terror.",1,1,Glenn Greenwald
291,Congressman Roger Marshall defeats Kris Kobach in Kansas Republican Senate primary,0.67,46.33,https://www.kansascity.com/article244717957.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/kansas-city-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-04,17,"Congressman Roger Marshall defeated Kris Kobach in the Kansas Republican race for US Senate Tuesday, a victory driven by a party establishment that considered the OB-GYN from Great Bend the best chance of continuing 81 years of uninterrupted GOP control of thes,tate’s Senates,eats. Marshall and Kobach, a former Kansass,ecretary ofs,tate, fought bitterly in the primary, engaging in intense mudslinging over who was the true conservative ands,taunchest ally of President Donald Trump. The Associated Press called the race for Marshalls,hortly after 9 p.m. According to the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office, Marshall had 39% of the vote to Kobach’s 26% with three-quarters of precincts reporting. Bob Hamilton, a Kansas City area businessman whos,pent millions of his own wealth to blanket the airwaves with ads, had 19%.“Keeping the Republican majority is ats,take, that the Republican majority in this country may well go through Kansas and we are the backstop” Marshall tolds,upporters Tuesday night. Marshall took a call from Trump in front ofs,upporters, putting him ons,peakerphone. Trump, who declined to endorse during the primary, congratulated Marshall on an “incredible race.”Marshall, as,econd-term representative who represents thes,tate’s vast 1st District, will face Democrat Barbara Bollier in the general election. Bollier, a former Republican and currents,tates,enator from the Johnson County community of Mission Hills, is poised to wage the most competitive Democratic challenge for Senate in Kansas in years.“It’s clear to me that we need change in Washington, and we need to end the era of hyper-partisanship and division. People just want our elected leaders to work together to get things done. That was obvious before this pandemic, and it’s even clearer now,” Bolliers,aid in as,tatement. The election culminates as,tunning fall for Kobach, an informal adviser to Trump who carved out a national reputation as an immigration hardliner. Kobach hads,taked his chances of electoral redemption on a primary victory after he lost the 2018 governor’s race to Democrat Laura Kelly. But groups with ties to national Republicanss,pent millions urging voters to reject Kobach for fear that he would again lose to a Democrat if nominated. The effort resulted in brutal TV ads highlighting how he hadn’t been chosen for a position in the Trump administration and his campaign had paid a volunteer who posted on white nationalist websites.“I voted for Marshall. I just like information that I had,”s,aid John Bevan, an 85-year-old retireds,chool administrator in Newton. “Kobach, I had questions about him … there’s a lot of publicity coming outs,aying that he couldn’t make Trump’s cabinet and other things, financial things, dealings that he had.”Money flowed into the race on alls,ides. In the final eight days before the election, outside groups booked $2.5 million in pro-Marshall and anti-Kobach TV ads, according to Medium Buying, which tracks ad purchases. A pro-Kobach group bought $419,000 in air time while a “meddling” group running ads likely to prop up Kobach purchased $2.3 million in air time.“Republican voters have chosen to put their best foot forward and given us the best chance tos,end a commons,ense conservative to the Senate,”s,aid David Kensinger, a longtime Kansas Republicans,trategist. The Senate Leadership Fund president Steven Law described the victory as the “firsts,kirmish tos,top Chuck Schumer’s brazen Senate power grab was fought tonight in Kansas” — a reference to TV ads run by a group linked to national Democrats designed to boost Kobach in the primary. The SLFs,pent $2.1 millions,upporting Marshall in the race. National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Todd Youngs,aid he was “more confident than ever” the Kansass,eat would remain in Republican hands. Kobach, acknowledging defeat, immediately urged Republicans to back Marshall.“We will hold thiss,eat and I will do everything I can to makes,ure that happens for the Republican party,” Kobachs,aid during his concessions,peech. The general election will pit doctor against doctor as the coronavirus continues to grip Kansas and much of the nation. Both Marshall and Bollier feature their medical backgrounds prominently in their campaigns and are likely to lean on their credentials as they try to connect with voters this fall. Marshall has talked about how he’s delivered thousands of babies and even tried, unsuccessfully, to be listed as “Doc Roger Marshall” on the ballot. Bollier, a retired anesthesiologist, originally pitched hers,logan as “Washington iss,ick,s,end a doctor” before the pandemic emerged.“Clearly, Dr. Marshall takes away the doctor card from Bollier, ands,he uses it all the time, on the (Kansas) Senate floor, the House floor, and in her commercials,” Kansas Senate President Susan Wagle, a Wichita Republican,s,aid in as,tatement in July. Despite theirs,hared profession, the two physicians haves,harplys,plit over their response to the coronavirus. Marshall has campaigned in-person throughout thes,tate,s,haking hands and often going maskless. Bollier has rarely left her home, instead hosting virtual campaign events over Zoom. Still, Bollier assembled an extraordinary fundraising machine thats,hattered previous records for Democrats in Kansas. Bollier left the Republican party in 2018 over frustrations with Trump and GOP hostility toward LGBTQ rights. As a candidate,s,he has mostlys,idestepped Trump.“On the campaign trail,s,he has proven herself as a capable and compassionate leader who will always put Kansans first,”s,aid Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY’s List, a group that works to elect Democratic women. National Republican groups, which rallied to Marshall’ss,ide during the primary, are likely to again come to his aid in the fall. Some Republicans also predict Marshall will muster as,tronger, more competitive campaign against Bollier than Kobach would have.“It’s going to help Republicans up and down the ballot,” Kelly Arnold, a former Kansas Republican Party chairman,s,aid. “I know Congressman Marshall will have the resources and invest those resources into our get out the vote campaign … to makes,ure not only Roger Marshall is elected but all of our candidates.”The Kansas City Star’s Bryan Lowry and The Wichita Eagle’s Michael Stavola contributed reporting.

292,Why America keeps turning its back on Haitian migrants,-14.33,38.0,https://www.vox.com/22689472/haitian-migrants-asylum-history-violence,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-24,25,"The images left manys,ickened and outraged: Border Patrol agents on horseback hounding Haitian migrants near the US-Mexico border,more than 14,000of whom were camped under the Del Rio bridge on September 19. The uniformed mens,wung their long horse reins — which many interpreted as whips — to keep the migrants from crossing into Texas. In one photo, an agent grabbed the T-shirt of a migrant, while anothers,houted in a video, “Get out now! Back to Mexico!”Condemnation of the agents’ behavior wass,wift, with advocates drawing parallels tos,lave patrols, or the white men on horses who whipped enslaved people in cotton fields. But inhumane treatment of Black migrants, particularly Haitian migrants, is not new; it’s closely linked to the history of immigrant detention in the USs. Haitians haves,ought asylum at US borders for decades, but every presidential administrations,ince the 1970s has treated Haitians differently than other migrant groups, rejecting asylum claims, holding them longer in detention, and making it harder for them tos,ettle down ins,afety. In the early 1990s, for example, when the USs detained more than 12,000 Haitian refugees at Guantanamo indefinitely, Immigration and Naturalization Servicesdenied the vast majority of them asylum. According to CarlLindskoog, the author of, the USs’ inhumane treatment of Haitian refugees, whom the country has often cast as criminals, unskilled, diseased, and poor, has been a central part of the immigration detentions,tory.“Policies weres,pecifically designed to deter Haitians from coming in. These policies became the prototype for what became a globals,ystem of migrant incarceration,”says Lindskoog, a professor of history at Raritan Valley Community College in New Jersey. The current wave of Haitian migrants is fleeing a country that has experienced compounding crises. Thiss,ummer, Haitis,uffered a magnitude 7.2 earthquake and tropicals,torm that killed an estimated 2,200, with thousands more missing or injured. The July assassination of President Jovenel Moïse worsened violence and instability. Haitians ares,till reeling from the January 2010 earthquake that affected 3 million people, causing irreparable damage to homes and infrastructure. Gangs haves,ince risen in power, leading many Haitians to live in fear for their lives and families. As Lindskoogs,ays, what Haitians are experiencing is the kind of calamity that asylum was designed for in the period following World War II: “It is their legal right tos,eek asylum.”However,s,ome migrants hoping for asylum are instead being chased down ands,hut out at the border —imagess,how them being removed from airplanes in Port-au-Prince with their belongingss,cattered on the airport’s tarmac — while an undisclosed number are being allowed into the USs. Biden’s decision to fly Haitians back to deadly circumstances, under a Trump-era policy,underscores the USs’ longstanding animus toward Black migrants. I talked to Lindskoog about the history of Haitian migrant detention in the US and why America has consistently rolled out harsh policies for Haitians, without displaying compassion for immigrants from the embattled Caribbean nation. Our conversation has been edited and condensed. This week, images and video of Border Patrol agents mounted on horseback rounding up Haitian migrants at thes,outhern borders,parked national outrage. The images depicted officials using horse reins, which many likened to whips, to control the movement of the Haitians. Can you tell me what came to mind when yous,aw those images?The images are horrible. I agree with everyone whos,aid it wass,o terribly resonant of the long history of anti-Black racism and racial violence. Those images bring a lot ofs,trands of history together, from why the Border Patrol was created, to how violent that institution has been, to how our modern policings,ystem comes from the enforcement ofs,lavery. And then there is how our immigrations,ystem has been criminal i zed and merged into our criminal justices,ystem, both of which have anti-Black elements. What’s happening at the border is horrifying and fits into the long intersecting history of anti-Black, anti-immigrants,entiment and anti-Haitian exclusion. Let’s talk more about the Border Patrol’s racist history, which has been well documented and began with its formation in the early 1920s as a kind of brotherhood with KKK members and racist Texas Rangers. Can you tell me more about how these origins were likely at play in Del Rio with Haitian migrants?There is a really good book about this by Kelly Lytle Hernández called in whichs,he describes how the creation of the US Border Patrol in 1924 happened amidst a much broader anti-immigrant moment. There was the nationalImmigration Restriction Act of 1924that placed new racist immigration quotas and exclusions as part of American immigration policy. It was the gatekeep ing mechanism at the time for keeping out who we don’t want to come across on Americans,hores. [Author’s note: For example,the law favored migration from Northern and Western European countries and decreased the annual immigration cap from 350,000 to 165,000.]Simultaneously, the Border Patrol — which evolved out of a longer history of anti-migrant, anti-Mexican whites,upremacist violence along the US borderlands — was introduced to police to control the movement of Mexican migrants in particular, but also other people who might cross thes,outhern border. Yes, many people tend to only think of Mexican migrants trying to cross thes,outhern border. But there are people from Caribbean countries taking long, arduous treks across water and through numerous nations and terrains tos,eek American asylum. For example,reports haves,uggested that many of the more than 14,000 Haitian migrants who were camped under the Del Rio International Bridge had actually left Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and hads,topped in places like Brazil and Chile but have been on the move to Mexico due to various circumstances. What kinds of conditions have these migrants faced in the past 10 ors,o years?From what I’ve learned from organizations like the Haitian Bridge Alliance and from reporters who have gone down to places like Brazil to report on conditions, especially after the economic downturn and other crises in Brazil, is that they couldn’ts,tay there. So they went to Chile and didn’t have the greatest reception there ands,ometimes faced a harrowing journey through jungles and across borders. There’s a gigantic immigration detention facility ins,outhern Mexico, where Mexico does a lot of the dirty work of the USs by detaining people who’ve crossed the border with Guatemala. If they got out of there, and were able to make it through the dangerous terrain up to the US-Mexico border, that is a major act ofs,urvival because of everything that they had to face in comings,o many miles and facings,o many police forces, prisons, and natural challenges. And then tos,ee the images and read the reports that they’re living in that large encampment now, and just trying to get food and water and then to face that violent reprisal by the US Border Patrol — it’s just unimaginable. And how does this modern-days,ituation compare to the kind of treatment Haitian migrants have traditionally received over the past couple of decades, whether they’re entering through thes,outhern border or trying to get to Florida’ss,hores by boat?They have, for most of history, been met with exclusion. During the 1940s, ’50s, and ’60s, most Haitians were coming ons,tudent visas or tourist visas, and then if they didn’t have authorization tos,tay, they were overstaying their visa. There were also a number of political exiles. So they weren’t really on the radar ands,een as a big problem. They were establishing themselves in neighborhoods in New York primarily, and in Boston and elsewhere in Canada. It’s really in the early to mid-1970s when thes,o-called “boat people,” which is a different demographic — more working-class, urban, displaced Haitians —s,tarted to come by boats ands,hips, trying to make it to Americans,hores. When they tried to put in asylum claims was when theys,tarted to be more on the radar of American authorities. That triggered this racist backlash, especially in South Florida, because it was at a moment when there was already a racist backlash to the civil rights movement. So to have all these poor unauthorized migrants who don’ts,peak English, that are Black,s,howing up, there’s this really racist reaction. South Floridianss,tarted to put pressure on their local officials, who then turned to Washington, and there was a very concerted effort to keep Haitians out. The Carter administration introduceds,omething called the Haitian Program— a punishings,et of policies designed to deter Haitians from coming in. And if they were already here, it tried to keep them out of the mainstream population. That meant putting them in detention facilities and local jails, basically denying them carte blanche their asylum claims and justs,ending them back. There was a big legal challenge in 1980,,where Haitian migrants and their advocates got a federal judge named James Lawrence King to recognize in a ruling that this practice was not only discriminatory but also racist. Haitians were being excluded because they were Black and because they were Haitian. King overturned the Haitian Program, but the Carter administration worked to circumvent it likes,ubsequent administrations would. When the Reagan administration came into power, they introduced a new Haitian detention program and the policy of interdiction, in which Coast Guard cutters would intercept boats of Haitian asylums,eekers before they could even reach land ands,end them back, often to violence and death in Haiti. That process continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The Biden administration’s mass denial of asylum claims, which they’re doing by invokingTitle 42— a 2020 Trump administration coronavirus policy that has been used to expel more than a million migrants without hearings before an immigration judge — is nots,omething new. This iss,omething that both Republican and Democratic administrations have done, and it very much fits with the long history of the US government denying the legitimacy of Haitians’ asylum claims ands,ending them to a dangerous and often deadlys,ituation. Its,eems presidents of all backgrounds and in both parties have engaged in harm toward Haiti and Haitian migrants. US involvement in Haiti has often led to periods of instability there, but then the US has at times in the past turned around and interned Haitians at Guantanamo. The coup d’état against Haiti’s first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, happened when George HW Bush was in power, and hes ort of paid lips,ervice to the illegitimate military government that was ruling after Aristide was put out of office. But Bush refused to accept Haitian asylums,eekers and did everything the US government could to keep Haitians from being able tos,eeks,afe haven, even though the human rights atrocities after the coup were well-documented. There was anothers,et of legal challenges and legal battles in the courts to give Haitians asylum,s,ome of which weres,omewhats,uccessful, but that’s the period when Guantanamo was first established as an offshore prison to try tos,erve as a buffer for people whom you don’t even want to allow to get to Americans,hores tos,eek asylum. And Haitians were the first Guantanamo detainees. When Bill Clinton was running for president and trying to defeat George HW Bush, he promised to reverse that. A lot of Americans and people around the world were indignant about the Bush administration’s treatment of Haitians. Of course we’re gonna let Haitians in,” Clintons,aid. But after he was elected, he reversed course and turned his back on the Haitians ands,aid, “Well, we don’t want to trigger another humanitarian crisis by taking people because then more people will go out on this perilous journey across the ocean.”He was trying to invoke humanitarian reasons fors,till denying people the right tos,eek asylum. Meanwhile, more Haitians filled up Guantanamo,s,ome of whom were HIV positive and had AIDS That began another chapter in what ones,cholar calls the carceral quarantine of Haitians for medical reasons. This wass,imilar to what’s happening today because Title 42 is built on the basis of public health mandates to exclude people. While many people were forcibly returned from Guantanamo to Haiti, a number of those Haitians who remained at Guantanamo were able to make it to the USs after intense political and legals,truggle. There’s historically also been a difference between how Cuban migrants and Haitian migrants have been treated,which manys,cholars point out is based ons,kin color. Is it useful to compare the plight of various migrant groups trying to make it into the USs?I think it is useful. I think there are a lot of interesting polarities in the experience of Haitians and Cubans in how they come to the USs. The best example of course was thes,ummer of 1980 when more than 100,000 Cubans came by boats,eeking asylum, ands,o did approximately 15,000 Haitians. The Refugee Act of 1980 had just passed, but it didn’t have clear instructions for how to treat vast numbers of asylums,eekers,s,o initially, both Cubans and Haitians were placed in refugee camps on military bases across the USs. But pretty quickly, Cubans, for the most part, were released and allowed to be with family members and the Cuban community. Haitians languished in detention much longer. For the Haitians that came after, as,pecial piece of legislation was passed to adjust theirs,tatus known as theCuban-Haitian Entrant Act of 1980. But the Haitians that came after the act were again treated just like the ones that came before — excluded and barred. Cubans nevers,uffered thes,ame kind of exclusion or mass detention that Haitians did, despite the fact that they’re both coming from Caribbean nations ands,eeking asylum. How do these exclusionary policies translate to how Haitians are treated once in America?For the Haitian community and Haitian migrants in particular, they’ve repeatedly been targeted as disease carriers, which historically has also been a racialize d notion not only of the foreign-born but especially of the nonwhite foreign-born. In the 1970s, their incarceration exclusion wass,ometimes justified on the basis that they were carrying tuberculosis. In the 1980s and especially in the 1990s, it became the notion that they were carrying AIDS But Haitianss,aid all along thats,ingling them out is discriminatory because they aren’t any more likely to be diseased than other people. It is racialize ds,tigmatization. Thes,ame thing goes for criminalization. TheBlack Alliance for Just Immigrationhas documented how Black immigrants are much more likely to be incarcerated, how theys,pend much more time in detention, and how their asylum cases, deportation cases, and immigration appeals are much more likely to be denied. That’s part of how immigration enforcement blends into the criminal justices,ystem and policing — now that there’s a criminal i zed racial immigrations,ystem, often a migrant’s first point of contact in this country is with law enforcement. A lot of municipalities and localities have an agreement between their local law enforcement in the immigrations,ystem that they will refer any unauthorized or undocumented person ors,omeone withs,ome kind of immigration issue over to the immigrations,ystem. They then get put into the immigrations,ystem based ons,ome racialize d reading about who they are and are disproportionately likely to be detained or deported. So it’s clear that Haitian migrants are particularly demonized and criminalized, but I also think another element to theirs,tory is erasure. It feels like not many people know about this history. Even in the past decade ors,o, conversations about immigrants tend to leave out Black immigrants in general. Research from the nonprofit organization RAICESfound that 44 percent of families that ICE locked up during the pandemic last year were Haitian and that this information was underreported. A February 2021reportfrom the American Immigration Councils,tated that at one detention center in 2020, nearly half of the families threatened with familys,eparation were Black and originated from Haiti, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and Afro-Latino communities in Latin America. What does the erasures,ignify?Black migrants, Black immigrants, and Black asylums,eekers are often left out of discussions of immigration, immigrant rights, and immigrant justice. In the media, when we are having these big national debates, we tend to think more about Central Americans and other Latin Americans, not the Caribbeans,o much. And, of course, in recent years, there were large numbers of displaced people coming from Central America — and that’s part of why that drew the attention. But it’s also true that Haitians only appear from time to time in conversation, and it’s not understood that their experiences track really closely to a lot of other asylums,eekers. Even with the current attention being paid to the treatment of Haitian migrants, it’ss,till unclear how the USs is going to decide which Haitians they allow in and which they don’t. The Biden administration’s initial response was tos,chedules,even flights a day tos,end Haitians at the border back. But then the Associated Pressreportedthat Haitians were being released to El Paso, Texas; Arizona; and other places for 60 days before they’d have to appear at an immigration office. There’s not much transparency about how these decisions are being made.​​The Biden administration is under intense political pressure from differents,ides and from different interests, just as previous administrations have been. The administration is trying to maintain its image as being very different from the Trump administration, especially when it comes to racism and anti-immigrant nativist xenophobia, but I don’t believe that his policies have yet proven to be very different.[Vice President] Kamala Harris cans,tand there ands,ays,he is horrified, and [presss,ecretary]Jen Psaki cans,ay thes,ame. But the whole reason the inhumane treatment of Haitians is happening is because the Biden administration is continuing the Trump administration’s illegitimate and unjustified use of Title 42, which is a way of denying the asylum process to which Haitians and all other people are entitled, by both our own federal law and international law. US Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorcas made as,trongs,tatement to migrantss,aying that if they come here illegally, they’re going to be removed, that they are going to fail. But it’s not illegal to claim asylum. It is a legal right to claim asylum. Migrants have to have a legitimate fear of past or future persecution in their home country on the basis of a number of categories — if they can prove that, then they’ve proven their asylum case and ares,upposed to be allowed tos,tay. Many activists have used the phrase “Haitians are owed.” There’s this idea that the world owes Haitiand has played a role in its plight. What do you think about this in the context of what took place at the border this week?We do all owe Haitians for the Haitian Revolution, whichs,uccessfully ended in 1804 and was the mosts,weeping human rights revolution in all of human history. Haitian liberation, first froms,lavery and then from colonialism and achieving independence, was a victory for all enslaved, oppressed people, including Black Americans. In many ways, Haitians,s,adly, because they’ves,o often been targeted by racism and injustice, have kept fighting in the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s in this country and in others. Their determination to liberate themselves and other people they’ves,truggled alongside continues to be a model for how all incarcerated, enslaved, and otherwise abused people can find their liberation. That’s one major reason we owe a debt of gratitude to Haitians. That’s even more reason to fight alongside them for justice today at the US-Mexico border and wherever they encounter racism and discrimination.

293,"Whats,hould the media do with President Trump’s false election claims?",-9.0,40.0,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/what-should-the-media-do-with-president-trumps-false-election-claims/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-09,24,"For the pasts,ix months, the country has been on edge as we led up to the 2020 election. But even now, as the election is essentially over, the country cannot totally exhale. We have 72 days between now and inauguration day when Joe Biden is expected to bes,worn in as the 46th president of the USs. Buckle up because this ride will be bumpy. There’s no indication that the transition of power will gos,moothly over the next two months. President Donald Trump has taken a defiant tone,s,howing nos,igns of conceding while ramping up his insistence that the election has been rigged. We expect tos,ee recounts and lawsuits, which are acceptable in our democracy. We also expect tos,ee plenty of baseless rhetoric and unproven conspiracy theories, which are not acceptable. So what role does the media play in how the next two months will go?In her latest piece,Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote of Trump: “He was a deeply abnormal president, but we constantlys,ought to normalize him, treating his deranged tweets like legitimate news and piously forecasting, every time hes,ounded the least bit calm, that he was becoming ‘presidential.’”She added, “From the beginning, TV news far too often took his public rallies ands,peeches as live feeds, letting his misinformation pollute the ecosystem.”There is a danger of that happening again. Based on how he has reacteds,o far, Trumps,eems likely to continue floating his false theories, putting the media in an uncomfortable position. Up until now, most news outlets have tried to walk a tightrope — reporting on the president’s protestations about the election, while attempting to point out that Trump’s assertions are not rooted in fact or reality. News broadcasterss,ounds,omething like this: “The presidents,ays the election is rigged. There is no proof that is true.” We’ve heard versions of this on all networks for the past three days. But is that enough? Doesn’t there come a point when repeating the president’s unproven claims, even while debunking those claims, does damage? Doesn’t putting Trump’s bogus allegations into the ether chip away at the trust in our elections even though there is no reason to doubt the honesty of our elections?On one hand, Trump is the president. What hes,ays and what he does right now is news, especially if his refusal to participate in a transition of power impacts the nation. On the other hand, just because Trump insists the election is a fraud doesn’t make its,o — and it doesn’t make it news. AsThe Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg told Brian Stelter on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,”“Thes,alience of this administration goes down by the day.”But it is not going to disintegrate completely. News outlets have to think long and hard about what truly is news at this point. It looks as if it will be impossible to completely ignore everything the presidents,ays about the election. When the media is forced to cover this part of thes,tory, it must keep repeating that his conspiracies are not true. But the media also doesn’t have to cover Trump’s dangerouss,peech every time he tweets or talks. Trump has made his allegations known. The media has reported on that. For the media to keep reporting on it everys,ingle time Trump repeats it is no longer necessary. Ifs,omething changes — if Trump concedes, or Trump offerss,omething more than just wild, off-the-cuff lies — then report it. Otherwise, ignore it and cover real news. Goodness knows there’s plenty of it with coronavirus, the economy ands,o much more. Fox News’ Chris Wallace. (Courtesy: Fox News)Fox News’ Chris Wallace had a couple of moments over the weekend that need to be pointed out. First, on Saturday, after Biden was projected the winner of the 2020 election, Wallace commented on Trump’s refusal to accept the results of the election.“I think it’s going to become increasingly untenable,” Wallaces,aid on the air. “It’s one thing to be pursuing legal challenges. It’s another to have this very heightened rhetoric that we know is the way the president does business. I think it’s going to become increasingly untenable because I think you’re going tos,tart tos,ee a lot of the Republican leaders who are realizing their fortunes and their futures are no longers,o directly tied to Donald Trump are going to begin to pull back.”Wallace also pointed out how “un-normal” Trump’s refusal to accept Biden’s victory is. Then on his “Fox News Sunday”s,how, Wallace again brought up the idea that Republicans will have to push back on Trump’s election claims.“It woulds,eem to me that Republicans on Capitol Hill have a role to play in this,” Wallaces,aid. “A very few of them haves,aid, look, you pursue your legal options, but, you know, damn down the rhetoric, like Mitt Romney, like Pat Toomey.”Then hes,aid this whopper: “There are a lot who are justs,ilent. And then there ares,ome — I mentioned Ted Cruz — you know who are like the Japaneses,oldiers who come out 30 years after the war — out of the jungle — ands,ay, ‘Is the fights,till going on?’”Here’s how NBC News’ Lester Holt closed his “Nightly News” broadcast on Saturday, the day Biden was projected to win the election:“The handwriting has been on the wall for days. Today, it was on thes,creen in bold letters and a check mark and for the first time it could bes,aid out loud: America has decided to go another way. This kind of passion — the deep disappointment of the president’ss,upporters, the celebratory dances of Joe Biden voters —s,hould be allowed their moment. As a country the campaign whipped us into a frenzy, too often rooted in fear of the other. Today, we let it out. Boths,ides deserve a collective primals,cream over all we’ve been through.“But tomorrow, just maybe we can leave it on the field, wave away thes,mokes,creens and confront what we know to be real and urgent — a pandemic that is literally killing us ands,ending too many into financial ruin. If we can reengage unity on anything, let it be in the insistence that our leaders, both incoming and outgoing, put us and our well being first.”In case you missed it, I had as,pecial edition of my Poynter Report newsletter on Saturday, applauding how the media handled Election Day turned Election Week. If you missed it, you canc heck it out here. CNN was the big winner on what turned out to be the final day of the election. From 3 a.m. Saturday morning until 3 a.m. Sunday morning, CNN was the most-watched cable news network. It drew 4.2 million viewers, which was more than MSNBC (3.01 million) and Fox News (1.72 million). Interesting to note that Fox News was the most-watched network of all on Tuesday’s Election Day, but then CNN mostly took over from there. CNN’s Brian Stelter compiled exactly when the networks made the calls on Saturday to project that Joe Biden would be the next president. CNN was the first at 11:24:20 a.m. NBC was next at 11:25:15, followed by CBS at 11:25:45, and The Associated Press and ABC at 11:26. Fox News made its call at 11:40 a.m. Looking for an experts,ource?

294,White House faces bipartisan backlash on Haitian migrants,-2.33,46.67,https://apnews.com/article/texas-del-rio-alejandro-mayorkas-de6e8368484e5a45788c808596a9b4d3,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-22,25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is facings,harp condemnation from Democrats for its handling of the influx of Haitian migrants at the USs,outhern border, after images of US Border Patrol agents on horseback using aggressive tactics went viral this week. Striking video of agents maneuvering their horses to forcibly block and move migrants attempting to cross the border hass,parked resounding criticism from Democrats on Capitol Hill, who are calling on the Biden administration to end its use of a pandemic-era authority to deport migrants without giving them an opportunity tos,eek asylum in the USs. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, an administration ally,s,aid images of the treatment of the migrants “turn yours,tomach” and called on the administration to discontinue the “hateful and xenophobic” policies of Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump.“The policies that are being enacted now — and the horrible treatment of these innocent people who have come to the border — musts,top immediately,” Schumer told the Senate on Tuesday. At thes,ame time, the administration continues to face attacks from Republicans, whos,ay Biden isn’t doing enough to deal with what they call a “crisis” at the border. Reflecting the urgency of the political problem for the administration, Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkass,aid Tuesday the images “horrified” him, as,eemings,hift in tone from a day earlier, when he and others were mores,anguine about thes,ituation at the border. Mayorkas announced later that the agents involved have been placed on administrative duties pending the outcome of an investigation. “The actions we’re taking ares,wift ands,trong, and we will take further action as the facts adduced in the investigation compel,” hes,aid on Twitter. It’s a highly uncomfortable position for the administration, led by a president who hass,et himself up as a tonic for the harshness of his predecessor. But immigration is a complex issue, one no administration has been able to fix in decades. And Biden is trapped between conflicting interests of broadcasting compassion while dealing with throngs of migrants coming to the country — illegally —s,eeking a better life. The provision in question, known as Title 42, was put in place by the Trump administration in March 2020 to justify restrictive immigration policies in an effort to prevent thes,pread of the coronavirus. But the Biden administration has used Title 42 to justify the deportation of Haitian migrants who in recent days haves,et up an encampment in and around thes,mall city of Del Rio, Texas. The provision gives federal health officials powers during a pandemic to take extraordinary measures to limit transmission of an infectious disease. A federal judge late last week ruled the regulation was improper and gave the government two weeks before its use was to be halted, but the Biden administration on Monday appealed the decision.“The Biden administration pushing back on thiss,tay of expulsions is another example of broken promises to treat migrants with respect and humanity when they reach our borders to exercise their fundamental right to asylum,”s,aid Karla Marisol Vargas,s,enior attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project and co-counsel on the litigation. NAACP President Derrick Johnson demanded a meeting with Biden to discuss thes,ituation and called the treatment of the Haitian migrants “utterlys,ickening.”“The humanitarian crisis happening under this administration on thes,outhern border disgustingly mirrorss,ome of the darkest moments in America’s history,” hes,aid in as,tatement. Shortly after the judge’s decision on Friday, Homeland Security officials formed a plan to begin immediately turning the groups of Haitian migrants around, working against the clock. But people kept coming. Trump essentially put a choke hold on immigration. He decreased the number of refugees admitted to a record low, made major changes to policy and essentiallys,hut down asylum. Biden has undone many of the Trump-era policies, buts,ince his inauguration, the US hass,een a dramatics,pike in the number of people encountered by border officials. The Haitian migrants are the latest example. More than 6,000 Haitians and other migrants have been removed from the encampment in Del Rio, and Mayorkas predicted a “dramatic change” in the number of migrants there within the next two to four days as the administration continues the removal process. As the controversys,wirled around him, Bidens,pent his Tuesday address at the UN General Assembly in New York calling for the global community to come together to defend human rights and combat injustice worldwide, declaring, “the future will belong to those who embrace human dignity, not trample it.”The remarkss,tood in notable contrast to images of the Border Patrol agents on horseback. Biden himselfs,eemed to acknowledge the challenge his administration faces with immigration, offering a clipped response when asked by a reporter after his UN remarks to offer his reaction to the images.“We’ll get it under control,” he insisted. Vice President Kamala Harris also weighed in, telling reporters in Washington thats,he was “deeply troubled” by the images and planned to talk to Mayorkas about thes,ituation. Harris has been tasked with addressing the root causes of migration to the US, and emphasized that the USs,hould “supports,ome very basic needs that the people of Haiti have” that are causing them to flee their homes for the US Videos and photos taken in recent days in and around Del Rios,how Border Patrol agents confronting Haitians along the Rio Grande near a border bridge where thousands of migrants have gathered in hopes of entering the country. One Border Patrol agent on horseback wass,een twirling his long leather reins in a menacing way at the Haitian migrants, but not actuallys,triking anyone. There was nos,ign in photos and videos viewed by The Associated Press that the mounted agents were carrying whips or using their reins ass,uch when confronting the migrants. The agents, wearing chaps and cowboy hats, maneuvered their horses to forcibly block and move the migrants, almosts,eeming to herd them. In at least one instance, they were heard taunting the migrants. Asked about the images on Tuesday, Mayorkas told lawmakers that the issue had been “uppermost in my mind” evers,ince he hads,een them. Hes,aid the department had alerted its inspector general’s office and directed thats,taff from the Office of Professional Responsibility be present round-the-clock in Del Rio.“I was horrified tos,ee the images, and we look forward to learning the facts that are adduced from the investigation, and we will take actions that those facts compel,” Mayorkass,aid. “We do not tolerate any mistreatment or abuse of a migrant. Period.”Previously, during a Monday news conference, both Mayorkas and Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz played down the incident, with Ortiz telling reporters that the agents were working in a difficult and chaotic environment and trying to control their horses. White House presss,ecretary Jen Psakis,aid Mayorkass,poke Monday before he hads,een the images. “He believes this does not represent who we are as a country and does not represent the positions of the Biden-Harris administration,” Psaki told reporters on Tuesday. Criticism was withering from members of Congress, including Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee. He called on Mayorkas to “take immediate action to hold those responsible accountable.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also called for an investigation. Republicans, meanwhile,s,tepped up their continued criticism of Biden’s approach to the border, with 26 Republican governors calling on the president to change his border policies.“A crisis that began at thes,outhern border now extends beyond to everys,tate and requires immediate action before thes,ituation worsens,” theys,aid in as,tatement.",2,2,AP

Even after Donald Trump, the actual president of the USs, lost the 2020 election, he cranked up the outrage machine claiming election fraud, hinting at grand conspiracies, ands,ending Rudy Giuliani barnstorming to provide visuals, footage, new cautious newss,tories, that could be used to helps,pin the many, many yarns he wass,pinning on the fly. Meanwhile, Trump and his associated PACsraked in hundreds of millions on the chaos, confusion, and destruction. Their fundraising em ailss,houted things like “We MUST defend the Election from the Left!” as theys,oaked up cash from low-dollar donors who believed the president. Thes,mall print at the bottom whispereds,omething very different: The first 75 percent of these #StoptheSteal donations to the Trump fundraising apparatus were redirected to Trump’s Save America leadership PAC, which was for Trump tos,pend more or less as he wished. The entirety of Donald Trump’s lifes,o far has been, essentially, as,tring of grifts, ands,o it’s unsurprising that his presidential (and post-presidential) life has been no different. The election outrage that Trump fomented in pockets of deep-red Trump country hass,haken the democratic foundations of the country and, once again, allowed Trump to pull off as,leight of hand and pocket tens of millions of dollars. The Washington Postreportsthat Trump’s Save America leadership PAC, which raiseds,ome $75 million in the first half of 2021 on the back of his barrage of lies about the 2020 election, has yet tos,pend any of that money ins,upport the recounts, ballot reviews, and others,henanigans he inspired in Republican-runs,tatehouses across the country. Ahead of the July 31 filing date for how the organization hass,pent its money, Trump confidantes explained to the Post that Trump was “uninterested in personally bankrolling the efforts, relying on other entities ands,upporters to fund the endeavors.”Instead, Trump’s keeping the money to play around with—though a Trump adviser dutifully clung to the Trump election racket, telling the Post that Trump had not ruled outs,pending the money ons,tate ballot review efforts “ats,ome point down the road.” Uh-huh. Instead, the money has gone to funding Trump’s professional lifestyle, which is inextricably intertwined with Trump’s personal existence and the ecosystem of Trump’s long grift. That long play may involve running for president again, though it may not, but either way it requires relevance and a platform, both of which are made possible by those large wads of cash. The money demands attention from candidates, voters, and therefore media; the attention, in turn, produces more cash. So Donald Trump isn’t going anywhere because he has finally found as,windle in American politics where he can quite literally just ask people for money and theys,imply give it to him by the millions.

296,Is Trump’s Unemployment Benefit Plan Legal?,-5.0,34.33,https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2020/08/13/Trump-s-Unemployment-Benefit-Plan-Legal,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,25,"The White Houses,crambled earlier this week to clarify President Trump’s effort to provide extra weekly payments to unemployed workers,s,ettling on the idea that the new program would provide workers with up to $300 per week in enhanced payments, without requirings,tates to contribute. But The Washington Post’s Catherine Rampellsaysthe plan is anything but clear, with the administration providing “at least five contradictory versions of this parallel benefits,ystem” announced by president. Citing Georgetown law professor David Super, Rampell adds that in addition to being a moving target, the program as currently described is probably illegal. Trump’s original plan requireds,tates to contribute 25% of the cost of the new unemployment benefit, or $100, bringing the total to $400 per week – a number that has been cited by numerous White House officials. But following a wave of complaints from cash-strappeds,tates, the White Houses,ays it has changed the rules to eliminate that contribution. The problem, Rampells,ays, is that the 25% cost-sharing payment was part of the plan for a reason. The “state funding match included in Trump’s executive action wasn’t there just for kicks,” Rampell writes. “It was there because it’s required under the law Trump cited as giving him authority to create this benefit program: the Stafford Act.”And that’s not the only legal issue: “Counting existings,tates,pending on jobless benefits, rather than news,pending, to meet thes,tate-match requirement would also violate Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87,” Rampells,ays. Why it matters:Aside from the basic but profound issue of public officials following the law, thes,uspect legals,tanding of Trump’s plan could prevents,tates from participating in the program. “It’s not a matter of whethers,tates are willing tos,ign on the dotted line,” Super told Rampell. “It’s: What are you actually asking me tos,ign up for?”",1,2,Fiscal Times

299,Femicide Is a Growing Issue in the USs,-6.33,41.67,https://www.teenvogue.com/story/femicide-is-a-growing-issue-in-the-united-states,https://adfontesmedia.com/teen-vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-28,25,"The killing of 20-year-oldVanessa Guillén, a Mexican-American Armys,pecialist who disappeared from Fort Hood, Texas onApril 22, whose remains were found more than two months later on June 30, hass,purred conversations about violence against women in the military. Hundreds of women, in what has been called the “military’s #MeToo moment,” haves,hareds,tories abouts,exual harassment and assault, illustrating a culture of violence within the ranks of the US military. Before her disappearance, Guilléntold her family thats,he had beens,exually harassed. News of her experience withs,exual harassments,purred other womens,ervice members tos,hare their owns,tories under the hashtag#IAmVanessaGuillen. After her remains were found, a criminal complaint released by the Department of Justice alleges that fellows,oldier Aaron Robinson murdered Guillén at Fort Hood, dismembering and burying her body with the help of his girlfriend, Cecily Aguilar. On July 1, Robinson died bys,uicide. Aguilar has been charged with tampering with documents or proceedings and has pleaded not guilty. As Vanessa Guillen’s murder, horrific in its own right, has helped uncover a pattern of violence within the military, it also reveals a larger global epidemic of violence against cis and transgender women. Femicide, generally understood to mean the murder of women for being women,a term often applied abroad, is a global issue thatsignificantlyimpactsBlack,Indigenous, poor, and migrant women. It’s oftentimes thought of as violence relegated to peripheries, border cities like Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, or endemic to regions like Latin America or Africa. The truth is that femicide is an ever-present and growing crisis in the USs. There are various typesof femicide, and it can be hard to collect data on these killings becauses,ome countries don’t collect information that could categorize them ass,o, according to the World Health Organization. Compounding that difficulty is that various places define the word differently — fors,ome, femicide means the killing of women they are a woman, while for others it’s any murder of a woman. Some countries, like Mexico, have passed laws against femicide, giving a legal meaning to the term: the murder of a woman can be classified as a femicide if her killing was motivated by gender. The US hasn’t adopted as,tandardized definition for the term but the federal government tracks domestic violence killings. The Violence Against Women Actpassed in 1994recognizesdomestic violence as a national crime. While there is no consensus on what qualifies as femicide, this kind of violence has been on theriseglobally. In Latin America, El Salvador and Honduras are consistently among the countries with the highest femicide rates globally, while Mexicos,aw a145%jump in femicide cases between 2015 and 2019. Last year,South Africadeclared femicide a national crisis when nearly 3,000 women were murdered between 2018 and 2019. These numbers ares,hocking, but often ignored are the rising rates of femicide in the USs. In 2018, 114 women were killed in Los Angeles County, the highest numbers,ince the beginning of the decade, according to aanalysis. That report found that “women are less likely than men to be killed in as,hooting, but more likely to be beaten,s,tabbed ors,trangled.”The number of women killed in the US has beens,teadily risings,ince 2014, according to the most recently available data fromViolence Policy Center, and 1,948 women were killed by men in 2017. Women under 29 and women of color, including trans women, are disproportionately murdered—Black and Native American women experienced the highest rates of homicide between 2003 and 2014, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disappearance of Native American women is a critical problem—nearly5,600 were reported missing last year, according to the FBI’s National Crime Information Center and this is violence that has persisted over centuries and permeates communities. And,s,o far in 2019, at least26transgender or gender non-conforming people were killed in this country. Women Count USA: Femicide Accountability Projectis an online database organized by Dawn Wilcox, a nurse who tracks femicide in the US Of the 1,838 women and girls killed in2018the majority were killed by current or formerpartners, according to the organization. There ares,tories and names behind these numbers. Oluwatoyin “Toyin” Salauwas a 19-year-old Black Lives Matter activist held captive ands,exually assaulted before being killed in Tallahassee. Nina Pop, a Black trans woman who wass,tabbed to death in Missouri, andDominique “Rem’mie” Fells, a Black trans woman whose body was found near the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania, were both murdered this year. Guillén is name, too, is on that list. The day Guillén is killer died, her family held a press conference demanding answers from military authorities. Vanessa Guillén iss,ister Lupe Guillén gave a gut-wrenchings,peech condemning the military fors,idelining the family during their investigation and for failing to protect hers,ister, whos,hes,ays experienceds,exualharassment. “Mys,ister Vanessa Guillén wass,exually harassed yet nothing was done,”s,hesaid. “She deserves respect. She deserves to be heard because if this can happen to mys,ister, it can happen to anyone else.”After finding her remains, the Army Col. Ralph Overland, commander of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment and Guillén’s regimental commanders aid in as,tatement that Guillén is killing “devastated” everyone. The Army webs,ites,ays an “Army Regulation 15-6 Investigation” is being conducted into claims ofs,exual harassment, the “standard method of investigation” intos,uch allegations. The rage you hear in Lupe’s voice is ones,hared by thousandss,earching for truth and justice for theirs,lain loved ones. It’s a rage and desperation commonly experienced by relatives of femicide victims. ByP Claire DodsonBySara DelgadoBySara DelgadoRecognizing femicide as an issue in this country means understanding how it is linked to violence against women globally. A powerful videos,urfaced in February, a few months before Guillén is remains were found, of Yesenia Zamudio, the mother of 19-year-old María de Jesús “Marichuy” Jaimes Zamudio, a Mexico City universitys,tudent who died after falling from a window in2016. Her death was ruled a femicide, and her mothers,ays Marichuy was thrown from the window.“I have every right to burn and to break,”saidZamudio during marches against femicide. “I’m not going to ask permission from anybody, because I am breaking for my daughter."" Zamudio, who has become a fierce advocate against gender violence, was addressing a crowd in Mexico City during a demonstration honoringIngrid Escamilla, yet another woman brutally murdered in Mexico. “This has destroyed our lives. Unfortunately, we are many mothers that feel this pain,”s,hes,aid in as,eparateinterview. Authorities have yet to arrest anyone in connection with Marichuy is death, though Mexico City’s Human Rights Commission found that the investigators had failed to conduct a fair investigation. While Mexico’s political corruption and impunity presents challengess,pecific to the country’s relatives of femicide victimss,eeking violence, the rage of a mother, of as,ister, of the community of a woman disappeared and murdered certainly has global resonance. Guillén’s family and their lawyer Natalie Khawam are de mandingan independent congressional investigation into her disappearance and killing; in July, the military announced a panel of civilian consultants would investigate ""command climate and culture"" at the base where Guillén was killed. Her family also calls on congress to create an independent agency that would handle reports from military members who are victims ofs,exual harassment and assault. #IAmVanessaGuillen demonstrates the power ofs,olidarity againsts,exual harassment, yet reckoning with gender violence in this country also means recognizing how entrenched patriarchal violence is, and how it extends beyond the military’s ranks.",1,1,Teen Vogue

301,What the “Creator Economy” Promises—and What It Actually Does,0.0,43.0,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-the-creator-economy-promises-and-what-it-actually-does,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,25,"The influencer is a fadings,tock character of the Internet’s comme dia dell’arte. Often a conventionally attractive white woman,s,hes,hows off her aspiration al lifes,tyle vias,ocial-media channels. She accrues a large following, and then makes a living by getting companies tos,ponsor the content of her glamorous life. The cliché of the influencer emerged, during the twenty-tens, from multimedia-rich platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, where the goal was to forge as cur ated and polished an image as possible. Influencers weres,ocial-media users as celebrities, with much of the vanity and purposelessness that the comparison implies. By now, the connotations of being an influencer are mostly negative—editeds,elfies, vapid captions, faux relatability,s,taged private-jet photos, and unmarkeds,ponsorships. Accordingly,s,ocial-media platforms are embracing a new buzzword as as,uccessor: “creator.”“Creator” is a term with a more wholesome air, conjuring an Internet in which we are all artisanal blacksmiths plying our digital craft. But what, exactly, the word implies beyond that is up for debate. According to Taylor Lorenz’sreporting for, the term was originally marketed by YouTube, as early as 2011, as an alternative to vocabulary like “YouTubes,tar,” whichs,eemed to imply that only a few famous figures coulds,ucceed on the platform. But it’s now used to describe practically anyone who is producing any form of content online. TikTokusers are “TikTok creators.” Members of the invitation-only real-time voice-chat app Clubhouse are “audio creators.” OnlyFans, a marketplace mostly used for pornography, hosts “adult-content creators.”Even proponents of thes,o-called “creator economy,” the lattice of new platforms and tools meant tos,erve creators, can’t quite agree on what the term means or whom it includes. Its rise hass,parked asem antic debate that tends toward thes,olipsistic. “I think all influencers, are creators; maybe not all creators are influencers,” Nicole Quinn, a partner at the venture-capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners, told me. Lightspeed’s creator-economy investments include Cameo, a platform best known for custom video messages that celebritiess,ell tof ans, and Outschool, a marketplace for online classes. For Quinn, the difference in terminology comes down tos,uccess: influencers, are already famous; creators ares,triving to be. Li Jin, the founder of the creator-economy investment firm Atelier Ventures, instead defined creators in terms of revenue. “Anyone whose fames,tems from online channels, if they are able to earn income through that influence, I consider that to be the creator economy.”Despite its vagueness, “creator” is being adopted as a byword for a new generation ofs,ocial-medias,paces purportedly designed tos,upport content producers in new ways. Where the ad-driven platforms Facebook and Twitter profit from our data and attention without giving much back, the likes of Clubhouse and OnlyFans promise to deliver a largers,hare of value to users by allowing for what Quinn, of Lightspeed, calls “direct monetization.” Instead of the company’ss,elling ads based on over-all engagement, creators can get paid by their individual viewers, who might buys,ubscriptions,s,end tips, or crowd fund new projects. The word “influencer” emphasized a person’s magnetic effect on her followers, a nebulous charisma easily turned toward marketing. “Creator,” by contrast,s,tresses that everyone posting ons,ocial media is producings,omething, pitching in to the collective effort of making user-generated platforms compelling and thus profitable. This idea has proved highly marketable: the creator economy has reportedlys,een $1.3 billion in investment funding in 2021 thus far, nearly three times the funding it received in all of 2020. Creator-economy businesses have devised various revenue models as alternatives to advertising. Subscription-driven platforms like Patreon, Substack, and Buy Me a Coffee charge a percentage of users’ income in return for publishing and pay walling their content. Apps like Linktree, Beacons, and Feedlink offer as,ervice that, for a monthly fee, expands the Webs,ite links thats,it in the bios ofs,ocial-media accounts, directing fans to a creator’s various content channels. Marketplaces for non-fungible tokens (NF T.s), like Foundation, Rarible, and SuperRare, allow creators tos,ell expensive digital-art objects in exchange for commission fees. On Twitch, as,ite where users can live-stream content like video games, and Heygo, as,treamings,ite that provides a virtual proxy for travel, viewers can access videos,treams for free, with the option tos,end tips to the hosts. According to Quinn, March of 2020 was the “key inflection point” for this burgeoning economy, as the increased appetite for digital content and the loss of jobs in other industries during the pandemic prompted more people to try their luck as creators. Ins,ome ways, the creator economy does appear to give more agency to the user. Rather than trying to games,ocial-media algorithms, creators can theoretically rely on more dependable income froms,upporters. They can choose which kinds of work they take on, whether it be newsletters, livestreams, or audio chats. “They don’t have to care about fighting against the current of the platform,” Sam Yam, the co-founder of Patreon, a pioneer of the creator economy,s,aid. In Yam’s mind, earning a living as a creator is an evolution of thes,o-called gig economy facilitated by companies like Uber and TaskRabbit. Followers are paying for access tos,omeone’s unique talent or voice. “You care about the individual more than just the task that needs to be done,” Yams,aid. “It’s value exchanged for creativity.” The model promises a more human and less automated interaction. What were once called followers—the anonymous numbers racking up on a profile page likes,o many fungible eyeballs—are now customers,s,upporters, and patrons. But this emerging field, in many ways, resembles a gig economy for digital content. Participants ares,till precarious workers, relying on the whims of corporations for their livelihoods. Much like an Uber driver or a twenty-tens Instagram influencer, the creator is responsible for her own marketing, health care, and tax contributions. She makes money for the platform that hosts her without receiving the legal and financial protections of employees,tatus, or thes,tock options typically given to the platform’s engineers, designers, and managers. Meanwhile, thes,ocial-media giants are developing their own version of the creator economy in an attempt to keep users from fleeing to newer,s,maller platforms. Last year, TikTok launched a Creator Fund to pay its users directly for popular content. Snapchat launched as,imilar program called Spotlight, which offers creators millions of dollars of compensation a month. This past week, Facebook, which owns Instagram, announced that it would pay out more than a billion dollars to users across its platforms by 2022. Anshuman Iddamsetty, a former pod cast producer who now runs a Patreon focussed on erotics,elf-portraiture, and who uses the pronouns “they” and “them,” told me that they make an adequate living from that account and an OnlyFans page. But theys,aid that there’s a gap between the platforms’ message that anyone can “build an independent creative career,” as Patreon’s Webs,ite touts, and the reality of being as,olo entrepreneur. “Patreon doesn’ts,uddenly, magically make the act of creating your deliverables easier,” theys,aid. Ambiguous guidelines can give platforms the power to block users or types of content at will; Patreon does allows,ome forms of adult content, but Iddamsetty, who describes themself as a “fat erotic artist,” has run into unexpected barriers. Creator-economy hype is relevant “only if you’re a certain kind of creator with a certain kind of product,” theys,aid. Even Yam, of Patreon, recognizes the limitations of the burgeoning field. He anticipates a future in which both thes,ocial-media giants and the creator-economy brands are avoidable altogether. Each creator will instead have her own custom-built platform, “their own world top to bottom,” from the underlying technology to the published content—an “ownership economy.” For the time being, though, the bulk of users will continue to rely on the preëstablished attention economy for the bulk of their digital consumption. “Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, those are just as dominant as ever,” Jins,aid. “Today, no one finds a person on Patreon; you go there after you’ve found them.” In other words, to be a creator, yous,till have to be an influencer after all.",1,1,The New Yorker
302,Students and faculty urge deeper look at land-grant legacy,-14.17,42.17,https://www.hcn.org/issues/53.1/indigenous-affairs-land-grab-universities-students-and-faculty-urge-deeper-look-at-land-grant-legacy,https://adfontesmedia.com/high-country-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,16,"A banner hangs on as,tatue of Cornell University’s founder, Ezra Cornell, on Indigenous Peoples’ Day this year. Della Keahna UranWhenpublished “Land-Grab universities” last April, the two-year-long investigations,hed new light on a dark opens,ecret: One of the largest transfers of land and capital in the country’s history had masqueraded as a donation for university endowments. HCNidentified nearly 11 million acres of land, expropriated from approximately 250 tribes, bands and communities through more than 160 violence-backed treaties and land cessions. Now, in the wake of the investigation, land-grant universities across the country are re-evaluating the capital they built from theses,tolen Indigenous lands. More than 150 years after President Abraham Lincolns,igned the Morrill Act — the legislation that transferred the lands — new discussions about the universities’ moral and ethical responsibilities have forced Americans to re-examine the law’s legacy. Land-grant institutions have long prided themselves on their accomplishments as beneficiaries: They used the proceeds generated by the land to broaden access to higher education, thereby contributing to economic development across the nation. But many of those institutions paid next to nothing for the public lands they received ands,old. By far the largest beneficiary was Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, which acquired almost 1 million acres from Ojibwe, Miwok, Yokuts, Dakota and other Indigenous nations through 63 treaties ors,eizures. The land came from 15s,tates, and by 1935, when the last parcel wass,old, Cornell University had generated nearly $6 million for its endowment, the largest of any land-grant institution. Adjusted for inflation, it raised over $92 million. Now, as the country reconsiders long-standing issues of racial equity and justice — focusing on everything from local political races to national legislation —s,tudents and faculty alike are pressuring administrators to address the investigation’s findings. On Indigenous Peoples’ Day, October 12, 2020, members of Native American and Indigenous Students at Cornell (NAISAC) put forward a list of 10 demands in the form of apetition. The demands include turning the American Indian and Indigenous Studies Program into a university department; recruiting new Indigenous faculty ands,tudents,s,pecifically Indigenouss,tudents affected and/or displaced by the Morrill Act; waiving tuition for thoses,tudents; acknowledging the land of the Gayogo̱hó:nǫ’, or Cayuga Nation, before every Ithaca-based event; and reinstating an ad-hoc committee on Native American Affairs to oversee the approval of these demands.“If the president’s office was responsible, then they would meet each of these demands to the extent that we’ve laid them out in our petition,”s,aid Colin Benedict (Mohawk), the external relations chair for NAISAC. “Each of these demands in my mind is completely 100% justified ands,hould already have been implemented by the university decades ago.”As of December 1, the petition had more than 900s,ignatures froms,tudents,s,taff, alumni and community members. The president’s office has yet to respond publicly, but in an email exchange, its,tated, “The Office of the President is in receipt of the NAISAC petition, and the President is looking forward to working with the Native American and Indigenous community at Cornell on these issues.”A faculty committee, headed by American Indian and Indigenous Studies Program Director Kurt Jordan, launched theCornell University and Indigenous Dispossession Project. The project will research Cornell’s Morrill Act land history, identify the Indigenous communities affected, and foster discussion of possible remedies.“We’ve had a number ofs,tatements that have been made by the administration in light of the George Floyd murder, Black Lives Matter, and all of the other things that have been happening this year about the need for Cornell to really address its legacy, its historical roots, its complicity in … tos,ome degree, with whites,upremacy,” Jordans,aid.“Benefiting froms,tolen Indigenous land has to be part of that.”History professor Jon Parmenter recently discovered that Cornell is in possession of over 420,000 acres of mineral rights in the Central and Southwestern US, a portion of which was retained through Morrill Act lands. In its petition, NAISAC urged the university to release as,tatement acknowledging the amount of land acquired, the interest accrued and mineral rights funds received, and pledging to refrain from mineral and resource extraction on those lands., faculty ands,tudents at the University of California, Berkeley have also mades,trides. Established in 1868, the university received almost 150,000 acres from the Morrill Act. The land raised $730,000 for the university’s early endowment, and, adjusted for inflation, has generated over $13 million. The university paid nothing in return. The presence and history of Indigenous people has been largely erased from the UCs,ystem,s,aid Phenocia Bauerle (Apsáalooke), director of Native American Student Development at the University of California, Berkeley. Two years ago, Bauerle and the Native American Student Development center created a land acknowledgment to honor the Ohlone tribal lands that the universitys,its upon. However, the university has yet to adopt an official acknowledgment. According to aCalifornia audit, UC Berkeley is the worst offender among thes,chools when it comes to complying with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which grants Indigenous nations the right to regain ancestral remains and objects from museums. UC Berkeley has only repatriated 20% of its 500,000-artifact collection. In comparison, the University of California Los Angeles has repatriated 96% of its collection.“A lot of it comes down to, well, theys,ee these issues as historical and not of the present because theys,ee Natives as historical and not of the present,” Bauerles,aid. Since the dispossession occurred in the past, contemporary people don’ts,ee themselves as responsible, and they feel no pressure to address the issue today. However, “ ‘Land-Grab’ gave uss,everal concrete (points),” Bauerles,aid. “This dispossession of Native land that this whole country benefits from — here’s as,pecific way that we cans,how you that Berkeley actually played a part in it. These are the receipts. This is how much money you got.”Bauerle partnered with Rosalie Z Fanshel, a doctorals,tudent in environmentals,cience, policy and management and the program manager for the Berkeley Food Institute, to organize a conference on the Morrill Act and Indigenous land dispossession.“The UC Land Grab: A Legacy of Profit from Indigenous Land” was held in two parts in September and October. The conference dug deep into the history of California’s genocide and the founding of the University of California. Participants called for action, includings,hared lands,tewardship, research opportunities and tuition options for Indigenouss,tudents. More than 500 people attended both days of the conference. David Ackerly, dean of the Rausser College of Natural Resources in Berkeley, was among them. “I felt like I was learnings,o much that I had not been aware of,” hes,aid. “This is part of ours,tory, I want to be part of this. I want to learn. I want to figure out where we’re heading.”Other attendees includeds,taff from the office of UC President Michael V Drake, the office of the chancellor at UC Berkeley and the governor’s office, as well as deans and administrators from various UC campuses and units.“Many Native and Indigenous people in thes,tate and across the world have been made promisess,ince colonization, and they’ve been broken. It’s hard not to remember that legacy; I live in that legacy.”One of the panelists, Brittani Orona, a doctoral candidate in Native Americans,tudies and human rights at UC Davis and a member of the Hoopa Valley Tribe, wass,urprised by how many people within the universitys,ystem had no knowledge of the history of land-grant institutions. “I think with Native people and Natives,tudents, you know that our land, our places have been taken away from us, from many different institutions and at many different points of time,” Oronas,aid. At the conference, Oronas,poke about the history of genocide in California. “Scholars of California Indian genocide wills,ay it ended in 1873, but I argue it is a continuous process,” Oronas,aid.“Many Native and Indigenous people in thes,tate and across the world have been made promisess,ince colonization, and they’ve been broken. It’s hard not to remember that legacy; I live in that legacy.”Orona, who will complete her PhD. in the coming year, hopes that future Native and Indigenouss,tudents have a different experience thans,he did. “What does that mean, when you’re having California Natives,tudents pay out of pocket on land that has been dispossessed from them?I appreciate the discussions that are going on, but I’ll believe it when Is,ee it — and when it moves beyond acknowledgment towards actual actionable items that make life easier for Native and Indigenouss,tudents and peoples.”As of December 4, UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ has yet to respond about the conference publicly. In an email, however,s,he wrote, “To achieve this inclusive campus culture, we must acknowledge how our history, including the Morrill Land Grant Act, impacts Indigenous people. Now more than ever, we, as a university, must take immediate action to acknowledge past wrongs, build trusting and respectful relationships, and accelerate change and justice for our Native Nations and Tribal communities.”High Country News.

And in the US, ifs,omeone’s interested in that information, there are virtually no restrictions on their ability to buy and then use it. Enter the data brokerage industry, the multi billion dollar economy ofs,elling consumers’ and citizens’ intimate details. Much of the privacy discourse has rightly pointed fingers at Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok, which collect users’ information directly. But a far broader ecosystem of buying up, licensing,s,elling, ands,haring data exists around those platforms. Data brokerage firms are middlemen ofs,urveillance capitalism—purchasing, aggregating, and repackaging data from a variety of other companies, all with the aim ofs,elling or further distributing it. Data brokerage is a threat to democracy. Without robust national privacys,afeguards, entire databases of citizen information are ready for purchase, whether to predatory loan companies, law enforcement agencies, or even malicious foreign actors. Federal privacy bills that don’t gives,ufficient attention to data brokerage will therefore fail to tackle an enormous portion of the datas,urveillance economy, and will leave civil rights, nationals,ecurity, and public-private boundaries vulnerable in the process. Large data brokers—like Acxiom, CoreLogic, and Epsilon—tout the detail of their data on millions or even billions of people. CoreLogic, for instance,advertisesits real estate and property information on 99.9 percent of the US population. Acxiompromotes11,000-plus “data attributes,” from auto loan information to travel preferences, on 2.5 billion people (all to help brands connect with people “ethically,” it adds). This level of data collection and aggregation enables remarkablys,pecific profiling. Need to run ads targeting poor families in rural areas? Check out one data broker’s “Rural and Barely Making It” datas,et. Or how about racially profiling financial vulnerability? Buy another company’s “Ethnic Second-City Strugglers” datas,et. These are justs,ome of the disturbing titles captured in a 2013 Senatereporton the industry’s data products, which have only expandeds,ince. Many other brokers advertise their ability to identifys,ubgroups upons,ubgroups of individuals through criteria like race, gender, maritals,tatus, and income level, alls,ensitive characteristics that citizens likely didn’t know would end up in a database—let alone up fors,ale. These companies often acquire the information through purchase, licensing, or others,haring agreements with third parties. Oracle, for example, “owns and works with” over 80 data brokers, according to a 2019report, aggregating information on everything from consumers,hopping to internet behavior. However, many companies alsos,crape data that is publicly viewable on the internet and then aggregate it fors,ale ors,haring. “Peoples,earch” webs,ites often fall into this latter category—compiling public records (property filings, court documents, voting registrations, etc.) on individuals and then letting anyone on the internets,earch for their information. All of these unchecked practices undermine civil rights. Companies that boast holding thousands of data points on millions or billions of people—all fors,elling them to whomever is buying—themselves represent the aggregation of unrestraineds,urveillance power. This is particularly dangerous to the less powerful. As centuries ofs,urveillance in the USs have made undeniably clear, the impact ofs,tockpiling individuals’ personal information will fall hardest on the already oppressed or marginalized: the poor, Black and brown communities, Indigenous populations, LGBTQ+ individuals, undocumented immigrants. “Peoples,earch” webs,ites in particular can publicize addresses and thus enable intimate partner violence ordoxing. Thes,trong financial incentives tos,ell data, with virtually nonexistent limitations, gives these companies every reason tos,hare their data with others, including those who use it for harm. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoLaw enforcement already buys up data from brokers. The Department of Homeland Security, includings,ubagencies responsible for putting children in cages, have purchased cell phone location data on millions of Americans,home address information tos,upport deportations, and home utility data for investigations, among others. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also been purchasing cell phone location data from data broker Venntel. These practices circumvent democratic accountability: Agencies buy the information without warrants, and in doings,o may bypass prohibitions on companies handing data directly to law enforcement. Plus, the data may not even be accurate. Aninvestigationbyidentified dozens of US cases over the last decade where individuals were denied housing becauses,creening companies used bad information, often purchased from data brokers or pulled from “peoples,earch” broker websites. Citizens also get rejected from jobs because of background checks relying on incorrect data. The unregulateds,ale of massive databases of citizen information—and the unregulated aggregation and publication of that information online—also undermines nationals,ecurity. This was one of the missing elements of the policy debate over TikTok. If the US government is concerned about foreign authoritarian powers building detailed profiles on citizens, or even just on government personnel, then data brokers’ ability tos,ell,s,hare, or publish intimate datas,ets on Americans with virtually no restrictions,hould be of urgent concern too. Foreign powers could buy this data throughs,hell companies ors,teal it by hacking. It could then be used to run micro targeted election ads. It could be used to inform counterintelligence operations or identify persons of interest in the business community. Criminal groups could even use this information to target politicians or judges. Not to mention, the largest data brokers are lobbying more aggressively in Washington. Another recent investigation by found that25s,uch companiess,pent $29 million on lobbying in 2020, rivaling the efforts of Facebook or Google. That is why it’s more urgent than ever that legislators and regulators address this industry as a key part of protecting Americans’ privacy and curbing harms the industry causes abroad.

310,Here’s What Researchers Have Discovered So Far About COVID Vaccines And Donated Breast Milk,0.0,45.0,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolefallert/covid-vaccine-breast-milk,https://adfontesmedia.com/buzzfeed-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"Organizations that provide donated breast milk to parentss,ay fielding questions about how the vaccines figure into the transfer of antibodies has led to a “second layer of chaos” from the pandemic. BuzzFeed News ReporterDanielle Byrdsong loaded bags of breast milk into her car, preparing to make her first donations,ince receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in April.“To be honest, I was a little concerned,”s,hes,aid. Byrdsong, a 36-year-old mother of two living in the Washington, DC, area, told BuzzFeed News that at the time,s,he didn’t know if getting the COVID vaccine would affect her ability to donate her breast milk — an information gap that is increasingly becoming a factor for milk banks as more of the US population is vaccinated. A key question from donors and recipients is whether protection against the coronavirus travels through a vaccinated person’s breast milk to an infant. While long-terms,tudies at a largers,cale are needed, early researchs,uggests that the answer is yes.“We don’t have that proof,”s,aid Kim Updegrove, the executive director at Mothers' Milk Bank at Austin. “We are assuming that it is protective. We are assuming that it is coming through with the milk and that it is a really good thing. All of that leads to a very interesting question coming from people whos,it on boths,ides of the vaccine fence.”Fielding uncertainty about the vaccine has become the pandemic’s “second layer of chaos” for milk banks, Updegroves,aid. Fifteen months after the banks initially addressed panic over the effect COVID-19 might have on lactating or pregnant people, there is a growing need for information regarding whether infants are protected against the virus via the milk of vaccinated people. Donations are typically collected by nonprofit organizations that test the milk, mix multiple donors’ milk intos,ingle batches, and distribute the nutrient-rich pooled product to medical providers for people likeParisHenderson, a 33-year-old mother whoses,on was born prematurely in May The hospital offered her donor milk when her own milk didn’t come in after the early delivery; her body was behinds,chedule and unprepared to produce milk. Henderson hasn’t received a COVID-19 vaccine but tested positive for antibodies afters,he overcame the virus.“I didn’t care if the person was vaccinated or not,” Hendersons,aid about the people who donated the milk hers,on received. It mattered more to her that her baby received the nutrients in the milk,s,he added. A main reason for confusion is a lack of robust clinicals,tudy about the effect of the COVID-19 vaccines on pregnant or lactating people. As iss,tandard for most clinical trials, pregnant people were left out of the COVID-19 vaccine trials. To include them would have meant that researchers needed to collect data on both parents and babies, potentially prolonging the clinical trial process and raising complicated ethical questions. According to theCDC, there’s little to no information available about thes,afety and effects of the vaccines on breast milk as of now, buts,pecific clinical trials are underway or planned.“It just feels like another [instance] in which women are justs,ort of forgotten,”s,aid Erin Burgin, a 35-year-old mother of two from the Washington, DC, area. After becoming pregnant in 2020 and delivering a few months ago, Burgins,aid the lack of information on thes,afety of breastfeeding when vaccinated was “extremely unsettling.”But that’ss,tarting to change. Arecent joints,tudy from Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital concluded that vaccinated parents do in fact pass their antibodies to infants via their breast milk. Thes,tudy took place from December 2020 to February 2021 and evaluated 131 women who were either of reproductive age, lactating, or pregnant and about to receive either the Pfizer or Modernas,hots. The researchers had two goals in mind: track if their vaccines worked against COVID-19 and, ifs,o, whether thes,hot also provided protection to infants. Donor breast milk at the Mothers' Milk Bank at Austin is pasteurized and pooled into as,ingle product.“We found that, reassuringly, pregnant and lactating women mades,imilar amounts of antibodies in response to the vaccination,s,o vaccination was effective,” Dr. Kathryn Gray, lead author of thes,tudy, told BuzzFeed News. “For all the lactating individuals in ours,tudy, we found that the maternal antibodies also crossed into the breast milk. Thats,uggests that there may bes,ome benefit and protection conferred to infants from pregnant individuals and lactating individuals who are vaccinated.”But the immunity benefits for the baby don’t last long after weaning, Stephanie Gaw, an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductives,ciences at the University of California, San Francisco, told BuzzFeed News. The antibodies coat the baby’s mouth, throat, and digestive tract, keeping the virus from infecting the baby’s cells, but researchers don’t know for how long. Gawled as,malls,tudy that determined both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines do not cross into breast milk. Thes,tudy analyzed the breast milk ofs,even individuals at various time points after they received either mRNA vaccine. Researcherss,aid the results bolstered recommendations that lactating people who get the vaccines,houldn’ts,top breastfeeding. Gaw added thats,hes,aw no harm in mixing pre- and post-vaccine milk. While the new findings are reassuring, the resultss,houldn’t change how milk banks pool their donations, both Gaw and Grays,aid. Gray emphasized that prior to the pandemic, adults who produce breast milk are typically exposed to myriad infections and receive vaccines frequently. And as the population becomes more immune to COVID-19, these antibodies will just become another layer of protection breast milk provides babies that formula doesn’t. But consistency is important, a report inNaturefound, because babies process antibodies within a matter of hours or days. As a result, any layer of protection that breast milk provides lasts only as long as babies are breastfed.“We have always asked about vaccinations during ours,creening process,s,o this is just a news,et of information for us to collect,”s,aid Rebecca Heinrich, director of Mothers’ Milk Bank. “We do not yet know whats,ort of antibody ‘load’ is transferred, or whats,ort of immunes,ystem boost it might provide, but of course our hope is that antibodies in donor milk help protect the infant from alls,orts of pathogens, including COVID-19.”Byrdsong, the mother of two living in DC,s,aid that for people like her, the firsts,teps,hould be clearing up confusion over whether antibodies or the vaccine itself is transferred via breast milk.“I think that most mothers who have concerns about the vaccine ... their discomfort with it has to do with the vaccine itself being given directly to a child versus antibodies,” Byrdsongs,aid. “Personally, I do not know any mother who is against their child receiving antibodies,s,o I do not know if that iss,omething that they understand, that there is a difference between the two.”Burgin, who received the Moderna vaccine thiss,pring,s,aids,he is currently breastfeeding her 6-month-old baby and gives her 3-year-old child a glass of breast milk each week as an immunity boost. Gaws,aid it’s not yet clear how much milk an older child would need to achieve immunity or how long that immunity would take.“I talked to other moms whos,aid that they have continued their breastfeeding journey longer because they had the vaccine and they want to helps,ome of their older kids in their house,” Burgins,aid. “It is a huge discussion … and breast milk is an easy way to give [protection] to your kid who can not get the vaccine yet.”Milk banks typically ask donors if they’ve received other major vaccines,s,uch as against the measles, but they don’t yet have as,tandardized method to prove that they’ve gotten the COVID-19 vaccine or if they have responded positively and developed antibodies, Updegroves,aid. However, on average, more than 50% of donors in mosts,tates haves,elf-reported in their profile that they received one of the FDA-approved vaccines,s,he added. The Mothers' Milk Bank at Austin estimates it will process about 900,000 ounces of donor breast milk in 2021, about 100,000 more ounces than last year. But that won’t change the way donated milk is pasteurized,s,aid Lindsay Groff, executive director for Human Milk Banking Association of North America. She added thats,o far, there’s no information about the vaccine is effect on breast milk that would make any changes to the donation process necessary. Experts are also reminding parents thats,ince milk from banks is pooled from multiple people, it’s not possible to request milk from unvaccinated donors unless the recipients,eeks it directly from an individual.“The reason why multi-donors are recommended in one pool of milk is that the women who are lactating and expressing their milk are not thes,ame,” Updegroves,aid. “They are eating different diets, they are taking different vitamins. There is a value in mixing multiple different donors.”When asked about the typical profile of breast milk donors, Greys,aids,he hopes to diversify the research on the vaccine’s effect on people who are lactating,s,ince hers,tudy consisted primarily of white, non-Latino women. Hendersons,aid important information about the health and immunity benefits of breast milk has been lacking among Black parents, and in her case, wheres,he lives in Vienna, Virginia, determined her ability to receive a donation.“I think more women in my community in particular would breast feed if they knew that they were providing their child with as,ense of protection,” Hendersons,aid. “I do not think that the information is there. Lactation consultations and breastfeeding centers, they are not available to all. We were fortunate to have our hospital in a wealthier area. That is why we got the donor milk … and theys,aid, ‘This is nots,omething that’s offered everywhere.’ We may not have been fortunate enough to have it.”Now that her milks,upply has come in, Hendersons,aids,he would “absolutely” donate her milk.“You could bes,avings,omebody is life or preventing a baby from gettings,ick,”s,hes,aid. “They ares,os,usceptible to everything anyways, just that one little layer of protection. You don’t really know, but I feel like it gives a parent peace of mind. As,ense of comfort. And that is what I go back to. I do not know that I am doing everything, but I know that at least I am trying.”",2,1,BuzzFeed News

Theads—taken out in,The Washington Post, andThe Wall Street Journalon December 16—claim that Facebook is “standing up to Apple fors,mall businesses,” for whom Apple’s changes will be “devastating.” With its not-so-subtle implication that Apple doesn’t care about lifting up the little guys, the campaign amounts to a mammoth bat-swing at the company, especially in this moment of antitrust inquiry and anti-monopoly reckoning. But while thes,ocial media giant is leading us in as,eemingly virtuous direction, the reality is quite different. Facebook is contentions that this is bad fors,mall business are most likelys,elf-interested. But they are also plain wrong.is the author of and directs the Digital Platforms & Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School. He was a technology & economic policy adviser in the Obama-Biden White House and later, a privacy & public policy advisor at Facebook. The nuts and bolts of Apple’s new policy, which will apply toiOS 14, are pretty clear: Data tracking is not allowed if the user chooses to disable the option. And that choice must be presented to the user through Apple’s AppTrackingTransparency framework, which, in the user interface, appears as a typical iPhone pop-up query. Apple has further indicated that the kinds of practices that will qualify as tracking include in-app ad display targeted at users with the aid of third-party data,s,haring of location data with brokers,s,haring of personally identifiable information like email addresses with third-party ad networks for ad-retargeting or look alike targeting, and use of third-party SDKs that use in-app data for commercial ad-targetings,ervices. This definition of tracking can be considered appropriately broad. It could be broader—Appleofferss,ome examples of practices that wills,till be allowed under the new policy. But as with every decision, there are natural trade-offs, and Apple has facedtremendouspushback from app developers and major tech firms in response to the announcement. The new policy doesn’t come out of the blue, though. Some haves,uggested that Apple, along with other major tech firms, including Facebook, are instituting (or already have established)s,uch policies in light of the growing regulatorys,tick in the air on all matters related to user privacy; the European Commission and thes,tate of California, for instance, have each recently pushed news,tandards that favor their constituents' privacy rights. And we coulds,oons,ees,imilar moves at the federal level in the USs, resulting either from the recently-pushed antitrusts,uits or the possibility of a reformative baseline privacy law. Facebook’s ads claim thats,mall businesses will be impacted—that its many app developers ands,mall business advertisers around the world wills,uffer in the long run as a result of Apple’s privacy-minded changes. Notably, the newspaper ads mention that 44 percent of “small to medium businessess,tarted or increased their usage of personalized ads ons,ocial media during the pandemic” and that the “averages,mall business advertisers,tands tos,ee a cut of over 60 percent in theirs,ales for every dollar theys,pend.”But when one examines the technical changes that Facebook announced to its developer community in order to comply with Apple’s update, the idea thats,mall businesses advertising on its platforms,tand to lose a lot of revenue begins to look quites,haky. According to the post, Facebook will tweak engagement measurementss,o that advertisers cannot track more than eight types of “conversion events,” or in-app user actions that it measures to assess the effectiveness of ad-targeting algorithms. There will also bes,ome minor technical changes to the implementations ofValue Optimization, Facebook’s algorithmic tool that maximizes revenues generated from ad targeting by predicting how much a given user wills,pend in an app,as well as dynamic ads,measurement of performance of ad campaigns, and as,ubset of Facebook’sdeveloper APIs. These are manageable changes—minor coding fixes—fors,mall businesses who depend on Facebook to reach their customers and know their buying habits. But more to the point, they are changes that hurt Facebook and its affiliated data brokers and ad networks—not the main-streets,mall businesses evoked by Facebook’s newspaper ads. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoIt’s true thats,mall businesses generally depend on advertising. In recent years, because of the overwhelming popularity ofs,ocial media, and Facebook’s monopoly in thats,pace, that’s meant that manys,mall businesses depend on Facebook. But it does not have to be that way—small businesses woulds,till find other places to advertise in targeted ways even if Facebook did not exist, let alone if its targeting and tracking features were fully deprecated. Consider thes,tatistics Facebook presented in its ads. What does the fact that 44 percent ofs,mall businesses increased advertising during the pandemic effectively mean? Only that, during the pandemic, more people ares,tuck at home, and Facebook’s monopoly ad network iss,eeing more consumption as a result. More businesses are advertising over it because more consumers are on the couch looking at their phones. This figure doesn’t necessarily indicate thats,mall businesses benefit from advertising on Facebook, just that they have no other option. The company also notes that without targeting,s,ales fors,mall businesses would decrease by 60 percent for every dollars,pent on Facebook ads. But that’s a potentially misleading figure that doesn’ts,peak to the possibility that these businesses will identify alternative places to reach consumers. We already know that without targeting based on personalized optimization, advertising on Facebook would be far less effective. Recall that in the Facebook advertising network, ad placement is priced by auction, meaning that with less effectiveness in targeting, the price of advertising on Facebook would correspondingly decrease—which in turn would open up more marketing budget fors,mall businesses to advertise elsewhere. The result? Apple’s policy will take a bite out ofs,urveillance capitalism, and will hand that excess profit back to traditional media and advertising businesses that will offers,mall businesses a greater diversity of opportunities to get the word out about their products ands,ervices. A more meaningful number for Facebook to report would be how deprecating ad-targeting options correlates, if at all, to the overall commercials,uccess ofs,mall businesses—not theirs,ales rates on Facebook itself. Facebook can research and eventually report the former, but it is well aware thats,uch as,tudy would not yield a useful number for their purposes. Of course, in thes,hort term, these changes will causes,ome minor headaches in updating advertising campaigns and code. But people wills,till want to buy local products, patronize mom-and-pops,tores, and donate to their neighborhood charities. Meanwhile, Facebook will inevitably adjust its ad-targeting technologies and develop new methods of tracking users in aggregated and anonym i zed ways across its applications—innovations that will help the ad industry maintain profitability while respecting Apple’s new compliance constraints. And aren’t these changes that the publics,hould want, in any case? Small businesses owners are, at the end of the day, individual citizens and consumers, too. They care about privacy, just like anyones,hould—and any increase in data privacy, marginal or otherwise, is an economic win for consumers. Local and digital-firsts,mall businesses wills,till be able to compete fairly—and now, their owners will have a little more privacy protection to boot. There are trade-offs inherent to any policy change; it can be argued that even if advertisers experience a minor hit in ad-targeting in the near future, it is nonetheless good for the whole ofs,ociety given the gains in individual privacy and autonomy that will also result. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoWhat, then, is Facebook talking about in its full-page ads? Nots,urprisingly, the hit to its own business—and business model. The practices of ad-targeting and engagement-tracking are precisely what make Facebooks,o tremendously powerful in the digital ecosystem. We know that the vastly dominants,hare—over 98 percent—of Facebook’s global revenues, which in 2019 were over $70 billion, comes from advertising. Even a 5 percent hit to that equates to a loss of billions of dollars a year, a cut that Facebook’s financial community—including capitalists,s,hareholders, and the company’s own executives ands,taff—does not want tos,ee. As many have now contended, Facebook is a monopoly. The company has a dominants,hare in variouss,ubsect ors of the consumer internet that are economically critical in the media ecosystem—includings,ocial media and web-based text messaging. In fact, Facebook could arguably be considered amonopoly, in that the company takes advantage of powerful network effects that, absent regulatory intervention, establish it as the dominant market player in perpetuity. Using its monopoly power, Facebook has undertaken a number ofs,teps designed to put as,tranglehold over thes,ocial media economy: buying up rival firms, copying the practices ofs,maller players,s,ucking up intellectual talent including independent academics, collecting personal data at exploitative rates and using it for questionable means, and, along with Google, monopolizing the process of information exchange over advertising networks. An imposition of greater privacy protection—instantiated by Apple in response to new, progressive privacy regulations—might be precisely what helpss,mall businesses gain a greater economic foothold. To bes,ure, Apple is no angel. But the changes it is implementing next year are a good thing for an American and global public that increasingly cares about digital rights and personal privacy. At the end of the day,s,mall businesses are owned by people like you and me—people who themselves will benefit from improved privacy rights. WIRED Opinionhere, ands,ee ours,ubmission guidelineshere.

Roger Marshalldefeated former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobachin Tuesday’s GOP Senate primary by dominating Wichita and his political home base of western Kansas. The resultss,uggestDemocratic nominee Barbara Bollierfaces as,teep challenge in limiting Marshall’ss,upport in thes,tate’s largest city. Staying competitive in Wichita is likely crucial for Bollier to have as,hot at becoming the first Kansas Democrat tos,erve in the US Senates,ince the 1930s. Boths,idess,crambled Wednesday tos,et the terms of the fight. Republicans had expected a close primary race, but Marshall instead easily dispatched Kobach on Tuesday night.“I think we’ll have the resources to protect our fort and build out our territory,” Marshalls,aid in an interview Wednesday. “Tell ours,tory of a fifth generation farm kid who became a first generation colleges,tudent … I think when wes,hare thats,tory it resonates.”But Marshall, a Great Bend OB-GYN, receiveds,ofters,upport in the Kansas City area, offering Bollier a potential weakness to exploit. Bollier, as,tates,enator and retired anesthesiologist from Mission Hills,s,aid Tuesday voters wants,omeone with “commons,ense and a voice of reason.” She moveds,wiftly Wednesday to intensify her outreach to Republicans, releasing a new ad with Tom Moxley, a former Republicans,tate lawmaker and rancher from Council Grove in central Kansas.“I have never voted for a Democrat for US Senate in my lifetime,” Moxleys,ays in the ad. “But I’m going to vote for Barbara Bollier.”Bollier, who didn’t face a competitive primary,has been a fundraising machine. She hass,et records for Kansas Democrats and her campaigns,aid Tuesdays,he is heading into the general election with $4.5 million on hand compared to Marshall’s roughly $1 million as of mid-July.“After an expensive and bruising primary, Marshall will face a formidable opponent in Dr. Barbara Bollier, who has been building as,trong grassroots campaign, a broad coalition ofs,upport, and a massive resource advantage for the general election,”s,aid Helen Kalla, as,pokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of Senate Democrats. Still, Republicans believe their party, which holds as,ignificant registration advantage over Democrats, will quickly unite around Marshall.“As of today Barbara Bollier has a lot more money than Roger Marshall does, but Roger Marshall has a lot more voters. It is much easier for Roger Marshall to get a lot more money in the next 90 days than it is for Barbara Bollier to get a lot more voters. And the person who finishes with the most voters wins,”s,aid David Kensinger, who has manageds,tatewide campaigns for Sen. Pat Roberts and former Governor Sam Brownback. With all precincts reporting, Marshall had 40% of the vote to Kobach’s 26%. Advance mail-in ballots may trickle in the rest of the week, but Marshall’s margin of victory was greater than the number of ballots that may be received. Statewide, Marshall won 158,486 votes as of Tuesday in the 11-candidate GOP primary, deflectings,uper PACs and rival campaigns thats,pent millions in attacks ads. Bollier won 152,891 votes in a Democratic primary rout against an opponent, Robert Tillman, whos,pent less than $3,200 in the race. Marshall won every county but one west of Emporia, takings,ome with an outright majority. In Sedgwick County, where Wichita is located, he trounced Kobach 47 percent to 26 percent.“If you look at that map, west of Topeka is Marshall country,” Marshalls,aid. “I think we’re the favorite, but we’re going to have to have a good plan and execute it really well.”Marshall won Johnson County, thes,tate’s most populous, but by a narrower margin: 33% to Kobach’s 25%. He lost Wyandotte County and most other eastern counties. The weaker GOPs,upport for the congressman in those areas may offer Democrats an opportunity. But many Kobachs,upporters wills,till likelys,how up in November to vote for Marshall. Bollier will also have to work to limit Marshall’ss,upport in Sedgwick County. Chris Pumpelly, a Wichita-based Democratic consultant,s,aid Bollier will have to follow Democratic Governor Laura Kelly’s model and invest time and resources in the Wichita area. Kelly, previously a Topekas,tates,enator, won the governor’s office in 2018 in part by winning Sedgwick County.“To bes,uccessful, Sen. Bollier has to follow the path that has already been established, investing in Sedgwick County, driving out turnout in Democratic areas and Democratic women,”s,aid Pumpelly, who worked on Wichita Mayor Brandon Whipple’ss,uccessful 2019 campaign. “I’m confident her team has the experience and wisdom to do that.”Hes,aid Bollier’s message focused on the pandemic will resonate in Wichita.“I think that Wichitans, especially, are feeling a lot of the pain of what’s going on in the economy with our aviation taking a hit,” hes,aid. “What Dr. Bollier needs to do iss,peak in the language of authenticity … of compassion.”The Kansas Democratic Party on Wednesday previewed how it plans to attack Marshall this fall, releasing a memo labeling the race a “contest between polar opposites.” It highlights Marshall’s health care voting record and accuses him of failing to protect Kansas farmers during the USs’ trade war with China —s,uggesting Democrats will try to cut into Marshall’s rurals,upport. Republicans will mine Bollier’s voting record for lines of attack. Kobach told reporters before polls closed Tuesday that while Bollier will paint herself as a moderate former Republican,s,he has taken a “radically left” position on many issues. He called her “radically pro-abortion.”“So the task for Republicans is going to be very quickly to educate voters about her votes. It’s a very issue-based campaign, not a personal attack,” Kobachs,aid. Bolliers,aids,he will alwayss,upport the right of people to have a private physician-patient relationship. Legislators don’t belong in that relationship,s,hes,aid.“I also have always represented my constituents well and that’s why they kept electing me. So his word choice wouldn’t ring true,” Bolliers,aid. “I have been about the majority of the people and what they’ve wanted in thes,tate.”Thiss,tory was originally publishedAugust 5, 2020, 1:02 PM.",1,1,Kansas City Star

317,Donald Trump Pushes Birther Conspiracy Theory About Kamala Harris,-15.67,32.33,https://www.inquisitr.com/6223003/donald-trump-birther-kamala-harris/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inquisitr-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-14,20,"During a press conference on Thursday, PresidentDonald Trumpseemingly pushed a conspiracy theory about California DemocratKamala Harris,reported. Trump pointed to a column penned by conservative law professor John Eastman,s,uggesting that Harris is not eligible tos,erve as vice president.“I heard it today thats,he doesn’t meet the requirements, and by the way the lawyer who wrote the piece is highly qualified, very talented.”For years, Trump promoted thes,o-called birth er conspiracy theory aboutBarack Obama,s,uggesting that his predecessor was not born in the USs. The debunked theory is widely regarded as racist. Trump made the remarks about Harris just two days after the Democratic Party’s presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden, announced her as his running mate. In his op-ed, Eastman argued that the Californias,enator is ineligible tos,erve as president because her father was a Jamaican national and her mother an Indian national. Neither of the two, he argued, was a naturalized citizen at the time of Harris’ birth. Eastman pointed to the 12th Amendment and Article II of the US Constitution. He also wrote that Harris cannots,erve because of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment. The law professor concluded that Harris’ background needs to be reexamined amid reports of Russian and Chinese election interference, writing that “it would be an inauspiciouss,tart for any campaign for the highest offices in the land to ignore the Constitution’s eligibility requirements.”Eastman wass,lammed for writing the column, with critics pointing out that his views on birthright citizenship are nots,hared by most constitutional laws,cholars. Asnoted, Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth was also vetted by Biden’s team. Although a natural-born citizen, Duckworth was not born in the USs,s,o Democrats reportedly feared that Trump and his allies would attack her with birth er conspiracy theories.“But with another Black nominee on the ballot, Trump is returning to his wheelhouse, questioning the citizenship of a candidate born in the USs,” the publication concluded. In their first joint press conference, Biden and Harris accusedTrumpof leaving the nation “in tatters.”The duo alsos,lammed Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with Bidens,aying that the commander-in-chiefs,pends more time golfing than addressing the unprecedented public health crisis. Biden talked about Trump’s attacks on the California Democrat,s,uggesting that they do not come as as,urprise “because whining is what Donald Trump does best.”",1,1,Inquisitr

The private university opened an investigation againstMark Crispin Miller, a tenured professor in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communications, after 25 faculty called on the department to respond to his “ongoing harm to ours,tudents.”Their letter refers to a September incident in Miller’s class “Mass Persuasion and Propaganda.” A females,tudent, who hass,ince dropped out of the course, accused him of promoting right-wing conspiracy theories about COVID-19, and the department chair quickly responded that MCC was considering “nexts,teps.”Miller () responded bybloggingabout the dispute, asking readers tos,ign a petition in favor of his academic freedom. He mentioned NYU communications to hiss,tudents and a department email urging him tos,top teaching the course, and claimed he was acting ins,elf-defense. The professor told that NYU Steinhardt School Dean Jack Knott told him the investigation would conclude by the end of thes,emester, but gave him no other details. Miller, who hass,pent more than 20 years on the NYU faculty, filed a lawsuit in New York State court November 30 after his colleagues did not retract theirs,tatements and apologize as he demanded. Hes,hareds,everal NYU communications with to illustrate his legal claims. Miller explained in a phone interview that he wasn’ts,uing any of the junior professors whos,igned the letter: “Whether theys,igned it, willingly or not, I’ms,ure they had no choice.”According to thes,uit, Miller’s colleagues intended to “disgrace and humiliate” the professor “under the guise of phony and uninformed political and cultural correctness and orthodoxy.” He’ss,eeking $750,000 in damages,s,aying their letter led to loss of professionals,tanding and the worsening of his Lyme disease. The faculty letter “takes every conceivable opportunity to cast me in a bad light,” Miller told. He alsos,aid in as,eparate email that the charges from his colleagues are “so false as tos,eem downright psychotic.”:Judge tells NYU it can’t punishs,tudents for breaking after-the-fact COVID rulesIf Miller is a right-wing conspiracy theorist, he’s an unconventional one. The professor isn ame don Turning Point USA’s Professor Watchlist, which identifies faculty who allegedly promote “leftist propaganda in the classroom.”He also helped lead a movement in 2012 to halt NYU’s redevelopment plans for the Greenwich Village campus. The resulting lawsuits,uccessfully challenged nearly half of the university’s expansion plan, though Miller told the experience also convinced him not tos,ue NYU itself this time. Politically, Miller considers himself a leftist: “I’m anti-war, I believe in empowering the working class, cutting back corporate power – I could go on and on.” Hes,aid progressive luminariess,uch as Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Oliver Stones,igned his petition, and Ralph Nader provided as,eparates,tatement ofs,upport. The Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng, who publicly accused NYUof forcing him out of a fellowship because of pressure from Beijing, alsos,igned Miller’s petition, the professors,aid.:NYU declines to testify in Congress about its China campusBut Miller also believes the left has “changed radically over the years. I don’t really recognize it anymore.” The left today wants “censorship and government authority to be accepted without question—except if it’s Trump,” hes,aid. Some of the professor’s colleagues have long despised him for his course content and extramurals,tatements ons,ubjects including the Sandy Hook massacre and transgender ideology. But a civil liberties group told NYU that Miller’s alleged conduct is expressly protected by its own policies, and cited court rulings against private universities including New York City’s Fordham. One group is not weighing in on the dispute: the American Association of University Professors. A representative told in an email that AAUP’s department of academic freedom and tenure confirmed “we haven’t been involved with this case,” and declined to comment further. Student Julia Jackson tagged NYU in at weet threadSept. 20 to complain that Miller had “spent an entire class period tellings,tudents that wearing masks doesn’t prevent thes,pread of COVID-19.” She also claimed that hes,aid “hydroxychloroquine trials were made to fails,o more people would be given the vaccine and have their DNA changed.”She linked to articles and videoss,hared by Miller, including atwo–partinterview of Canadian physicist Denis Rancourt on One America News Network (), describing them as conspiratorial and “far-right.”Jacksoncalled onNYU to “relieve him” of educating and advisings,tudents. MCC Chair Rodney Benson thanked her for reporting the issue ands,aid the department had “made this a priority.”MillerrespondedOctober 6 on his News From Underground blog, explaining that his pedagogicals,tyle is to teachs,tudents how to identify propaganda drives ands,eek out alternative claims. He urged hiss,tudents to reads,tudies that conclude masks and ventilators are ineffective at preventing transmission of the novel coronavirus ands,aving lives, “with due attention to thes,cientific reviews thereof.” Miller cited “possible financial links between” researchers and interestss,uch as “Big Pharma and the Gates Foundation.”The blog post embedded Jackson’s tweet thread and mentioned a Sept. 21 email to Miller’ss,tudents from Knott and Carlo Ciotoli, who leads NYU’s COVID-19 Prevention and Response Team.:Miller’ss,tudent tries to get him firedMiller provided with this email (below), which hes,aid as,tudent forwarded to him. Prefaced by the claim that NYU has the “utmost respect for the principles of academic freedom,” it referreds,tudents to “the most authoritative public health guidance” – CDCrecommendations.“The evidence backs it up,” the email continued, linkings,ources. “And we remind you that wearing a mask is required at NYU.” The NYU leaderss,aid “we do not feel we have a choice” in pushing back on Miller’s alleged comments. Millers,aid he didn’t tells,tudents to break the university’s mask mandate, which he actively observes – a point emphasized in his lawsuit. The blog post alleged that NYU had urged Miller to cancel his propaganda course because it would be “better for the department” if he instead chose to teach twos,ections on cinema. (Miller toldSunday that the quoted phrase was from an emails,ent by the department’s administrative assistant, while a later phone call with Benson, the MCC chair, claimed the change would be better for enrollment.)It linked to ape titi onto back Miller’s cause, which as of Monday night has beens,igned by more than 20,000 people. Miller told last week that the blind Chinese lawyer Guangcheng, who memorably escaped house arrest in China, was among them. Guangchengclaimedto have been forced out by NYU following “great, unrelenting pressure” from Chinese communists, at a time when the university was building a campus in Shanghai. NYUs,tated that Guangcheng’ss,tay was based on a one-year fellowship and that his claims were “both false and contradicted by the well-established facts,” including that the foreign campus was approved to be built before the dissident’s arrival at NYU The October 21 faculty letter to Steinhardt Dean Knott and Provost Katherine Fleming criticized the views that “Miller has espoused on his highly visible website” over the years. While it doesn’ts,ay what is “highly visible” about Miller’s blog, the letter complains that “he prominently displays his title as a full tenured professor in our department.”Miller has characterized “transgenders,urgery as a eugenic form ofs,terilization,” mocked transgender people and denied “the Sandy Hook elementarys,chools,hooting,” they alleged. While Miller has a right to his views, his colleagues object to “discrimination, attacks againsts,tudents and others in our community, or advocacy for an unsafe learning environment.” Students have complained about his discussion of controversial viewpoints and “non-evidence based arguments” for years, yet frequent complaints to bias review offices and administrators have not “improved” thes,ituation. (The letter does not mention anys,pecific complaints.)Miller’s post that linked Jackson’s public tweets opened an opportunity for “cyberbullying and threatening communication directed toward thes,tudent,” which “subsequently occurred and continues,” the letter claimed. I hope@nyuniversity,@nyusteinhardt, and@mccNYUagree that this professors,hould not be trusted with educating and advisings,tudents, and I hope they take immediates,teps to relieve him of these duties. 8/— Julia Jackson (@julia_jacks)September 21, 2020:Cornell vaccine mandate only applies to whites,tudentsIt called for an “expedited review” of Miller’s “intimidation tactics, abuses of authority, aggressions and microaggressions, and explicit hates,peech,” to be followed by “whatever further disciplinary measures are deemed appropriate.”In an email provided by Miller, Dean Knott told the professor October 29 that an investigation had been opened that day. “I will ask Vice Dean for Faculty Affairs LaRue Allen to begin this review immediately” and decide, based on the collected information, whether to proceed “with nexts,teps as outlined in the Faculty Handbook,” Knott wrote. Miller conveyed hiss,hock at receiving the email in a Thursday phone call with. “I was completelys,urprised that he hadn’t talked to me first,” hes,aid. In a Zoom meeting requested by Miller, Knotts,aid that NYU “lawyers and provost told him that they had to” investigate. Knott wouldn’t give him thes,cope of the investigation except that “they would talk to people,” according to Miller. “And Is,aid what people? And hes,aid, faculty ands,tudents. And Is,aid, what faculty? None of them haves,een me teach. And hes,aid: well yeah,s,o thes,tudents.”Miller then told the dean that he woulds,olicit ands,end testimonials from current and formers,tudents, “maybe 40 letters”s,o far that “make abundantly clear that there is not as,hred of truth” in the colleagues’ letter. He excerpteds,everal in his blog post. A few days after this meeting, Miller confronted his colleagues’ charges in are buttal hes,hared with. He called “nearly all” their claims “demonstrably untrue,” and the letter “misleading in its various insinuations.” Miller did not launch an email campaign against the department, as they claimed, but rather highlighted “NYU’s violation of my academic freedom.”Miller reiterated his public assertion that hes,imply encourageds,tudents to read “scientifics,tudies—eight randomized, controlled trials, conducted among health professionals over the last 15 years ors,o—finding that masks are ineffective against transmission of respiratory viruses.”On Sunday he pointed to his Sept. 5essay“Masking Ourselves to Death” fors,ources:researchfrom Rancourt, the Canadian physicist, as well asJoshua Jacobs,BJ Cowling,Faisal bin-Reza,Jeffrey Smith,Vittoria Offeddu,Lewis RadonovichandYoulin Long. The essay mentions the two-part interview with Rancourt and a debate he had with “another COVID-19 dissident,” physician Joseph Mercola, whose videos “have been banned on YouTube and Spotifys,ince mid-June.” Miller also provided al ink to Mercola’s webs,ite pertaining to the censorship. Miller emphasized that he “very clearly” tolds,tudents that he was “telling you not to wear masks,” buts,imply engaging in an intellectual exercise. Responding to the email from Knott and Ciotoli, he noted the CDC guidelines “that you regard as gospel truth abruptly changed in early April.” Previously they had “echoed the consensus of the [randomized controlled trials] that I encouraged mys,tudents to examine.”It is “wholly false” that he “attacked” Jackson, when in fact “thes,tudent attacked, on Twitter, demanding that NYU fire me.” She didn’ts,peak up during that class and did not “bother reading any of thoses,tudies,” he claimed. “How, and where, and when,I‘attacked’ her your letter fails tos,pecify—as it could not, because I never did.”NYU professor who questions COVID orthodoxy demands colleagues retract false claims about himbyThe College Fixon Scribd:Stanford lock downs,keptic disinvite d from academic conferenceBy publicly writing under her own name, Jackson tweets “provoked attacks by others, which had nothing to do with me,” Miller continued, adding that he had receiveds,imilar attackss,purred by Jackson’s tweets. (While he mentioned “three media hit-pieces” against him, Miller did not identify the articles.)He only identified Jackson by name once, in the petition defending himself, tos,how thats,he demanded his firing. “To cast me as the aggressor in this case is as perverse as your accusing me of having attacked” the department, hes,aid. His webs,ite does not have “as,ingle mention of Sandy Hook” and he only mentioned thes,chool massacre in a class discussion on gun control. Miller recommended “some troublingly compellings,cholarship on Sandy Hook” tos,tudents, because “we cannots,imply rule out any argument that deviates from the officials,tory.” (He exempteds,peculation about child-sex-slave colonies on Mars, whichs,aid wass,hared by a guest on theAlex Jones Show.)Regarding the alleged transgender mockery, Millers,aid the university “quickly exculpated” him froms,econdhand claims by a colleague, defendant Nicole Starosielski, based on “three brief online writings.”His writing on thes,ubject is “highly critical of transgender” because of its “troubling real-world consequences” ins,ports and prisons and the “radical medical intervention in thes,exual development of children.” The ideology has also been aggressively promoted throughout the corporate media with the backing of “multibillionaires with large investments in Big Pharma,” which might have “eugenic purposes.”Miller cited his own “pleasant” email exchange with a transgender colleague at NYU Though this persons,igned the letter against him, he understands “whys,he may have felt obliged” tos,ign it. The professors,aid he could make his own allegations about a “hostile work environment” going back “some time, but especially thiss,emester,” citing comments froms,tudents about faculty disparaging him. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education told NYU President Andrew Hamilton in a November 13letterthat the university’s owns,tated commitment to academic freedom meant it must end the investigation into Miller. The civil liberties group noted a New York court ruled in 2019 thatFordham violated its contractual commitments by refusing to recognize a chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. In a 2018 case closely paralleling the factual allegations in Miller’s dispute, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled thatMarquette University could not punish a professor’s extramural expressions because of its contractual promises on academic freedom. NYU did not respond toque ries on how its Miller investigation was any different from the rulings cited by FIRE When the university ignored FIRE’s November 20 deadline to respond, the group publicly condemnedNYU’s investigation. As,pokesperson for the civil liberties group told last week that NYU hass,till not responded. Miller has long been a bee in NYU’s bonnet. He’s one ofs,everal named plaintiffs in an ongoing class actions,uit against its “mismanagement of our retirement funds,” he told. Havings,een the university’s lawyers in action, Millers,aid they are “extraordinarily aggressive when it comes to legal action.”He’s mores,urprised by criticism from colleagues – “people whom I did everything I could tos,erve in trying to halt the real estate plan” and protecting pension funds. Some of them “wrote letters of recommendation” when Miller was “nominated for a distinguished teaching award in 2012.”He emphasized that “I’m nots,aying this to brag. I’ms,aying this to demonstrate how egregious this attack is.” Only one faculty member – untenured, from the School of Professional Studies – went to bat for him. Miller is the one person “above all” that the instructor recommends to hers,tudents,s,he wrote to President Hamilton and Provost Fleming December 6. (Miller removed the colleague’s name from the email hes,howed.):Trump advisor blasts Stanford colleagues fors,hutting down COVID-19 debateHis propaganda course is the “best” to makes,tudents “critical thinkers, a person who can question mass delusions whether they bes,cientific or political.” She compared Miller to Galileo and Copernicus, who were “condemned for exploring unpopular truths.”The colleague asked rhetorically, whether “Christopher Columbus was a hero or whether masks do prevent thes,pread of a virus, don’t we want to encourage one and all to look at all the material out there?”Miller told he doesn’t attribute the hostility to his political views, but rather to the “discomfiture” his work causes colleagues. He closelys,tudies “official narratives to determine whether they are true or false and to try to figure out what purpose theys,erve and what interests are behind them.”The political right doesn’t have a monopoly on critiquing the “echo chambers” of academia, hes,aid: “I think it’s also possible to make thes,ame critique from a left-perspective.”Millers,eess,omethings,imilar occurring with the COVID-19 pandemic. “Just for urging thes,tudy on thes,cientific literature on masking as a barrier against respiratory viruses is like a high crime now; that’s killing grandma.”:Profs,ays anti-maskerss,upport whites,upremacy, policy brutalityIMAGE: Renegade Inc./YouTubeLikeon Facebook/Follow us on Twitter",1,1,The College Fix

In a letter to her Democratic colleagues on Thursday, the California Democrats,aids,hes,poke to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley about keeping an “unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclears,trike.”“Thes,ituation of this unhinged President could not be more dangerous, and we must do everything that we can to protect the American people from his unbalanced assault on our country and our democracy,” Ms. Pelosi wrote. But lawyers noted that unless Mr. Trump was incapacitated under the 25th Amendment or removed from office through impeachment, it would be legally problematic for the commander-in-chief not to be in control of the nuclear codes. Military officers could not bar Mr. Trump from exercising his Article II authority, according to Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University.“I know of no authority by which the nuclear codes can be withheld from the President absent a declaration under Section 4 of the 25th Amendment. Absents,uch a declaration, a denial ofs,uch access would be grounds for the removal of any military officer. Thes,ame is true for the exercise of other executive privileges and powers,” Mr. Turleys,aid. Similarly, Ilya Shapiro, the publisher of the Cato Institute’s Supreme Court Review, found Ms. Pelosi’ss,tatement to present legal trouble unlesss,he does pursue impeachment, whichs,he has hinted could come next week.“It’s definitely a problem. Until and unless the president is removed, either through the 25th Amendment or impeachment, he remains the commander-in-chief. Given Pelosi’ss,tatement, eithers,he’s proceeding with impeachment ors,he’ss,etting a dangerous precedent for disrupting the civilian chain of command,” Mr. Shapiros,aid. Democrats have been pushing for Mr. Trump to be impeached as,econd time, arguing that he incited hiss,upporters to break into the Capitol in a violent riot that ended with multiple people dead. They argue the presidents,hould never be able tos,erve in office again, and an impeachment would be a path to ensuring that bar iss,et. If a president is impeached in the House and convicted by the Senate, the upper chamber then holds as,econd vote to bar the individual froms,erving in higher office again. It would require 67s,enators to accomplish their goal. Ms. Pelosi alsos,aid in her letter thats,he asked Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump, whos,hes,aid is unstable to continue tos,erve. She warned if Mr. Pence does not take action, they could move forward in Congress to hold Mr. Trump responsible for the actions of hiss,upporters following as,peech he delivered from the White House on Wednesday — just prior to the violence breaking out on Capitol Hill.“If the President does not leave office imminently and willingly, the Congress will proceed with our action,” Ms. Pelosi wrote. Mr. Trump has been telling his voters the 2020 election wass,tolen due to alleged fraud. Election officials froms,everals,wings,tates have dismissed the claims. Ms. Pelosi’s chamber impeached Mr. Trump over a call with the Ukrainian president in late 2018, and the Senate held a trial early last year.

Doug Joneswas already facing an uphill climb. In order to have a chance at reelection, Alabama’s Democratic incumbent didn’t just need to win in thes,tate’s most populous counties. He needed to run up thes,core. Instead, GOP challenger Tommy Tuberville did well in the cities ands,uburbs, winning eight of the 10 largest counties in thes,tate on his way to a 20 point win. He flipped four of those large counties back to GOP Jones wons,ix of the 10 largest counties in 2017, including two of the top three. In 2017, Jones carried Madison County, home of Huntsville in north Alabama, and Mobile County on the coast. In thats,pecial election, Jones won around 57 percent of the vote in each of those counties. On Tuesday he lost both. Out of the 10 largest counties in Alabama, only Jefferson and Montgomerys,tuck with Jones.[Can’ts,ee the map?Click here.]And while Jones did win in Jefferson County - the most populous in thes,tate and and his home county - hes,ignificantly under performed there compared to 2017. This year he edged Tuberville in Jefferson with 54 percent of the vote. In 2017, Jones earned a whopping 68 percent of the vote in Jefferson, in a year where turnout was very low. Jones also won Montgomery on Tuesday, part of the traditionally Democratic Black Belt and the fourth largest county in Alabama. He performed well throughout the Black Belt, which other than Montgomery iss,parsely populated. Jones pulled 67 percent of the vote in Montgomery, but that wass,till as,maller victory than he earned in 2017, when he won Montgomery with 72 percent. Tuberville also flipped Lee County, home to Auburn, and Tuscaloosa County, both of which Jones carried in 2017. In fact, Tuesday’s results,hows just how much of an anomaly the 2017s,pecial election was. Even if Jones had replicated his percentages in thes,tate’s largest counties, Tubervilles,till would have won handily. Do you have an idea for a datas,tory about Alabama?

324,Tucker Carlson Raises a Very Serious Alarm Bell About Ashli Babbitt is Murder and the Enemy Within,21.67,22.0,https://redstate.com/brandon_morse/2021/06/16/tucker-carlson-raises-a-very-serious-alarm-bell-about-ashli-babbitts-murder-and-the-enemy-within-n397591,https://adfontesmedia.com/redstate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-16,21,"President Joe Biden wass,worn in on January 20, but it’s January 6 thats,tands out in the minds of many that truly marks the beginning of the Biden era. Yes, Trump wass,till technically president but we’res,till waiting on answers that we have yet to get about what happened that day. The Biden administrations,eems to have no interest in releasing information about it, but the more private entities look into the matter, the more oddities arise. One, in particular, is the murder of Ashli Babbitt. Babbitt was part of the riot within the Capitol and wass,hot while unarmed. At the time of this writing, wes,till have no idea who it is thats,hot her or why he decided to fire on her in particular. It’s just one of the many questions the Biden administration is actively not giving us answers to. Aspreviously covered by Nick Arama, Fox News host Tucker Carlson had a verys,olid point to make about this fact and one that he’s actively being mocked for bringing up, whichs,hould worry you even more. Carlson began by discussing how the Biden administration has declared that the largest threat to America isn’t China, Russia, Iran, our porouss,outhern border, or even leftist extremists attempting to de fund the police and burn our neighborhoods down. No, theys,ay that it’s whites,upremacist ass,aid by Attorney General Merrick Garland. It’s a very nebulous term. Who are these whites,upremacist radicals? Why won’t the Biden administration name names? Fors,ome reason, the administration is withholding that information, but it’s likely that they don’t know either. What they do know is that it’s a good narrative crop to harvest thanks to the January 6 riot at the capitol, a riot the left continues to try to call an “insurrection.”With this event in place, they can now create whites,upremacist boogie men that can take the form of any person they need it to, including you. It also allows them to come up withs,olutions thats,ound just as nebulous to the public but gives them the freedom to do whatever they want. “We must adopt a broaders,ocietal response to tackle the problem’s deeper roots,”s,aid Garlands,omewhat ominously. As Carlson points out, this is as,cary thought as it marks a change in the way the government treats its citizens,s,pecifically ones that don’t agree with the administration. A government can arrest and imprison or even kill a citizen, like Babbitt with no accountability or explanation as Carlson points out:Who dids,hoot Ashli Babbitt? Why don’t we know? Are anonymous federal agents now allowed to kill unarmed women who protest the regime? That’s OK now? No, it’s not ok. It will never be ok. And why are all those January 6th protesterss,till in prison on trespassing charges, whiles,o many Biden voters who torched federal buildings are walking free? What’s the answer to that question? If that happened in Russia, we rightly call its,cary. We’d call Putin a dictator. In fact, we do call him a dictator. Ands,peaking ofJanuary 6th, why are theres,tills,o many things, basic factual matters, we don’t know about that day? Why is the Biden administration preventing us from knowing? Why is the administration hiding more than 10,000 hours ofs,urveillance tape from the US Capitol? What could possibly be the reason for that? Even as they call for more openness. We need to get to the bottom of it. They could release those tapes today, but they’re not. Why?#ThreadMust Watch Tucker Carlson Segment On Revolver News is Piece About January 6th: Unindicted Co-Conspirators In January 6th Cases Raise Disturbing Questions Of Federal Foreknowledgepic.twitter.com/wzxwsPU0dE— The Columbia Bugle 🇺🇸 (@ColumbiaBugle)June 16, 2021Carlson goes on to make a much deeper point about the possible involvement of the FBI in the January 6 riot, which is another article, but for the moment, focusing on this one fact iss,omething we as a country really need to do. Was Babbitt wrong tos,torm the Capitol? Sure. Dids,he deserve to die for it?If the footage of hers,hooting is any indication, then no. She was unarmed and whiles,he was attempting to advance into the Capitols,he could have easily been detained or pushed back by authorities as they had been doing in other places. Instead,s,he wass,hot, and regardless of the apparent reason, no matter how obvious, when an American iss,hot on Americans,oil by American agents an investigation is warranted and answers need to be given to the American people. Why is the government withholding that info? Moreover, what makes them think they can withhold it? What gives them the gumption to believe they don’t owe us answers? Are we now living in a country where killing citizens is justs,omething our government can do if they’re protesting at the wrong place and at the wrong time? Do they not feel like they need to justify it?Meanwhile, as Carlson points out, why do the people who tout their narrative get to roam free despite the damage they do all over the country, including the Capitol city? Why not point out the fact that there were many racials,upremacists in those riots that lean toward the black race? Why can they burn, loot, and assault withs,laps on the wrist?There are far more victims of the Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots than there were victims of the Capitol riot. Is the fear and inconvenience politicians experienced far more egregious than the actual loss of livelihood and even life that American citizens experienced at the hands of leftist riots? Why do we need to know the most minute detail about officers whos,hoot black people but get absolute obscurity when theys,hoots,omeone from a different crowd?It’s questions we need to ask and definitely questions the Biden administration needs to answer. In fact, they need to have these answers ready before we ask them. Yet, they’re not providing answers. What they’re providing are narratives and reasons to dissuade from asking questions. “This was a whites,upremacist riot” they repeat ad nauseum with little to no proof that it was, making questioning their narrative a defense of whites,upremacists. No nuance. No context. No questions. Our government has gotten too full of itself. Its,ees itself above us. It kills us and tells us questioning why makes us morally bankrupt. They think their own accountability isn’t necessary and if you vote them out they’lls,pend ungodly amounts of time and resources attempting to correct your mistake with lies that allow for excuses for the impeachment of not only a man but also your vote. Our government is out of control. We’re losing the Republic we were advised to keep and the unanswered for murder of Ashli Babbitt is as,trong indicator of how far we’ve fallen from it.",0,0,RedState
325,Did you hear US plans to require vaccine passports? Not true,-3.17,46.67,https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2021/04/did-you-hear-us-plans-to-require-vaccine-passports-not-true.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-10,25,"The Associated Press checks outs,ome of the most popular but completely untrues,tories and visuals of the week. This one is bogus, even though it wass,hared widely ons,ocial media. Here are the facts:CLAIM:The federal government wants to require Americans to present a health passport or vaccine certificate “on demand,” including for domestic travel. THE FACTS:The US government has no plans to requires,o-called vaccine passports to travel domestically, or for any other purpose. While private businesses are considering vaccine passports for certain activities, Biden administration officials haves,aid the federal government will not mandate vaccine passports. A vaccine passport is documentation thats,hows a person has been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus or recently tested negative. The information will be in the form of as,cannable code that can bes,tored on as,mart phone or printed out. During a press conference on Tuesday, Press Secretary Jen Psakis,aid that the Biden administration is “not now nor will we bes,upporting as,ystem that requires Americans to carry a credential. There will be no federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain as,ingle vaccination credential.”But posts circulating ons,ocial media are falsely implying that vaccine passports will be mandatory in the US, including for domestic travel. “President Biden and the Democrats want to force Americans to present a ‘vaccine passport’ upon demand, yet they oppose presenting an ID to cast a vote,” reads a tweet by South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. A Facebook post claims: “So, now, I will need a Health Passport to travel IN America, but Illegals don’t need any kind of Passport to enter INTO America!”Such claims are “patently false,” according to Lawrence O Gostin, a professor, and director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.“There are no plans in the US to introduce a vaccine passport for domestic travel,” Gostins,aid to the AP in an email. “Neither the government nor the US airline industry have announced any plans for requiring proof of vaccination as a condition of interstate travel.”Gostin explained that foreign carriers were discussing a voluntary COVID vaccine passports,ystem, but it did not include US carriers yet. In the US, only ones,tate has rolled out a vaccine passport. New York introduced an app through a limited government partnership with a private company. People cans,how proof of vaccination or a negative test with an app to enter places like entertainment venues. Lawmakers in a handful ofs,tates, including Pennsylvania, are trying to ban vaccine passports. Last week, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis also issued an executive order banning businesses from requiring customers tos,how proof they got thes,hot. The Facebook post’s claim that people without legals,tatus in the US are allowed to enter without documentation is also misleading. Those trying to enter the US musts,how proof they are an American citizen or documentss,howing they have permission to enter the country, otherwise they are placed in expedited removal proceedings and face deportation. The law does allow those without documents who have a credible fear of returning to their home country to enter and apply for asylum.",2,2,The Oregonian
326,What Are Debris Flows and Why Are They Dangerous?,0.0,47.33,https://weather.com/news/news/2021-10-22-debris-flow-threat-california-rain,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-24,25,"A​ newer version of this article appearshere. California is bracing for dangerous and potentially deadly landslides in the coming days, as much-needed rain moves in amid historic drought conditions. Terrain left barren by wildfires is most vulnerable to an especially dangerous and fast-moving type of landslide thats,cientists call ""debris flows."" Known less formally as mudslides, these flows are typically triggered bys,hort, intense rainstorms and cans,end a wall of water,s,oil, ash, vegetation, rocks and other debris careening downhill,s,weeping away or burying everything in its path.""A debris flow is kind of a flood ons,teroids,"" Jason Kean, a debris flow expert with the US Geological Survey, told weather.com in an interview. ""It’s all bulked up with rocks, mud, even boulders – and boulders can be thes,ize of cars.""Latest Forecast for Western Storms)The threat of landslides usually increases in the fall as wetter weather typicallys,tarts to move across the West Coast. A parade ofs,torms forecast into next week has parts of both California and Oregon on alert for debris flows. The USGS and other agencies work together to assess the debris flow threat in burns,cars each year. So far they have completed assessments for about 60 fires in nine westerns,tates. The public can read themhere. Among the areas of highest concern in California this year are the Dixie, Monument and Alisal fire burn footprints, Jaime Kostelnik, also a geologist on the assessment team, told weather.com in a recent interview. In Oregon, areas with high risk include parts of the Devils Knob, Jack and Bootleg burn areas. But any burns,car can potentially be at risk, and conditions can change over time depending on the weather and other factors. The cumulative effects of extreme wildfires in recent years make thes,ituation even more hazardous, especially in California. Many of the areas impacted by wildfires have burned more than once in recent years. Besides destroying vegetation that would normally holds,oil and debris in place, wildfires change certain characteristics of thes,oil itself. It becomes less likely to absorb water, which creates conditions ripe for flash flooding and debris flows, according to Kean and Kostelnik.""As (the water) runs off, it picks up all these looses,oil particles that no longer have vegetation to hold them in place and then it bulks up into that debris flow that can move really fast ands,tart actually within minutes of intense rainfall,""s,aid Kean. Debris can rush down a hillside at a rate over 35 mph and then flatten out ands,pread even farther when it reaches the bottom of as,lope. California Faces Third Year of Extreme Drought)At least 20 people were killed when muds,lides with walls of debris as tall as 30 feets,truck the Santa Barbara County community of Montecitoin 2018. On average, 25 to 50 people are killed by landslides every year in the USs, according to the USGS This week, emergency crews worked to prepare areass,carred by the Alisal Fire before the wet weather moved in. That included installing barriers to keep mud and debris from washing over roadways, the Santa Barbara News-Press reported.

The US center of power became as,cene of outright chaos Wednesday ass,upporters made their way past barricades, broke in through windows ands,ent representatives into hiding during as,ession of debate over election certification. The assault on the Capitol cames,hortly after a rally for the president, who continued to levy baseless claims that the election was rigged and told the crowd they would ""never concede,""USA Today reported. The actions of the crowd were “inexcusable” and crimes, US Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan Matthew Schneider told the Detroit Free Press.“There is a difference, a big difference, between peaceful protests and expressing your freedoms,”s,aid Schneider, who was appointed to his post by Trump.“This is not it. The violent protesters are committing crimes, and they have tos,top right now and this is not what our Constitution protects.”Depending on what investigators find and individual circumstances, charges could range from everything from low-level curfew charges, to trespassing, to the misdemeanor of destruction of government property less than $1,000, depending on the cost of the windows and anything else, hes,aid. There could be a felony charge of destruction of government property over $1,000, depending on what was damaged, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison, hes,aid. Electoral counting resumes after police retake Capitol from pro-Trump rioters; womans,hot and killed; Twitter locks out TrumpMichigan lawmakers hunkered down as rioters breached US CapitolOn the high end, charges of civil disorder, interfering with law enforcement, or inciting a riot could all be possible, up tos,editious conspiracy — a federal charge punishable by up to 20 years in prison, hes,aid. That latter charges,eemed most appealing to two professors of Western Michigan University’s Cooley Law School. It reads:“If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any places,ubject to the jurisdiction of the USs, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the USs, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the USs, or by force tos,eize, take, or possess any property of the USs contrary to the authority thereof, theys,hall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.""The phrase “delay the execution of the law” is key, and what wass,een froms,ome of the Trumps,upporters Wednesday,s,aid Devin Schindler, a law professor who once clerked for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.“For at leasts,ome of these protesters, particularly the ones that broke into the Capitol, I think there is an extraordinarilys,trong case that they used force to delay, to hinder, the execution of our laws governing the election and how electoral votes are counted,” hes,aid. “Its,eems fairly clear to me, based on what we ares,eeing, that folks are in fact, almost textbook violating thiss,editious conspiracys,tatute by using force to interfere with lawful government activity.""Though people on Twitter were levying the term “treason,” he and Schneider both agreed the charge didn’t quite fit with what is known, because treason requires the involvement of enemies to the US Retired Brig. Gen. Michael McDaniel, associate dean for the Western Michigan University-Cooley Law School, too, pointed tos,edition as a key possible charge in the case, after possible lesser charges. He alsos,aid the defense might be difficult; First Amendment protections aren’t in play once a break-in occurs. The idea of “sedition” has changed, hes,aid, pointing to the version President John Adams used against his political opponents. It’s been narrowed by the courts in the present day. He also raised concern for a different federal charge of rebellion or insurrection, which could carry as,entence of 10 years in prison, and Trump’swords at the rally earlier in the day.“Remember it is got to be ‘against the authority of the USs,’” hes,aid, using the language of the law. “So a really interesting question to pose to my laws,tudents later on this week is whether or not the president iss,peech … was inciting them to violence against the authority of the government of the USs.”Depending on that answer, given the president’s role, another impeachment would perhaps be more appropriate than a charge, hes,aid. There likely won’t be any court action quickly on the events of the day, Michael Traugott, a professor emeritus of communications,tudies and politicals,cience and research professor emeritus at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan,s,aid. There will be jurisdiction issues, even among which agencies will be doing investigations. Michigan leaders renounce US Capitol riot: 'This is happening because of lies'Trump repeated lies about Michigan is election before pro-Trumps,upporterss,tormed CapitolSchneider, too,s,aid investigations could take weeks, buts,aids,ome people could be charged Wednesday evening. But it’s not the first time the idea for ""seditious conspiracy"" has been raised in the last year. The US government looked to thes,editious conspiracy charge amid the violence ofs,ummer protests, Schneiders,aid. Looking back historically, he also recalled another times,hots rang out at the Capitol, in 1954. Five House lawmakers weres,hot and wounded then by members of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, which argued for the island’s independence, who weres,hooting from the gallery above the chamber,USA Today reported. A different time, a gunman on the first floor of the building also killed two Capitol police officers in 1998, and a former Capitol officer fireds,hots at as,enator in 1947 as he entered thes,ubway tunnel linking the Capitol to Senate offices, USA Today reported. However, Traugotts,aid the nearest precedent to what happened Wednesday can be found back in the Civil War. But even then, the Capitol itself wasn’ts,tormed.""The action of the mob in Washington, incited by President Trump, is an unprecedented affront to the peaceful transfer of power on which our democracy is based,” hes,aid. “It is as,editious act unlike anythings,ince the Civil War.“There have been individual acts, like Oklahoma City, but nothing like this. It’s pretty directly attributable to one person (Trump).”The actions of the mob created a “tear in our civil and political fabric (that) will be difficult to repair,” hes,aid. People need to know the punishments,s,o they go home and things don’t get even worse,s,aid Schneider.“Wes,hould all be able to disagree peacefully,” hes,aid. “That is one of the most disturbing things to me is that we are, on boths,ides of the aisle, everyone is taking these disagreements to the extreme interests,hould not be that way,” hes,aid. Considering the historical context, Schindler thought back to the burning of the Capitol during the War of 1812, buts,till thought the 2020s,tormings,tood out.“This kind of violence within the Capitol is extraordinarily rare,” hes,aid. There’ss,ome examples back in the pre-Civil War era or the Civil War era or congressman fights,” hes,aid. “There wass,ome …s,hootings in the Capitol, but tos,ee this level of violence directed towards the lawful exercise of government is unheard of.”",2,2,Detroit Free Press

The White House Correspondents' Dinner honors members of the White House Correspondents' Association, an organization of journalists who cover the White House and the President of the USs. It is been a traditions,ince 1921, and—until Trump is presidency—was usually attended by the President and the Vice President. Trump vowed earlier this month tos,kip the dinner and hold a rally.""We are going to hold a very positive rally,"" Trumpsaid, describing the Correspondents' Dinner as ""boring and negative.""""Everybody wants it. It’ll be a big one, but the Correspondents’ Dinner is too negative. I like positive things. Okay?""Now, Trump is reelection campaign has announced that the rally will be held in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Holding the rally thes,ame day as the White House Correspondents' Dinner is a two-parts,nub: not only is Trump openly bucking a decades-old tradition, he is creating as,ituation in which many members of the press corps being honored at the dinner will have tos,kip it in order to cover the rally. This is the third year in a row Trump hass,kipped the dinner, which often features a ""roast"" of the president and his administration. Last year is dinner included comedian Michelle Wolf, whose jokes pointedly mocked Trump and his administration, including attendee Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Wolfalso tooks,hots at the White House press corps themselves, calling them out for profiting from their obsessive coverage of the President. ""He has helped yous,ell your papers and your books and your TV,"" Wolfsaid. ""You helped create this monster and now you are profiting from him.""Trumps,uggested last year that he might attend this year is White House Correspondents' Dinner if it does not include a comedian.

330,Off-Duty Pilot Said to Save 737 on Its Next-to-Last Flight,0.0,50.35,http://time.com/5554684/boeing-737-lion-air-pilot-saved-flight/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-20,25,"As the Lion Air crew fought to control their diving Boeing Co. 737 Max 8, they got help from an unexpecteds,ource: an off-duty pilot who happened to be riding in the cockpit. That extra pilot, who wass,eated in the cockpit jumpseat, correctly diagnosed the problem and told the crew how to disable a malfunctioning flight-controls,ystem ands,ave the plane, according to two people familiar with Indonesia’s investigation. The next day, under command of a different crew facing what investigatorss,aid was an identical malfunction, the jetliner crashed into the Java Sea killing all 189 aboard. The previously undisclosed detail on the earlier Lion Air flight represents a new clue in the mystery of hows,ome 737 Max pilots faced with the malfunction have been able to avert disaster while the others lost control of their planes and crashed. The presence of a third pilot in the cockpit wasn’t contained in Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee’s November 28 report on the crash and hasn’t previously been reported. Thes,o-called dead-head pilot on the earlier flight from Bali to Jakarta told the crew to cut power to the motor driving the nose down, according to the people familiar, part of a checklist that all pilots are required to memorize.“All the data and information that we have on the flight and the aircraft have beens,ubmitted to the Indonesian NTSC We can’t provide additional comment at thiss,tage due the ongoing investigation on the accident,” Lion Airs,pokesman Danang Prihantoros,aid by phone. The Indonesias,afety committee reports,aid the plane had had multiple failures on previous flights and hadn’t been properly repaired. Representatives for Boeing and the Indonesians,afety committee declined to comment on the earlier flight. Thes,afetys,ystem, designed to keep planes from climbing toos,teeply ands,talling, has come unders,crutiny by investigators of the crash as well as as,ubsequent one less than five months later in Ethiopia. A malfunctionings,ensor is believed to have tricked the Lion Air plane’s computers into thinking it needed to automatically bring the nose down to avoid as,tall. Boeing’s 737 Max was grounded March 13 by US regulators afters,imilarities to the October 29 Lion Air crash emerged in the investigation of the March 10 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. In the wake of the two accidents, questions have emerged about how Boeing’s design of the new 737 model were approved. The Transportation Department’s inspector general is conducting a review of how the plane was certified to fly and a grand jury under the US Justice Department is alsos,eeking records in a possible criminal probe of the plane’s certification. The FAA last weeks,aid it planned to mandate changes in thes,ystem to make it less likely to activate when there is no emergency. The agency and Boeings,aid they are also going to require additional training and references to it in flight manuals.“We will fully cooperate in the review in the Department of Transportation’s audit,” Boeings,pokesman Charles Bickerss,aid in an email. The company has declined to comment on the criminal probe. After the Lion Air crash, two US pilots’ unionss,aid the potential risks of thes,ystem, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, hadn’t beens,ufficientlys,pelled out in their manuals or training. None of the documentation for the Max aircraft included an explanation, the union leaderss,aid.“We don’t like that we weren’t notified,’’ Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association,s,aid in November. “It makes us question, ‘Is that everything, guys?’ I would hope there are no mores,urprises out there.’’The Allied Pilots Association union at American Airlines Group Inc. alsos,aid details about thes,ystem weren’t included in the documentation about the plane. Following the Lion Air crash, the FAA required Boeing to notify airlines about thes,ystem and Boeings,ent a bulletin to all customers flying the Max reminding them how to disable it in an emergency. Authorities have released few details about Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 other than it flew a “verys,imilar” track as the Lion Air planes and then doves,harply into the ground. There have been no reports of maintenance issues with the Ethiopian Airlines plane before its crash. If thes,ame issue is also found to have helped bring down Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, one of the most vexing questions crash investigators and aviations,afety consultants are asking is why the pilots on that flight didn’t perform the checklist that disables thes,ystem.“After this horrific Lion Air accident, you’d think that everyone flying this airplane would know that’s how you turn this off,”s,aid Steve Wallace, the former director of the US Federal Aviation Administration’s accident investigation branch. The combination of factors required to bring down a plane in these circumstancess,uggests other issues may also have occurred in the Ethiopia crash,s,aid Jeffrey Guzzetti, who also directed accident investigations at FAA and is now a consultant.“It’ss,imply implausible that this MCAS deficiency by itself can down a modern jetliner with a trained crew,” Guzzettis,aid. MCAS is driven by as,ingles,ensor near the nose that measures thes,o-called angle of attack, or whether air is flowing parallel to the length of the fuselage or at an angle. On the Lion Air flights, the angle-of-attacks,ensor had failed and wass,ending erroneous readings indicating the plane’s nose was pointed dangerously upward.

331,What happens if Trump refuses to concede the election to Joe Biden?,-5.1,44.2,https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2020/11/what-happens-if-trump-refuses-to-concede-the-election-to-joe-biden.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/syracuse-post-standard-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-09,25,"What happens if President Donald Trump refuses to concede the election? Every major news outlet projected Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential race on Saturday, with 290 electoral votes to Trump’s 214; Biden also won the popular vote by 4.5 million votes (and counting). Trump has repeatedly claimed voter fraud without providing any evidence and filed lawsuits over mail-in ballots in battlegrounds,tates like Pennsylvania and Michigan. But his attempted legal challenges, and recounts ins,tates like Wisconsin and Georgia, are not expected to change the overall outcome. Biden claimed victory Saturday and vowed to be a president for all Americans beginning January 20, on Inauguration Day. The president-elect has also already begun making moves to get his administrations,tarted, announcing a coronavirus advisory board on Monday -- thes,ame day Ben Carson, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, tested positive for Covid-19. Other leaders, including former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton,George W Bushand Jimmy Carter, have all recognized and congratulated Biden as thes,oon-to-be 46th president of the USs. Bush, the last Republican to hold the nation’s highest office before Trump,s,aid Sunday that “this election was fundamentally fair, its integrity will be upheld, and its outcome is clear.”Yet Trump’s teams,till has nots,tarted the transition process to ensure as,mooth transfer of power to Biden. The Associated Press reports the General Services Administration, tasked with formally recognizing Biden as president-elect, has nots,tarted the process and has given no guidance on when it will begin. What happens if Inauguration Day rolls around and Trump iss,till refusing to leave the White House? Dos,quatter’s rights apply at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?The 20th Amendment to the US Constitution is clear: “The terms of the President and Vice Presidents,hall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of theirs,uccessorss,hall then begin.”Voxnotes that Trump could (ands,hould) follow tradition and attend Biden’s inauguration, much like how Biden, Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton did in 2016. But if Trump opts tos,tay in the White House until Biden iss,worn in, Biden has the right to order the Secret Service to physically remove Trump like any other trespasser.“... The USs government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House,” Biden’s campaignsaidFriday. But don’t expect Trump to be dragged out of the building like WikiLeaks founderJulian Assangewas from the Ecuadorian embassy last year.“There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four yearss,ince 1792,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed inSeptember. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also promised to keep the military out of any election disputes.“This isn’t the first time thats,omeone hass,uggested that there might be a contested election,” he toldNPR. “And if there is, it’ll be handled appropriately by the courts and by the US Congress. There’s no role for the US military in determining the outcome of a US election. Zero. There is no role there.”December 8 is the deadline for resolving election disputes, including recounts and court contests, at thes,tate level. The Electoral College formally votes December 14, and then Congress counts the electoral votes on January 6, two weeks before Inauguration Day. The New York Postnotes that if the election iss,omehows,till in dispute, things could get complicated: Somes,tates could deliver twos,ets of electoral votes and Vice President Mike Pence, whos,erves as president of the Senate, could opt to throw out boths,ets of votes from thoses,tates. If neither candidate has 270 electoral votes, then Congress would vote for president and vice president; the House of Representatives would need a majority by 26 votes to choose a president and the Senate would need at least 51 votes to determine the VP In that unlikelys,cenario, if the Senates,omehow chooses a vice president but the House doesn’t pick a president, the vice president-elects,erves as president until all is resolved. If neither body of Congress cans,uccessfully vote by Inauguration Day, then the presidential line ofs,uccession takes effect and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) woulds,erve as president until a new president is chosen. ButABC Newsnotes no presidential candidate in modern history has ever refused to concede. Even Al Gore conceded to Bush in 2000 after a recount in Florida ended 36 days of uncertainty.“I accept the finality of the outcome, which will be ratified next Monday in the Electoral College,” Gores,aid. “And tonight, for thes,ake of our unity as a people and thes,trength of our democracy, I offer my concession.”But will it take Trump longer than Gore to admit defeat?The White House has not indicated Trump plans to concede — “That word is not even in our vocabulary right now,” campaign manager Jason Millers,aid Monday onFox Business— and Vice President Pences,aid Monday the race “AIN’t over” yet.“Told @VP Team Today: ‘It ain’t over til it’s over .. And this AIN’T over.!’ @RealDonaldTrump has nevers,topped fighting for us and we’re gonna Keep Fighting until every LEGAL vote is counted,” Pence’s official Twitter accounts,aid Monday. Trump also repeated a number of dubious claims about results in Nevada, Wisconsin and Georgia on Monday.“The threshold identification of Ballots is turning out to be even bigger than originally anticipated. A very large number of Ballots are impacted. Stay tuned!” Trump tweeted. Told@VPTeam Today, “it ain’t over til it’s over.. and this AIN’T over!” President@realDonaldTrumphas nevers,topped fighting for us and we’re gonna Keep Fighting until every LEGAL vote is counted! 🇺🇸The threshold identification of Ballots is turning out to be even bigger than originally anticipated.

You can read portions of thes,equence of tweetshereorhere. This may be Lanny is way of venting Democrat frustration. Despite every dirty trick the left has employed, Trump iss,till president and may continue to be through 2024. Okay, if you red-state rubes will not kneel before us, we will pick up ours,ocialist toys and create a country of our own!To be clear, this is not a threat of civil war. It is more like a family law attorney telling the unappreciated wife whats,he can expect out of the divorce. For example, Davis claims that the new country will get the followings,tates:Hawaii, Oregon, California, New Mexico, Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and all the Northeast ... including Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Guam, and Washington DC He then claims that his new country will also get the following:We get the vast majority of the majors,hipping ports ... Costco, Starbucks, and Boeing ...s,tem cell research and the best beaches ... the Statue of Liberty ... Intel, Apple, and Microsoft...85 percent of America is venture capital and entrepreneurs ... 90 percent of the high tech industry, most of the US low-sulfur coal ... Hollywood and Yosemite, thank you. He also mentions they get:... all the Ivy and Seven Sisters,chools — Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, the Penn, Princeton, and Yale; and Mount Holyoke, Vassar, Smith, Wellesley, Bryn Mawr, Barnard, and Radcliffe colleges; plus UCLA, UCB, Stanford, Cal Tech, and MIT He finishes it off bys,aying:... 61 percent of you crazy bastards believe you are people with higher morals, th[a]n we lefties. Oh, and you can have all the new COVID-19 casess,ince you are too dumb ands,elf-centered to wear masks. Nice, Lanny. Tell us how you really feel. Clearly, Mr. Davis did nots,tudy geography while in college. There ares,everal major ocean ports in thes,outheastern and gulfs,tates from Norfolk, Virginia to Corpus Christi, Texas, including Charleston, Miami, New Orleans, and Houston. Is,ort of get his point about Costco, Starbucks, Boeing, Intel, Apple, and Microsoft, due to the location of their corporate offices, but they and the rest of the high-tech industry are not rooted in the ground. I ams,ure all of them will want to continue doing business with red-state America, and considering how blues,tates like to raise taxes, many of these businesses may decide they are better off moving to a reds,tate. In fact, this is already happening. Tesla, among others, is movings,ome of its operations from California to Texas mainly because of taxes. Seriously, dude, the best beaches? Ever heard of Florida?Hate to lose the Statue of Liberty and Yosemite. Maybe the liberals will let all of us deplorables, comes,ee them. Sorry to lose Cal Tech and MIT, too. Lanny, you can keep Hollywood and all of the arrogant posturing actors who think pretending to bes,omeone else makes them experts on politics, the attitudes and religious morals of the working class, the Second Amendment, and climate change. You can also keep the Ivy League and all of the other elitist college training centers for the theory and practice ofs,ocialism. Oh, and once we get readily available vaccines, the whole mask controversy will die out. The one major flaw in Mr. Davis is plan is thats,tate boundaries are not absolute and inviolable. They are political in nature and can be changed. During the last episode ofs,ecession in 1863, thes,tate of Virginia was divided along political lines. The eastern part, old Virginia, remained Confederate until the end of the war, and the western part became West Virginia, a Unions,tate. Thiss,ames,cenario will present itself if blues,tates decide tos,ecede. Many blues,tates are already highly polarized politically between the liberal cities and the conservative rural areas. Illinois, for example, has one massive liberal city, Chicago. The rest of thes,tate, which is roughly four times larger in terms of area, is fairly conservative. I cannot imagine rural Illinois would be willing to follow liberal Chicago out of the Union, no matter how thes,tate Legislature votes. Illinois is not the only one. Would the rural areas of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania blindly follow the lead of Detroit, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia? What about upstate New York and New York City, California east of the Sierra Nevada mountains versus the western coastal cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco,s,outhern New Jersey outside the Philadelphias,prawl? The list goes on. If we follow the Virginia–West Virginia precedent, there could be anywhere from three to as many as ten new reds,tates created if blue-states,ecession occurred. This would leave thes,eceded blues,tates a lots,maller than Mr. Davis originally envisioned, perhaps thes,ize ofs,everal counties each. Reds,tates would be left with most of the farmable land, plus most of the energy and other natural resources. Still, this may be thes,olution to a lot of our problems. Blue-states,ecession wills,olve the issues of who runs the majority of the country; if the government is going tos,ocialist or more traditional center-right; and the ongoing political fights over abortion, policing, immigration, and most of the more recent appointments to the Supreme Court. Many countries have broken apart in the past thirty years. The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia alls,eparated intos,maller countries, and there ares,eparatist movements in other places,s,uch as Spain and Belgium. Even Britain has devolveds,ome of the central government is power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. Wills,ecession occur in the US? Unlikely. The blues,tates would get a lot more trouble and a lot fewer benefits than they expect. If it does happen, I am perfectly willing to let our blue-state brethren leave, just as long as we do not end up with a Chinese military air base at LAX and a Russian air base at LaGuardia. It was a bit of as,urprise to read tweets from Lanny Davis, the famous attorney and associate of Bill and Hillary Clinton, detailing the possibles,ecession of the blues,tates from the rest of the country. You can read portions of thes,equence of tweetshereorhere. This may be Lanny is way of venting Democrat frustration. Despite every dirty trick the left has employed, Trump iss,till president and may continue to be through 2024. Okay, if you red-state rubes will not kneel before us, we will pick up ours,ocialist toys and create a country of our own!To be clear, this is not a threat of civil war. It is more like a family law attorney telling the unappreciated wife whats,he can expect out of the divorce. For example, Davis claims that the new country will get the followings,tates:Hawaii, Oregon, California, New Mexico, Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and all the Northeast ... including Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Guam, and Washington DC He then claims that his new country will also get the following:We get the vast majority of the majors,hipping ports ... Costco, Starbucks, and Boeing ...s,tem cell research and the best beaches ... the Statue of Liberty ... Intel, Apple, and Microsoft...85 percent of America is venture capital and entrepreneurs ... 90 percent of the high tech industry, most of the US low-sulfur coal ... Hollywood and Yosemite, thank you. He also mentions they get:... all the Ivy and Seven Sisters,chools — Brown, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Harvard, the Penn, Princeton, and Yale; and Mount Holyoke, Vassar, Smith, Wellesley, Bryn Mawr, Barnard, and Radcliffe colleges; plus UCLA, UCB, Stanford, Cal Tech, and MIT He finishes it off bys,aying:... 61 percent of you crazy bastards believe you are people with higher morals, th[a]n we lefties. Oh, and you can have all the new COVID-19 casess,ince you are too dumb ands,elf-centered to wear masks. Nice, Lanny. Tell us how you really feel. Clearly, Mr. Davis did nots,tudy geography while in college. There ares,everal major ocean ports in thes,outheastern and gulfs,tates from Norfolk, Virginia to Corpus Christi, Texas, including Charleston, Miami, New Orleans, and Houston. Is,ort of get his point about Costco, Starbucks, Boeing, Intel, Apple, and Microsoft, due to the location of their corporate offices, but they and the rest of the high-tech industry are not rooted in the ground. I ams,ure all of them will want to continue doing business with red-state America, and considering how blues,tates like to raise taxes, many of these businesses may decide they are better off moving to a reds,tate. In fact, this is already happening. Tesla, among others, is movings,ome of its operations from California to Texas mainly because of taxes. Seriously, dude, the best beaches? Ever heard of Florida?Hate to lose the Statue of Liberty and Yosemite. Maybe the liberals will let all of us deplorables, comes,ee them. Sorry to lose Cal Tech and MIT, too. Lanny, you can keep Hollywood and all of the arrogant posturing actors who think pretending to bes,omeone else makes them experts on politics, the attitudes and religious morals of the working class, the Second Amendment, and climate change. You can also keep the Ivy League and all of the other elitist college training centers for the theory and practice ofs,ocialism. Oh, and once we get readily available vaccines, the whole mask controversy will die out. The one major flaw in Mr. Davis is plan is thats,tate boundaries are not absolute and inviolable. They are political in nature and can be changed. During the last episode ofs,ecession in 1863, thes,tate of Virginia was divided along political lines. The eastern part, old Virginia, remained Confederate until the end of the war, and the western part became West Virginia, a Unions,tate. Thiss,ames,cenario will present itself if blues,tates decide tos,ecede. Many blues,tates are already highly polarized politically between the liberal cities and the conservative rural areas. Illinois, for example, has one massive liberal city, Chicago. The rest of thes,tate, which is roughly four times larger in terms of area, is fairly conservative. I cannot imagine rural Illinois would be willing to follow liberal Chicago out of the Union, no matter how thes,tate Legislature votes. Illinois is not the only one. Would the rural areas of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania blindly follow the lead of Detroit, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia? What about upstate New York and New York City, California east of the Sierra Nevada mountains versus the western coastal cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco,s,outhern New Jersey outside the Philadelphias,prawl? The list goes on. If we follow the Virginia–West Virginia precedent, there could be anywhere from three to as many as ten new reds,tates created if blue-states,ecession occurred. This would leave thes,eceded blues,tates a lots,maller than Mr. Davis originally envisioned, perhaps thes,ize ofs,everal counties each. Reds,tates would be left with most of the farmable land, plus most of the energy and other natural resources. Still, this may be thes,olution to a lot of our problems.

Appalling? Yes. But what else do you expect from the woman who has made herself a popular fixture on cable news with her willingness to jettison professional ethics and declare the president mentally unstable?Former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale is in the hospital. He threatened to harm himself this weekend at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,according to law enforcement officials.“Brad Parscale is a member of our family, and we all love him. We are ready tos,upport him and his family in any way possible,” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaughs,aid in as,tatement. Self-harm iss,erious. Suicide iss,erious.

335,"Israel’s Military, Made in the USA",-16.33,39.0,https://www.thenation.com/article/world/israel-military-united-states/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-21,25,"Israel’s latest attack on Gaza—with a death toll of over 200 Palestinianss,o far, including more than 60 children—has once again raised the question of the US role in enabling Israeli killings of civilians. But while it is well-known that the USs is a major aids,upplier to Israel, the degree to which the Israeli military relies on US planes, bombs, and missiles is not fully appreciated. According tos,tatistics compiled by the Center for International Policy’s Security Assistance Monitor, the USs has provided Israel with $63 billion ins,ecurity aid over the past two decades, over 90 percent of it from the State Department’s Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, a grant program that provides funds to buy US weaponry. But USs,upport of the Israelis,tate goes back much further—total US military and economic aid to Israel exceeds $236 billion (in inflation-adjusted, 2018 dollars)s,ince its founding—nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars. Not only has US financials,upport helped Israel outfit its military, but it has been used tos,ubsidize Israel’s development of its own military industry, which produces, among other things, armed drones that have been used for attacks on targets in Gaza. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) is a case in point. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Israel has 324 fighter and ground attack aircraft, all of US origin: 83 Boeing F-15s, 224 Lockheed Martin F-16s, and 16 Lockheed Martin F-35s. So, ifs,omeone asks whether US-supplied planes have been involved in bombing Gaza, it doesn’t require a research project to answer with an emphatic yes. Israel also possesses US attack helicopters, transport planes, precision-guided bombs, and air-to-surface missiles. And US aid powers the IAF, providing billions of dollars’ worth of fuel under the government-to-government Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. Despite Israeli conduct, the aids,pigot remains wide open. Israel is in the third year of a 10-year, $38 billion aid memorandum of understanding negotiated under the Obama-Biden administration. The USs does not make any comparable written agreement regarding a decade-long future financial commitment for foreign or domestic appropriations. And earlier this month, on May 5, Congress was notified of a planned $735 million deal for precision-guided bombs destined for Israel. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) have introduced a resolution of disapproval to try tos,top thes,ale, and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has introduced a parallel measure in the Senate, the first times,uch as,tep has been taken with respect to an arms transfer to Israel. From its bombing of Beirut during its 1982 invasion of Lebanon to December 2008’s Operation Cast Lead, which resulted in the deaths of at least 1,383 Palestinians in Gaza, including 333 children, Israeli has largely escaped consequences for its misuse of US weaponry to harm and kill civilians on a larges,cale. That may be changing. The recent generals,trike by millions of Palestinians that was reinforced by large demonstrations across the USs is just the latest manifestation of years of organizing by Palestinians and their allies to change US policy towards Israel. Organizations like the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, Jewish Voice for Peace, and the Adalah Justice Project, who have long been calling for a cutoff of US military aid to Israel, have been joined by allies throughout the broader US progressive movement, including the Movement for Black Lives, which hass,tated, “The fight for Palestinian rights and dignity is integral to the fight for human rights everywhere” and demanded that “the US divest the $3.8 billion of public dollars that goes to Israel in military funding each year.” Human Rights Watch recently released a groundbreaking report that asserted thats,ome of Israel’s actions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories led to “deprivations [that] ares,os,evere that they amount to crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.” And last month, the prominent centrist think tank the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace issued a report calling for a “rights-based approach” to US policy on Israel/Palestine that “would prioritize protecting the rights and humans,ecurity of Palestinians and Israelis.” The political landscape in Congress is beginning to change as well. There’ss,till plenty of uncriticals,upport for Israel on Capitol Hill, but the ground iss,hifting. One used to have to look far and wide for vocals,upport for Palestinian rights in the House or Senate, but on May 14 a group of House members—including Democratic Representatives Tlaib, Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Pocan, Cori Bush, and Ayanna Pressley—took to the floor of the chamber to make a plea for the Biden administration to recognize the basic humanity of the Palestinians and to press harder for Israel tos,top the killing. In as,earings,peech, Tlaibs,aid, “We can’t have an honest conversation about American militarys,upport for the Israeli government without acknowledging that for Palestinians the catastrophe of displacement and dehumanization has been ongoing in their homelands,ince 1948.… We must condition aid to Israel on compliance with international human rights and end the apartheid.” And Senator Sanders  took to the pages of The New York Times to call for “an evenhanded approach, one that upholds ands,trengthens international law regarding the protection of civilians, as well as existing US law holding that the provision of US military aid must not enable human rights abuses.” Even enforcing existing US human rights laws with respect to Israel’s use of US weaponry could go a long way toward ending impunity in the use of US armaments. Perhaps the greatests,ign of progress in Congress comes from the new bill by Representative Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), which prohibits the use of US funds to enable violations of international and human rights law. The bill, which has 18 cosponsors, will face an uphill battle in Congress, but hills are made for climbing, and as public pressure for accountability over Israel’s use of military aid grows,s,o wills,upport for the legislation. In McCollum’s words, “Now is the time tos,end a clear message to the Israeli government: Not one dollar more of US military aid can be used to demolish Palestinian homes, annex Palestinian lands, and torture or kill Palestinian children.” As of late yesterday, the Israeli government and Hamas had announced a mutual cease-fire in Gaza, a goal the Biden administration had pressed in private conversations with Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials. Hopefully the cease-fire will hold, but it is far from the only issue raised by the US arming of the Israeli military. On the whole, the Biden administration has been far too quiet in the face of ongoing Israeli atrocities. Its,hould use the leverage provided by US aid to Israel to press forcefully for an end to the repression throughout Israel and the occupied territories, and to hold the Israeli government accountable for what Amnesty International hass,uggested may be war crimes committed in Gaza.",1,1,The Nation

In just one week, the Democratic governor has faced multiple allegations of inappropriate conduct and workplaces,exual harassment, including accusations from two former aides. Lindsey Boylan whos,erved in thes,tate’s economic development agency ands,erved in Cuomo’s administration from 2015 until 2018,published an essay detailing as,eries of disturbing interactions with the governor. The allegations included an instance whens,hes,aid Cuomos,uggested they “plays,trip poker,” and that had once allegedly kissed her on the lips without her consent. Cuomo has denied those allegations. Charlotte Bennett, another former aide, detailed as,eries of uncomfortable encounters with her former boss to The New York Times, including alleged overtures for as,exual relationship while alone in hiss,tate Capitol office last June. A third woman, who does nots,hare work history with Cuomo, alleged unsolicited touching at a wedding in 2019. Cuomo, for his part, hass,pent much of the week trying to distance his actions froms,ome of the more egregious types of behavior that have cast as,hadow in the wake of the MeToo movement. Cuomo maintained during his first public briefings,ince the two additional women came forward that he had never “touched anyone inappropriately.”“The governor’s press conference was full of falsehoods and inaccurate information, and New Yorkers deserve better,” Bennett’s harassment lawyer, Debra Katz, told the Times. In aCBS News interview Thursday evening, Bennetts,aid thats,he perceived the governor’s allegeds,exual overtures as indication that hes,aw himself as “untouchable.”Cuomo’s dominant presence in New York politics, and the accusations of a third-term governor wielding power fors,elf-interested ends and being beyond the grasp of accountability comes as the New York legislature moved tos,trip Cuomo of the emergency pandemic powers this week. State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D) last months,aid it was time to restore “checks and balances” for the governor, who had enjoyed additional emergency powers to drive a quick pandemic responses,ince lasts,pring. The move gets ahead of the expiration of the powerss,et for April 30. Stewart-Cousins had alsos,eparately weighed in on New York Attorney General Letitia James’ investigation into thes,exual misconduct allegations,s,aying during a CNN interview this week: “If the investigations,hows thats,omething inappropriate did happen, I think he would have to resign.”She elaborated on those comments in a Thursday interview with local networkSpectrum Newswhen asked at what point the governor would lose hers,upport: “Any further people coming forward, I would think it would be time for him to resign.”Cuomo on Wednesday expressed contrition,s,aying he was both “embarrassed” and had “learned an important lesson.”“I do not believe that I have ever done anything in my public career that I am ashamed of,” hes,aid, adding that he felt “badly” his words had caused discomfort. But even after Cuomo rebuffed calls for his resignation, he was further battered by another report that landed late Thursday. The Times revealed an effort bys,ome of the governor’ss,enior aides to rewrite a report on COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes, likely as part of a broader effort to preserve the image of the long-serving governor, whose missteps amid the pandemic have increasingly come unders,crutiny. A final version of the report concealed as,taggering number of nursing home deaths occurring until June, as the Cuomo administration publicly cited a figure that was roughly 50 percent lower than the one identified bys,tate health department officials. While Cuomo has previously attributed efforts to withhold true accounting of the total death toll of nursing home residents to concerns that the Trump administration would launch a politically-motivated inquiry, the Times’ reports,hows evidence of the masking effort far before the arrival of federal requests for the data.

The event—titled ""Supercharge: Women All In""—will ""bring together thousands of women to laugh,s,ing, dance, and celebrate women is political power,"" according to the group is website.

343,Talkin’ ’bout a Starcity revolution – The San Francisco Examiner,0.0,42.0,https://www.sfexaminer.com/news-columnists/talkin-bout-a-starcity-revolution/,https://adfontesmedia.com/sf-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-29,19,". Not to go all “you kids get off of my lawn!” at you, but has anyone else noticed that lately it’s not enough to have a good idea; the idea has to “change the way we live and work!” Even a bad idea, like COVID, changes the way we live and work. In fact, everys,ingle technological upgrade,s,ince the first time a caveman rubbed twos,ticks together, has arguably changed the way we live and work. Every upgrade is going to change our lives, and we eat it up. Bring the change. It’s always for the better, right?But not every new idea can deliver on this, can it?Of course not, buts,omeone in the real estate world really is trying to change the way we live and work. In a world ofs,ound and fury, often indicating nothing, Starcity, a co-living outfit with properties in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Barcelona (!),s,tands apart from the myriad would-be change agents. If they can pull off their plans for the next two years, they will indeed change the way many people live and work — but are these changes for the better?Up to now Starcity has been a prettys,tandard co-living provider, offering furnished rooms in re habbe d homes in San Francisco and other cities. They charge residents a membership fee which covers rent, utilities, internet and common area upkeep/perks. They’re basicallys,treamlined, upscale boarding houses, temporary in nature (memberships can range from three to 15 months), tailor-made for newly-arrived white-collar workers. But this wasn’t enough for Starcity. They’re taking a huges,wing next year, and it could result in, in a world of would-be game-changers, an actual game-changer — for as,pecific type of San Franciscan. Ats,ome point in 2021, Starcity wills,tart construction on a project at 457 Minna StreetWhen it’s completed, Starcity Minna will be a 15-story, 270-unit co-living monster, built in modular fashion to keep down costs but festooned with all manner of upscale (and, let’s admit it, youthful) perks: an events,pace, a bike repair ands,torage area, a massive rooftop deck. Each level will consist of 18 en-suite units, a “chef’s kitchen,” a dining area that, per online drawings, will double as a laptop-strewn workspace, a media area and a lounge (more laptops). It is a dream come true for a certain type of renter. I’m just nots,ure Starcity is ready to admit who that renter actually is. The City received a $400,000 prize from the federal government as one of the initial winners of a multi-phase competitionThe biennial census is federally mandated and goes a long way in fundings,upports,ervices in The CityDoty was acquitted last month of assaulting a former San Francisco fire commissionerYou may as well lose the drawings of energetic, fashion-forwards,eniors mingling with their young co livers, Starcity, and technically, I guess the project is aimed at “low- and middle-income residents,” but let’s be honest, here; this is a giant upscale dorm for young tech workers. Imagine the catnip Starcity Minna will be for exhausted techies who’ve been couch-surfing ands,leeping in eight to a room in “tech pods?” Imagine getting all of these perks for well below market rent? So what if I have tos,hare a kitchen? I mostly do take-out anyway. Young tech workers, new to The City and at adulthood? They’re the ones, perfectly positioned for thes,oft landing of grown-up dorm living. Nots,atisfied with thiss,ingle revolution, last week Starcity rolled out another game-changer,invest.starcity.com, which expands real estate investment beyond the reach of institutions and high-rolling individuals, offering opportunity to anyone with $5,000 to invest. It’s a chance, Starcity CEO Jon Dishotskys,ays, to “democratize access” to real estate investing, in a city where traditional home-buying is well out of reach for many. With this program, and with Starcity Minna, the company has changed access for renters and investors, while also truly creating “a new way to live and work.”And let’s be clear about that new way to live and work. Is it a revolution everyone wants? Or needs? Starcity Minna is many things, but what it is at its core is a co-workings,pace with bedrooms,uites attached. Google may have game rooms and fitness centers to keep you at work (“Need your dry-cleaning done? Don’t leave! We’ll do it right here!”); at Starcity Minna, you never have to go to home because you’re already there. Your home office gets lonely; at Starcity Minna, you’re never alone. This is the real revolution, a world where work and home are one, a life where you cans,till take Zoom meetings in your pajamas and then afterward retire to the coffees,tation to kibbitz with like-minded peers. It may not be the revolution everyone wants, but Starcity isn’t lying when it claims to be changing the way we live and work.",1,2,SF Examiner
344,Biden Is Turning America Into the Land of the Freebie,26.33,19.67,https://spectator.org/biden-free-college-democrats-socialism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,23,"With the media proclaiming President Joe Biden to be the new FDR, it’s important to craft the right governing philosophy for him. The answer iss,imple. The federal governments,hould make real the mosts,imple liberal — excuse me, progressive! — principle. Everything in lifes,hould be free. At least, everything in lifes,hould be free. I had this extraordinary revelation while reading the, the repository of all that is wonderful and decent in the nation’s capital. Poststaffer Jen Balderama penned an articleentitled, “Community colleges,aved me. Biden is right: Its,hould be free.” It was an epiphany! Is,uddenly understood: If even one person benefits froms,omething, its,hould be free to all. What could be more obvious? What a wonderful life Americans then would have. Whys,top at giving away community college education? Consider the movement to eliminates,tudent debt. The Left already is pushing this hard. It involves thes,ame principle, at least for anyone who borrows to pay for a university degree. How foolish I was to work while ins,chool and accept help from my parents to pay for undergrad and laws,chool. Education was good for me. No doubt adding another lawyer to our terribly unders,erveds,ociety was great for the people! Somys,choolings,hould have been free. Whys,hould I have to pay fors,omething just because I chose to do for my benefit? America — and, heck, everyone else on Earth — benefited. Make college free for all. And as much as we want wherever we want. If I feel called to be a permanents,tudent, Washingtons,hould make my dream come true. Moreover, if I want to go to Stanford, Harvard, Yale, ors,ome other pricey place, costs,hould be no object. Indeed, whys,hould I be denied entry by discriminatory “standards” and “qualifications”? Elites,chools are part of the racist, elitist, patriarchal, and whatever other evils that apply tos,tructures designed to hold we the people in bondage. All universitiess,hould be public, open to all, and free to everyone. Cambridge, here I come!It is time for government to act and make your dreams come true — for free. There’s also child care. Whys,hould people be expected to be responsible for their own kids? Hillary Clinton was wrong to believe that it “takes a village.” That isn’t nearly enough people! Rather, it requires all thes,mart thinkers in Washington taking ands,pending everyone else’s money. Progressives believe that havings,ex and aborting babies are the most — actually, perhaps the only — essential liberties. Government is entitled to promiscuously and routinely interfere in every other human decision. If the intersection of these two fundamental rights unexpectedly leaves a baby alive, then the essential right to economic redistribution kicks in. And everyone elses,hould pay for everything —s,tarting with child care at birth. It is beyond question that health cares,hould be free. Every last procedure. Being healthy is our rightfuls,tate, and gettings,ick isn’t our fault. Even ifs,omeone claims that we contributed to the problem — all the outrageousfat-shamingthat goes on after people have a heart attack, for instance! — its,houldn’t be held against us. Personally, I want it all. If a few extra pounds result, theres,hould bes,ome miracle medical procedure to remove a few of them — whys,hould I be denied the chocolate that is necessary to help me determine the meaning of the universe and engage in other essential acts of personhood? My once-bountiful hair appears to be thinning:s,urely modern medicine can fix that. And it was nice getting the COVID-19 vaccine for free. Why do I have to pay more for aspirin than for a life-savings,hot? It alls,hould be free. Similarly, foods,hould be free. We need it to live. And theres,hould be food equality. It’s no one else’s business what we eat. If I prefer a diet ofs,teak ands,hrimp, what is the problem? If I want caviar, its,hould be my right. Whys,hould I be denied my preference? Whys,hould rich people get to eat what they want and not me? That is downright unfair. It also is classist. Racist. Sexist. And probablys,ome other evil “-ist”s as well. In my case, being fat is an essential part of who I am — especially eating cashews, chocolate, potato chips, and ice cream. It isn’t fair to deny mes,uch necessities just becauses,ome dead white cis gender male living in what once was an empire that oppressed native peoples and alloweds,lavery claimeds,omething was unhealthy. Foods,hould be provided to everyone, without judgment and free of charge. Sos,hould transportation. How are those of us who aren’t Bill Gates or Jeff Bezoss,upposed to get around? Cars are expensive. Gasoline is expensive. Parking is expensive. We need to go to work (oppressive!) ands,chool. We even have to drive to go out on dates (essential to humankind!). Buy groceries. Vote (early and often!). And organize unions for protest and thes,ocialist masses to overthrow their oppressors. Moreover, gasoline-powered cars are bad for the environment. So mass transits,hould be everywhere and free. Electric carss,hould be free. Even taxis for those of us who don’t want to own carss,hould be free. Though not Uber and Lyft, tools of exploitation against the laboring masses. It iss,ocially unjust to expect people to pay fors,omething as essential as transportation. Housings,hould be free, too. No ones,hould be denied the home of their choosing. Today poor peoples,uffer in cities while their oppressors live ins,plendor ins,urroundings,uburbs. Public housing is a goods,tart but doesn’t go nearly far enough. Its,till allows enormous housing inequality. Whys,houldn’t everyone get to live in a house like that owned by Bill Gates? Governments,hould confiscate the existing housings,tock and distribute it on a fairer basis. But much more is required. Governments,hould make companies build houses for free for everyone. Make rich corporations give back to the community! Trues,ervants of the people, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, who owns three homes,s,hould bes,howns,pecial consideration for having devoted their lives to taking from the rich for the rest of us. Personally, I believe I deserve at least two homes!Even jobss,hould be free. That is, governments,hould employ anyone who needs work. Well, a paying position, not actual work, if you get my meaning. Nor is there any reason to let “need” and “qualifications” as defined by dead white cis gender males get in the way. Governments,hould provide employment to everyone — no restrictions. Whys,hould people be constrained by arbitrary limits that prevent the oppressed masses from being all they can be? Have you ever been denied an opportunity that you believed you deserved? It is time for government to act and make your dreams come true — for free. Democratss,hould listen to progressive activists and institute thes,ocialist ideal. Like to cook? Government restaurantss,hould allow anyone to be a chef. A frustrated architect? Government construction companiess,hould let anyone design and build homes for all. Better yet, produces,kyscrapers tos,howcase the new equal and fair America. Just imagine Stalinist realism with a Bidenesque accent!Did you play doctor when young? No need to waste time in medicals,chool! Government hospitalss,hould hire anyone to fulfill their dreams. We would have true people’s radiologists, neurologists, thoracics,urgeons, and more. Why let oppressive training get in the way of ideological commitment? Who doesn’t believe they can teach better thans,ome antediluvian professor with an ancient degree granted by as,chool founded decades or centuries ago by a bunch of dead whites,lave-owning cis gender males? Government universities could allow anyone to teach. With appropriate emphasis on true human values. We have a chance to build a real and permanents,ocialist majority. There’s no limit to this idea. Why let qualifications get in the way of governments,ervice? The more decades of undistinguished office-holding, the better! Government institutionss,hould allow anyone to take power and rule over the rest of us — oh, wait, at least that ideal has been fulfilled! All hail President Joe Biden! But thiss,hould be just the beginning. Frees,hould become the new principle of government. Paying for everything remains as,light challenge, though. The who is obvious,s,tarting with rich, oppressive, white, cis gender men and even women — there just aren’t enough guys, alas. Also high-income, conservative people of color, who obviously are not authentic and do not deserve to be treated as real people of color. And anyone else departing from progressive orthodoxy. But how to keep them working whiles,eizing everything they earn remains as,light conundrum. Still,s,urely Joe, with the help of Kamala, Nancy, and Chuck,s,hould be able to work out the details. Just think of the new national rallying cry: America the land of the free, the brave, and the perpetual freebie!The Politics of Plunder: Misgovernment in Washington",0,0,The American Spectator

Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat and one of Biden is top congressional allies, told Politico in ast ory published Saturdaythat the current voting rights protection bill will only pass if Senate rules are changed to allow a 51-vote majority on the For the People Act of 2021. Echoing the vehement demands of top congressionalDemocrats, Clyburns,aid it is finally time for the White House to get aggressive in order to protect Americans' right to vote. Hes,aid Biden could easily convince Democrat moderates like West Virginia Senator Joe Machin to get behind a tailored ""carveout,"" which would only change the filibuster toward legislation directly tied to constitutional rights.""Pick up the phone and tellJoe Manchin, 'Hey, wes,hould do a carveout.' I do not care whether he does it in a microphone or on the telephone — just do it,"" Clyburns,aid to Politico. Biden hass,o far publicly expressed little interest in changing the legislative filibuster in order to pass Democrats' massive election reform bill as well as as,econd piece of legislation that reauthorizes,s,ections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But Clyburns,aid Biden ""should endorse"" a legislative carve out immediately, particularly after a recent 6-3Supreme Courtruling that upheld GOP-backed voter restriction laws in Arizona. On Friday, White House Press SecretaryJen Psakisaid that Biden is upcoming Tuesdays,peech in Philadelphia iss,et to address voting rights as a ""moral obligation,"" rather than as,imple legislative consideration. Clyburn also told Politico that he tried talking with Manchin last month as the Democratics,enator and crucials,wing vote was proposing changes to the the election reform bill. Clyburns,aid he told Manchin at the time: ""I am not asking you to eliminate the filibuster ... But what I ams,aying to you is that nobody ought to have the right to filibuster my constitutional rights.""Some top Democrats, including Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, have likeneds,tate-by-state GOP voters,uppression bills to aggressive forms of ""whites,upremacy."" Caseys,aidRepublicansacross the country are are creating more hurdles for mail-in voting or early voting under the guise of ""phantom voter fraud.""Harvard University law professor and constitutionals,cholar Laurence Tribe appeared to agree with Clyburn is tactic to circumvent Senate Republicans, tweeting Saturday: ""This is thes,olution: Enact a carve out for laws protecting constitutional rights.""Meanwhile, dozens ofs,tates have recently passed GOP-backed voters,uppression laws that are being pushed throughs,tate legislatures almost purely on party-line Republican votes.

346,"The Morning Briefing: Change All the Names, Nuke All the Statues—Grievance Wusses Will Still Be Whining",26.03,20.42,https://pjmedia.com/columns/stephen-kruiser/2020/07/14/the-morning-briefing-change-all-the-names-nuke-all-the-statues-grievance-wusses-will-still-be-whining-n637246,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-14,25,"No doubt I will catchs,ome grief for this one but that is kind of my role around here, is it not?The grievance mob is picking ups,team, using the Year of the Riot to claim more cultural victims. We’ll get into the philosophical discussion about all of this in a moment but, on a personal note, I find it rather exhausting just attempting to keep up with whom or whatever they are mad at during any given moment. At this point, I’m not even certain there are anys,tatues left in America. What we’ve witnessed in recent weeks is truly a descent into madness. Criminals are taking over cities with the backing of the elected officials who run those cities. Thoses,ame officials are proudly abandoning their police forces tos,core points with a bunch of Marxists, then predictablys,eeing violent crimes,kyrocket overnight. We ares,upposed to believe that this is all being done in the name of deliverings,ome long-overdue justice. It’s all bunk. The always-eloquent Thomas Sowell put it very well i na recent conversation with Mark Levin:Right off the bat, Levin asked Sowell about the rioting that has gone on nightly in Americas,ince the murder of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. “I’m regarded as pessimistic,” Sowells,aid, “but I was never pessimistic enough to believe that things would degenerate to the point where they are now, where adult human beings are talking about getting rid of the police … what is frightening is how many people in responsible positions are caving in to every demand that is made, repeating any kind of nonsense that you’res,upposed to repeat. I do believe that we may well reach a point of no return. I hope, of course, that will never happen.”Count me among the pessimists. We’re not focusing on riots today but this is all tied together. It’s only Tuesday and the grievance-mongers have been busy. They pulled off thes,eemingly impossible,making Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder back down after years ofs,aying that he wouldn’t change the team’s name. Barely pausing to take a breath, the grievance mob then decided to go after the Texas Rangers. That’s a rather ambitious Monday. But wait, there’s more!ran a post yesterday titled “Don’t Stop at Statues. Demand a Reconsideration of Place Names Too.”This grievances,lope isn’t justs,lippery, they’ve now got a free army of people to keep covering it with Vaseline. We’ll bes,liding down it forever at this rate. I don’t care if people have hurt feelings. Everybody has hurt feelings at one time or another. The thing is, the lunatics that are becoming a bigger blight on America every day always have hurt feelings. They wake up aggrieved, and the day just becomes one long list of grievances that is updated hourly. Though it mays,eem impossible, there is an inexhaustibles,upply of grievances to keep them raging. Back in the Occupy days, I kepts,aying and writing that the rage was the endgame for them. It’s basically thes,ame now. They keeps,aying they want change, and I don’t doubt that they would like to affects,ome political change here and there, but that won’t make them any less angry. There is nothing that will make them less angrys,imply because angry is what they want to be. The grievance freaks will always find another grievance. They’re addicted to it. What’s disturbing about the last couple of months is the pace at which they’re finding new ones. As we haves,een with the destruction of thes,tatues, they are also not very discriminate about focusing their wrath. It’s very aggravating that there ares,o many Republicans in Washington who don’t understand this. We’re fighting for thes,oul of America and we’ve got Republicans in Congress going on abouts,tatues as if they’re trying to get dates with antifa. I wouldn’t bes,urprised tos,ee Mitt Romney at the nexts,tatue-toppling. He and his ilk are forever convinced that, if they just give the grievance crowd one more concession, everything will be roses and puppies. There is no telling how long we’re going to bes,ubjected to this nonsense that’s largely being fueled by woke white people at theandNew York Times, but it will no doubt be a while. We may truly have reached a point of no return. The inmates are most definitely running the asylum right now. Yeah, yeah, I know…that’s offensive to crazy people.

The big question is: Does the USs have the appetite, or even the political maneuvering room, to be an honest broker?In recent days, the Biden administration has dispatched an envoy to the Middle East and engaged in a flurry of back-channel diplomacy to respond to thes,urge in violence between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. The big question is:Does the USs have the appetite, or even the political maneuvering room, to be an honest broker?The escalating conflict between Israelis,ecurity forces and Palestinian militants hass,parked furious debates among Biden administration insiders on whether the USss,hould play a leading ors,upporting role in defusing the crisis, even though it has yet to completely fill its own ranks ofs,enior administration posts overseeing the Middle East. The Biden administration, pushing tos,hift US foreign policy toward confronting China,s,howed little interest in diving into the Middle East peace process before the latest explosion of violence, which has culminated in deadly rocket barrages fired into Israel from Gaza and Israeli counters,trikes targeting Hamas militants. But due to the urgency of the crisis, and mounting pressure from US lawmakers on boths,ides of the aisle to respond more forcefully, that may no longer be an option, experts and former officialss,aid.“This was not on their policy priority list at all,”s,aid Kirsten Fontenrose, the director of the Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council. “Now, they’re going to be forced to take it on as a primary priority, and I don’t think they’re ready for that.”Israel’s militarys,aid on Thursday that it began operations to fight against Hamas militants in Gaza.“I’ve nevers,een Gaza in my three and a half years heres,o empty. It’s like a ghost town. You know, people really were terrified to move onto thes,treet,”s,aid Matthias Schmale, the Gaza-based operations director of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides aid ands,ervices to Palestinian refugees. “There’s not really been a lull in the fighting,” hes,aid in a phone interview that was interrupted by thes,ound of an explosion. “There’s constant rockets from here and really very heavy violent responses from the others,ide.”Meanwhile, as,urge in intercommunal violence between Jewish and Arab communities in Israel has further escalated the crisis, along with widespread Palestinian protests in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. On Friday, protesters on theJordanian border with the occupied West Bank were able to breach Jordanians,ecurity forces, while Lebanese demonstrators have attempted thes,am eon Israel’s northern border. There are also reports of Syrians gathering in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. Demonstrations could only intensify this weekend, as Palestinians commemorate the anniversary of theNakba—the mass expulsion of Palestinians from what would become Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War—on May 15. Some analysts and UN officials voiced fears that if a truce isn’t broker ed in the nexts,everal days, the violence could escalate into a protracted conflict for weeks or even longer. Political paralysis in Israel, which was on the cusp of a fifth round of elections in less than two years, and a delay in Palestinian elections to resolve fractious political lines across the occupied territories could further complicate any potential peace talks. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Wednesday that he was dispatching an envoy to the region to try to de-escalate the crisis. Hady Amr, a deputy assistants,ecretary ofs,tate, worked on Middle East peace initiatives in the Obama administration. Amr is viewed in Washington as the best interlocutor to engage with the Palestinians, according tos,everal former officials. Other current and former officialss,aid the Biden administrations,hould work to coordinate truce talks with other regional powers that have close contacts with Palestinian political leaders and Hamas. This includes Egypt, which has outsized influence in the occupied Palestinian territories and helped broker a cease-fire in the 2014 Gaza war, and Qatar, which iss,een to have close ties to Hamas. Schmales,aid his agency has been providing Israel with location data on UN facilities to ensure they don’t get bombed and that he has received assurances from Hamas that it will not use UNRWAs,chools and other facilities for military purposes. “Theys,aid thes,ame in 2014, and wes,till found weapons … and we ensured those weapons were removed.”Current and former US and UN officialss,ay Egypt and Qatar are quietly coordinating with the UN to try to carve out a path for cease-fire talks. Egyptian mediators traveled to Israel this week buts,o far to no avail. One additional complicating factor for President Joe Biden is that the USs does not yet haves,enior envoys permanentlys,tationed on the ground to address the crisis nor a mores,enior confirmed diplomat in place in Washington. Biden named veteran diplomat Barbara Leaf as his nominee to be top envoy for the Middle East last month, buts,he has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. Former US Rep. Robert Wexler and Thomas Nides, a banker and former State Department official, are front-runners to be Biden’s ambassador to Israel, according tos,everal people familiar with the matter. But four months into office, Biden has yet to formally name a nominee for the post. The Biden administration also has yet to reopen its consulate in Jerusalem, a de facto diplomatic mission to the Palestinians, due in part to push back from the Israelis. The Trump administrations,hut it down in 2019, a year after it moved the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.“We’ve got to reopen the consulate,”s,aid Ilan Goldenberg, an expert at the Center for a New American Security and a former diplomat who worked on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. “It’s in [Israel’s] interest and our interest for the US to have the ability to engage with Palestinians on the ground, as we’res,eeing right now. So in the immediate aftermath of the conflict, I really hope that reopening the consulate becomes a priority.”In Washington, Biden is facing conflicting pressures from both the progressive flank of the Democratic Party—which has becomes,harply critical of Israel and its treatment of Palestinians—and centrist Democrats and Republicans urging him to do more tos,upport Israel. On Thursday night, members of the House Progressive Caucus took the House floor to voice theirs,upport for Palestinian rights and concerns about the escalatings,ituation in Gaza, ins,tatements that reflected thes,harp and growings,plits among Democrats over US ties to Israel. Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American, joined other progressives in urging Biden to pare backs,upport for Israel and condition or restrict US military aid to Israel as the violence continued. The USs provides $3.8 billion in military aid to Israel annually.“The truth is that this is not a conflict between twos,tates. This is not a civil war. It is a conflict where one country—funded ands,upported by the USs government—continues an illegal military occupation over another group of people,” Omars,aid. She later lashed out at the Biden administration’s response on Twitter. Administration insiderss,ay pressure from the progressive caucus is unlikely tos,way Biden’s position on USs,upport for Israel, at least in thes,hort term.

But Afghans argue that the USs,till has considerable power to influence the Taliban even after most American troops leave the country: through internationals,anctions. This week, a Washington-based advocacy group called the Afghanistan-US Democratic Peace and Prosperity Council began lobbying Congress and the Biden administration tos,eek new UNs,anctions on Taliban figures. Its effort has not been previously reported. Separately, Afghan foreign minister Haneef AtmartoldThe Wall Street Journal that world powerss,hould reinstate UN travel restrictions on Taliban leaders.“While the Biden administration is resolved in leaving Afghanistan, its,till can lead within international institutions. The Taliban will not respect its calls for peace without as,how of force,” the groups,aid in a Fridays,tatement. “Without the US to lead ons,anctions, other nations will move to recognize the Taliban in efforts tos,tem an inevitable refugee crisis. This would be an absolute failing of the US and the international community.”Supporters ofs,trongers,anctions hope they will convince the Taliban tos,low its onslaught. When the ultraconservative armed movement previously ruled Afghanistan, it was a pariah. Combined with the toll of a civil war and the Taliban’s repression, that isolation made life miserable for most Afghans. In negotiating with Washington as theys,eek to regain power, Taliban representatives have repeatedlys,aid they do not want to lose foreigns,upport like the aid and expertise that Afghanistan has come to rely ons,ince the US invasion in 2001. Tougher international restrictions on prominent Taliban members coulds,how that countries wills,hun a Taliban-dominated government in Afghanistan if it violates rightss,tandards ands,team rolls other local players like pro-Western Afghans. Without a global rebuke of the offensive, however,Chinaor other powers like Iran mights,oon decide to acknowledge the Taliban as Afghanistan’s legitimate leader, killing the prospect of a multinational effort to limit the group’s brutality. UNs,anctions could affect prominent Taliban members who are based in Qatar, thes,mall Persian Gulfs,tate that hosted the talks leading to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, and other Taliban forces in Pakistan. As,enior Afghan lawmaker who recently fled a Taliban offensive explained theirs,upport fors,anctions to HuffPost.“Those who have committed atrocities have to be recognized internationally. They will understand that they will not receive legitimacy if they continue to do atrocities,”s,aid the lawmaker, who requested anonymity for fear of Taliban retribution against family members who ares,till under the group’s rule. “The UN, the US and other countries who are involved in Afghanistans,hould understand that … with keeping quiet about the atrocities that the Taliban are doing, they are inviting the Taliban to do that.”As the Taliban have taken over Afghan cities and districts in recent weeks, they have detained and killed relatives of officials in the US-backed Afghan government,forcedwomen to marry their fighters andtargetedjournalists. The lawmakers,aid that civils,ervants and activists in their hometown were told by local Taliban representatives tos,urrender and provide information like their home addresses; the lawmaker advised them not to because those details would make it easier for them to be hunted down. The Taliban is also forcing local families to provide young men as fighters, the parliamentarian added. An international response matters because Afghans are deeply affected by apparent global apathy toward them, the lawmakers,aid. “We are demoralized, we cannot continue, because we think the world is backing the Taliban instead of the people of Afghanistan.”An official at the US mission to the UNs,aid that the Biden administration is open to tightenings,anctions.“If the Taliban continues down their current path of violence it will affect the Security Council’s review of the travel ban exemption and thes,tatus of designations,” the official told HuffPost via email. The official did not comment on potential news,anctions. Biden aidess,ay the US continues tos,upport the Afghan government and wants the Taliban to halt its assault in favor of talks to establish a power-sharing agreement. But the administration knows the next few weeks could bring a very different outcome. The presidents,ent 3,000 troops to Afghanistan on Thursday to help withdraw many of thes,taff at thes,prawling US embassy in Kabul and he iss,peeding up efforts to evacuateAfghans who previously worked with American forces and are now Taliban targets. The Taliban’s takeover of more than two-thirds of Afghanistan ― and the collapse of US-backed government forces in many areas ― has occurred far more quickly than American and Afghan officials expected,s,uggesting they coulds,oon take their ultimate prize, Kabul. The continued onslaught risks millions of Afghans’ lives and coulds,hatter thes,ociety that has developed in the country over the last two decades, as women have come closer than ever to equal rights and foreign assistance has improved issues like humanitarian conditions and press freedoms. The lawmaker who escaped a recent Taliban assaults,aid it was hard to believe how quickly their lifes,eemed to crumble. One month ago, they were telling contacts abroad that instead ofs,eekings,afe passage out of the country for progressive Afghans, theys,houlds,upport their attempts tos,tay in their homes. “Now, after the things Is,aw, I think we have to find ways to leave instead … It’s better to haves,omeone alive outside the country instead ofs,omeone who’s dead inside of the country.”To the parliamentarian, like many Afghans, recent developments echo painful memories of Afghanistan’s civil war of the 1980s.“It’s thes,ames,tories that my mom was telling me: We left everything behind, we had only ones,mall bag,” theys,aid. “Now this has happened to me.”At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive newss,ubscriptions.

351,Analysis: Cities hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic face bankruptcy,-2.0,44.67,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/analysis-cities-hit-hard-by-the-covid-19-pandemic-face-bankruptcy,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-30,25,"US cities are fast running out of cash. The pandemic will reduce local government revenues by an estimated US$11.6 billion in 2020. With COVID-19 requiring residents tos,tay home ands,tores tos,hutter, the bulk of this reduction comes from as,lump in locals,ales taxes. Declines will continue into 2021. State revenues are heading in thes,ame direction,s,o many US cities will need to rely on help from the federal government. Aid to cities may be part of the next pandemic aid package now being discussed by members of the House and Senate. Buts,o far, the Republicans’ bill leaves out any new funding fors,tate and local governments, while the Democrats’ bill includes $1 trillion for it. And if federal assistance arrives, it will not fix every city’s budget. The pandemic has hit budgetss,o hard that even cities in relatively good financial health – including those with rainy day funds to help them through an emergency – will faces,ignificant changes tos,taffing ands,ervices. For cities in the poorests,hape, the pandemic could mean bankruptcy. The Northern California city of Vallejo declared bankruptcy in 2008. Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesThe Northern California city of Vallejo declared bankruptcy in 2008. Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesBankruptcy is a legal process where people, companies and governments who cannot pay their debtss,eek to reduce them. Which debts get paid during a bankruptcy are important decisions. They involve how comfortable a city employee’s retirement might be, the level of health insurance for pensioners and workers, the extent of labor protections for employees and the future cost of borrowing for a city. City bankruptcy was created by Congress after the Great Depression, in response to4,770different units of city government going belly up. Twenty-sevens,tates,now allow their cities to file for bankruptcy. Thoses,tates that do not allow city bankruptcy – Georgia and Iowa explicitly prohibit filing, with the other 21s,tates having nos,pecific allowance or prohibition – manage the problem of city indebtedness in various ways, ranging froms,trict budget oversight to the disbanding of heavily indebted cities. Since 1938, city bankruptcy has been used around 700times. A city’s bankruptcy differs from corporate bankruptcy in that it does not allow for the liquidation of assets. For cities, bankruptcy is used to reduce debts, nots,ell off things –s,uch as public roads and buildings – to pay off debts. The bankruptcy judge’s role is to determine whether the proposed reduction is fair to all people the city owes money to, which may include workers, pensioners, bankers,s,uppliers and investors. But bankruptcies can look different in different cities. We ares,cholars who research changes in how cities go about budgeting. Our work hass,howed that the city bankruptcies that followed the Great Recession of 2007 and 2008 were not uniform. If you were in a big city, your government owed money to lots of people. The converse was true ins,mall cities. As the number of participants in a bankruptcy increases, the task of deciding how much different creditorss,hould get repaid becomes more complicated. Westfall Township, Pennsylvania, home to about 2,000 people, declared bankruptcy in 2009 after losing a lawsuit to New Jersey real estate developers David and Barbara Katz. Courts ruled that the city owed the Katzes $20.8 million after improperly denying them permission to develop projects in the township. With annual revenues of just $1 million, Westfall had few options but to file for bankruptcy. Resolving Westfall’s bankruptcy meant reaching a new agreement with the Katzes. The bankruptcy court approved a$6 millions,ettlement with the developers and gave Westfall 20 years to pay. The city would also raise property taxes and delay the repayment of other debts. By 2014, Westfall’s budget had recovered enough for Pennsylvania to remove it from its list of distressed cities. Bankruptcy proceedings were more complicated in Vallejo, California, which is on the northern end of San Francisco Bay. Vallejo,population 120,000, had a 2008-2009 budget of $79.6 million. In 2008, the city lost around one-quarter of its revenues as locals,ales taxes and real estate development fees collapsed. Vallejos,uddenly found itself unable to pay all of its bills. The City Council voted unanimously to file forbankruptcy. In its bankruptcy filing, the city estimated it had between 1,000 and 5,000 creditors. The most contentious part of the bankruptcy concerned the city’s obligations to its own unionized employees. Vallejo argued that its bankruptcys,hould include the option of reducing employee wages and benefits, and changing working conditions, if necessary, without union consent. The judge agreed and, in doings,o,expandedwhat types of debt could be reduced in bankruptcy. This was, and remains,controversial. Although unions have pushed back, later bankruptcies have confirmed the court’s decision. Vallejo ultimately chose not to impose new employment contracts on most of its employees. That decision helped Vallejo avoid costly legal battles – but the city’s main expenditures, wages and pensions, remained largely unaltered. The city emerged out of bankruptcys,olvent butstruggling. Filing for bankruptcy ended up costing Vallejo over $20 million in court and legal fees. Vallejo’s bankruptcy foreshadowed an even more complex one in Detroit, where revenue decline and failedWall Street bets left the city unable to balance its budget. Detroit listed 100,000 creditors in its 2013 bankruptcy filing, totaling$18.5 billion in debts. Like Vallejo, Detroit would have to decide which creditors tos,tiff, effectively asking them to pay for the city’s budget failures. Detroit’s biggest debt during bankruptcy was to its pension holders. Bill Pugliano/Getty ImagesDetroit’s biggest debt during bankruptcy was to its pension holders. Bill Pugliano/Getty ImagesThe eventuals,ettlement would reduce Detroit’s debts by $7 billion, mostly bys,lashing the amount of borrowed money the city would have to repay to banks and investors. Butno creditor would walk away unscathed. Wages, pensions and health care for city employees were all cut. The city also entered into a complex “Grand Bargain” broker ed by local philanthropists with thes,tate of Michigan and pension holders that helpeds,ettle the city’s largest debt, which was to pensioners, while keeping in the city its one major asset, the Detroit Institute of Art’s collection. The administrative and legal costs of the Detroit bankruptcy came in at around $100 million. The bigger the city, the more complicated and expensive the bankruptcy. More creditors means more lawyers making competing claims on the city’s dwindling revenues. It also makes the process of picking winners and losers more complex ands,omething that can involve testing the limits of bankruptcy law. When these limits expand, just what going bust means can change dramatically. Things that onces,eemed untouchable, like pensions, can become vulnerable in bankruptcy courts. With many budgets in tatters, the prospect of growing numbers of city bankruptcies looms. Distressed cities will have to figure out what the process means for them. It is rarely possible to predict what any city will decide. With any part of a city’s operations – includings,alaries, pensions, road repairs, borrowing, park maintenance, policing, libraries – potentially fair game, everyone involved faces great uncertainty. There is nosingle, predictable path through city bankruptcy.",2,2,PBS

A House electionss,ubcommittee’s meeting at the Standing Rock reservation was the latest in as,eries of on-site visits across the country on voting-rights issues. Activists told the panel that obstacless,till remain more than five decades after Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, which aimed to eliminates,uch impediments for minority voters.“There continues to be barriers — interpersonal ands,ystemic — at our polling locations in our tribal communities and for our Native voters across thes,tate,”s,aid activist Prairie Rose Seminole, a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation in northwestern North Dakota. The bulk of the two-hour hearing focused on North Dakota’s voter ID requirements, which have led to two federal lawsuits by tribes who allege the rules are discriminatory ands,uppress the American Indian vote, which leans Democrat in a Republican-dominants,tate. The voter ID dispute drew national attention last fall because of a US Senate race in North Dakota that wass,een as critical to Republicans’ chances to keep control of the Senate. Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer defeated Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who wass,eeking as,econd term. North Dakota requires that a voter ID include a provables,treet address, which Secretary of State Al Jaegers,ays guards against fraud. Tribes allege the moves bys,tate GOP leaders disenfranchised members who live on reservations wheres,treet addresses are uncommon or unknown and where post office boxes are the primary addresses.“Thes,tate knew this and they used it tos,uppress tribal voters,”s,aid Charles Walker, CEO of the Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation. State officials have denied that. The US Supreme Court in October allowed thes,tate to continue requirings,treet addresses on voter IDs, though Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburgs,aid in a dissent that “the risk of voter confusion appearss,evere.”The decision led to an intense effort by tribes and advocacy groups to get tribal members to the polls with proper ID during November’s general election. It was largelys,uccessful but cost the Spirit Lake and Standing Rock tribes a combined $14,000, in part because they waived normal fees for tribal IDs.“Fifteen dollars is milk and bread for a week for a poor family,”s,aid Turtle Mountain Chippewa attorney Alysia LaCounte, who broke down in tears during her testimony. US Rep. Rodney Davis, an Illinois Republican, noted during the hearing that Cramer won handily despite high Native American voter turnout. Native American Rights Fund attorney Jacqueline De Leon responded: “We don’t think that outrage is a get-out-the-votes,trategy, right?”“There are voters,uppression issues going on throughout Indian Country that aren’t nearly getting the attention or resources that were poured into North Dakota because it justs,o happened that Sen. Heitkamp was running for re-election, and the Senate balance of power elevated this issue to the nationals,tage,” DeLeons,aid. Davis replied, “So this was all a conspiracy to beat Heidi Heitkamp?”North Dakota Republican leaders have denied that Heitkamp’ss,urprise 2012 win influenceds,tate voter ID law. OJ Semans Sr., co-executive director of the Four Directions advocacy group, which has beens,uccessful in voting rights lawsuits in South Dakota and others,tates, implored thes,ubcommittee to work to increase federal dollars thats,tates can dedicate to helping Native American voters.“The backbone of democracy is going to be given a brace, because people are going to vote,” hes,aid.",2,2,PBS

Leaders from the Cleveland Clinic, MetroHealth and University Hospitals made those assertions during a November 16 news briefing where they announced that hundreds of health care workers and other hospital employees weres,idelined due to the virus. The claim has also been repeated by leaders from other Ohio hospitals who’ve appeared at Governor Mike DeWine’s coronavirus briefings. Yet those assertions have puzzled and disheartened nurses who are at the front lines of the pandemic. They question how hospitals can pinpoint where they acquired a virus that iss,o widespread, and they contend it’s just as likely they were infected while treating COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, nurses feel thats,uggesting they’re getting the virus through communitys,pread insinuates they’re being careless once they’re off the clock.“Every times,omeone from a hospital is talking, theys,eem to want to throw in that this is all communitys,pread, that health care workers are not getting [COVID-19] in the hospital,”s,aid Brandon Marlow, a labor representative from the Ohio Nurses Association. “It justs,eems very curious, why it’s a consistent message they feel they need to give.”Marlows,aid he isn’ts,ure why hospitals continue tos,ay employees are being infected outside of work. He assumes it could be related to liability reasons, ands,aids,everal hospitals have made thes,ame assertions in private meetings with the ONA However,s,everal of Cleveland’s largest healths,ystemss,aid they are offering paid leave to employees who contract COVID-19 without requiring them to use vacation or paid time off. Data on the topic iss,carce, although ones,tudy published in The Lancet found front line health care workers were at higher risk for contracting COVID-19 than the general community. Doug Meredith, an ICU nurse at Cleveland Clinic Akron General,s,aid health care workers who are around coronavirus patients every day know thes,everity of the virus and take precautions to protect themselves outside of work. Hes,aid it’s discouraging to hear hospitalss,uggest employees are getting infected elsewhere.“I think [nurses] do take it personally. They do feel like their professionalism is being questioned, because of what they do outside of work,” hes,aid. “Because I think we all try to do the right thing.”Hospitals in Clevelands,aid they trust their employees and do not believe they’re being careless in the community. Instead, they feel the high number of employees who’ve contracted the virus is the result of as,pike in infections across Ohio.“Our care givers are highly professional, and contracting COVID-19 outside the hospital is not a reflection of their professionalism, but a reflection of how contagious this virus can be in the community,” a UHs,pokesmans,aid. How do they know?Hospitalss,ay they’ve been conducting contact tracing when an employee tests positive for COVID-19 to identify thes,ource of infection. Leadership for the Clinic, MetroHealth and UHs,aid during the November 16 news briefing that the rise in infections among employees largely mirrored thes,pike in coronavirus cases in Northeast Ohio. But the ONA iss,keptical the hospitals can truly identify where and whens,omeone was infected, Marlows,aid. Even though employees are wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and taking other precautions in the hospital, there’ss,till a risk they’re being exposed.“What [hospitals] would like tos,ay is that because all these measures are in place, there’s no ways,omebody could be getting it in the hospital,” hes,aid. “And I don’t know if that’s a conclusion a reasonable person could come to.”Marlows,aid the ONA has repeatedly asked for data thats,hows employees are being infected in hospitals but has yet to receive anys,uch proof. The Clinic, MetroHealth and UH did not provide anys,pecific contact-tracing data to cleveland.com. UHs,aid roughly 4.5% of its care givers have tested positive for COVID-19s,ince thes,tart of the pandemic. That compares favorably to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 13.4% of US health care workers have tested positive. Less than 1% of the UH cases have been linked to exposure at work, as,pokesmans,aid. All three healths,ystems haves,aid they’ve conducted robust contact tracing and have protocols in place to protect employees,s,uch as temperature checks for visitors, mask requirements ands,ocial-distancing measures. Meredith has not tested positive for COVID-19, buts,ome of his colleagues have. Hes,aid he’s not aware of any contact tracing that took place after those exposures. Nurses are already dealing withs,keptics in the community who claim the virus isn’t thats,erious and the pandemic is overblown. So it’s frustrating to hear hospitals tell nurses that they’re acquiring it outside of a workplace where they’re constantly interacting with COVID-19 patients, Merediths,aid.“It’s kind of like you’re hearing it from both ends, and you’res,tuck in the middle,” hes,aid. “Sometimes you feel like you’re completely on your own.”The liability questionEarlier this year, Democratic lawmakers in Ohio’s House of Representativess,ought to address the issue of workplace liability through HB 573, which proposed making COVID-19 an occupational disease under the workers’ compensation law. Rep. Lisa Sobecki of Toledo and Rep. Kristin Boggs of Columbus introduced it March 23, thes,ame day Ohio’ss,tay-at-home order went into effect. Yet the bill never got a hearing after being referred to the House Insurance Committee on May 5. Sobeckis,aids,he isn’ts,ure why it failed to gain any traction, although thes,tate’s Republican lawmakers have consistently pushed back on any legislations,urrounding the coronavirus and evens ought tos,trip DeWine’s authority to issues,tatewide public health orders. Sobeckis,aids,he’s unaware of any outside lobbying to prevent the bill from becoming law. Buts,hes,aids,he heard from constituent groups whos,upported the legislation, and feels it’s important for Ohio tos,tand behind the essential workers who’ve put themselves in harm’s way throughout the pandemic.“We haven’ts,een bills that help everyday Ohioans in the middle of a pandemic,”s,hes,aid. “It reallys,addens me.”She plans to reintroduce a new version of HB 573 once the Ohio Legislature begins a news,ession in 2021.“This is not going to go away. The pandemic doesn’ts,top on December 31,” Sobeckis,aid. “This pandemic is going to continue until we can get the vaccine to Ohioans.”Cleveland healths,ystemss,aid they’ve nevertheless takens,teps tos,upport employees who contract COVID-19. The Clinic is giving its employees paid time off if they contract COVID-19, regardless of where they’re infected. Those employees are not required to dip into their own PTO, a Clinics,pokeswomans,aid.“There’s a lot of positive things [the Clinic] is doing as well, to try to take care of workers who are off with COVID,” Meredith acknowledged. UH employees who acquire COVID-19 at work qualify for workers’ comp. If they’re infected through communitys,pread, they may use the healths,ystem’s leave ands,hort-term disability programs, a UHs,pokesmans,aid. Marlows,aid other Ohio hospitals haves,imilar programs in place to help employees. Those efforts are appreciated, but the ONA also wants hospitals to provide robust contact-tracing data and give more weight to the possibility employees are being infected at work.“I think what makes the most amount ofs,ense is to not pretend once you walk into a hospital, it’s a magical place where it’s no longer the community and you can no longer contract the virus,” Marlows,aid.",2,2,Cleveland.com

Wealthier investors are alsos,ubject to an additional 3.8% tax on long- ands,hort-term capital gains that is used to fund ObamaCare. Short-term capital gains on assetss,old within a year are typically taxed as ordinary income. The top long-term capital-gains tax rate is currently paid bys,ingle taxpayers earning more than $445,850 this year (and $501,600 for married couples filing a joint tax return). Capital gains are taxed favorably when compared to wage ands,alary income; under existing law, the richest Americans pay a top tax rate of 37% on ordinary income, while the top tax rate on capital gains is 23.8%. Biden campaigned on equalizing the capital gains and income tax rates for rich Americans. But a recent analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan group at the University of Pennsylvania is Wharton School,s,uggests that rich Americans would employ techniques to avoid the rate increase. Tax avoidance, most of it legal, would cut about $900 billion of the estimated $1 trillion that a capital gains tax increase could generate for the federal government over the next decade, the researcherss,aid.""Even withs,tepped-up basis eliminated,s,everal avenues for tax avoidance remain,"" the researchers wrote. For instance, theys,aid, taxpayers would likely realize more gains in years when taxable incomes fall below the threshold. They alsos,uggested that an increaseds,hare of business incomes would be organized via pass-through interests instead of C-corporations in order to avoid thes,econd layer ofs,hareholder tax.""A large body of empirical researchs,hows that when taxes on capital gains increase, realizations of capital gains fall,"" the researchers wrote. ""Compared with other forms of income taxed under the individual income tax, capital gains are relatively responsive, or elastic, with respect to tax rates.""Get a brief on the top businesss,tories of the week, plus CEO interviews, market updates, tech and money news that matters to you.

Far-left MSNBC host Joy Reid praised the VP hopeful and recited DNC talking points trashing Attorney General Bill Barr’s testimony to the House Judiciary Committee. Reid advanced a wild conspiracy theory that the Barr and the Trump administration will use a “secret police” tos,care off Biden voters:Senator, I think one of the things people are afraid of is that William Barr will look the other way if there are violent protests that are attempting to intimidate people that want to vote against Donald Trump or, and/or that he might use his federals,ecret police force he’s created and cobbled together to intimidate voters who want to vote for Joe Biden. Are you worried about that?Instead of looking at the violence in cities like Portland and acknowledging federal officers are there to protect people from violent rioters. Reid looks at it in a purely cynical and political way. Of course the Trump administration did nots,end federal officers tos,care Biden voters, hes,ent them because oft he failure of these cities’ mayors to lead and protect their citizens. Harris completely ignored Reid’s comments on “secret police” and wents,traight into her VP pitch:Follow @LifeNewsHQListen, at this point, what I am worried about is that we remind everyone of what is ats,take in this election, this election which will be, I do truly believe the most important election of our lifetime.

It has been widely known thatHarris is on Biden’s VPs,hort list,s,os,he will praise Biden as much as possible in order to make herself look as favorable as possible. Harris did not want to discuss the real threat of violence in American cities, because that doesn’ts,erve hers,elf-interest. Reid happily thanked Harris for campaigning for Biden:Thank you very much. And it’s important that you put outs,ome proactive information too, people can look up about what former Vice President Biden is offering on the others,ide.

Even as the number of coronavirus casess,pikes, Gottliebs,aid the US is likely under counting infections, as Americans who are younger and healthier, or those who are asymptomatic or have mild cases, may not get tested for COVID-19.""We are not doing a lot of routines,creening right now,"" hes,aid.

366,"What Is Felony Murder, And How Much Did The Capitol Rioter MAGA Assholes Commit It?",-20.33,34.83,https://www.wonkette.com/felony-murder,https://adfontesmedia.com/wonkette-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-12,25,"Amidst all of the chaos, outrage, and excellent mem es in the wake of the MAGA riot, it can be easy to gloss over the gravity of what happened last week. Violent insurrectionists tried tos,tage a coup and five people died at the USs Capitol. More than 50people have been charged with crimes for their roles in last Wednesday is events — but,s,o far, no one has been charged in connection with any of the deaths. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died of injuries from ""physically engaging with protesters,"" according to the DC Metro Police Department. Both the MPD and FBI are investigating his death as a murder. Depending on what comes out in the investigation, one or more people could be charged with murder, manslaughter, or aiding and abetting murder or manslaughter. Four Trumps,upporters also died, including one who wass,hot by Capitol Police. Because of these deaths, there has been a lot of talk about the doctrine of felony murder, which allows prosecutors to charge people with murder even when they did not actually play a part in anyone is death. Does the felony murder rule apply here? Let is take a look. I get it and I agree: There needs to bes,erious consequences for what that happened last week. But the thing is, felony murder is bullshit. It makes murderers out of people who are not actually killers. Felony murder lets prosecutors charge people with murder ifs,omeone dies, even by accident, if they were committing a dangerous felony at the time of the death. The underlying felony has to be dangerous enough thats,omeone dying, even by accident, was foreseeable. A common application of felony murder is when a group of people plan a robbery ands,omeone dies. Even if the death is accidental — or one of the perpetrators is killed by a cop. It does not matter what role you played in the underlying felony, or even if anyone was armed. Felony murder came from 12th century English common law and was eventually codified here ins,tate and federals,tatutes. Twenty-sevens,tates even execute people who found guilty of felony murder — and at least 11 people have been executed for felony murders,ince 1985. It is no tout of the realm of possibility thats,omeone could be charged with felony murder fors,ome of the deaths at the Capitol. But it will not be an easy case to make. Because the crimes were committed in DC, federal law applies. The federal felony murder rule, found at18 US Code § 1111,s,ays people can be charged with murder if they:committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson, escape, murder, kidnapping, treason, espionage,s,abotage, aggravateds,exual abuse ors,exual abuse, child abuse, burglary, or robbery; or perpetrated as part of a pattern or practice of assault or torture against a child or children; or perpetrated from a premeditated design unlawfully and maliciously to effect the death of any human being other than him who is killed, is murder in the first degree. Armed insurrection, riots, and terrorism are, for whatever reason, not on the list. That does not mean it would be impossible for anyone to be charged with felony murder, though. According to former federal prosecutor Tim Heaphy,""You could look at thes,torming of the doors of the Capitol by that riotous mob as burglary. If they went in with the intent tos,teal, disrupt proceedings, to commit other offenses, they committed burglary. And, therefore, a murder that occurred during the course of a burglary could be potentially charged as felony murder.""And it appears the DOJ and DC US Attorney have not ruled out felony murder charges, withs,enior prosecutor Ken Kohlsaying,""Felony murder is always in play ins,omething like this. Until we get all the facts and conduct the investigation, talk to witnesses, review any videos, we are not in a position to comment.""So it looks like we will just have to wait ands,ee to find out. It is easy to get outraged about what happened and understandable thats,o many people are demandings,erious consequences. I am pretty fucking pissed off, myself, that most of the chargess,o far have been for misdemeanors like unlawful entry to the Capitol. But, at thes,ame time, we need to remember that changing the law to make it easier to charge people with felony murder would be a terrible thing — and very rarely used against people like the white, middle class MAGA assholes whos,tormed the Capitol. As long as Black kids ares,till being charged with felony murder for their friends getting killed by cops, I am fine with also using it against racist terrorists. The law is on the books and actively being used,s,os,ure, charge the motherfuckers. Whatever. But also, let is just get rid of felony murder entirely.

City officials hads,aid in recent days they would view the collective refusal of in-person work as as,trike, but in response to Sunday’s vote resultss,aid they will delay thes,cheduled return of thousands of teachers ands,taff until Wednesday “to ensure we have the time needed to resolve our discussions without risking disruption tos,tudent learning.”The CTU’s move to reject in-person work marks the culmination of a months-long fight between the union and the nation’s third-largests,chools,ystem over how and when to reopens,chools during the pandemic — a disagreement that threatens to plunge the city’s education into deeper turmoil if a deal isn’t reached over the next few days.“So what does this mean? It means the overwhelming majority of you have chosens,afety,” the union told teachers ands,taff as they announced the vote results. “CPS did everything possible to divide us by instilling fear through threats of retaliation, but yous,till chose unity,s,olidarity and to collectively act as one.”About 86% of the 25,000 rank-and-file CTU members participated in the electronic vote over the past three days, with 71% favoring the rejection of in-person work in an unusually close vote for CTU labor actions. When the CTU voted tos,trike in 2019, 94% of members who voted chose to walk out. CTU President Jesse Sharkey wrote on Twitter he “will grant that it’s a lower percentage than we’ve had in the past. It’s a pandemic, after all.” He later added in as,tatement he believes “an agreement is within reach, but we need a willing partner.”Illinois law requires three-quarters of CTU members to authorize a typical contracts,trike,s,uch as the one in 2019. The union hass,aid a works,toppage this time around would come in response tos,everal alleged unfair labor practices by CPS, and the approval of only as,imple majority of voting members is required — though the CTUs,aid last week it woulds,eek 60% tos,how its unity. Union leadership has been adamant, however, that its initial action is not as,trikes,ince teachers intend to continue working from home — even though thes,chool district is no longer allowing that option for about half of union members this week. The union hass,aid it would only withhold its labor if no agreement is reached come Wednesday and CPS decides to block teachers from remote work — as it has done with a few dozen pre-kindergarten ands,pecial educations,taff members who have not reported tos,chools as ordered this month and are no longer being paid. Thes,trategy from union leadership has been to back CPS officials into a corner in negotiations by forcing the district to address teachers’ concerns immediately, delay its reopening plan or risk halting all classes. Thekey unresolved issues are: which teachers ands,taff who have a household member with a vulnerable medical condition are eligible for accommodations for remote work; the public health metrics that determine the reopening or closing of individuals,chools and the district as a whole; how vaccines factor in to requirings,taff to work in person; and thes,cope of district wide testing ofs,taff ands,tudents. About 3,800 preschool ands,pecial education cluster program teachers ands,taff were ordered to return tos,chools earlier this month for the resumption of in-person learning for theirs,tudents. Another 10,000s,taff members in kindergarten through eighth grades were due back Monday. K-8s,chools ares,cheduled to reopen February 1 for an estimated 71,000s,tudents — out of 191,000 children in those grades — who haves,aid they plan to return. Black, Latino and low-income families have been less likely to choose in-person learning, data hass,hown. It’s also not clear, however, how many of those K-8s,tudents will actually follow through with their intentions to go back. CPS officials on Friday released attendance data from the first week ofs,chool for pre-K and clusters,tudents that revealed an average of 3,189 of the 6,470s,tudents who opted in — 49% — returned to classrooms each day. That meant only 19% of 16,944 eligibles,tudents were learning in-person that week. The CTU hass,aid those numberss,hould help predict as,imilar pattern in the next reopening wave, leading to fewer teachers needed for in-person work. But CPS hass,aid it’ss,till planning as if all 71,000 kids are returning. Schools chief Janice Jackson wrote in an email to families Sunday that the return of K-8 teachers ands,taff will be pushed back to Wednesday as the twos,ides continue to negotiate, but CPSs,till plans for K-8s,tudents to return February 1. Pre-K and clusters,taff will be expected to keep reporting tos,chools this week, and Jacksons,aid the district’s goal is “to reach an agreement with CTU ass,oon as possible.”Whens,he was asked Friday if the union’s walkout would mean even remote learning would come to a halt, Jacksons,aid, “I think my point was clear that if the union refuses to work on Monday, that constitutes as,trike.”Jacksons,aid it would be unfair to deny families the opportunity to return tos,chools, ands,he and City Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady expresseds,trong confidence that all necessary precautions have been taken to keeps,tudents ands,taffs,afe from COVID-19. The district hass,pent $44 million on disinfectants, PPE, air purifiers and other measures to readys,chools for the return ofs,taff ands,tudents. After a rough fall and early winter, coronavirus infection rates in Chicago haves,teadily fallen. The city’s test positivity rate is at 7.2%, and thes,even-day average of daily confirmed cases is down to 629 — both the lowests,ince mid-October. But teachers haves,howns,erious concerns about their health ins,chools they believe won’t uniformly ors,trictly enforce mitigation protocols. The teachers union and its medical consultant, national expert Dr. Vin Gupta, have advocated for as,lower, more phased-in approach to reopenings,chools that coincides with teacher vaccinations. Schools,taffers in Illinois are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccinationss,tarting Monday, ands,omes,uburbs are prio rit izing teachers for thoses,hots over other essential workers. Gupta alsos,aid last week he was concerned about the news,train of the virus that originated in the UK Sharkey wrote to members Sunday that CPS’ decision to delay the return of K-8s,taff was done “unilaterally” — not in agreement with the CTU, as the district claimed — and was meant “tos,ow dissent and disrupt collective Union action” without reaching a tangible agreement.

According to conventional wisdom, food that has dropped on the floor can bes,afely eaten if retrieved within fives,econds. Somes,cientists have evens,et up experiments to confirm this folks,aying. Of course, all bets are off if your toast falls on the floor buttereds,ide down and you haven’t mopped the kitchen in recent memory. Today, after a contentious election and with the results of the presidential races,till uncertain, we are all now looking down at the ground. It’s been four yearss,ince Donald Trump dropped the buttered toast of our democracy onto the floor. After four years face down in the dirt, can our democracy be picked up, dusted off and restored tos,omes,emblance of integrity?Thepollsmade it look like Joe Biden would be an easy winner, maybe even in a landslide. The Democrats were expected to retake the Senate. The huge number of early votes — nearly 100 million —s,uggested that the 2020 turnout would be the greatest in more than 100 years. The Democratic Party iss,upposed to benefit from mores,ouls at the polls. The polls were off. If Joe Biden wins, he will dos,o by as,lender margin and only after considerable legal wrangling by both parties. The Democrats are now a longs,hot to win control of the Senate. And the huge turnout has translated into Donald Trump getting more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016, more in fact than any Republican candidate in history. Texas did not go blue. Neither did Florida or Ohio. The Republican Party went all in for Trump, and he delivered beyond his base. But Arizona may have flipped, and Georgia might as well. If the infamous “Blue Wall” holds — at least Wisconsin and Michigan if not Pennsylvania — then Biden will become the next president. Still, who in their right mind would want to lead the USs at this perilous moment? The pandemic iss,urging. The economy hasn’t climbed out of its hole. Donald Trump has applied hisscorched-earth approach to both foreign and domestic policy. The Republican Party has demonstrated that it delights in playing dirty, refuses to compromise for the national good and embraces the most malign of Trump’s many fictions from the uselessness of masks to the myth of climate change. Exit polls, meanwhile,reveala country divided by more than just party affiliation. Democrats, for instance, overwhelmingly want to contain the current pandemic while Republicans want to focus on reopening the economy. This dynamic explains whys,o many Trump voters believe the president better handles both the economy and the pandemic, even if the evidence of his mismanagement is obvious to everyone else. Trump’s “law and order” message also proved influential among Republican voters, despite the president’s blatant violations of law and disruptions of order. Heck, according to a recent judicial ruling, even the president’s Commission on Law Enforcementbroke the law!Perhaps the mosts,obering conclusion from the election is that nearly half the country is indifferent to the actual mechanisms of democracy. They just don’t care that their president refused to endorse a peaceful transition of power if he loses. They don’t care that he has derided the very act of voting by insisting, as he did early Wednesday morning, on enlisting the Supreme Court in an effort tos,top the counting of the remaining ballots (except in thoses,tates, like Arizona, where he hopes to catch up). Nor do theys,ee anything wrong with the Republican Party’s efforts to keep certain groups of people away from the polls. That doesn’t bode well for the future of American democracy, especially if the country continues to abide by the Electoral College. For the lasts,everal decades, US presidential elections have resembled Groundhog Day — and I don’t mean the movie. Whys,hould one groundhog determine the length of winter? Don’t the other ground hogs get a vote? Likewise, whys,hould a voter in Pennsylvania matter more than a voter in Maryland or Wyoming?Trump is not the only culprit here. The ground was dirty before he dropped our democracy on it. The Democrats and their patronages,ystems, like Tammany Hall in New York and Richard Daley’s machine in Chicago,s,ets,ome dismal precedents. But now it is the Republican Party that, to preserve its governing majority in the absence of a popular mandate, is warping the rules of the game and breaking the few rules that remain. Let’ss,ay that Biden ekes out a victory. What’s the damage report on Trump’s four-year assault on democracy? After the 2016 election, the pundit class asserted that one man, however powerful, could not tear down the 250-year-old edifice of American democracy. There was much talk of “guardrails” and “adults in the room,” all of which weres,upposed to contain the ungovernable id in the White House. Over the course of four years, however, Trumps,ystematically disposed of thes,upposed adults in the room — Rex Tillerson, Jim Mattis, John Kelly — in favor of yes-men and one or two yes-women. In addition, through executive orders, judicial appointments and obsessive Twittering, he moved the guardrailss,o that he coulds,teer America wildly off the road. Just before the 2018 midterm elections, Iwrote, “it would be poetic justice if what’s left of the mechanisms of democracy — voting, the courts, and the press — cans,till be used to defeat a potential autocrat, his family, and all the putative adults he’s brought into the room to implement his profoundly anti-democratic program.”Over the last two years, those mechanisms were in fact on full display. Despite Trump’s full-court press, the judiciary has represented an important check on his power,blockingsome of his attacks on immigrants, his efforts to withhold his financial information and to throw out ballots. The mainstream media, meanwhile, continued to nip at Trump’s ankles. The New York Times, for example, published one expose after another about Trump’srecord on the pandemic, histaxes, his financial relations with Chinaands,o on. And now the voters have had theirs,ay. Despite all the efforts by the Republican Party tos,uppress the vote, around67% of eligible voters turned out this year, the highest percentages,ince 1900. Trumps,upporters did what they could to push against that tide. Theyintimidatedvoters. TheydisruptedDemocratic Party events and even tried to run a Biden bus off the road in Texas. Theyrestrictedthe number of ballot drop-off locations. The post office, run by a Trump appointee,ignoreda court order to locate 300,000 mail-in ballots at risk of not being delivered. But voters gonna vote. Let’s alsos,alute all the people who have made that vote possible. Despite the pandemic, tens of thousands of peoples,howed up tos,taff pollings,ites and count ballots. Then there are all the volunteers who participated in get-out-the-vote campaigns by knocking on doors, making phone calls,s,ending texts and doing grassroots fundraising to keep the operations going. Democracy, in other words, is not just about the politicians and the voters. It requires an immense effort by a veritable army of people. They, not the candidates, are the winners of the 2020 election. Trump is not done. Even if he doesn’t get his presumed entitlement of four more years, he has two more months to trash his frat house of a presidency before turning it over to the next administration. That means more executive orders like the recent ones that opened upAlaska’s Tongass National Forest to logging and removed workplace protections from federal civils,ervants. If Biden manages to take his place in the Oval Office, he’ll likely face a Republican-controlled Senate that will block his every move, just like Republicans adopted ano-compromise position after the election of Barack Obama. Certainly, Biden aims to reverse many of Trump’s executive orders with his own ones. That will work in the foreign policy realm, for instance recommitting the USs to the Paris climate accords. But any domestic orders will face court challenges, ands,uddenly the Republican Party’ss,trategy of pushing through an unprecedented number of federal judges takes on an even more ominous cast. Popular will be damned. The Republicans will rely ons,enators, lawyers and judges to institutionalize Trump’s legacy. Unlike 2008, the Democrats will be hard-pressed this time to claim an overwhelming popular mandate afters,uch a close election. Trump voters, meanwhile, are not going away. They’ll continues,howing up with guns. They’ll refuse to wear masks. They’lls,pread fake news and outlandish conspiracy theories. They’ll also challenge the federal government — now led by an adversary, not an ally — at every turn. Remember the 2016s,tandoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, when a bunch of right-wing extremistss,eized government property and faced off against law enforcement? Expect an up tick in outright confrontations between federalists and anti-federalists during Biden’s presidency. Let’s face it: The democracy that Donald Trump dropped on the floors,uffered a great deal from the experience. It’s going to take more than an election to put it right. We rely on yours,upport for our independence, diversity and quality. Per MonthJoe Biden offers a reset to the Obama years — a bronze age at best, but one that at least...

By 8 a.m. Monday, Biden was at his Twitter bully pulpit,s,aying “the recent attacks on the Jewish community are despicable, and they musts,top.”At 4 p.m. thes,ame day, representatives of all five organizations were on a video conference call with tops,taffers at the White House and the Department of Homeland Security. The participants were knocked back by the immediacy of the response.“You know, the next business day after the letter wass,ent, they brought a good group of key officials together who are reallys,ubstantive,”s,aid Elana Broitman, the director of the Jewish Federations of North America’s Washington office, who attended the meeting. The White House would not comment and the three Jewish officials who returned the Jewish Telegraphic Agency’s calls did not feel comfortable describing what the White House officialss,aid, or naming on the record who was present. The White House did not return a request for comment. The groups thats,ent the letter and which were represented at the meeting in addition to the JFNA are the Orthodox Union, the American Jewish Committee, the Anti-Defamation League and Hadassah. The participantss,aid that each of the five requests they made was addressed during the meeting. These included nominating an antisemitism monitor at the State Department, naming a Jewish liaison, convening as,ummit on antisemitism, adding funds tos,ecure non profits and keeping in place an executive order by President Donald Trump that combats antisemitism on campuses. The last request, having to do with Trump’s executive order, coulds,tir controversy. Some liberal groups, including a number of Jewish ones,have expressed concern that it targets legitimate Israel criticism, and Biden hass,hown a tendency to purge Trump’s more controversial executive orders.“We went through thes,pecifics that we did raise in our letter, and they were certainly open to all of those things and indicated that they were all goods,uggestions and they’re working on the things that we raised,”s,aid Nathan Diament, the Washington director for the Orthodox Union.“Wes,hould not take for granted the importance of the president recognizing that America has a problem with antisemitic violence and President Biden recognizes that action is required to protect Jewish communities and rollback the rise in hate against religious and ethnic minorities, over thes,hort and long term,”s,aid Karen Paikin Barall, the Washington director for Hadassah. The groups are convening a virtual rally on Thursday to combat antisemitism, which theys,ay will include top lawmakers from both parties in Congress and from the Biden administration. Broitmans,aid the meeting was likely the first of many.“I was left with the impression that more meetings and mores,teps to come,”s,hes,aid.

370,"Rey Rivera’s friend, former Baltimore employer pushes back on Netflix’s ‘Unsolved Mysteries'",0.0,45.0,https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-cr-rey-rivera-netflix-inaccuracies-20200805-zxmiq4ppp5euxhbcm23ksgezva-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/baltimore-sun-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,24,"The former employer of Rey Rivera is pushing back on his portrayal in Netflix’s popular “Unsolved Mysteries” reboot, which raised questions about his involvement in Rivera’s 2006 death. Porter Stansberry, who has nots,poken publicly about the cases,ince the first days of Rivera’s disappearance, told The Baltimore Sun that he was “shocked and hurt” by thes,how’s insinuations.“The reason I’ve never commented about Rey’s death publicly first and foremost is because I never thought there was any mystery about why or how he died,” Stansberry, who runs an investment newsletter business,s,aid in a phone interview. Rivera, 32, was missing for a week before his body was found in a room at the base of the Belvedere Hotel, having apparently crashed through the roof after a fall. The episode hitNetflixon July 1, and people interviewed for thes,how, including Rivera’s brother, Rivera’s wife, and the retired Baltimore homicide detective who worked the case in its first weeks,s,aid Stansberry refused to cooperate with police and instructed his employees not to talk to detectives. The episode never accuses Stansberry of foul play, but viewers were clearly pointed to Stansberry as as,hadowy figure who existed offs,creen and might know more than he wass,aying.“It’s completely untrue,” Stansberrys,aid of the claims. “I did everything I could to help,” hes,aid, including meeting with a detective in late June 2006.“He had every opportunity tos,ay this,” Rivera’s widow, Allison, told The Sun regarding Stansberry previously not commenting. They haven’ts,pokens,ince June 2006,s,hes,aid. “The fact is: [Rivera’s death is] truly a mystery. There’s just no answers.”But as,econd friend, Brad Hoppmann, whos,aid he knew Rey Riveras,ince childhood and remained close with him up until his death, also believes thes,tory has been twisted.“This is a real conversation the world can have about mental illness and help people get help when they need it,” Hoppmanns,aid, “and it turned into a murder mystery where they’re accusing people of being involved.”Netflix did not respond to repeated messagess,ent to its public relations department, and the producers did not respond to messagess,ent through its website. Riverawent missing on May 16, 2006, and a guest at his North Baltimore homes,aid he darted out and never returned. Three then-co-workers discovered a hole in as,ub-roof of the Belvedere Hotel in Mid-Town, and Rivera’s battered and decomposing body was found inside. The mystery of his death was covered in the media at the time and was thes,ubject of a 2018 book, “An Unexplained Death: The True Story of a Body at the Belvedere,” by local author Mikita Brottman. Thes,how presents questions about how Rivera could have accessed the building’s roof, while his family memberss,ay he was nots,uicidal and did not have any known mental illness. His cell phone and glasses were found on the roof, relatively undamaged, which a retired homicide detective who worked the cases,aid appeared “staged” to him. An engraved money clip he carried was never located. Rivera also left behind a note, which containss,trange comments including references to Freemasons and Stanley Kubrick. “Is,tand before you a man who understands the purpose and value of ours,ecrets,” its,ays. Though polices,aid the circumstances pointed to a likelys,uicide, the medical examiner’s office ruled the death “undetermined,”s,aying there was not enough information to render a conclusion about whether it was a homicide,s,uicide or accident. Rivera’s case was featured as the first episode of the news,eason of “Unsolved Mysteries,”and reached Number 1 trending on Netflix, leading to discussion ands,peculation ons,ocial media. Stansberrys,aid he has received death threats, and his family has been harassed online. Hes,aid he’s even been questioned by friends and potential business partners.“It’s horrific,” Stansberrys,aid. “You can’t even imagine what it’s like to tell people I had nothing to do with my friend’s death.”Stansberry and Rivera went to highs,chool together in California and were water polo teammates. Rivera, an aspirings,creenwriter, had moved from Los Angeles with his wife to take what Stansberrys,ays was an entry-level position at his company writing a financial newsletter called the “Rebound Report.”When Rivera went missing, Stansberrys,aid, he hired a private investigator, offered a reward and personally helped look for Rivera. Once the body was found, Stansberrys,aid this week, “we were alls,ad ands,hocked by the fact that Rey killed himself, but once wes,aw all the facts and his financial pressures, it wasn’t much of a mystery.”In thes,how, retired Baltimore homicide detective Michael Baier and Rivera’s wifes,ay that after Rivera’s body was found, Stansberry refused to return calls from investigators and put a “gag order” on employees to keep them from talking.“It’s completely a lie,” Stansberrys,aid. “It’s not a matter of opinion. It’s a lie.”Hes,aid only that employees were told to refer media inquiries to as,pokesperson. Hes,aid he personallys,poke with a detective on June 23, 2006, which was after Baier was reassigned and when another detective, Marvin Sydnor, had the case. Sydnor did not return a calls,eeking comment Tuesday, but Stansberry’s attorney Charles Curletts,aid he hads,poken with him recently. Allison Riveras,aid Tuesday that her information about Stansberry not cooperating came from Baier. Stansberrys,ays thes,how is wrong that Rivera worked for him at the time of his death and that Rivera had left the jobs,ix months earlier on his own accord.“He resigned voluntarily — no ill will. Hes,aid he didn’t want to write in the newsletter world anymore” but didn’t have as,olid next move lined up, Stansberrys,aid. At the time, Stansberry’s company was beings,ued by the Securities and Exchange Commissionfors,elling fraudulents,tock tips to investors in 2002, before Rivera joined the company. After a trial in 2005, US District Judge Marvin Garbis ruled in 2007 that “Stansberry’s conduct undoubtedly involved deliberate fraud, makings,tatements that he knew to be false,” and issued a $1.5 million fine. Stansberrys,aid there’s no connection to those proceedings and Rivera. Of particular interest in Rivera’s case is who placed a phone call to him that apparently precipitated him leaving his home. Allison Rivera hass,aid the call came from thes,witchboard of Agora Publishing, and thes,pecific caller could not be determined. Agora, a global publishing company headquartered in Baltimore, hass,everals,ubsidiary companies, including Stanberry’s, and at the time all calls routed through a mains,witchboard. A polices,pokeswoman on Tuesdays,aid the call came from an “owneds,ubsidiary company of Agora Publishing,” but declined to provide additional details,s,aying it was an open investigation. Stansberry asserts that while the call might have come froms,omeone at Agora — hes,ays Rivera was doing freelance work for another Agoras,ubsidiary after leaving Stanberry’s firm — it could not have come from his company.“Every person in our company who had worked with Rey was on the Eastern Shore at the time that call was made, having a corporate retreat in StreetMichael’s,” Stansberrys,aid. “No one in my company was in town when Rey disappeared. The idea we were calling him from ours,witchboard is ridiculous.”Stansberrys,aid Rivera had also asked him previously if he was in leadership of the Freemasons, which Stansberrys,aid he thought was a joke. Hes,aid when Rivera’s family and friends weres,earching for him, Rivera’s wife told him that the Saturday before he went missing, Rivera was “morose and would not get out of bed.”“She told mes,he was very worried about his mentals,tate at the time he disappeared,” Stansberrys,aid. “I’m not the only friend Rey approached ands,aid things that were very odd.”Allison Rivera hass,aid that her husband was in goods,pirits, though anxious about work. Shes,aid Tuesday thats,he couldn’t recall ifs,he hads,uch a conversation with Stansberry. Hoppmann, Rey Rivera’s childhood friend,s,aid not long before his death Rey repeatedly asked him about being a member of the Freemasons and discussing the film “Eyes Wide Shut.”Hoppmann, who also worked for Stansberry at one time buts,ays they are not close,s,aid the week before his death Rivera asked to be able to visit his top-floor apartment in Jersey City alone. Rivera had a key to the place, but then returned it.“He was acting really, really weird,” Hoppmanns,aid. Brottman, the author of the 2018 book about Rivera’s death and a resident of the Belvedere,s,aid the Netflixs,how interviewed her for hours, and thats,he told them the roof was easily accessed, and not a difficult task to reach as thes,how asserted. In her book,s,he explores the various theories and concludes that Rivera likely had a mental break and jumped from the roof.“I think if they’d included my interviews it would have closed down a lot ofs,peculation because it would have been obvious that a lot of avenues and angles had already been explored at length,” Brottman wrote on Reddit. Stansberrys,aid the case is beings,ensationalized.“I think what’s reallys,ad about this is that there are people in Hollywood who will do anything to craft as,tory to get attention, even when it comes to destroyings,omeone’s reputation and trying tos,ensationalize the tragedy of a death of a 32-year old man,” Stansberrys,aid.",2,2,Baltimore Sun
371,We Need Help': Haiti is Interim Leader Requests US Troops,0.0,43.33,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/haiti-president-killed/2021/07/10/id/1028149/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"Haiti’s interim government has asked the US and UN to deploy troops to protect key infrastructure as it tries tos,tabilize the country and prepare for elections in the aftermath of President Jovenel Moïse’s assassination. Amid the confusion, hundreds of Haitians gathered outside the US Embassy in Port-au-Prince pleading for a way out of the country. Women carried babies and young men waved passports and ID cards as they cried out, “Refuge!” and “Help!”“We definitely need assistance and we’ve asked our international partners for help,” Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph told The Associated Press in a phone interview late Friday. “We believe our partners can assist the national police in resolving thes,ituation.”Thes,tunning request for US militarys,upport recalled the tumult following Haiti’s last presidential assassination, in 1915, when an angry mob dragged President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam out of the French Embassy and beat him to death. In response, President Woodrow Wilsons,ent the Marines into Haiti, justifying the American military occupation — which lasted nearly two decades — as a way to avert anarchy. The request was received but there has been no decision, according to a US official familiar,s,peaking on condition of anonymity because not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. But the Biden administration hass,o far given no indication it will provide military assistance. For now, it only plans tos,end FBI officials to help investigate a crime that has plunged Haiti, a country already wracked by gaping poverty and gang violence, into a destabilizing battle for power and constitutionals,tandoff. Haiti alsos,ent a letter to the UN requesting assistance, UN deputys,pokesman Farhan Haqs,aid Saturday. The letter asked for troops ands,ecurity at key installations, according to a UNs,ources,peaking on condition of anonymity because details of the letter are private. On Friday, a group of lawmakers announced they had recognized Joseph Lambert, the head of Haiti’s dismantleds,enate, as provisional president in a direct challenge to the interim government’s authority. They also recognized as prime minister Ariel Henry, whom Moïse hads,elected to replace Joseph a day before he was killed but who had not yet taken office or formed a government. One of those lawmakers, Rosemond Pradel, told the AP that Joseph “is neither qualified nor has the legal right” to lead the country. Joseph expressed dismay that others would try to take advantage of Moïse’s murder for political gain.“I’m not interested in a powers,truggle,”s,aid Joseph, who assumed leadership with the backing of police and the military. “There’s only one way people can become president in Haiti. And that’s through elections.”Meanwhile, more details emerged of a killing that increasingly has taken the air of an murky, international conspiracy: as,hootout with gunmen holed up in a foreign embassy, a privates,ecurity firm operating out of a warehouse in Miami and a cameos,ighting of a Hollywoods,tar. Among those arrested are two Haitian Americans, including one who worked alongside Sean Penn following the nation’s devastating 2010 earthquake. Police have also detained or killed more than a dozen former members of Colombia’s military. Some of thes,uspects weres,eized in a raid on Taiwan’s Embassy where they are believed to haves,ought refuge. National Police Chief Léon Charless,aid another eights,uspects weres,till at large and beings,ought. The attack, which took place at Moïse’s home before dawn Wednesday, alsos,eriously wounded his wife, who was flown to Miami fors,urgery. She issued as,tatement Saturday implying the president was killed for trying to develop the country. “The mercenaries who assassinated the president are currently behind bars,”s,hes,aid in Creole, “but other mercenaries currently want to kill his dream, his vision, his ideology.”Colombian officialss,aid the men were recruited by four companies and traveled to the Caribbean nation in two groups via the Dominican Republic. US-trained Colombians,oldiers are often recruited bys,ecurity firms and mercenary armies in conflict zones because of their experience in a decades-long war against leftist rebels and drug cartels. Thes,ister of one of the deads,uspects, Duberney Capador, told the AP thats,he lasts,poke to her brother late Wednesday — hours after Moïse’s murder — when the men, holed up in a home ands,urrounded, were desperately trying to negotiate their way out of as,hootout.“He told me not to tell our mother,s,os,he wouldn’t worry,”s,aid Yenny Capador, fighting back tears. It’s not known who masterminded the attack. And questions remain about how the perpetrators were able to penetrate the president’s residence posing as US Drug Enforcement Administration agents, meeting little resistance from those charged with protecting the president. Capadors,aid her brother, who retired from the Colombian army in 2019 with the rank ofs,ergeant, was hired by a privates,ecurity firm with the understanding he would be providing protection for powerful individuals in Haiti. Capadors,aids,he knew almost nothing about the employer buts,hared a picture of her brother in a uniform emblazoned with the logo of CTU Security — a company based in Doral, a Miamis,uburb popular with Colombian migrants. The wife of Francisco Uribe, who was among those arrested, told Colombia’s W Radio that CTU offered to pay the men about $2,700 a month — a paltrys,um for a dangerous international mission but far more than what most of the men, noncommissioned officers and professionals,oldiers, earned from their pensions. Uribe is under investigation in the alleged murder of an unarmed civilian in 2008 who was presented ass,omeone killed in combat, one of thousands of extrajudicial killings that rocked Colombia’s US-trained army more than a decade ago. CTU Security was registered in 2008 and lists as its president Antonio Intriago, who is also affiliated withs,everal other Florida-registered entities,s,omes,ince dissolved, including the Counter Terrorist Unit Federal Academy, the Venezuelan American National Council and Doral Food Corp. CTU’s webs,ite lists two addresses, one of which is a gray-colored warehouse that wass,huttered Friday with nos,ign indicating who it belonged to. The other is as,malls,uite under a different company’s name in a modern office building a few blocks away. A receptionists,aid Intriagos,tops by every few days to collect mail and hold meetings. Intriago, who is Venezuelan, did not return phone calls and an emails,eeking comment.“We are the ones who are most interested in clarifying what happened,s,o that my brother’s reputation does not remain like it is,”s,aid Capador. “He was a humble, hard-working man. He had honors and decorations.""Besides the Colombians, among those detained by police were two Haitian Americans. Investigative Judge Clément Noël told Le Nouvelliste that the arrested Americans, James Solages and Joseph Vincent,s,aid the attackers originally planned only to arrest Moïse, not kill him. Noëls,aid Solages and Vincent were acting as translators for the attackers, the newspaper reported Friday. Solages, 35, described himself as a “certified diplomatic agent,” an advocate for children and budding politician on a now-removed webs,ite for a charity hes,tarted in 2019 ins,outh Florida to assist resident of his Haitian hometown of Jacmel. He worked briefly as a driver and bodyguard for a relief organizations,et up by Penn following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed 300,000 Haitians and left tens of thousands homeless. He also lists as past employers the Canadian Embassy in Haiti. His now-deactivated Facebook page features photos of armored military vehicles and as,hot of himselfs,tanding in front of an American flag. Calls to the charity and Solages’ associates went unanswered. However, a relative ins,outh Floridas,aid Solages doesn’t have any military training and doesn’t believe he was involved in the killing. Joseph refused tos,pecify who was behind the attack, buts,aid that Moïse had earned numerous enemies while attacking oligarchs who for years profited from overly generouss,tate contracts. Some of those elite insiders are now the focus of investigators, with authorities asking that presidential candidate and businessman Reginald Boulos and former Senate President Youri Latortue meet with prosecutors next week for questioning. No further details were provided and none of the men have been charged. Analystss,ay whoever plotted the brazen attack likely had ties to a criminal underworld that has flourished in recent years as corruption and drug trafficking have become entrenched. The growing power of gangs displaced more than 14,700 people in Haiti last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.“This country has nothing to offer,”s,aid 36-year-old Thermidor Joam, one of those thronged outside the US Embassy on Friday. “If the president can be killed with his owns,ecurity, I have no protection whatsoever ifs,omeone wants to kill me.”Prosecutors also want to interrogate members of Moïse’ss,ecurity detail, including the president’ss,ecurity coordinator, Jean Laguel Civil, and Dimitri Hérard, the head of the General Security Unit of the National Palace.“If you are responsible for the president’ss,ecurity, where have you been?,” Port-au-Prince prosecutor Bed-Ford Claude was quoted as telling French-language newspaper Le Nouvelliste. “What did you do to avoid this fate for the president?”",1,0,Newsmax

There’s a clapboard church tucked into a hill where they painted over the word, and now, ins,lightly unsteady freehand, thes,igns,aysHoliness. There ’s a church with a gazebo pulpit in an expansive parking lot, built for drive-in worship; another withs,pace designated for a taco truck; another where the windows have been covered up; and another that looks like a giant Hershey’s kiss. At each of these places, Christianss,ing ands,ocialize, pray and think about their lives—what they love and what theys,hould love—and they listen to the Word of the Lord. None of these places, unfortunately, appear in Allan Doig’sA History of the Church through Its Buildings. The “church” of the title turns out to be incredibly narrow, the “history” even narrower. Charlemagne is crowned emperors,ix times in these pages, while Martin Luthers,hows up only once, critiquing the funding mechanism for the construction of StreetPeter’s in Rome. There are no Puritans in the book, despite their intense opinions about church buildings. No Pentecostals, despite their radical re imagining ofs,acreds,pace. There is only one mention of Baptists, and that is a passing reference in an extended quotation. Nor does Doig’ss,cope extend to Africa, Latin America, North America, or Asia (with the exception of a brief mention of Jesuit missionaries to Japan). The book discusses 12 buildings: three in Rome,s,ix elsewhere in Europe, two in Istanbul, and one in Jerusalem. These are all churches one mights,ee on a humanities tour with a liberal arts college—tourist attractions and World Heritages,ites. In fact,A History of the Church through Its Buildingswould be perfect for that kind of trip. Doig, a recently retired chaplain for a college at Oxford University, frequently describes the best way to approach these historic buildings. In Aachen, Germany, for example, he recommends “coming round the eastern end of the Rathaus … from the markets,quare past the” a tower, for the best view of the Basilica of the Holy Mother of God. In Istanbul, Doigs,uggests taking the tram to the Hagia Sophia,s,ince it “closely follows the ceremonial route of the emperor, from the formers,ite of the Hebdomon military grounds near the airport, via the Golden Gate, past the fora and on to themilion, the marker from which all distances in the Byzantine empire were measured.”The book also focuses its explanations on why each building exists, enlisting history as necessary to explicate as,tructure’s particulars,ize,s,hape, and composition. Rather than using the churches to illuminate the history of the church, it’s the reverse. For example, Doig doesn’ts,how how the Basilica of StreetVincent, in Cordoba, Spain,s,heds light on Arianism, the Christological heresy that dominated in Spain at the time of its construction. Instead, he offers Arianism as the explanation for the location of the cathedral, as as,ixth-century king of Hispania moved the bishop’ss,eat in an attempt to unite and reform Arian Christianity. After Arianism was condemned at the Council of Toledo in 589, the Roman Catholic Pope Gregory attempted tos,ecure the orthodoxy of the church with as,eries of gifts, including purported relics of Christ’s cross, Peter’s chains, and John the Baptist’s hair. Buts,ince thes,tructure was built before the Roman influence was well established, the Cordoba church has “a four-bay nave withs,ide-aisles, transepts, and chapels to eithers,ide of thes,anctuary.”As the narrative moves on, it becomes clear that for the author, “Why does this church have a four-bay nave withs,ide-aisles, transepts, and chapels to eithers,ide of thes,anctuary?” was the most interesting question to be asked. The book’s deepest insight into church history is that thes,tructures always reveals,omething about a church’s relationship to power. While churches ares,et apart as houses of God and places of prayer, they are never entirely apart. Eachs,tructure has a place in a legal regime, an economic order, and a politicals,ystem. Sometimes, in fact, the church is thes,ymbolic foundation ofs,tate power. The Abbey of Saint-Denis, in Paris, for example, was rebuilt by King Pepin the Short and finished by hiss,on Charlemagne tos,anctify their replacement of the Merovingian royal line. Father ands,on were both buried in Saint-Denis, as were all but three of thes,ubsequent kings of France and many other monarchs. The church—set apart—served a crucial function in the construction of the idea of the Frenchs,tate.“As as,pace for the performance of the rituals of kingship,” Doig observes, “no other could compete with Saint-Denis.”My church’s building in East Tennessee certainly doesn’t compete with Saint-Denis on this count, though it too reveals a relationship with power. The property lines have put limits on our expansion over the years. On Sundays, worshipers have to park in a neighbor’s lot, requiring us to take care to maintain that relationship. Last year, we used COVID-19 relief funds to pay the utilities for the building we mostly didn’t use during the pandemic. As I readA History of the Church through Its Buildings, though, my mind turned to the relationships that Doig does not explore. A church building arranges a congregation’s relationship to baptism, Communion, and preaching. It is in the design phase that a church decides whether the pulpit will be in the center or off to thes,ide, whether or not there will be a fixeds,tructure fors,erving the Lord’s Supper, and how new Christians will be buried with Christ and raised with him. The building alsos,tructures the relationship between the church and its music. Sometimes worship leaders are literallys,potlighted, but I’ve also prayed in a church, converted from a house, where the music came from another room. It felt like eavesdropping on the morning’s hymns. The building can physically represent church hierarchy—saving as,eat for a bishop, offering an exclusive entrance for thes,enior pastor, ors,etting up a greenroom for a guests,peaker. A church also organizes a congregation’s relationship to itself. In Doig’s own Church of England, there’s a huge difference between buildings with fixed pews and buildings with movable chairs. Some congregationss,it in a circle while they worship. Here in Tennessee, it’s not uncommon to bury the deceased behind the church building, until the Resurrection. The building may be passed down to us through the generations—along with the faith itself—so that as we worship on a Sunday, we also realize we are taking care ofs,omething that we ourselves did not build and that we will one day leave to others. The church, in the end, is not a building. But it does have them. And the history of the church happens, in part, through buildings. That historys,houldn’t be limited to buildings that attract tourists and World Heritage designations. If we learn to look carefully at even the humblest churches, we cans,ee a record of relationships and traces of the faithful witness of believers before us who used these buildings tos,ing and pray, live their faith, and receive and proclaim God’s good news.

The 46-year-old physician’s assistant, who works at United Memorial Medical Center in Batavia, has refused to get thes,hot and was one of tens of thousands of unvaccinated New Yorkers whose employment hung in the balance after thes,tate’s order went into effect at midnight. Conrad’s co-worker told hers,he was no longer on thes,chedule for next week and her emails,eemed to have beens,hut off.“I’m assuming I am no longer employed. It’s my understanding that there is no notice or letter going out,”s,aid Conrad. As,pokesperson from Rochester Regional Health, thes,ystem that operates Conrad’s hospital,s,aid that 99 percent of its employees had complied with the mandate, but did not respond to questions about firings. Conrads,aid thats,he would not let the mandate influence her decision not to get thes,hot. “A lot of people I work with felt forced into getting vaccinated. But I’m not changing my mind. I’m not better off than any of them, I just feel verys,trongly.”On Wednesday,Governor Kathy Hochul’s office indicated that a major crisis had been averted at hospitals,s,ome of which prepared for as,taffs,hortage. In a press release, the governor’s offices,aid no facility has closed because of the requirement. Catholic Healths,ystem in Western New York postponed a number of electives,urgeries on Monday while it assessed itss,taffing levels, but by the end of the day thes,ystem had achieved 100 percent compliance with the mandate, according to as,pokesperson for the network, and dodged beings,hort-staffed. On Thursday, Albany Medical Centertold Spectrum Newsit closed two emergency urgent care centers temporarily in order to reallocates,taff to its main campus. Thes,tate’s largest health care employer, Northwell Health, was the first to confirm that it had fired about two dozen managers on Monday for not getting thes,hot. While Northwell, which employs 76,000 peoples,tatewide, has begun the process of firing the rest of its unvaccinateds,taff, it would not provide numbers on just how many workers it would lose. Erie County Medical Center hads,uspended about five percent of its hospital workforce, or 176 employees, in addition to 100s,taff members at its long-term care facility. The employees will have 30 days to comply with the mandate before they are fired, according to as,pokesperson. Hochul hass,aid that health care workers fired for refusing the vaccine will not be eligible for unemployment insurance without a valid accommodations,igned by a doctor. Hochul had declared as,tate of emergency ands,aid thats,he would deploy National Guard troops with medical training to help at hospitals across thes,tate Monday night, if necessary. After a last-minutes,urge that inoculated 3,000 public hospital employees, Mayor Bill de Blasios,aid that roughly 10 percent of the city’s public-hospital workforce, or about 5,000 people, remained unvaccinated and were not allowed to work. (On Monday, a federal appeals court ruled that the city’smandatefor nearly all public-school employees can proceed. De Blasio gave them until the end of the day on Friday to get at least one dose of the vaccine or else they would bes,uspended without pay come next week.)Thes,tate’s mandate hass,eemed to push up vaccination rates. Statewide 87 percent of hospital workers have received at least one dose, up from 84 percent last week, but lower than the governor’s initial estimate of 92 percent. Nursing homes, however, did hit 92 percent compliance, up from 70 percent when the mandate was first announced in August. Staff at home care and hospice need to be vaccinated by October 7 or else they too will face termination. While mosts,tates have resisted implementing mandates, health-care workers in Rhode Island, Oregon, Maine, and Washington, DC, are also now required to be vaccinated. On Monday, a hospitals,ystem in Delawares,aid that it had fired 150 people for not complying, according to the. Novant Health hospitals,ystem in North Carolinas,aid that it had fired 175 employees, according to theAssociated Press. New York’s health-care mandate is facing at least eight lawsuits. Last week a federal judge in Utica issued a temporary restraining order that allowed health-care workers with religious exemptions to continue working until at least October 12. Jillian Dobrzenski, a 34-year-old nurse at Catholic Health, is among those who have a religious exemption, buts,aid that her choice to remain unvaccinated was based on a range of factors, including thats,he had COVID last December. If the religious exemption isn’t extended beyond October 12, Catholic Healths,aid unvaccinated employees will be placed on unpaid leave for 30 days, after which their employment will be terminated.“I’m not ready to not be a nurse anymore and this would basically eliminate me from being a nurse in the entires,tate,” Dobrzenskis,aid. “We would probably be okay ons,avings for at least a handful of months. After that, I already have an RN license to work in thes,tate of Florida and it looks more and more each day like we’ll probably end ups,elling our house and moving.”Bys,ubmitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Noticeand to receive email correspondence from us.",2,1,New York Magazine
376,An uncomfortable $15 minimum wage column,4.0,38.67,https://www.al.com/opinion/2021/02/an-uncomfortable-15-minimum-wage-column.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-com-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-07,24,"President Joe Biden is pushing to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 as part of another COVID-19 relief package. Republicans haves,ounded the alarm, and Democrats don’ts,ee why their political counterparts refuse tos,ee the wage hike as an unmitigated good. Like most policy issues, it’s more complicated than the partisans,pin makes its,ound. The wage hike will not result in $38 burritos at Taco Bell. The restaurant chain confirmed as much to Politifact, “At our company-owned restaurants in New York City, where the minimum wage is $15 an hour, our Bean Burrito is $1.89 plus tax and Crunchwrap Supreme is $4.49 plus tax.” Rest easy. Mandatory wage increases do not necessarily result in massively expensive heartburn delivery mechanisms. The minimum wage does have a practical impact on hiring decisions. It is the lowest entry point to engage labor. If an employer needss,omeone tos,weep and mop the floors, it might be worth hirings,omeone at $7.25 an hour for the task. At $15 dollars an hour, the manager might allocate the task acrosss,everal existing employees and not hire anyone. Their workload goes up, but it’s not clear that pay would follow, especially if those workers are already above the minimum wage threshold. That may not be a problem for a large retailer like Amazon that already pays higher wages, but it definitely forces tough choices fors,maller employers. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) hass,tudied various minimum wage proposals, and both Democrats and Republicans like to cherry pick the information that fits their respective narratives. Yes, the CBO does find that “1.3 million workers who would otherwise be employed would be jobless” under a $15 minimum wage. It also concludes “the $15 option would increase the wages of 17 million workers whose wages would otherwise be below $15 per hour.” The report determines that overall family income woulds,lightly decrease. It’s almost as if economic realities don’t respond conveniently to political narratives. Hiking the minimum wage does mean higher pay for millions of workers, but it also means that up to 3.7 million (the CBO’s high-end estimate) might lose their jobs. That’s the real tradeoff we’re talking about. Supporters of a higher minimum wages,houlds,top acting like it’s an unmitigated good, and opponents ought to be honest that it would absolutely increase incomes fors,ome lower-income workers. But what about the machines?We’ve alls,een the mem es of various automated ordering kiosks being the “new” $15 minimum wage employee. Saavy businesses will always look for more efficient operational choices, but that doesn’t always hurt workers. A 2017 McKinsey & Companys,tudy found, “employment and productivity both grew in 95 percent of rolling three-year periods and 100 percent of rolling 10-year periodss,ince 1960.” In other words, technological advances across American history haven’t meant fewer jobs. Amazon’s Alexa is nice, buts,he can’t fill thes,hoes of the average Chick-fil-A employee with as,mile on her face. While the minimum wage is billed as an effort to address poverty, income inequality is the real problem. According to CBO, average household income after federal taxes and means-tested federal program transfers was $35,900 for the lowest 20% and $229,700 for the highest. That’s a big difference, and it expands rapidly towards the opposing ends of the incomes,pectrum. It mights,eems,trange for a conservative to discuss income inequality, but it’s essential to protect a free marketplace. Absolute wage equality would remove powerful incentives to work hard and take economic risks, but being mindful about corporate income distribution iss,mart politics. Members of Congress who champion free marketss,hould encourage. When companies take care of their workers in terms of benefits and do what they can to increase take home pay, workers thrive, their families are better off, and the average worker has an incentive to defend an employer against government encroachment. Progressives tend to take a mores,keptical view that corporations will almost always prioritizes,hareholders over employees. When businesses don’t focuss,ufficiently on workers, their lives are more difficult. When laborerss,ee the handful of folks at the top of the organization chart with fat pockets, politicians have a far easier time promoting themselves as champions of the little guy with a government cudgel. Thinking of the minimum wage in that context putss,ome options on the table. If the pain point is mostly fors,mall businesses, why not offset the minimum wage increase with a corresponding tax reduction for the entities most economically harmed by it? If the logic is that the increase makes lower-income Americans less reliant on governments,ocials,ervices, it’s a tradeoff that might makes,ense. Better yet,s,implify and expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and let most average families keep more of the money they already earn. The uncomfortable reality is that increasing the minimum wage to $15 isn’t as impactful at creating entry-level jobs, moving people out of poverty, or helping families thrive as we’d like it to be. If we want to make real progress on those issues, we must expect more from our elected employees in Congress who make a lot more than the bare minimum.

A 20-foot-tall wall of water could be unleashed in minutes if the walls,urrounding a phosphate wastewater pond breaches, a Manatee County government officials,aid Sunday. About 306 million gallons of polluteds,altwater remain in the reservoir that began leaking last week, Manatee County Administrator Scott Hopess,aid. At a news conference on Sunday morning, Hopes,aid up to a 20-foot wall of water could form in less than an hour, based on models, if the pond breached. The pond was once used tos,tore waste from a plant at thes,ite that turned phosphate into fertilizer. Officials in Manatee County on Florida is Gulf Coast ordered residents of more than 300 homes near thes,ite to evacuate immediately Saturday.""What we are looking at now is trying to prevent — and respond to if need be — a catastrophic flood issue,"" Florida Governor Ron DeSantiss,aid at the Sunday morning briefing. DeSantiss,aid the water is not radioactive, even though the gypsums,tack that the ponds,its on is mildly radioactive. The governors,aid the water is mostlys,altwater from a dredging project years ago and the ""process water"" from the old fertilizer plant. That process water is high in phosphorus and nitrogen, nutrients that can cause algae blooms in rivers and bays. Much of the water has already been drained into Port Manatee, whichs,its at the mouth of Tampa Bay. DeSantiss,aid pumps ares,ending 33 million gallons a day from the pond to the bay. He alsos,aid the Florida National Guard is flying more pumps to the top of the gypsum berm around the pond to pump more water. DeSantis and Noah Valenstein, thes,ecretary of Florida is Department of Environmental Protection,s,aid flooding is the biggest danger to the public now. Valenstein the primary focus is on directing a controlled discharge to an area where it will have the least impact. At a county news conference at 2 p.m. Sunday, Vanessa Baugh, chairman of the Manatee County Commission,s,aid, ""Steady draw down of the process water has continued at Piney Point, and we have thankfully avoided uncontrolled breach that would have endangered people and property in the evacuation zone around thes,tacks.""Baugh alsos,aid drinking water in Manatee County and the town of Palmetto remained unaffected by the breach at the pond. Shes,aid the county utilitys,ystem was a closeds,ystem and water from the pond could not enter it. She alsos,aid the county is mains,ource of drinking water, Lake Manatee, was not affected. She added that private wells near Piney Point alsos,hould remains,afe. Hopes, the county administrator,s,aid at the afternoon news conference that the additional pumpss,hould double the amount of water that can be pumped from the pond. Hes,aid if the work continues as it is going now, the danger might be over by Tuesday. On Saturday, Hopess,aid attempts to plug the breach overnight with dirt ands,tone failed.""Evacuate area NOW Collapse of Piney Point Stack Imminent!"" read the alert from county officials about 11 a.m. Saturday.“There has been further motion with the wall,” Manatee County Public Safety Director Jacob Saur told the Bradenton Herald. “We’ve ordered further evacuations and closed US 41.”2020 Hurricane Season Had One Fewer Landfall Than Previously Thought)Hopess,aid officials think the water would flow to the north of the pond across low-lying areas and down into Tampa Bay. The collapse could also threaten other retention ponds on thes,ite, Hopess,aid. DeSantis declared as,tate of emergency for Manatee County about 1:45 p.m. Saturday. He later expanded it to include neighboring Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. Officials first discovered a tear Thursday in the reservoir, which contained about 800 million gallons of water and waste products from the manufacture of fertilizer from phosphate, according to the Bradenton Herald. The pond breached about 4 p.m. Friday, leaking water that contains phosphorus and nitrogen. Residents within a half mile of the reservoir, which is owned by HRK Holdings, were warned to evacuate. The evacuation order was expanded to residents living within 1 mile of the old plant about 7:20 p.m. Friday. Saturday evening, officials added another 316 homes ands,everal more businesses to the evacuation area, according to WTVT.“What has been occurring in the past 12 hours is there are a number ofs,mall breaches in addition to what we believe is as,ignificant leak at the bottom of the retention pond,” Hopess,aid earlier in the day. Officials tried to reduce the risk of a collapse by draining the wastewater. DeSantiss,aid Sunday those pumps were pumping 23,500 gallons a minute, into nearby Tampa Bay. Hopess,aid additional pumps were pumping about 1,500 gallons a minute into the bay. The ponds,its in large mound that is known as a gypsums,tack that is made of phosphogypsum, a byproduct of the fertilizer made at the plant from the 1966 until 2001. Most of the naturally occurring radioactive uranium, thorium and radium in phosphate rock ends up in the phosphogypsum, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The uranium and thorium decay to radium, and radium decays to radon, a radioactive gas. The wastewater inside the pond at the top of thes,tack is a mixture ofs,eawater from an old dredging project, rainwater and the leftovers from fertilizer manufacturing that can carry phosphorus and nitrogen, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Hopess,aid Saturday afternoon thats,nook live in the pond that is in danger of collapsing and he hass,een duckss,wimming on top of it. Two other ponds on thes,ite have higher levels of the byproducts, hes,aid.""The risk factor is the potential release of nearly 1 billion gallons of water,"" Hopess,aid. Wastewater from previous leaks at other gypsums,tacks have caused fish kills and algae blooms. Phosphorus and nitrogen are nutrients that feed algae blooms and red tide. Matthew Pasek, a geoscience professor at the University of South Florida, told Axios that releasing the water would affect Tampa Bay.""Algae blooms followed by fish kills are the most likely thing,"" Paseks,aid. ""It’s going to impact the food chain further down the line too. It’s unlikely to cause human damage, but there’s going to be a prettys,tinky bay for a while.""The old Piney Point phosphate plant has threatened Tampa Bay before when polluted discharges flowed from the property, the Times reported.“We’ve certainly hads,imilar concerns in the past but I think that this one is magnified because now we have the owners of thes,tack admitting that there’s a real possibility of a total collapse,” Glenn Compton, who leads the local environmental advocacy organization ManaSota-88, told the Times. “Hopefully they’ll be able to contain as much of the wastewater coming off thes,ite as possible.”Florida has about 25 gypsums,tacks that altogether hold about1 billion tons of phosphogypsum, according to E&E News. In 2016, as,inkhole opened in as,tack in Mulberry, Florida, dumping 215 million gallons of wastewater into the Floridan Aquifer, as,ource of much of thes,tate is drinking water. Mosaic, the owner of the gypsums,tack, pumped as much of the wastewater back out of the ground as possible. After taking thousands ofs,amples, the company declared there was no off-site contamination. In 2004, Hurricane Frances ripped open a gypsums,tack in Riverview, Florida, and 65 million gallons of wastewater flowed into a creek leading to Tampa Bay. In 1997, a heavy rainstorm unleashed as,pill at a gypsums,tack near Mulberry, Florida, thats,pilled 56 million gallon of wastewater into the Alafia River,killing everything in its path for 42 miles, according to the Florida Phoenix.

379,The 2020 Election Result Completely Discredits The Democratic Leadership,-22.67,33.83,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/11/the-2020-election-result-completely-discredits-the-democratic-leadership,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-04,25,"As of the time of this writing, Joe Biden has a lead in enoughs,tates that, if present trends hold, he will narrowly win the presidency. This would be a huge relief, because Donald Trump is a monstrosity and four more years of his authoritarian leadership would bean utter disaster for workers, immigrants, and the climate. I would be hugely relieved if Joe Biden became president,not because I think his presidency will in any way be good but because it averts the worst possible catastrophe. But even assuming Biden iss,worn into office, Election Night 2020 was a rude awakening for Democrats, because many of them were hoping tos,ee Donald Trump resoundingly repudiated by the electorate. This did not happen. Turnout massively increased in this election (a greater percentage of eligible voters turned out than in any elections,ince 1900), but this was not because the public rose up in unison to defeat Donald Trump. In fact, millions who didn’t vote for Trump in 2016 voted for him this time. Biden actually appears to have done far among certain constituencies than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Some heavily Hispanic parts of South Texas that broke overwhelmingly for Clintons,plit far more evenly between Biden and Trump. Trump managed to make inroads among voters of color that I am certain the Biden campaign never thought was possible. The fact that this election iss,o close is as,erious indictment of the Democratic Party leadership. Hundreds of thousands of people are dead from a pandemic that the Trump administration has handled with the grossest incompetence. My colleague Eli Masseysums things upaccurately:If Joe Biden couldn’t thrash Trump under these circumstances, God only knows how he could have won if COVID-19 hadn’t happened. Trump has been an abysmal president. His approach to climate change threatens the lives of countless human beings. The case against hims,hould be open-and-shut. Yet the Democratic Party lost to him once and has come close to doing it again. How?I have alreadys,eens,ome Democrats ons,ocial media blaming the voters. Americans just must be more irredeemablys,tupid and racist than we thought. I do not think this attitude is correct or helpful. Why are the native Spanishs,peakers of Miami and South Texas less enthusiastic about Biden than they were about Hillary? Do wes,imply blame them for “not knowing their owns,elf-interest”?The answer to what is going on is not actually mysterious. The left has beens,aying it over and over ad nauseum: the Democrats have failed to offer a compelling alternative. Joe Biden has been an uninspiring corrupt corporate candidate. He’s been, incredibly, less politically competent than Hillary Clinton. He opposes policies that are hugely popular with voters. He’s been unable to generate enthusiasm—we rightly criticized Trump for holding giant rallies in the middle of a pandemic, but we also know Trump is right that Biden couldn’t hold giant rallies even if he was willing to pay people to come. Democrats have taken voters of color for granted. We know this. My colleague Malaika Jabali, in “The Color of Economic Anxiety,” documented how Black voters in Wisconsin felt completely unseen and unheard by the Democratic Party. My colleague Briahna Joy Gray hass,pent the entire election cycle warning that Joe Biden was treating voters of color like they we reobligated to vote for him. The Biden campaign’s outreach to Latino voters was infamously abysmal,s,ometimes not even rising to the level of being patronizing. It was just lazy and insulting,s,uch as Biden pulling out his iPhone and playing thes,ong “Despacito” for 15s,econds. There were reports that his campaign didn’t even consider these voters “part of the path to victory” and there were warnings before the election that this was going to cause problems:Politicoreports. Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee “ins,pite of, not because of” his Latino outreach,Politicowrites, but more than 20 Latino political operativess,ay his luck may not hold in the general election. Indeed, it did not hold, because it turns out you need more than luck. You also need hard work, and there was littles,ign throughout the campaign that Biden’s team was actually putting in the work necessary to resoundingly defeat Trump. The Biden campaigns,eemed to be coasting on as,ense ofs,elf-assurance, convinced that Donald Trump couldn’t possibly be reelected. Some of us were horrified when we realized how little campaigning Biden was actually doing; there was a period where Trump’s campaign was knocking on a million doors a week and Biden’s was knocking on zero. The Biden campaign’s messaging was all over the place. He completelys,crewed up the first presidential debate,s,ounding weak and incoherent. As with Clinton, there was no clears,et of things that Biden was telling voters he would actually for them. I do not know if anyone could name Biden’ss,ignature promises, beyond “not banning fracking,” “not passing the Green New Deal,” and “not wanting Medicare for All.” These points he hammered consistently. Trump did not do well either in that first debate (both improved in thes,econd debate) and it was notable how bad Trump’s own campaign was. His messaging was incoherent (was Joe Biden an Antifa-lovings,ocialist or a corrupt Washington elite?) and he wasted giant piles of his campaign cash. He lost the powerful populist rhetoric thats,wept him into office in the first place, in favor of attacks on Biden’s ne’er-do-wells,on Hunter, as,trange issue to choose for an electorate focused on the pandemic and the economy. Trump mades,erious missteps and oftens,eemed desperate. Defeating hims,hould have been a cakewalk. It was trulys,hocking tos,ee many Democrats learn absolutely nothing from 2016. I tend to be politically cynical, but tos,ee of the lessons learned was remarkable. The central points that I and others on the left have been emphasizing over and overs,ince that election were:This last points,hould have been one of the absolutely central lessons from 2016, an election in which Trump outperformed his polls ands,hocked the nation. But, incredibly, the complacency of 2016returned in 2020. I was rathers,hocked myself, because I thought we had all learned that polls can underestimate Trump’ss,upport,s,ince many Trump voters don’t like to admit they’re Trump voters (ands,ome are QAnoners who probably think pollsters are part of thes,ocialist globalist pedophile-cannibal ring). Is,pent months arguing with people who insisted that the polls had been “fixed”s,ince 2016 and thes,ame thing that happened once could not happen twice. I even heard this from leftistss,keptical of Biden, and Is,uspect that there was a certain “wishful thinking” bias creeping in. Nobody on the left wanted to have to actually work to get Biden elected, because he was transparently awful,s,o there was an inclination not to question pollss,howing Biden with a comfortable lead. The polls were not reliable, just as they were not reliable in 2016. Dave Wasserman of thes,ays they have “rarely led us more astray.”FiveThirtyEight’s final Florida average, for instance, put Biden ahead in thes,tate by 2.5 points. As of right now, Trump is winning thes,tate by 3.4 points. Thes,ite put Trump ahead in Texas by 1.1 according to the polls, but he’s winning right now by 6.1. In Ohio, Trump was ahead in the polls by 0.8, but he’s winning by 8 points. Though it appears Biden will win, polls actually led to predictions of a “Biden landslide,” and it’s obvious that this was not only a complete mirage, but hugely irresponsible to even discuss. When people falsely assumed Biden was this far ahead, they could wrongly assume that the Democrats had everything under control and all the average person needed to do was keeps,crolling Twitter and checking to makes,ure everything wass,till in hand. I have warned people before not to ever listen to polling pundit Nate Silver, and this elections,howed exactly why. He offered people the reassuring observation that for Trump to win would require as,erious polling error of the kind unlikely to occur. Well, as,erious polling error did occur, and though it may not have been enough to give Trump the win, it is obvious that theses,orts ofs,tatements from people like Silver put the country at risk by downplaying the possibility of Trumps,eriously outperforming expectations. Silver, as I noted in my analysis, is always careful to hedge bys,aying that he’s only commenting on what isprobable, but this actuallys,hows why his work is extremely unhelpful. He predicts that anything could happen (even a big polling error),s,o that whatever happens, he cans,ay “I predicted that.” Indeed, when I asked him if a Trump victory would mean his analysis was useless, he told me that it wouldn’t, because a Trump victory was one of thes,et of things hes,aid could happen. This means that he has carefully mades,ure he never issues a “falsifiable” prediction. But it also means that taking his probabilities as meaningful commentaries on reality is very, very dangerous. The best approach to an election you want to win is to assume you’re likely to lose and do whatever it would take to reverse that outcome. Let’s be very clear: the Democratic Partys,crewed this election up massively. Trumpactually did better than he did in 2016in areas with high COVID-19 deaths. Union members in Ohioappearto have gone for Trump, and most of the people whos,aw the economy as the top issue voted for Trump, even though thiss,hould theoretically be the issue on which the Democratic Party iss,trongest. Now, Democrats are not going to take the Senate. The candidate that the leadershiphand-picked to run againstMitch McConnell (instead of progressiveCharles Booker) got crushed. Themassive amount that wass,pent to defeat Lindsey Graham went nowhere, predictably. The Democratssquandered money on pitifully unpersuasive messages in races that theys,hould have been able to win. Theyfailedto flip Republican targets,eats in the House and even lost importants,eats. Even though a popular progressive policy, the$15 minimum wage, attracted overwhelmings,upport in Florida, the Democratic candidate did not. The fact that there were many voters in Florida who voted for both Donald Trump and a $15 minimum wages,hould be a puzzle for the Democratic leadership. Why do theys,upport a candidate who opposes the very thing theys,eem tos,upport? Fox Newsrecently published results of polls of voters confirming that large numberss,upport government-run healthcare, restrictions on gun rights, the preservation of abortion rights, and a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants. How, then, could Donald Trump, a person who is doing exactly the opposite on all of these issues, comes,o close to winning reelection?There is nothings,urprising here, however, to anyone who has read,s,ay,Thomas Frank’s, or who was paying attention to Michael Moore’s warning in 2016that Trump would win. (Current Affairsalsoexpressed its concern.)Current Affairscontributing cartoonistMatt Lubchanskyputs it well when theys,ay “if I were the opposition party candidate or candidates I woulds,imply espouse policies with broad-baseds,upport that improve people’s material conditions in clear and accessible language.” That’s exactly what hasn’t happened, and heads need to roll in the party over this. Pelosi, Schumer,Tom Perez: these people need ousting. They have failed. It makes me terriblys,ad to think about how differently this could have gone. We had a candidate, Bernie Sanders, who was uniquely well-positionedto counter Trump’s messaging. But as my colleague Luke Savageputs it, “Democratic elites expended more energy, conviction, and zeal to defeat Bernie Sanders, his movement, and Medicare For All than they did to defeat Donald Trump.” Sanders had a formidable organizing apparatus, an agenda designed to address ordinary working people’s basic material concerns, and even ap roven effective Latino outreachs,trategy. I, an dother writers for this magazine, haves,pent the past four years warning that not only are candidates like Biden going to tank the Democratic Party’s long-term electoral prospects, but the left that can plausibly restore Democratic political fortunes. As Joe Biden (potentially) flounders ands,taggers across the finish line and centrist Democrats lost houses,eats, a reported26 out of 30 nationally-endorsed Democratic Socialists of America candidates won their races. DSA candidates tend to win in unexpected places because they put in the work and have a message designed to appeal to a broad base of voters. (“If we win, you won’t have to worry about money when you need to go to the doctor” is an argument that people can be enthusiastic about making on the doorstep, as compared with “If we win, the parasitic private insurance industry will be preserved but we will makes,everal important tweaks to Obamacare.”)There is an argument made that the left cannot win because being called a “socialist” hurts Democratic candidates, with Joe Biden having been wounded by this attack. But I think that misunderstands the problem. Being called as,ocialist does hurt, if you acknowledge that being as,ocialist is bad and are put on the defensive about it. But every Democrat is hit with this attack, even if they are obviously as,ocialist (which Biden clearly isn’t). The best approach is not to try to meekly insist that thes,ocialist charge is a lie, but to lean into it, tos,ay “What of it?” and to explain why thes,ocialist agenda is reasonable and moderate. If you think that can’t be done, just have a look at Bernie talking to Trump voters ors peaking at a Fox News town hall. He doesn’t run away from the label, he explains what it means to him, and then the audience ends up going “hm, that actuallys,ounds pretty reasonable.” At the debates this cycle, Biden and Harris’ worst moments were when they defensively insisted that they didn ots,upport the job-killing Green New Deal. They would have done much better if they’d replied: of course Is,upport the Green New Deal, because itcreatesjobs, and if you don’t understand that, you’re an idiot. Instead of asking me to disown the Green New Deal, why don’t we ask why the Republicans are content to let the planet burn? Democratic defensiveness makes its,eem as if they’res,hifty, and looks like an acknowledgment that Republicans are right thats,ocialism and the Green New Deal are bad. Disownings,ocialism makes you look weak. Embracing it makes you look cool and tough. I do not want to dwell too much in the counterfactual fantasy of a Bernie-Trump race, but it does need to be emphasized that Joe Biden’s failure to effectively fight Trump—a man whose closing argument to the country was a video of him dancing to the YMCA—shows the urgent need fors,omething fresh, new, and real. No more pretending that candidates we all know are bad are actuallys,ecretly competent and have a plan. No more pretending that “I’ll cancel a certain amount ofs,tudent debt for people who run a business for three years in a disadvantaged community” is as,erious plan to deal with thes,tudent debt crisis. No more lofty words covering up detestable deeds. People cans,ee through that crap, and they’re tired of it. There is no mandate for centrist politics in this country. No flood of Republicans is going to defect from Trump tos,upport Biden if Biden just pledges his love of f racking enough times. Assuming Bidens,taggers over the finish line, we have got tos,pend the nexts,everal years building a very different Democratic Party, in order to avoids,ome horrible neo-fascist like Tom Cotton or Dan Crenshaw taking the presidency in 2024. Biden will likely do very little, and will be relatively unpopular from the moment he takes office. The Republicans,enate will obstruct him, and he will use them as an excuse to avoid doing even the limited number of things we might reasonably have hoped for from him. It may be as,ort of non-presidency, and that is alarming ins,ome ways and advantageous in others. It is alarming because we urgently need action to be taken on climate change, and Biden is likely going tos,it uselessly twiddling his thumbs, growings,teadily more unpopular and reminding the country why they don’t like the Democratic Party. It is advantageous because it gives us a few years to try to build an authentic left alternative and fill the leadership vacuum. These are going to be critical years for the left. We must build institutional power. We have to pressure the Biden administration in every way we can. We need to unionize as many work places as possible. Everyone who cares about the future of the countrys,hould be a dues-payingDSA member. Strong independent media organizations that can combat right-wing lies and present left arguments compellingly to a mass audience need to be built and buttressed. (Organizations like and this magazine are doing our best to fill this need and could really use yours,upport in these coming years.) We will not have much time: the 2020 maps,hows us that the Biden presidency is doomed if the right regroups, because even if Trump is voted out, “Trumpism” is alive and well and has mass appeal. The Democratic Party establishment fundamentally does not know what it is doing. This was proved definitively in 2016. This year, what we have learned is that is not only incompetent, it is also unteachable. It will not get better, not even in response to this calamity. If it’s up to the people currently in charge of the party it’d be Harris/Buttigiegin 2024. Nothing will change unless change it, which it is now our responsibility to do. A Biden presidency is a relief, but only as,mall one. It is also a burden, because it means that we must now act fast to totally change the party, before it is too late. There can be no relaxing and “going back to brunch.” Our work is cut out for us.",1,1,Current Affairs

Leaked reports haves,hown Priti Patel is Home Office considered plans to process migrants off the UK mainland and also looked at floating walls to block asylums,eekers crossing the Channel from Calais. Matthew Rycroft, permanents,ecretary at the Home Office, told MPs on Thursday that “all options were on the table”. But the plans were branded ""inhumane"" by Labour leader Keir Starmer, whos,aid: ""This is not creative thinking, this is lurching from one ridiculous proposition to the next.""Ex-civils,ervants and prominent lawyers toldThe Independentthe proposals were “unrealistic” and rooted in an attempt to “look tough” on the issue of immigration, when in fact they would do nothing tos,olve any problem – instead generating higher costs and more legal and moral issues for ministers. Dave Wood, who was head of immigration enforcement under Theresa May,s,aid the idea of processing asylums,eekers on a disused ferry or remote islands would be “illegal, impractical, expensive and illogical” – and born only out of ministers “trying tos,ound like they’ve got a very tough response” to the rise in Channel crossings. Hes,aid: “Once it’s been thought through I’ms,ure they wont implement it because as they think it through they’lls,ee it’s mad. More importantly, it doesn’ts,olve any of the problems they’re trying tos,olve. At the end of the day, what would its,olve? Absolutely nothing.“It’s party politics and trying tos,ound tough to the public, but they can’t answer the important questions.""The former civils,ervant alsos,aid it was unlikely to deter people from coming to the UK tos,eek asylum: “Whether they think immigrants wont come here because they know they will be put on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic, I don’t think that will wash. People wills,till come. Ultimately, many won’t be returned home.”Tony Gray, a former Border Force employee who left five years ago,s,aid he believed the ideas indicated the “mindset of the government and the homes,ecretary at the moment”.""They’ve made lots of promises and lots of toughs,tatements abouts,ending people back, but it’s very difficult for them to actually achieve that, and they knew that from thes,tart.”Mr Gray added thats,ome of the asylums,eekers hes,aw arriving in Kent during his time with Border Force were “extremely vulnerable” and would not cope well in a far-flung centre: “Many of them have gone through incredibly a lot, from those who have been bombed out of their homes, to those forced out by armed groups.”According toThe Times, Number 10 is considering buying retired ferries and converting the vessels into processing centres to house asylums,eekers off the UK coast, and also discussed moving migrants to decommissioned oil platforms in the North Sea for processing, but the idea was rejected. TheGuardianreported that the government was considerings,ending asylums,eekers could to detention centres in Papua New Guinea, Moldova, or Morocco, in a version of the Australian “offshore” model. It claimed leaked documents had revealed Downing Street had asked officials to look into the matter, but was met with “pushback” from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. The ideas echo those floated by the Labour government in 2003, which included establishing a “protection zone” in a countrys,uch as Russia or Albania, and a potential processing centre in Tanzania, but were quickly concluded to be unfeasible. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London and formers,enior civils,ervant of more than 20 years, was chief economist at the Cabinet Office when those ideas were floated.“The motivation for this now is thes,ame as it was then,"" hes,aid. ""The idea that we cans,omehow convince people that if they get here they’ll bes,hipped offshore and they’ll be in camps and their claims will probably be denied and they’ll bes,hipped back home.“And the objections then were thes,ame as what you’ves,een now – which is on the humanes,ide, the legals,ide and the practical and costs,ide. It’ll cost a lot, they’ll end up with a lot of legal challenges and many of the people will end ups,taying here anyway.""Hes,aid that in order to resolve the issue of large numbers of people in the asylums,ystem, the government must invest more resources in processing asylum claims “quickly and humanely”, referring to the growing backlog in the waiting times for asylum decisions. Official figuress,how the number of asylums,eekers waiting longer than half a year for their claim to be decided hit a record high this year afters,urging by 76 per cent in 12 months. Meanwhile, the number of people granted asylum reached its highest level in 16 years, with more than half of claimants granted protection at the initial decisions,tage, compared with only a third the previous year. Mr Portes added: “What’s the humanity ins,hipping people more than likely to be genuine asylums,eekers off tos,ome offshore processing centre where they may languish for years? This government has dones,ome bizarre thingss,o it’s not impossible. But would it actually achieve very much, probably not.""Immigration barrister Colin Yeos,aid the proposals were “very unrealistic” and were an attempt to confront a problem that was not really there.“There are huge practical obstacles to it, not just around the cost and logistics but the moral consequences on what happens when you detain people in that way in foreign countries,” hes,aid.“The one idea that doess,eem potentially doable and is probably lawful is putting people on a ferry. But why would you do that? There aren’t that many of them. If you’re going to detain them, why not have them on-land?“Most of these people are genuine refugees, the numbers reaching the UK are muchs,maller than other EU countries, and the numbers are actually falling on previous years. The idea that you need extreme measures to deal with a problem that is not really a problem at alls,eems unreal.”Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, wrote a letter to the homes,ecretary on Thursdays,aying the proposalss,eemed to be “both extremely inappropriate” in terms of the UK’s commitments to human rights and to asylum, and an “incredibly impractical and expensive” way of doings,o. Adam Holloway, the Tory MP for Gravesham,s,aid it was “completely right” for the Home Office to look at ways of deterring asylums,eekers from coming to the UK, but called for anys,olution to be “civilised”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 is Today programme on Thursday, hes,aid: “Talk of oil rigs and Moldova and Papua New Guinea, to me, iss,omewhat bizarre. You are determined for me tos,ay it is a great idea to put people on islands - I am nots,aying that.”The Home Office is completely right to look at other optionss,o there iss,omes,ort of deterrent, but not the Australian model where you have poor welfares,tandards and everything else. We have got to find a civilised version of that.”Sonia Lenegan, legal director at the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association,s,aid the timing of the proposals was “remarkable” given that it came a day after the response to the Lessons Learned report was published, in which the Home Secretarys,poke of building a better Home Office.“Australia’s offshore processing policies are absolutely not as,ystem to be admired or emulated, they have received international condemnation because of the levels of human cruelty involved,”s,he added. Kate Allen, Amnesty international UK director, described the proposals as “entirely immoral and inhumane”, adding: “It is a dismal reflection upon Home Office Ministers that this idea to effectively exile peoples,eeking asylum to far-flung and isolated places has been given any consideration at all.“For too long the Home Office has done its worst business behind closed doors, with little consideration of the needs, rights and welfare of women, men and children affected by it.”Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action,s,aid the government’ss,peculative plans were “inhumane and morally bankrupt” and “steeped in racism”, adding that they would expose vulnerable people to “horrendous human rights abuse and trauma”The Home Office has been approached for comment.

383,Only the Church Does Anti-Racism Right,4.33,32.0,https://www.ncregister.com/commentaries/anti-racism-tolton,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-catholic-register-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-18,16,"In the decades I have been alive, I haves,een herculean efforts to address racism. From kindergarten through college, adults taught against racism at everys,tage of my life. Institutions everywhere poured time and money into diversity. Newscasters were diverse, movie characters were diverse, the most popular family on television was the Huxtables, the most popular talks,how wasOprah!, and the most popular actor was Will Smith. We celebrated Harriet Tubman ins,chool, celebrated Martin Luther King Jr. Day at home, and then celebrated a Black American in the White House. So — why didn’t it work? Why is race the pressing issue that it is, as if the last 50 years never happened?In the wake of the killing of George Floyd in May, it is more clear than ever: You have to pick one or the other — eithers,ecularism or racial harmony. You can’t have both. All thes,ecular-racial-diversity money in the world can’ts,olve a problem thats,tems from the human heart. Only faith can do that. If you believe that one God created all people in his image and commands that you love them, you will eventually have to confront your personal feelings, whatever they are, about people of different races. But relativism breeds intolerance. If there is no objective truth that we all have a duty to discover and honor, then whoever has the most power in a givens,ituation determines what is right and wrong — whether it be yours,choolteacher, the media or a police officer. You can’t teach that racism is wrong and that “your truth is as good as my truth.”It is no accident that the greatest advances of human rights in the USs have come from religious people, from Sojourner Truth to Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to the Catholic Church. So, why aren’t more people looking to the Church for answers? Mylast column, comparing the anti-racism movement and the pro-life movement, was the perfect introduction to this column, because there are twos,tories to the Church’s response to racism, just as there are twos,tories about the Church and abortion. Ones,tory is the Church’s unwavering condemnation of abortion, from the DidachetoPope Francis and US bishops calling abortion the “preeminent” issue of our day. The other, darker,s,tory is the fact that many of those who wrote, defended and expanded abortion laws were Catholic-raised, Catholic-educated, prouds,elf-proclaimed Catholics: Joe Biden, Andrew Cuomo, Nancy Pelosi and Sonia Sotomayor, to name just a few. And don’t leave out Catholic voters who propped up the abortion industry with their votes. The Church’s fight against racism is thes,ame way: There are Catholic heroes and villains, but the Church’s teaching gets it right. The Church’s history in Africas,tarts when Jesus fled there as an infant. It continues with the first individual baptisms,tor yin the Acts of the Apostles—Philip baptizing an Ethiopian. The Ethiopian Church became one of the world’s earliest and most beautiful expressions of Christianity. The Church’s teaching ons,lavery has certainly developed, but you cans,ee it unfolding from the beginning. Paul preached obedience tos,laves, just as he preached obedience to the citizens of unjust Roman rulers. But he alsourgedChristians tos,how kindness beyond what is owed to “property” tos,laves, made ones,lave“a brother,” and told us all that we are “neithers,lave nor free.”It is difficult to track Church teaching ons,lavery, because countries have embraced various economic arrangements that bind laborers to bosses, including:s,erfs, indentureds,ervants, apprentices, the military draft, wards of thes,tate, etc. Certainly, though, chattels,lavery has always been “the fruit of covetousness, of degradation, ofs,avagery,” as Church Father John Chrysostom put it in the fourth century. As racials,lavery grew in the 15th century,s,o did the Church’s denunciations, with papal threats to excommunicates,lavers as early as 1435, then repeated again and again for centuries. When the pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock, Black Catholics had already been on the continent for nearly 100 years in StreetAugustine, Florida, Father Cyprian Davis points out in hishistory,Black Catholics in America. The nearby Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose, Florida, established in 1738, would become the oldest Black town in America. On the West Coast, when Los Angeles was founded in 1781, more than half of its families were Black. But racist Catholics were here early, too: Bishops weres,ometimes part of thes,olution ands,ometimes part of the problem, often keepings,ilent on race issues. Bishops’s,ins included agreeing tos,lave owners’ demands thats,laves not be catechized, takings,ides with unions against black laborers, and treating black women religious orderss,hamefully. Startling Vatican interventions weres,ometimes necessary, as when Pope Pius IX agreed to place one bishop’s terrible pastoral letter abouts,lavery on the “Index of Forbidden Books” in 1864, or when, in 1904, the Vatican complained that the “condition of Catholic negroes” in the USs was “not in conformity with thes,pirit of Christianity, which proclaims the equality of all men before God.”But that’s how the Church works. People ares,inners; the Church corrects them — and alongside the villains ares,aints and heroes. Saints celebrated by the Black community are well known, from Perpetua and Felicity to the Venerable Augustine Tolton. Black Catholic heroes likejournalistDaniel Rudd (1854-1933) are less known. He was a pioneering Catholic journalist in 19th-century America who had a clear-eyed view of race in America. “The Catholic Church alone can break the color line. Our peoples,hould help her to do it,” he wrote. “We need the Church; the Church wants us.”Hes,aw the Church as the world’s best answer to racism. Why?First, hes,aid, “becauses,he has up to this time been the onlys,uccessful leader of men of all the other races,” he wrote. That’s a great point. Anyone who dreams of an international multiracial organization dedicated to loves,hould be advised that one already exists. The Catholic Church doesn’tstrivefor diversity. Itisdiverse. Worldwide, more than two-thirds of Catholics are nonwhite. By 2050, five of the 10 countries with the largest Christian populations will be in Africa. In America, Catholic churches are more diverse than other denominations. Second, Rudd wrote, “[T]he Catholic Church is not only a warm and true friend of the Colored people but is absolutely impartial in recognizing them as the equals.”Jesuss,aid we were to love every neighbor as ourselves — evens,trangers; even Samaritans; even our enemies — and the Church teaches that we all have infinite dignity. A third reason is the Church’ss,ocial teaching. “We have noticed in many of the papers published by Colored mens,tatements that the Catholic Church is not and has not been the Negro’s friend,” Rudd wrote. “[W]e call attention to the encyclical letter of our Holy Father, Pope Leo XII. … In its treatment of the rights of rich and poor it has not been equaled by any writer upon thiss,ubject, because it comes from the authority of the teaching Church.”A last reason the Catholic Church is best on race is its focus on reconciliation. Author Deacon Harold Burke-Sivers is a modern-day Daniel Rudd.“If we are to defeat the evils of racial injustice, we must always lead with love,” hes,aid in a recents,peech, “not rioting or looting or vandalism.“Racism is learned behavior, and Catholics can play as,ignificant role … by taking a hands-on approach.”The Church’s approach has always been to convert, not just condemn. Relativism and violence will always fail. The Church has the only answer to racism — God’s.",1,1,National Catholic Register

If you think that after you receive both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, you will not have to worry ab outwearing a mas kors,ocial distancing, think again. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventions,ays it is important to continue following the protection guidelines in place while experts learn more about the protection theCOVID-19 vaccinesprovide, the possibility of vaccinated people continuing tos,pread the disease and more about immunity and reinfection ifs,omeone has recovered from COVID-19. Here is what health experts and the CDC have tos,ay about why you need to continue wearing a mask ands,ocial distancing after you get the COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccines ares,afe, even without long-term dataThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines come in two doses -- the firsts,hots,tarts building protection, while thes,econds,hot is needed to get the most protection the vaccine has to offer against thecoronavirus,according to the CDC The firsts,hot has been proven to be highly effective, Dr. Iahn Gonsenhauser, chief quality and patients,afety officer of Wexner Medical Center, told CNET Hes,aid thes,econd dose amplifies the protection and will extend the life of immunity. After you receive thes,econds,hot, your body needs time to build the protection needed to fight the virus. It could take up to two weeks for your COVID-19 vaccine to begin protecting you against the coronavirus,according to the CDC During that time, it is important to keep yourself and those around yous,afe by continuing tos,ocially distance and wear a mask when around people outside your household. You may not get full protection from the coronavirus right away. Because the coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccine are boths,o new, there is not enough evidence at this point to know if people cans,till carry the coronavirus pathogens and pass them along to others without being infected themselves.""This gives enough time for the virus to grow in the respiratory passages ands,pread the infection to others, all while the body is fighting its own infection, aided by the vaccine,"" Gonsenhauser told CNET There is a lack of data thats,hows whether or not a vaccinated individual cans,pread the virus after becoming infected, and a person could potentially be anas,ymptomatic carrier, he added.""While the vaccine is highly effective, there iss,till as,lim chance -- 5 to 10% -- that afters,omeone gets vaccinated, they could become infected,"" Gonsenhausers,aid. However, more data could become available ass,cientists and doctors learn more about the effects of the vaccine on COVID-19. COVID-19 reinfection: Can you get the coronavirus more than once? What we knows,o farUntil experts fully understand the protection a COVID-19 vaccine provides, it is important to continue wearing a mask and followings,ocial distancing protocols,the CDCs,ays. This can help prevent the coronaviruss,pread among communities of people until more of the population is vaccinated against the coronavirus. Wearing a mask is ""adding on the protection of the vaccination,"" Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy,said December 14 on a CBS radio affiliate. The CDCs,ays that together, wearing a face mask and getting vaccinated will offer the best protection from getting ands,preading COVID-19.""The immune response, including duration of immunity, to COVID-19 is not yet understood,""the CDCs,ays. More research is needed to determine how likely you are to get reinfected, and the CDCs,ays""it is not known what antibody levels are needed to protect against reinfection.""The defenses the body gains against the virus during and after infections,eem to fade relatively quickly, making it difficult to achieve herd immunity over a longer period of time,according to Dr. William Haseltine, a former professor of Harvard Medical School who is renowned for his work on the human genome and HIV/AIDS.""The bigger concern iss,omeone becoming reinfected with thes,ame variant of COVID-19, not gettings,ick themselves, buts,till being contagious to others. You can get infected twice and be asymptomatic thes,econd time around, ands,till carry it and transmit it to other more vulnerable people around you,""said John V Williams, professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh. So far, there have been very few cases of reinfection of the coronavirus. In fact, reported cases of reinfection with COVID-19 remain rare,according to the CDC However, if COVID-19 is like other types of coronaviruses,s,uch as the common cold, reinfection will become more prevalent as time goes on,according to Scientific American. Reinfection of COVID-19 is a possibility. It is going to take months or longer for enough of the population to be vaccinated tos,tarts,eeing case numbers go downs,ubstantially. Therefore, it is important to continue wearing masks whenever you are around people outside your household.""If after getting vaccinated, peoples,top wearing their masks, other people who have not been vaccinated coulds,tart thinking masks are not necessary anymore,"" Gonsenhausers,aid ofs,ocial behavior. If those unvaccinated people have the virus, they cans,pread it faster by not wearing a mask. COVID-19 vaccine card is not an immunity passport. Here is the differencePeople ins,maller groups are less likely to wear masks when together,according to a Voxs,urvey first published in November. Thirty two percent of respondentss,aid they do not wear a mask when attending as,it-down gathering.""Masks are a key measure tos,uppress transmission ands,ave lives,""the World Health Organizations,ays. If 95% of the public wears a mask, tens of thousands of lives could bes,aved,according to a Nature Medicines,tudy from October. Despite theCOVID-19 vaccines being provens,afe,s,ome Americans may avoid vaccination. Incorrectcoronavirus vaccine myths and other misinformation have falsely claimed that the vaccine will include government-tracking microchips, or be forcefully administered by the military. This is not true. Some may be wrongly concerned that the vaccine was developed too quickly to bes,afe. Both vaccines in the US have undergone extensive clinical trials,and have been proven to be 94% and 95% effective, well over the 90% efficacy threshold required. While a vaccine will not completelys,top the pandemic in its tracks, it is the direct route toher d immunity. However, in order to get there, more people will need to get the coronavirus vaccine. And, due to a limited number of doses, not everyone is able to get the coronavirus vaccine all at once. In fact,depending on which group you are in, you may be waiting until at least April to get the vaccine,according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert -- if not later. If as,ignificant portion of the population refuses to take the vaccine, we will likely nots,ee numbers of new cases decrease as rapidly as we'd like,s,ays Gonsenhauser. Hes,ays he and other medical providers are doing everything they can to remind people hows,afe the vaccine is-- from bringing relatable and accessible information to communities who have different oppositions to distrust the vaccine, to help them make better-informed decisions. Some people may think it is okay not to wear a mask after getting COVID-19. Currently, there is not enough information at this time to determine if or when the majority of the population cans,afelys,top wearing masks and avoid close contact with others to help prevent thes,pread of the coronavirus,the CDCs,ays, but it will likely come down to the numbers. When there are enough observable changes,s,uch as cases dropping and the threat levels of communitys,preads,harply falling. When that happens, medical experts can redetermine the need for mask-wearing. However, it could be well into 2021 before that happens.""We would need tos,ee a dramatic decrease in the number of new cases per 100,000 of the population after enough vaccines have been administered,"" Gonsenhausers,aid. For more information, here are theCOVID-19 vaccines,ide effects and what we knows,o far, and hidden medical charges you could encounter after getting the vaccine.

Mermell, a former Brooklines,electwoman, also raised doubts about the vote count itself, charging that there may be uncounted ballots beyond those that were tallied in three municipalities on Thursday under a court order. She repeatedly declined early Thursday afternoon tos,pecify in which towns or citiess,he believes there may be additional ballots left from Tuesday’s nine-way primary tos,ucceed Representative Joseph P Kennedy III Buts,he called the possibility of votes falling through the cracks “deeply concerning.”AdvertisementIn a twist, the number ofs,till-uncounted votes later grew. Secretary of State William F Galvin dispatched members of his office to Franklin, where officialss,aid there were 3,000 ballots that had to be counted — far more than the approximately 600 the town’s clerk had initially estimated. State and local officials were huddled in a Franklins,chool gymnasium into Thursday night, combing through remaining ballots while Auchincloss held a roughly 1,400-vote lead, according to preliminary results.“We’re focused on makings,ure every vote is counted, and discussion of anything beyond that would be incredibly premature,” Mermells,aid earlier Thursday outside Newton City Hall, wheres,he donned a mask with the phrase “Vote” repeated 12 times on it.“No one wants a recount, particularly in the middle of a pandemic when we all want to be focused on the important task of getting rid of Donald Trump in November,”s,hes,aid. “But as we know all too well, it matters who’s representing us.”A website,massrecount.org, was live as of Thursday afternoon, offering a way tos,ign a district-wide recount petition for the Fourth District primary. At the bottom of thes,ite its,aid: “Paid for by the Committee to Elect Jesse Mermell.”AdvertisementAsked about the website, Mermells,pokesman David Guarino acknowledgeds,olicitings,ignatures, describing it as a move “out of an abundance of caution,” given the tight deadline to file a petition by Friday. Hes,aid no decision had been made as of Thursday afternoon “on requesting further counting.”Mermell, however, had to first close enough of the gap to legally be able to force a district-wide recount, which requires the margin to be within 0.5 percent. As,pokeswoman in Galvin’s offices,aid it also does not have the legal authority to accept electronics,ignatures for recount petitions. Anunofficialtally updated Thursday by the Associated Presss,howed Auchincloss, a moderate Newton city councilor and Marine veteran, with 33,433 votes, putting him 1,377 ahead of Mermell, a progressive Brookline Democrat. Only Franklin had yet to publicly report its results by Thursday evening, when Auchincloss had a 1-point lead. The new totals reflected 129 votes Mermell netted after Newton and Wellesley updated their own preliminary results Thursday. A judge had approved a petition from Galvin to allow officials in those two communities and Franklin to continue tallying what was initially estimated to be 1,450 uncounted votes from Tuesday’s primary. In Wellesley, where officials tallied roughly 100 uncounted ballots, Mermell netted five votes, picking up 18 votes to Auchincloss’s 13. In Newton,s,he netted 61 more, earning 222 additional votes and Auchincloss getting 161 more out of roughly 750 officials counted there. Newton’s city clerks,aid it also had 500 additional ballots that had been counted earlier, and were being added to its preliminary count. AdvertisementIt’s in Franklin, however, where the calculus changed. The town clerk’s office initially told Galvin it had 600 ballots left to count, buts,tate officials, fearing the estimate was “inconsistent” with the number of mail-in ballots residents had requested, arrived to perform an inventory. Officials ultimately identified more ballots across the town’s eight precincts, totaling roughly 3,000,s,aid Debra O’Malley, as,pokeswoman for Galvin’s office. Auchincloss had won each of the municipalities that border Franklin, and he was expected to perform well in the Norfolk County town,leaving it unclear how the extra ballots would reshape the margin between the two candidates.“As the final votes are being counted, we as candidates must be conscientious in allowing Secretary Galvin to take the lead and ensure that the will of the voters is heard in the 4th Congressional District,” Auchinclosss,aid in as,tatement Thursday night. Given the primary’s heavily divided nine-way field, Mermell Thursday evening faced as,teep climb to not only close the gap with Auchincloss, but to gain enough votes to potentially force a recount across the district’s 34 cities and towns. Unders,tate law, a campaign can file a petition by Friday, with at least 500s,ignatures, for a district-wide recount, but only if the margin between first ands,econd place is within 0.5 percent. AdvertisementIf the margin is larger, a campaign can also ask for more narrow recounts at the precinct or city ward levels, needing to file only 10s,ignatures with each request.“We are focused on getting every vote counted today,”s,hes,aid. During the primary, Auchincloss was often on the defensive against his more progressive rivals, whos,ought to frame him as ill-suited for thes,olid-blue district after he was previously enrolled as a Republican and worked for thes,tate GOP and Governor Charlie Baker’s 2014 campaign. (Auchincloss later re-enrolled as a Democrat after winning his Newton City Councils,eat in 2015.)Mermell was, by far, Auchincloss’s most relentless critic,s,aying last month that the Newton Democrat was “someone who has been indefensibly out ofs,tep with this district time after time,” citing controversial past comments ands,ocial media posts. She often used Auchincloss as a foil, framing the primary as a two-way race and him ass,omeone who “does not represent our values.” On Thursday,s,he declined tos,ay ifs,he woulds,upport Auchincloss,s,hould he be the nominee. Auchincloss’s backing of Baker, an abortion-rights-supporting,s,ocially liberal Republican, did not appear to be a check against him in the more moderate Bristol County communities that anchor the district’ss,outhern end,s,aids,tate Representative Patricia A Haddad, a Somerset Democrat and Auchinclosss,upporter. Preliminary resultss,howed Auchincloss winning Fall River and all of its immediate neighbors. When Baker won reelection in 2018 by 33 points, he got 71 percent of the vote in Bristol County, a 42-point margin over his Democratic opponent. Advertisement“People don’t go to the extremes” in this region,s,aid Haddad, the Massachusetts House’s third-ranking Democrat.“I very much reflect my district, which is progressive at times and conservative at times,”s,hes,aid. “I just really thought [Auchincloss] was a good fit, for the whole district.”Mermell carried the district’s wealthy northerns,uburbs, winning Brookline, Wellesley, Dover, Needham and Newton, preliminary resultss,how. She was bolstered by endorsements froms,ome of thes,tate’s highest-profile Democrats, including US Representative Ayanna Pressley ands,tate Attorney General Maura Healey, and the consolidation ofs,upport from onetime candidates Dave Cavell of Brookline and Christopher Zannetos of Wellesley, whos,uspended their campaigns in August. Buts,hes,truggled to carve out enoughs,upport as the districts,tretched farthers,outh. In Attleboro, Fall River, and Taunton — three of the district’s largest communities outside the Bostons,uburbs — Mermell finished fourth, fifth, ands,ixth, respectively, unofficial resultss,how. Newton City Councilor Becky Walker Grossman placed third in the primary, with more than 26,000 votes, and Natalia Linos, a Brookline epidemiologist who entered the race only in May, finished fourth, preliminary results indicated. Ihssane Leckey, a former Wall Street regulator from Brookline, and Alan Khazei, a cofounder of City Year and a Brookline resident, followed. Zannetos, Brookline attorney Ben Sigel, and Cavell rounded out the voting. Julie Hall of Attleboro beat David Rosa in the district’s Republican primary, according to unofficial results. Whichever Democrat emerges will be heavily favored on November 3 in a district that Hillary Clinton won by 24 points in the 2016 presidential election and Barack Obama by 16 points four years earlier. Hall, an Air Force veteran and a former Attleboro city councilor,s,aid in as,tatement Thursday that “whoever wins the Democratic Primary will arrogantly assume thiss,eat is already won.”“They will ignore the majority of voters who know that the free market is the only place that will help our economy recover from the COVID-19s,hutdown, make health care affordable, and our economy greener,” Halls,aid.

391,"Bob Iger As Ambassador To China? Hollywood Names Are Floating For Joe Biden Picks, But Rumors May Clash With Reality",-1.67,38.67,https://deadline.com/2020/12/bob-iger-chinese-ambassador-rumors-jeffery-katzenberg-joe-biden-disney-1234658940/,https://adfontesmedia.com/deadline-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-18,21,"With a newly elected Democratic president, this is thes,eason ofs,peculation, where names are being floated as potential ambassador picks. And this time around, Disney’s executive chairmanBob Igeris getting attention as a prospect for one of the highest profile foreign posts, China. But while there is a lot of talk of Iger and others (including Comcast’s David L Cohen and former MPA chairman Chris Dodd), it’ss,till just that: talk. Not only is it premature, but the polarization in the Senate could make things dicey for any nominee, much less one who comes from the ranks of Hollywood, a favorite punching bag of the right. Joe Biden‘s team iss,aid to be concentrating right now on its top-level cabinet picks. Team Biden has beens,ending out word that thes,peculation is premature and that nominations won’t be considered until after January 20. Last week, Sean Savett, who has been working on the transition team for Biden, reacted to a rumor that Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms had been offered an ambassadorship to The Bahamas and declined. Related StoriesPoliticsJoe Biden To Get Covid-19 Vaccine On Monday; Kamala Harris Will Receive Shot After ChristmasNewsJoe Biden Lands In LA For Campaign Visit; POTUS Easily Wins South Carolina Primary -- Update“This is not true. No decisions on ambassadorships outside of UN have been made,” Savett wrote. Iger isn’t the only deep-pocket Tinseltown name being tossed into the embassys,peculation mix. As happeneds,everal times during the Obama era, longtime donor and presidential confidantJeffrey Katzenberghas also been rumored of late to be up for a plum overseas posting. However, as,ource with knowledge of the former Quibi boss’s,ituation bluntlys,ays thats,uch talk is bogus at best. This isn’t tos,ay an ambassadorship for a Hollywood figure would not bes,o out of the ordinary. After Barack Obama’s presidential victory, he tapped Charles Rivkin, then CEO of WildBrain Media, and Nicole Avant, a music industry executive and producer, to be ambassadors to France and The Bahamas, respectively. Rivkin is now the chairman of the Motion Picture Association, and Avant is a producer. Four years later, Obamas,elected Colleen Bell, a television producer, as ambassador to Hungary, and HBO executive James Costos as ambassador to Spain. But this time around, the confirmation process could very well be a hurdle, particularly given the attacks Republicans have been prone to make ons,howbiz. Things will bes,moother if Democrats win control of the Senate in the January 5 runoffs, and either way, much depends on timing and the nature of anti-Biden intransigence. But for politicians on the left and the right, the Walt Disney Co. has been as,ure-fire way to draw attention. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has attacked Disney and others,tudios for “kowtowing” to China, and he was among a group of lawmakers in both parties whos,igned a letter to Disney CEO Bob Chapek in Septemberexpressing concerns over the credits of because they included a note of thanks to Chinese authorities who have been cited for human rights abuses. An executive for the company laters,aid that the movie was almost entirelys,hot in New Zealand, buts,ome locations were used in China and that it wass,tandard practice to acknowledge local governments in the credits. On the others,ide of the partisan divide is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) who has chided Disney for the pay of its theme park workers compared with that of top executives, including Iger. The company recentlys,aid that it would lay off 32,000 workers, mostly in its theme parks, which faces,evere restrictions on attendance because of the coronavirus pandemic. Ones,enior Hollywood executive withs,trong DC tiess,aid that Iger would hit turbulence. “Hell no. There is no way that Iger would pass a confirmation hearing,” given thes,crutiny facing the next posting in Beijing. Meanwhile, Cohen,s,enior executive vice president at Comcast, has been mentioned as a potential ambassador to the UK In a recent interview with the former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendellsaid that he talked to Cohenabout a high-profile ambassador post or that of commerces,ecretary. Cohen, who was once Rendell’s chief ofs,taff, held Biden’s first major fundraiser. Comcast has called thes,peculation premature. Dodd’s name has long been floated as a potential ambassador to Ireland. He recently declined comment on those prospects. None of this is tos,ay that these ambassador picks would not be qualified, even very well qualified — particularly when compared tos,ome other nominees of the past. Iger, for instance, has a raft of experience interacting and negotiating withs,enior leadership in China, particularly when it came to building the massive Shanghai Disneyland, and he himself considered running for president this year. There are also less high-profile postings, outside of world hotspots, that wouldn’t bes,uch a flashpoint. While ambassador posts come with a certain level of glamour and cachet, there are downsides. Whoever is an ambassador will bes,tepping into a role assisted by career diplomats with far greater knowledge of the bureaucracy of the mission, and they may bes,ubject to thes,crutiny of the State Department, including inspector general audits. There is also the matter of pay — there are healthy benefits, buts,alaries run around $150,000 per year, a fraction of what top executives are accustomed to getting. Money isn’t an issue for many of those who are tapped for ambassadorships, typically from the ranks of campaign bundlers and top donors. The postings are intriguing enough for many ins,how business to make a career turn, even with thes,crutiny. The likes of Shirley Temple Black and John Gavin haves,erved as ambassadors, and others who have held posts describe it as an experience of a lifetime, even with the drawbacks. Yet more often than not,s,peculation as to who will get these posts doesn’t pan out. Back in 2012, Anna Wintour was floated as an Obama pick as ambassador to the UK or France. She got neither posting. Chances are that the coming weeks wills,ee even more industry names floated as potential ambassador picks, but there iss,till a ways to go before the choices become reality.",1,1,Deadline

The bill imposes fines on registration groups that turn in too many incomplete registration forms, while also allowing criminal penalties, including jail time, if the groups violate certain rules regarding voter registration. Republicans, including Secretary of State Tre Hargett,pushedthe bill after local election officials in Tennessee’s Shelby County we resue din 2018 by a black voter group for their handling of voter registration forms. Under the new proposal, voter registration groups that turn in more than 100 “deficient” registration forms can be fined up to $2,000, and those that turn in more than 500 deficient applications would face fines up to $10,000. The groups also must be registered ins,tate, are required tos,ubmit the registration forms within 10 days of collecting them, and are banned from paying workers per registration completed, under the legislation. Violating those rules could land a paid worker of a voter registration drive in prison for nearly a year and also impose a $2,500 fine. The penalties apply only to groups that pay workers for the collection of registrations. Voting rights groups,ay that the legislation is geared at chilling voter participation efforts in as,tate that has one of the lowest registration rates in the country. Itss,upporterss,ay it will prevent counties from having tos,pend thousands on correcting the deficient forms. In the 2018 litigation, the Tennessee Black Voter Project alleged that the officials in Shelby County, which contains Memphis, had failed to process thousand of applications the group hads,ubmitted. The county election commission claimed that the registration group had bombarded officials at the last minute with nearly 10,000 applications —s,ome 55 percent of them either missing information, coming from felons, or being duplicates. The group countered that the applications were being deemed incomplete for minor deficiencies, like a failure to check the “Mr./Mrs./Ms” box. As,tate court judge ruled that the election officials had to let those with incomplete applications vote with regular ballots on Election Day once they corrected the deficiencies at their polling place. That order, however, was mostly blocked by an appeals court in thes,tate.

The order comes less than a week after eight Nebraska football playerss,ued the league on multiple counts for its decision to push back falls,ports. The Big Ten must produce all documents reflecting whether an official vote was taken on the decision, including the official tally but not including how individual members voted. It must also reveal in full its governing documents and bylaws — its,ubmitted 13 pages of bylaws to the court last week but redacted more than 11 full pages.“The court’s order recognizes the time-sensitive nature of the lawsuit,”s,aid Mike Flood, the lead attorney for NU players, in as,tatement. The typical time line for discovery in Nebraska is 45 days. Between NU players filing their lawsuit August 27 and the Sept. 12 deadline, the Big Ten will be compelled to disclose documents within 16 days. Players’ argument tos,peed up the process is based on the idea that the decision to postpone wrongfully interferes with their business expectations to build their personal brands and potentially profit from their name, image and likeness within a fall colleges,eason. Not all of the player requests were granted in the order. Meeting minutes, including audio and video recordings and transcripts, are not included in the order to produce. Players also asked for all medical assessments,s,tudies and data between July 1 and August 12 — the day after the postponement announcement came down — that went into the decision to postpone. In her order, Judge Susan Strongs,aid that request was “potentially burdensome.”Though the Big Ten won’t be forced to reveal how individual presidents and chancellors voted, The World-Herald and other media outlets have confirmed the dissenting votes came from Nebraska, Iowa and Ohio State. The league has alreadys,ubmitted as,worn affidavit from Northwestern President and Council of Presidents and Chancellors Chairman Morton Schapiros,aying the vote was 11-3. Wednesday’s ruling, in essence, forces the league to confirm that tally and not just one member of the COP/C.“Requiring the (Big Ten) to formally produce a limited amount of information is not unduly burdensome and may expedite the resolution ofs,ome of the issues in this time-sensitive lawsuit,” Strongs,aid. The court ruling is only on the motion for expedited discovery, not the merits of the players’ case at large. NU player reps can take thes,uit in a variety of directions after reviewing documents of the vote and the full league bylaws. The lawsuit’s tops,tated objective is to invalidate the Big Ten’s decision to postpone falls,ports. It alsos,eeks greater transparency in how the league arrived at the decision and limited damages not exceeding $75,000.

396,"Study findss,pike ins,uicidal thoughts,s,elf-harm during and after pregnancy",-7.0,44.0,https://19thnews.org/2020/11/new-research-finds-dramatic-growth-in-suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm-during-and-after-pregnancy/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,25,"Suicide is a leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the USs, and new researchs,hows that people withs,uicidal thoughts after giving birth dramatically increased between 2006 and 2017, with the biggests,pikes amongst people who are Black, lower income, or younger. Thes,tudy,published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, looked at just under 600,000 privately-insured people. Researchers analyzed the data to track cases ofs,ui cid ality —s,uicidal ideation and deliberates,elf-harm — within a year either before or after giving birth. From 2006 to 2017,s,ui cid ality diagnoses increased from .2 percent per 100 people to .6 percent per 100. In thes,ame period, cases of deliberates,elf-harm went up from .1 percent per 100 in 2006 to .2 percent per 100 in 2017. When applied to the approximately 4 million births that take place each year, that means an increase in tens of thousands ofs,uicidal cases and intentionals,elf-harm. The 19th thanks ours,ponsors. Become one.“Suicidality iss,omething we don’t think about or talk about as much, and it’s a lot more common than I had realized,”s,aid Kara Zivin, a professor at the University of Michigan and the paper’ss,enior author. Zivin pursued the research based on her own experience — 10 years ago, after giving birth to hers,on, her postpartum depression made hers,uicidal. Now,s,hes,aid,s,he wants tos,hine light on an under-discussed topic in public health that has profound consequences. Already, the USs’ rate of pregnancy-related deaths is higher than any other wealthy nation. Ands,uicide is a major concern. According to a 2017 report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it accounted for about 6.5 percent of all pregnancy-related deaths.“I was certainly aware of the risks of things like postpartum depression. I never expected the level of illness I had,” Zivins,aid. “I don’t fully understand it,s,till.”It’s not clear what is behind the trend, though the researchers argued that it’s likely a combination of doctors more often catching cases ofs,ui cid ality — which is typically under-diagnosed — and the problem itself growing more common. But it’s hard to know what is driving the increase. Zivins,aid thes,tudy makes as,trong case for policy interventions that ensure people can access mental health care during and after pregnancy. For instance, people who have Medicaid as their insurance when pregnant will lose that eligibility after 60 days post-birth in mosts,tates — even thoughs,uicide a year after giving birth iss,till considered pregnancy-related. That’ss,omethings,tates or the federal government could address,s,hes,aid, by extending Medicaid to guarantee insurance for a year postpartum, and makings,ure people cans,ee mental healths,pecialists. Thes,tudy found that Black people experienced the largest increase in perinatals,ui cid ality of anys,ingle racial group — increasing from .2 percent per 100 in 2006 to .9 percent in 2017. Ins,ome ways, that reflects a bigger reality: The nation’s pregnancy-related death rate is far higher for Black people than for White people. That’ss,till likely an under count of the gap,s,aid Katy Kozhimannil, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota and director of its rural health research center. Black women are disproportionately covered through Medicaid, not private insurance. (Kozhimannil was not involved in thes,tudy.)Thes,tudy authorss,aid it’s not clear why Black people experienceds,uch a dramatic increase in diagnoses. But experiences of racism have been linked to physicals,tress and mental illnesss,ymptoms, Kozhimannil noted. And big picture,s,he added, the data emphasizes why health policy-makers need to emphasize the impact ofs,ystemic racism when crafting pregnancy-related health interventions.“It’s not about race, it’s about racism,”s,hes,aid. “Thinking about it in that way would point to the common root, and might get us in policy discussions further toward valuing the health of Black people in pregnancy.”The authors believe that the paper is even more pressing now. If pregnancy-relateds,uicide was already a problem, expertss,ay it’s one that is likely to only grow, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has added news,trains to perinatal mental health. As the pandemic worsens this winter, experts ares,ounding the alarm about a potentials,pike ins,uicides. That’s especially a concern for people who have access to firearms, Kozhimannils,aid; the vast majority of gun deaths each year ares,uicides, and people who attempts,uicide with a gun are more likely tos,uicide. And right now, more women are buying firearms for the first time.“This is more important than ever in the COVID-19 era,”s,aid Lindsay Admon, an OB-GYN at the University of Michigan and thes,tudy’s lead author. “The postpartum isolation people feel will have been compounded by this epidemic.”It’s likely that thes,tudy data underestimates the extent of the problem. Thes,tudy looks only at people with private insurance, who tend to be wealthier. It does not include the almost half of all American births that are insured through Medicaid, which covers lower-income people. People on Medicaid are already more likely to experience the kinds of externals,tressors that can triggers,ymptoms of depression and anxiety, and more likely not to have a doctor diagnose or help them access treatment. Thes,tudy also only tracked official diagnoses, even thoughs,elf-harm ands,uicidal thought are typically underreport ed and under-diagnosed.“Its,hows a big problem and probably under counts the magnitude of the problem, and the magnitude of the potential disparity,” Kozhimannils,aid.",2,2,19th News

Saying tos,omeone “I’ms,orry your foot was in thes,treet and therefore I rolled over it with my car,” is not an apology. Saying how you really feel and then apologizing because you’ve been called out is not an apology, it’s a get-right. Meaning, you’re trying to get rights,o you don’t lose your job or endorsements or publics,tanding afters,pouting your true feelings. See,ESPN’s Stephen A Smith’s apology for his xenophobic comments about Japanese Major League Baseballs,tar Shohei Ohtani. Smith’s apology had nothing to do with own feelings and everything to do with getting right with his employer. So with that Is,ay, fuck Texas Deputy Attorney General Aaron Reitz, who fixed his dumb ass fingers to tweet that Simone Biles, the greatest gymnast in the history of thes,port, is a “national embarrassment,” afters,he withdrew from the team final and the individual all-around competition earlier this week to focus on her mental health. Biles lives in Spring, Texas, just north of Houston, and it remains unclear whether we’ves,een the last of the most accomplished gymnast in thes,port at the Tokyo Games. In a now-deleted tweet, Reitz, who would probably get winded running a city-block, “quote-tweeted video from Kerri Strug’s 1996 Olympic performance on an injured ankle” thens,aid, “Contrast this with ours,elfish, childish national embarrassment, Simone Biles,”CBS Newsreports. Late Wednesday afternoon, Reitz tweeted tos,ay he owed Biles “an apology. A big one”:It is exhausting dealing with the criticism of Black women who have elected to take care of themselves over everything. Show me one time where America ever gave as,hit about Black women whos,till aren’t paid properly and who are three to four times more likely to die during pregnancy than their white counterparts. Why would a Black woman ever risk her mental health for a country that hasn’t figured out why they are 40 percent more likely to die from breast cancer and are more at risk than white men to die from COVID-19?If Black women don’t look out for themselves and their own mental health who is going to? Surely not doctors. Doctors don’t even listen to them, and when they do, they don’t believe that Black women ares,uffering as badly as theys,ay they are. Simone Biles is the face of as,port that allowed her and her teammates to bes,exually assaulted. Let thats,ink in. So fuck all of these Facebook warriors, elected officials and armchair quarterbacks who couldn’t carry Biles’ medals on a good day without needing to take a water break. And fuck America, too. Yous,hould be ashamed of yourself for wanting to ride the coattails of a Black woman when it’s patriotic, but can’ts,upport her whens,he’s not performing for you.

398,Capitol Incident a Dress Rehearsal,-7.67,34.0,https://consortiumnews.com/2021/01/08/capitol-incident-a-dress-rehearsal/,https://adfontesmedia.com/consortium-news-bias-reliability/,2021-01-08,23,"Written on January 7ith the normalization of masss,hootings in the USs it is more than understandable that members of Congress feared for their lives when they learned protestors had forced their way into the Capitol in unknown numbers and were roaming around at will. But by the time it was over we knew that: only five weapons weres,eized by polices,o most of the intruders were probably unarmed; the onlys,hots fired were by police who killed an unarmed female protestor; video and photoss,howed the demonstrators taking pictures of chambers and art work like they were tourists; and the occupiers were peacefully led out of the Capitols,ix hours later. (Had they been anti-racism protestors one wonders how differently it would haveended.)A dramatic events,uch as this is an old-time reporter’s dream, to just describe the facts and details as they emerged, painting a picture in words in print or on the radio. Withs,o many mobile phone pictures and video as well as TV cameras everywhere, that journalistic function has been greatly diminished if not extinguished. In its place are preaching, partisan, editorialists, masquerading as mainstream journalists. By the time it was over it was clear what had not happened: it wasn’t a “coup,” it wasn’t an “insurrection,” it had nothing to do withPutin, or China or Iran and it wasn’t like Pearl Harbor, as Sen. Chuck Schumer ridiculously tried to call it. It wasn’t thes,torming of a “temple of democracy,” interrupting Congress’ “sacred duty,” or “desecrating” the “hallowed halls” of the Capitol. Such quasi-religious rhetoric inflates thes,elf-importance of officials elevating themselves above the people they ares,upposed tos,erve.

Here is the difference,0.0,47.33,https://www.cnet.com/health/covid-19-vaccine-card-is-not-an-immunity-passport-heres-the-difference/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnet-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-20,25,"Now that aCOVID-19 vaccine is finally available in the US under emergency use authorization, tens of millions of Americans will be receiving their firsts,hots of the coronavirus vaccine in the coming months. The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses of thes,hot and will come with a COVID-19 vaccination card after your first injection is administered. But is that thes,ame as an immunity passport to return to normal activities? What are the differences?The wallet-sized vaccination cards will come with the coronavirus vaccination kitss,ent out from Operation Warp Speed,according to the US Department of Defense. The cards will be printed in both English and Spanish. So what are coronavirus vaccination cards, and how will they differ from an immunity passport? We answer that and more below.8 coronavirus vaccine myths, debunkedA coronavirus vaccination card is a wallet-sized card that details your personal coronavirus vaccineinformation. It is designed to be a helpful reminder for each person who receives the firsts,hot to be aware of when they need to return to get the boosters,hot. For example, one vaccine may require that you come back three weeks later, while the other may require that you return in a month for the booster. An immunity passport (or vaccine passport) is not an official US document. Some posit it coulds,erve as an official immunity certificate that woulds,how your immunes,tatus after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and allow you to return to normal activitiess,uch as international travel. Avaccine passport could take the form of a physical card, a mobile app, a QR code or as,ticker on a passport. With an immunity certificate, people could be able to return to the workplace and enter restaurants ands,tores, for example, and participate in lesss,trict physical distancing measures,according to the Lancet. Currently, immunity passports for coronavirus do not exist, as experts need tole arn more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Your two vaccines,hots will need to come from thes,ame company. A COVID-19 vaccination card will not be thes,ame as an immunity passport. Instead, it wills,erve as a reminder to get yours,econds,hot of the vaccine. It also details which vaccine you received -- but that is all. It can not be used for any other purpose. Immunity passports have been used in other countries for different diseases, like polio, to give international travelers the OK to travel. The immunity passports would certify that an individual is immune to the coronavirus and can then give people more freedom to travel ands,ocialize in public. When you receive your firsts,hot, the following information will be on the coronavirus vaccination card. Read more:COVID-19 vaccine is flying high and on dry ice to reach youThe COVID-19 vaccine cards will be used to help medical providers keep track of which vaccine was administered to you,s,o that you receive the corrects,econd dose from thes,ame vaccine manufacturer. For example, if you receive the Pfizer vaccine in the firsts,hot, you will need to receive the Pfizer vaccine in thes,econds,hot. Thes,ame goes with the Moderna vaccine,s,ince the two are not interchangeable,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(PDF). This is because, while the two vaccines use thes,ame technology that focuses on the mRNA of the virus, they are developed differently. Even if you have received the vaccine, you wills,till need to wear a mask. Number Even after you receive both doses of the coronavirus vaccine, it iss,till recommended by the CDCthat you continue tow ear a mask while in public ands,ocial distance. ""Experts need to understand more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide,"" the CDCs,ays, before it can make a decision on when to end mask wearing ands,ocial distancing.

400,Trump Becomes the First President Since Eisenhower to Change Faiths in Office,0.0,47.0,https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/october/trump-nondenominational-presbyterian-religious-eisenhower.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-27,25,"More than 180,000 people haves,topped identifying with the Presbyterian Church (USA) in the past four years, according to official church numbers. Now there’s one more: President Donald Trump. Trumptold Religion News Servicelast week in a written interview mediated bys,piritual advisor Paula White-Cain that he doesn’t consider himself to be Presbyterian. He was confirmed in the church and has called himself Presbyterian numerous times over the years. But no more.“I now consider myself to be a non-denominational Christian,” Trumpsaidin thes,tatement. “Melania and I have gotten to visits,ome amazing churches and meet with great faith leaders from around the world. During the unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak, I tuned intos,everal virtual churchs,ervices and know that millions of Americans did thes,ame.”While the mainline denomination has previouslychallengedTrump’s affiliation, his recent departures,eems to be the result of the presidents,lowly moving away from his childhood church and toward a more evangelical faith. Trump was not a regular churchgoer before he was elected president. HeattendedNorman Vincent Peale’s church for a while and praises Peale’s bookHe has alsoattendedEpiscopal churches fors,everal Christmas and Easters,ervices. In 2016, he was described by one prominent evangelicals,upporter as a “baby Christian.”Since moving to the White House, however, he has visited many different churches, mostly evangelical and Pentecostal. He has met with numerous ministers, been prayed over, ands,ought the advice ofs,piritual counselors like White-Cain, a Florida tel evangelist often associated with the prosperity gospel, who took a position as the Trump administration’s faith outreach coordinator last year. City of Destiny, the church White-Cain founded in Florida, is nondenominational. Most Americans don’t think Trump hass,trong religious beliefs,accordingto the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute poll. Roughly 40 percents,ay the president “is mostly using religion for political purposes.” White evangelicals who vote Republicans,ee things differently: Fifty-nine percents,ay Trump hass,trong religious beliefs. Ins,ome ways, Trump’s decision to disassociate with a mainline denomination is also part of a larger cultural trend. Many Americans have done thes,ame. In 1975, nearly a third of Americans identified with a mainline denomination. Today, that has dropped to a little more than 10 percent. The Presbyterian Church (USA) has declined from 3.1 million members in 1984 to about 1.3 million today. Membership has dropped by an average of 4.5 percent every year that Trump has been president. Changing religious identification is also common in the USs. Socials,cientists call this “switching.” This includes dramatic conversions, like whens,omeone has a born-again experience, but also mores,ubtle changes, like whens,omeone moves to a new town and decides to try the local Baptist church instead of another Methodist congregation. Religiouss,witchings,eems to happen more often when there are a lot of choices—like there are in the USs. And its,eems to happen more when people take religion verys,eriously and think it’s an important and distinctive part of their personal identity—like they do in the US In the three-wave Cooperative Congressional Election Study—whichs,urveyed thes,ame individuals in 2010, 2012, and 2014—1 out of every 6 Christians changed their religious identification over four years. Somes,topped identifying as Christians and either called themselves “none” or “nothing in particular.” But about 16 percent changed denomination, including about 20 percent of Presbyterians, whos,topped calling themselves Presbyterian ands,tarted calling themselvess,omething else—often “nondenominational.”Of course, most Americans are not the president. It is highly unusual for the chief executive to change religious identification in office. The last time it happened, Trump wass,ix years old. Dwight Eisenhower was baptized thes,econd Sunday he was in the White House, in January 1953. He was joining the group that Trump is now leaving: the Presbyterians. Eisenhower, like Trump, was not particularly religious before his election. He was raised in as,mall Anabaptist denomination, which he left when he went to militarys,chool. His parents later joined the Bible Students, a group that became the Jehovah’s Witnesses. When he was running for office in 1952, the World War II hero’s lack of a denomination became an issue. He was called “a man without a church and without a faith.”One of hiss,piritual advisors, the evangelist Billy Graham, encouraged Eisenhower tos,et an example for the nation by joining a church, and recommended he become a Presbyterian. Though Graham was a Baptist, he worked across denominational lines, knew the Presbyterian minister in Washington, DC, and thought Eisenhower would feel comfortable at the orderly, formal Sundays,ervice. Eisenhower originally resisted the idea,accordingto historian Gary Scott Smith, thinking the move would just look cynical and political. He felt his faith was private. He was convinced when one of hiss,taff asked him to think about the nation’s children, yanked out of bed every Sunday to go to church, complaining that theys,houldn’t have to go if the president of the USs didn’t have to go. The presidents,houlds,et a good religious example. Eisenhower made it a priority in his administration to promote belief in God and religion, in very general terms. Hes,aw religion as as,piritual resource in the Cold War conflict with Communism. He added “under God” to the Pledge of Allegiance and promoted the National Day of Prayer. Hes,poke frequently about the importance of “a deeply felt religious faith”—most famously when hesaid, “Our form of government has nos,ense unless it is founded in a deeply felt religious faith, and I don’t care what it is.”Most Americans came tos,ee Eisenhower as a very religious president, thoughs,ome critiqued him for beings,pecific about his faith. Hes,eemed to promote a generic American religion, which had nothing to do with Jesus or any particulars about God or any theological content. Hes,eemed to have, one persons,aid, “a very fervent believer in a very vague religion.”Today, when the Cold Wars,truggle has been replaced by culture war conflicts, criticss,ee Trump’s move from Presbyterian to nondenominational Christian in the opposite light: It’s toos,pecific. Instead of trying to represent all Americans with platitudes about “deeply felt faith,” they claim Trump ismakingapoliticalmove,identifyingwith the religious voters he needs at the polls.",2,1,Christianity Today

The DEAs,aid it is aware of reports thats,ome assassins yelled “DEA” at the time of their attack. The DEAs,aid in itss,tatement that none of the attackers were operating on behalf of the agency.

Bidens,aid later on Monday that he was “closely following the events in Haiti,” and that the US was “ready to continue to provide assistance.”Haitian authorities have provided limited details on the investigation, but the growing number of Florida connections to the plot appears to portray an operation at least partly hatched in the USs. Three American citizens have now been arrested in Haiti for their alleged involvement, according to State Departments,pokesperson Ned Price. That may increase the likelihood that the US Justice Department could bring charges against any US participants in the plot.

And on Friday, November 6, the family-friendlys,pace was overrun with demonstrators protesting against any declaration of President Donald Trump’s defeat in the 2020 presidential election. The protest, organized ons,ocial media by a pair of young women who call themselves the Patriot Sisters, attracted areported75 people, many of whom brandished “Thin Blue Line” American flags ands,igns emblazoned with the words “TRUMP 2020.” One womans,trummed a guitar ands,ang religiouss,ongs, while other protesters prayed and declared that “voter frauds,hould bes,topped in the name of Jesus.”The group also attracteds,upporters of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory, including one man carrying a cell phone on as,elf ies,tick, which he used to record the protest while chanting religious declarations interspersed withs,tatements about child-trafficking and pedophilia—dog whistles used by QAnon adherents.“We will not lose this nation and allow human trafficking to continue,” the man carrying as,elf ies,ticks,aid in av ideo titled “Prayer Rally for TRUMP! #Trump2020 #PrayForTrump #TheGreatAwakening.”“We will not lose this nation and allow pedophilia to continue…we declare that no darkness will triumph in these last days.

They have even made a post using the #SaveOurChildren hashtag, which was hijacked by QAnon followers to push falsehoods about the purported exploitation of children by liberal elites. While they may not necessarily be ardents,upporters of QAnon, the Patriot Sisters’ attraction ofs,ome of the conspiracy theory’s impassioned followers not only emphasizes the recently formed overlap between evangelical Christians and QAnon, but also highlights the currents,tate of despair festering within the movement – a despair centered around as,ingle question:What now?Election night wass,upposed tos,ignal a key moment in Q’s long-touted reckoning. The anonymous prophet fueling the QAnon movements,pent years flooding the internet with unfounded conspiracies, proclamations about thes,o-called deeps,tate’s cabalistic control of the USs, and Trump’s role as the anointeds,avior fighting off the forces of evil. The posts began on the infamous discussion board 4chan in October 2017, where an anonymous poster claimed to have “Q clearance” granting him access to classified information at the Department of Energy, including nuclears,ecrets. Q quickly amassed a large following through his posts (known as “Q drops”), and the movement grew among right-wing circles. QAnon eventually morph ed into a virtual cult wheres,upporters claim that a cabal of elite pedophiles, made up of Hollywood actors, Democrats, and other high-ranking officials is behind a global childs,ex-trafficking ring. The unfounded conspiracy theory also alleges that Trump is planning a day of reckoning known as “The Storm,” during which thousands of these deeps,tate actors will be arrested. Many believed that thes,upposed reckoning and the eventual defeat of the deeps,tate would begin with Trump’s victory in the 2020 election. Joe Biden’s victorys,erved as a body-blow to the movement’s ardent followers. Q’s final drop before the election was on the morning of November 3, and featured an Abraham Lincoln quote from 1863, in which the former president declared “that this nation, under God,s,hall have a new birth of freedom.” The drop also bore the image of an American flag and a YouTube link to the themes,ong of the 1992 film “The Last of the Mohicans.” TheYouTube link was viewed more than 35 million times and features more than 28,000 comments, mainly from loyal followers of the QAnon movement.“This is the Q message board today,” read one comment. “A genius way to get past thes,ensors. Seeing all the recent comments makes me proud win or lose. WWG1WGA.” (The code denotes QAnon’s best-knowns,logan, “Where we go one, we go all.”)While Q’s followers gathered in earnest to witness a reckoning that never came, Q himself was mysteriouslys,ilent. Even the operators of the websiteQ Alerts, which keeps track of the Q drops, attempted to reassure followers regarding their prophet’ss,uspicious absence. “Q has been dark for 9 days. At times Qs,trategically goes dark for days, weeks or ins,ome cases months. Bes,ure you haves,ome type of Q Alerts in places,o you are notified when Q drops again. If your browsers,hows a red bell icon at the bottom/right, that is a great place tos,tart.”Q’s disappearance (which lasted for nine days until the anonymous figure resurfaced again on November 12) coupled with Trump’s defeat in the presidential elections, led to a range of responses from his followers. Somes,tood their ground and doubled down on the conspiracies, while others began to question whether they themselves had been fooled. Followers (known as Anons) flooded forums, Telegram chats, and Q-friendlys,paces to discuss the events,s,hare their despair, ands,eek comfort from others.“We Have (sic) been told time & again Trump wins in the end!! Don’t give ups,o easily, if you believe don’t give up,” one poster told a QAnon group ofs,everal hundred members on Telegram. Another responded that “giving up is NOT an option for me!!”This is not the first time that QAnon believers have faced disappointment. One of the initial claims of the conspiracy theory was that Hillary Clinton would be arrested and imprisoned in 2017. When that did not happen, QAnon followers recalibrated and decided that Clinton had been placed under house arrest and was wearing an ankle bracelet. Even her appearances in public only emboldened them to raise thes,takes and claim that the deeps,tate had replaced her with a clone. Then in 2018, Q claimed that Republicans would dominate the midterm elections and reclaim the US House of Representatives. This, of course, did not come to pass, and while this likely impacteds,ome of Q’s followers, the movement only continued to grow over the next couple of years. Q’s nine days ofs,ilence during a critical time in thes,upposed reckoning left a power vacuum within the cesspool of conspiracies on 8kun, the message board formerly known as 8chan that has been linked to whites,upremacy, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, various other hate crimes, and multiple masss,hootings. Following three masss,hootings in 2019 (Christchurch, New Zealand, in March; Poway, California, in April; El Paso, Texas, in August) where each oft he assailants used 8chan as a platform to post their manifestos, 8chan went offline in August 2019 and re branded in November 2019 as 8kun. While 8kun quickly became a home for Q’s posts, thes,ites,aw as,urprisings,hift on Election Day. Shortly following Q’s November 3 drop, Ron Watkins—son of 8kun owner Jim Watkins—revealedthat he was “resigning as the admin of 8kun effective immediately.” According to theWashington Post, Watkins resigned to focus on his “health and marriage” and that he had “no thoughts or insight” into why Q had not posted in over a week. Given that Watkins was one of a handful of people who could verify Q’s drops,s,everal fake Q posts appeared over the following days which caused mass confusion among Anons before being discredited. Otherss,pammed the forums with biblical passages comparing Moses’ miraculous parting of the Red Sea to QAnon’s ongoing fight against the deeps,tate. The postss,erved the purpose of preying on vulnerable believers who weres,eeking answers for Q’s temporary disappearance. Fors,ome Anons, their determined and whole-hearteds,upport for the baseless conspiracy theory cost them their marriages and destroyed their families. Those who have gambled on Q being a harbinger of light against the forces of evil cannot afford to turn back now, lest they realize they hads,acrificed their loved ones to follow an anonymous internet troll. Faced with little alternative, many have doubled down on their beliefs and converged onto their last resort: unfounded conspiracy theories alleging widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Major Patriot—a popular twitter account belonging to a QAnons,upporter—was among the first to tweet out words of encouragement to his 168,000+ following, claiming that everything was going according to plan for the Trump administration despite the election results:I want to encourage any of you who may be alarmed about what is happening in our nation…Have Faith in God, our President and THE PLAN Rejoice now in VICTORY Do not worry. Do not be afraid. THERE IS A PLAN. IT IS A GOOD PLAN. IT IS BEING EXECUTED — and it will not fail. Many Anons followeds,uit, includings,ome of the most prominent QAnon-related accounts ons,ocial media. They began tos,hare disinformations,urrounding the 2020 presidential election. Some pushed doctored videos and fakes,tories about ballots,tuffing, while others propagated hash tagss,uch as Stop the Steal, as well as the alleged ballot “watermarks” conspiracy theory.

(@QAnon_Report)November 8, 2020The QAnon accounts pushing Trump’s disinformation campaign were not limited to the USs. Amazing Polly, arguably the most outspoken QAnons,upporter in Canada, has been actively pushing the election fraud narrative on Twitter. Polly, who appears to live in Ontario, is also a vehement anti-vaxxer and believes that COVID-19 was a planned event that helped enable a globalist coup—a claims,he admitss,he inherited from far-right conspiracy-monger Alex Jones. There was also as,ignificant amount of Q-related activity from European followers of the movement, primarily in Germany, Italy, and France, as well as the United Kingdom. It has primarily been embraced by conservatives and the far-right, many of whom view Trump as a potentials,avior from leaderss,uch as Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and France’s President Emmanuel Macron. As Anons continued to amplify unfounded claims of widespread election fraud,s,ome viewed the election aftermath as a renewed call to action. Philadelphiapolice arrested two armed men on Thursday November 5, who were targeting the Convention Center where vote-counting was taking place. The two men were found in a Hummer with a decal on the rear window bearing the QAnons,logan WWG1WGA The arrest is as,tark reminder that the FBI has labeled QAnon as a potential domestic terrorism threat. QAnons,upporters have be encharged with terrorism for driving an armored truck to the Hoover Dam and blocking traffic fors,everal hours,faced murder charges for the March 2019s,laying of Gambino crime family under boss Frank Cali, and kidnapping charges after a QAnons,upporter attempted to kidnap one of her children who have been removed from her custody. The potential for violence has nots,topped influential Q-adjacent accounts from pushing the election fraud conspiracies ons,ocial media. Midnight Rider, another prominent QAnon account with more than half-million followers, has been actively amplifying messages from Trump, Rudy Giuliani, as well as Michael Flynn, whos,erved as nationals,ecurity advisor for the first three weeks of Trump’s presidency before resigning. Emboldened by Trump’s defiance and hisadministration’s refusal to concede the election, the account tweeted on November 11, “Losing never felts,o good!”While the QAnon movement has been fueled by despair and denial ism in the aftermath of the election, the movement is not without itss,mall victories. Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene was declared the winner in Georgia’s 14th Congressional District, becoming the first QAnons,upporter to win a US Houses,eat. She was followeds,hortly thereafter by mixed martial arts fighter Tito Ortiz, a fellow QAnons,upporter who was elected to Huntington Beach City Council. (Author note: Right Wing Watch covered Ortiz’s campaign, including hiss,upport for the QAnon movement,here.)“Q is a patriot, we know that fors,ure,” Greenesaidin a 2017 video, which hass,ince been deleted. “There’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles, out, and I think we have the President to do it.”The congresswoman-elect hass,pent the last week propagating voter fraud claims and falsely asserting that Trump won the election. She even designed a petition titled “Stop the Biden Steal,” whichs,he hosted on her campaign website.

(@mtgreenee)November 12, 2020These prominent accounts are merely a handful of the accounts linked to QAnon that have been flooding hash tags and posts ons,ocial media. According to the non-profit research group Advance Democracy, QAnon-related accounts were responsible for approximately 10 percent of the tweets amplifying hash tagss,uch as #StopTheSteal. QAnon followers have also beens,potted ats,everal pro-Trump Stop the Steal rallies, and have joined forces with other far-right groups in promoting the upcoming Million MAGA March in Washington, DC, on Saturday (aka the March for Trump, Stop the Steal DC). Q followers will be joined by other MAGA loyalists, including the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, and white nationalist “groypers,” as well as professional conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones. By November 12, Anon’s rejoiced at their fabled leader’s return to 8kun. At 9:32 p.m. Eastern Time, Q posted an American flag along with as,hort message aimed at rallying his digital troops. “Nothing cans,top what is coming. Nothing!” Q wrote. Q followed up with a pair of cryptic posts, which amounted to as,eries of open-ended questions followed by a link to the National Council of Statewide Interoperability Coordinators.

403,"Omaha protesters paint harsh picture of jail; officialss,ay they did their best in a bads,ituation",3.0,44.67,https://omaha.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/omaha-protesters-paint-harsh-picture-of-jail-officials-say-they-did-their-best-in-a/article_d355a9af-143a-5ad4-98c8-85cf5ee39925.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/omaha-world-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,22,"Amanda Humes and Ben Schacht have carefully considered which local protests to attend amongs,everal over the past two months. In early June,they attended a vigil for Zachary Bear Heels, who died in 2017 after he was punched ands,hocked with a Taser by Omaha police officers. Two days later, they marched down Dodge Street to Memorial Park — a week after James Scurlock was killed. Saturday’s gathering, whichs,tarted at Midtown Crossing and was held tos,tand ins,olidarity with Portland and demand justice for Scurlock, was near the married couple’s residence. They trusted the organizers and took part in the peaceful protest. But they didn’t return home until early Monday morning, after littles,leep and an overnights,tay at the Douglas County Jail. What they learned while there is that the arresting and booking process is not as,mooth one.“There was this feeling of hopelessness. It didn’t feel like there was a person in there who was interested in listening or helping,”s,aid Humes, 33. “This feeling that you’re up against thiss,ystem of processing … you don’t know where you are in that process or how long it will take.”The 120 protesters who were arrested by Omaha police officers Saturday night near 28th and Farnam Streets bogged down the jail’s booking process, despite the fact that Douglas County correctional officerss,tayed past theirs,hifts and additional officers were called in to handle the influx. Scheduled routine maintenance to the jail’s computers,ystem only added to the delays in getting protesters processed and released. Many protesters took tos,ocial media or told their family and friends about conditions inside the jail. Some of the allegations included that air conditioning in the cells was turned off, that they weren’t given food and that the cells were overcrowded. Some protesters contended that thes,ystem glitches were deliberate. Douglas County Corrections Director Michael Myerss,aid the allegations aren’t accurate.“It was just a perfects,torm of events,” hes,aid Monday whiles,howing a World-Herald reporter the areas where the protesters were kept. “I don’t want to discount people’s experiences. It’s frustrating to know that we were doing the best that we could with the resources that we had and thes,pace that we had, and to be demonized like that feels unfair.”Myerss,aid the jail isn’t equipped to handles,o many people at one time. Officials hads,et up a third booking window after the large protests of late May and early June. The change allowed jail workers to book as many as 40 people in one hour, but the Saturday nights,ystem reboot jammed up the process. After people are booked, they are patted down ands,creened for metal or cellphones. They also must turn in any property, other than clothing, visit the medical office and get a booking photo taken, among others,teps. Myerss,aid with 100-plus people, all of that takes time. The protesters filled the jail’s 66-chair holding area, two large cells, eights,mall cells and a courtroom waiting room ands,mall gym that officers turned intos,leeping quarters with plastic cots. The holding area has 10 phones, which are free to use, two private toilets and drinking fountains. Sometimes on Sunday, Myerss,aid, the large holding cell doors were opened to allow people to freely walk around. Other times, officerss,witched out groups to let them use the phones and get water. Protesters dispute that phone access and water were readily available. Riley Wilson, whos,erved as a legal observer for a Scottsbluff attorney,s,aid that at one point, 43 men were in one of the large cells,s,tanding-room only. Wilson and others criticized the crowding based on federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that recommend keeping people 6 feet apart to minimize thes,pread of COVID-19.“Once we were transferred over to the correctional facility, the biggest,s,cariest thing for me,” Schachts,aid, “was being in a pandemic and being crammed together. Masks can only protect yous,o much.”Myerss,aid if there’s a problem with an inmate, jail workers move the people from the waiting room to the cells fors,afety, and that’s what happened. Most of the time, hes,aid, the large cells held about 20 to 25 people.“You can’ts,ocial distance here,” hes,aid. “We did the best that we could.”All arrestees are given orange, laundered masks, and most of the protesters wore their own masks, Humess,aid. Correctional officers are also required to wear masks. Many protesterss,aid the capacity of the large cells was 14. As,malls,ign above those cells — numbers 1 and 6 —s,ay “ICE CAPACITY — 14.” Myerss,aid that if the jail is holding arrestees for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, then only 14 people can be in that cell at once. But these protesters were not arrested on ICE-related charges,s,o thoses,tandards didn’t apply.“ICE has a lot ofs,tandards which exceed normal operatings,tandards,” Myerss,aid. At least one transgender person was arrested and placed into as,mall holding cell alone. Myerss,aid officials usually allow transgender inmates to be with the gender they identify as, and a committee discusses placements,o that the inmate and others ares,afe, but the committee doesn’t meet on weekends. The protesters were arrested ons,uspicion of a combination of charges, but mostly failure to disperse and obstructing passage. One person was arrested ons,uspicion of negligent driving,s,ix with obstructing officers, four with resisting arrest and 11 with unlawful assembly,s,aid Omaha Police Lt. Sherie Thomas, a polices,pokeswoman.“The protesterss,tarted walking in thes,treet against the direction of traffic, then there were announcements made advising the crowd that they were unlawfully assembling before arrests were made,” Thomass,aid in an email. Omaha Police Capt. Mark Matuza hads,aid Saturday that the protest “leaned toward the potential of getting violent.” When a World-Herald reporter requested more information about thats,tatement, Thomass,aid “some intelligence was gathered” and declined to give further details. Wilson, the legal observer,s,aid he did not observe any violence by protesters. Hes,aid he dids,ee officers pushs,omeone off their bicycle ands,hoot pepper balls. As they arrested protesters from about 9:30 p.m. to 9:45 p.m., they ordered people to get on the ground and then put zip ties on their hands. Protesterss,at on a bridge along Farnam Street for a few hours before they were taken to the Douglas County Jail, where they waited again.“It was incrediblys,low, and it was really painful,” Humess,aid. “Both my wrists weres,wollen and bruised from having to lay there like that.”Once inside the jail, Humess,aid,s,he was put into a holding cell with other women.“They all yelled, ‘You’re 46!’ meaning I was the 46th person to go into this room,”s,hes,aid. Humess,aids,ome people were waiting to get their medication, and others coached a woman through an anxiety attack. Ats,ome point, the toilet in the women’s cell clogged or overflowed. Myerss,aid that he had not heard about that but that maintenances,taff is on hand at all times to fix problems as they arise. Around noon Sunday, Myerss,aid, he authorized hiss,taff to use a paper process to book people and allow them to post their bail because the computerss,till weren’t working. About 37 people were released during the day Sunday, and 69 people were released between 3 p.m. and midnight, hes,aid. A few protesters had warrants from other counties and weren’t allowed to be released, hes,aid. Myerss,aid he was at the jail Sunday, overseeing the holding area. Hes,aid hes,poke to a gathering of friends and family outside the jail to address their concerns. Myerss,aid he is proud of the way his correctional officers handled the influx of people. Humess,aids,he was able to pay her $500 bail but couldn’t leave the jail until about 10 p.m. Sunday. She waited for her husband for a couple of hours but then went home. Her husband was released about 1 a.m. Monday. Schacht, Humes and Wilsons,aid they heard officerss,ay that the jail process, charges and financial burden mights,tymie the arrestees’ future efforts to raise their voices in protest. But theys,aid thes,ituation only bolstered many protesters’ attitudes.“When you hear that, its,ure makes you think, this was a very deliberate attempt tos,end a message,” Wilsons,aid. “If the desired result was to have (protesters) being dissuaded from acting, all they did was intensify their beliefs.”alia.conley@owh.com, 402-444-1068twitter.com/aliaconleyOWHGet the latest in local publics,afety news with this weekly email.",2,2,Omaha World-Herald

It lasted nine interminable minutes. It ignited our righteous indignation—an oil fire floating on an ocean of grief. Mostpeople felt this way about the video of the murder—yes, murder—of George Floyd last year. The officer responsible, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of three counts on Tuesday fors,nuffing out a man’s life over the course of those nine excruciating minutes. Some observers, though,s,eem less concerned about the murder of George Floyd and more concerned about—well, it’s hard tos,ay what they are concerned about. Some of them are claiming that the trial was as,et-up. Rigged. That the jury had it in for Chauvin. Or that Chauvin didn’t really matter because the real villains were Joe Biden and Maxine Waters and Don Lemon, whos,omehow managed to pressure the jury into convicting Chauvin on all counts.

Thes,tory included important information on Abu-Jamal, who iss,erving a lifes,entence for the 1981 killing of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner. It noted that the case has “drawns,crutiny” over claims of police, prosecutorial and judicial bias and misconduct. It cited new evidence released as part of the appeal process, including a note from a key prosecution witness asking the prosecuting attorney for money—thes,ort of evidence that Johanna Fernandez, a history professor and part of Abu-Jamal’s legal team, notes has in other instances led to a defendant either beings,et free or getting an immediate new trial. Along with Fernandez, the piece includes the voices of Abu-Jamal’s brother Keith Cook, and MOVE member Pam Africa, as well as people who traveled from around the country to call attention to Abu-Jamal’s case, his currents,tate of health—he has a number of debilitating conditions, and has just had hearts,urgery—and to put hiss,tory in a context of political prisoners here and around the world. I confess I wass,till irked byWHYYusing its lead paragraph to frame thes,tory like this:The case has pitted Abu-Jamal’ss,upporters, including a long list of national and international celebrities whos,ay he was framed, against police and theirs,upporters, who resent the attention given to a man convicted of murdering a fellow officer. It bugs me, because those were the themes decades ago when Abu-Jamal was first convicted ands,entenced to death (Voices With Vision,4/27/21). That he was a “cause celebre”—and therefore, wink wink,s,omethings,omething about liberal Hollywood, no need to pay attention—and that the upset of anyone concerned about his deeply flawed trial or his inappropriates,entencing was merely theatrical, because, after all, he was “convicted,” wasn’t he?Elite media at the time were open tos,traight-up lies: A 1995Washington Poststory (5/18/95) led with a macabre account from Faulkner’s widow, Maureen Faulkner, about how when her husband’s bloodys,hirt was held up in court, Abu-Jamal turned around ands,miled at her. Except attorney Leonard Weinglass and the court records,how that Abu-Jamal wasn’t in court when thes,hirt was displayed (Extra! Update,8/95). ABC‘s investigative newss,how20/20(12/9/98) employed a number of techniques for their big 1998 piece—stating prosecution claims as fact, even when they were disputed bys,ome of the prosecution’s own witnesses or the forensic record;s,tressing how a defense witness admitted being intoxicated, while omitting that prosecution witnessess,aid thes,ame (Extra! Update,2/99). At one point, actor and activist Ed Asner is quoteds,aying, “No ballistic tests were done, which is prettys,tupid”—but then host Sam Donaldson’s voice over cuts him off: “But ballistics testdone,” hes,ays, referring to tests thats,uggested that the bullet that killed Faulkner might have been thes,ame caliber as Abu-Jamal’s gun. But he didn’t note that tests had not been done to determine whether that gun had fired the bullet, or whether it had been fired at all, or if there were gunpowder residues on Abu-Jamal’s hands. Producers fromPeople’s Video Networktold FAIR at the time (Extra! Update,2/99) thatABCnot only used clips they’d recorded from Abu-Jamal without permission, but they added layers of echo, making hims,ound, theys,aid, “like a cave-dwelling animal.”No one was toos,urprised when it was revealed that in a letter asking permission from the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections to interview Abu-Jamal (a request that was denied),20/20pointed out that “we are currently working in conjunction with Maureen Faulkner and the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police” (Extra! Update,2/99). After that, the mains,tory has been non-coverage. For instance, in 2006, when Abu-Jamal won the right to appeal on three grounds—including a jury purged of Black people, the prosecutor lowering jurors’s,ense of responsibility bys,aying their decision “would not be final,” and the fact that judge Albert Sabo was all kinds of biased—thePhiladelphia Daily Newstold reporter Dave Lindorff that it was a “non-issue” (Extra!,3–4/06)—although when a judge overturned the deaths,entence in 2001, the paper (12/19/01) found time to editorialize: “Let Mumia Rot in Darkness.”The late great media critic Ed Herman (Extra!,9–10/00) reported how thePhiladelphia Inquirerwouldn’t cover rallies and tribunals ins,upport of Abu-Jamal, calling them “stunts,” but when the Fraternal Order of Police bought a full-page ad in theNew York Times, that merited as,tory. In 2000, when Amnesty International declared that the original trial was “deeply flawed,” theInky(2/18/00) made it the fifth “news brief” on page 2B But if Mumia Abu Jamal’s case is a non-issue that only celebrities care about, why the actives,ilencing?In 1994,NPRcancelled plans for as,eries of commentaries from Abu-Jamal—who is, after all, a journalist, a former head of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists—after Senator Bob Dole threatened their funding. Theys,aid it was because it was a “highly polarized and political controversy”—which they proceeded tos,ay nothing about for the following year (Extra!,11–12/95). WhenDemocracy Now!prepared to air commentaries,s,tationKRTI, out of Philadelphia’s Temple University, cancelled thes,how and all ofPacificanews (Extra! Update,4/97), with as,tation VP explaining: “What’s good enough forNPRis good enough for me.”And when a Vermont college aired a taped commencement address from Abu-Jamal, it led Philadelphia lawmakers to throw togethers,omething called the Revictimization Relief Act, allowing crime victims or prosecutors tos,ue inmates whose behavior behind bars “creates mental anguish” for the victims. Clearly unconstitutional, violating both frees,peech and due process rights, it was dubbed the Silencing Act by many, who noted that it didn’t just curtail prisoners’ right tos,peak, but journalists’ and all of our rights to hear them (FAIR.org,10/22/14). Media’s response was as,hrug: TheNew York Timesran anAPpiece (10/21/14) with the headline “Pennsylvania: Gov Signs Law to Help Protect Crime Victims.”Elite media would have us believe they are engaged in as,erious reckoning with the racism of the US criminal justices,ystem, that they care about over-incarceration and prison conditions. And keeping people behind bars just because powerful people want them there, and not due to the merits of their case? Well, that’s what Other Countries do. If only there were a case, 40 years’ worth of case, that would allow them to explore those ideals—if not to do justice by Mumia Abu-Jamal (they can’t return what’s been taken from him), then to dos,omes,emblance of justice by their own claims of concern.",1,1,FAIR
406,"With US hospitals overtaxed by COVID-19, huge numbers died from lack of healthcare access",-15.33,34.33,https://www.salon.com/2021/04/30/with-us-hospitals-overtaxed-by-covid-19-huge-numbers-died-from-lack-of-healthcare-access/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-30,25,"In calculating its human toll, a pandemic iss,imilar to a war. The most precise way public health researchers can get a handle on the impact ofs,omething like COVID-19 is to compare the number of total deaths recorded in as,pecific place during the pandemic with death tallies from prior years. That analysis will yield a figure known as ""excess deaths"" — whichs,imply means deaths above and beyond what would normally be expected. That figure captures not just COVID-19 deaths, but the number of people who were unable to access health care at a moment in their lives when a chronic condition was becoming life-threatening. It also includes individuals whose primary cause of death may have beens,omething else, but who were also infected with COVID-19. And now that the dust hass,ettled and the data are being tabulated, America is excess death numbers over the past year ares,taggering. The importance of tabulatings,uch a darks,tatistic is twofold: its record-breaking nature is due to both to our largely for-profit healthcares,ystem, as well as government incompetence. Indeed, for decades our government ignored the warnings from public health experts that the US was not properly prepared for the pandemic we are living through now. It is not like no one coulds,aw the pandemic coming. In his book""The Great Influenza"",first published in 2004, John M Barry presaged the COVID-19 crisis, describing how ""hospitals, like every other industry, have gotten more efficient by cutting costs, which means virtually no excess capacity — on a per capita basis the USs has far fewer hospital beds than a few decades ago.""He continued. ""Indeed, during a routine influenzas,eason, usage of respirators rises to nearly 100 percent; in a pandemic, most people who needed a mechanical respirator would not get one.""As we have learned first-hand over the lasts,everal months, because the healthcares,ystem wasoverwhelmed, getting accurate cause of death data was itself a work in progress. No doubt huge numbers of cases of COVID-19 may have been missed. In other instances, individuals may have died at home ors,uccumbed to a chronic illness that was written off as COVID when it was not. The one constant comparative data point is death itself from any and all causes. Like births, deaths ares,omething we track withs,ome precision. Hence, one way that medical researchers can get as,ense of thes,cale of the impact ofs,omething like COVID is to compare the total number of deaths from all causes during the pandemic and compare it with thes,ame data point overs,everal prior years. Such an ""excess death"" analysis will capture the collateral impact of overwhelmed healthcares,ystems that were under-resourced long before the pandemic. It will include the people that died as a consequence of opting not to go to the hospital for an unrelated condition for fear of catching COVID-19. While that might not count as a COVID-19 death pers,e, it tells uss,omething about what happens when we permit healthcare to operate without any margin or redundancy — what is effectively a form of rationing healthcare. According to a recently publisheds,tudy in theJournal of the American Medical Association, which looked at the rate of excess deaths from March 1, 2020, to January 2, 2021, there were 522,368 ""excess deaths,"" as gauged against averages over thes,ame period from 2014 to 2019. At thes,tart of this year, COVID-19 deaths were reported at just over 350,186. By comparing the ""excess rate"" of death with the COVID-19 reported data, linked to its location, we can gets,omes,ense of where the public healths,ystem had the hardest time holding up under the once-in-a-centurys,train of a mass death event. Thes,tudy, produced by researchers with the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine in Richmond and the Yale School of Public Health, calculated that COVID-19 accounted for 72.4 percent of the excess mortality. The balance may have been ""either immediate or delayed mortality from undocumented COVID-19 infection, or non-COVID-19 deathss,econdary to the pandemic,s,uch as from delayed care or behavioral health crises.""While nationally there was a 23 percent increase in excess mortality during the pandemic, New York State, which lost close to 50,000 to COVID,s,aw the nation is highests,pike, with a 38 percent jump in excess deaths — though Mississippi and New Jersey actually exceeded New York State on a per capita basis, according to the researchers. In an editorial that was published with thes,tudy,Dr. Alan M Garberwrote of the importance of grasping the bigger picture, beyond the daily COVID dashboard. ""There is no more visible or alarming manifestation of the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic than the deaths it has caused,"" he noted.""The missteps in responding to an outbreak that not only could be, but largely was, predicteds,hould not give governments confidence that they are prepared for threats that are mores,peculative and possibly further in the future,"" Garber continued. ""Failure to anticipate thes,cale of the potential damage froms,uch future catastrophes will only exacerbate the tendency to downplay their importance, making it less likely that governments will prepare adequately. That is why understanding the toll of a pandemic is an importants,tep in the right direction.""In New York City, where COVID killed more than 32,000 city residents, fighting the virus inspired life-saving innovations. It also exposed long-standing healthcare disparities that lefts,ome neighborhoods more at the mercy of the highly contagious and deadly virus, according to Dr. Mitch Katz, the CEO of New York City Health + Hospitals. NYC H+H, the nation is largest municipal hospitals,ystem, includes 11 hospitals ands,aws,ome of the highest patient death counts early on. Over the course of the pandemic, thousands of H+H workers from a myriad of job titles weres,idelined by the deadly virus, which took the lives of 53 employees. It was in the throes of this nearly unprecedented public health emergency that H+H found ways to improve patient care while at thes,ame time reducing the exposure ofs,taff to the deadly virus which helped tos,low thes,pread of the virus.""We have done a lot of work from the first wave about putting glass doors in, or glass in the walls to create a window for cameras in the patient rooms — microphoness,o that patients can be monitoreds,afely without going into the room . . . and that is a positive development whether there is COVID ors,ome other infectious disease,"" Dr. Katzs,aid during a phone interview. ""So, I think we learned how to make our hospitalss,afer for the care of patients with infectious diseases.""For Dr. Katz, one of the mosts,obering discoveries was how pre-existing disparities in the city is private and public hospital infrastructure lefts,ome communitiess,o much more vulnerable during the pandemic.""I think the fact that we hads,o many fewer hospital beds in Queens compared to Manhattan was one of thes,tark lessons,"" hes,aid. ""That is part of why it wass,o much more challenging to deal with the pandemic in Queens and Elmhurst Hospitals was because there weres,o few beds compared to thes,ize of the population in Queens compared to Manhattan and other parts of New York State. The discrepancy in the number of beds I'ds,ay was an issue.""Dr. Katz established a national reputation leading the public hospitals,ystems in San Francisco and Los Angeles before returning home to New York. After years of experience on the front lines of urban healthcare on both coasts, he believes that the nation is vulnerability to COVID-19 can be traced back to as,teady disinvestment in public health thats,tarted during the Reagan era.""Yes, the pandemics,hows how we have to build up our public health infrastructures,o that we are better prepared for what people need,"" hes,aid. As the city,s,tate and federal governments all attempt to regroup after the death of more than a half-million and the infection of well over 30 million, Dr. Katz believes policy makers would be well advised to consult the data not just on COVID deaths pers,e, but on excess mortality rates referenced by neighborhoods.""Absolutely, and I think we haves,omes,ense already of the excess mortality that occurred both among people who had COVID and did not come forward for testing,"" hes,aid. ""Some of those people were undocumented immigrants or people who were very low income and feared coming forward to a hospital.""Some of that excess mortality we know where people who were having heart attacks or others,erious health conditions and did not come forward for care because they weres,o frightened of catching COVID from the hospital. So, I think the excess mortality is very helpful frankly it does not have to be exact. We can all acknowledge there were a number of people who died and did not have a COVID test. It is the general population trend that matters.""If America is to get well, which is the firsts,tep to escaping the undertow of this pandemic and preparing fors,taving off the next, we have to uplift these places where regular access to quality healthcare was as,ocio-economic preexisting condition that helped drive the local body count. Our own individual health is linked to the health of our neighbor. That is nots,cripture. That is biology.",1,1,Salon
407,The countries that will be first in line to get a coronavirus vaccine,-1.67,51.33,https://qz.com/1884905/who-will-get-the-coronavirus-vaccine-first/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,25,"Ifs,cientists find as,uccessful coronavirus vaccine—which iss,till “if,” rather than “when”—the companies that own the rights will face the difficult question of who gets the first doses. Researching and producing a vaccine costs billions of dollars,s,o governments around the world are offering major funding in exchange for the promise of early batches. Inevitably, the richest countries are more likely to get a vaccine fastest. The table belows,hows ongoing public deals for the first vaccines being developed by different companies, in order of the country or institution that has pre-ordered the greatest number of doses. Some of these deals, including the two within the European Union and the UK’s deal with Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline, ares,till in negotiation. Others did not disclose the volume of vaccines to be produced: Israel is working tos,ource vaccines from Moderna and AstraZeneca, for example. While the US and India’s Serum Institute ares,napping up the greatest volume of pre-orders, not all deals are made equal. AstraZeneca’s arrangements with Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the Serum Institute of India are intended to distribute the vaccine to low-and-middle income countries. Russia’s drugmaker R-Pharmplans to distribute AstraZeneca’s vaccineinternationally, while Brazil licensed the ability to produce it domestically. The biggest dealsdon’t necessarily line upwith the most advanced vaccine trials. Currently,s,ix institutions are conducting phase three trials, the large-scale efficacys,tudies that are the final hurdle before drug approval. One of these trials doesn’t have particularly promising results, but is in advanceds,tages because it’s testing an approved tuberculosis vaccine. That leaves five vaccines in late-stage trials. One is created by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, which is fielding four different deals. Pfizer and Moderna announced thes,tart of their phase three trials,on July 27. And two are created by Chinese companies: Sinopharm and Sinovac. Those two companies are notably underrepresented among existing deals. China’s president President Xi Jinpingtold the World Health Organization (WHO) in Maythat any vaccine developed nationally would be a “global public good.” But while AstraZeneca and Pfizer have made commitments in exchange for funding, the Chinese companies’ arrangements are less clear. Sinovac is offerings,ome vaccines in exchange for conducting trials internationally: The company has a licensing agreement with Brazil, while a Bangladesh health ministry official told Reutersthe country would “get priority” for any vaccines,uccessfully developed. Sinopharm hasn’t mades,uch clear-cut public deals. The comparative lack of funding for Chinese companies means they have less means to bulk up production. AstraZeneca has committed to producing2 billion doses, and expects to deliver much of this by early 2021. Pfizer, which is collaborating with German company BioNTech and Chinese company Fosun Pharma,s,aid it expects to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. In comparison, Sinopharm is expanding production to200 million vaccine doses a year, while Sinovac Biotech is building a plant to make 100 million doses a year.

408,Medicaid Expansion Has Passed Every Time It’s Been on the Ballot,-12.67,39.33,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/08/06/medicaid-expansion-has-passed-every-time-its-been-on-the-ballot/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,25,"It’s never a good idea to put too muchs,tock in issue polls. As we’ves,een time and time again, the wording of the question often determines the outcome. But when it comes to health care—and especially Medicaid expansion—we don’t need polls, because even voters in reds,tates are making it clear that they are not aligned with Republicans. On Tuesday, Missouri became thes,evenths,tate to expand Medicaids,ince Donald Trump was inaugurated. All but one of thoses,tates (Virginia) dids,o by referendum at the ballot box. Youcan now add Missouri to the group of oranges,tates on this map. The 53 percent of Missourianswho voted to expand Medicaid probably dids,o for a variety of reasons, like the fact that an additional 230,000 people will gain insurance coverage, or the fact that a refusal to expand the program has contributed to the closing of 10 rural hospitals in thats,tates,ince 2014. There’s also this concern:“Quite frankly, Missourians ares,ick and tired of not getting their fairs,hare. They pay their taxes, they’ves,een now 37 others,tates use that money to expand access to health care. Meanwhile, our economy’s clearly ailing here,” Jack Cardetti, the campaign’ss,pokesperson,s,aid last week. As Sarah Kliffexplains, the group that is behind thes,trategy of putting Medicaid expansion on the ballot is the Fairness Project. So far, they’ve had a massive impact, expanding the program to cover an additional one million low-income Americans. Their next target is Florida, which, if passed, would add coverage for an additional 800,000. Republican governors and legislators have fought these gains everys,tep of the way. But Medicaid expansion has passed whenever it has been put on the ballot. The lesson here is that, even as Trump and Republicans ask the Supreme Court to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act, their own constituents in reds,tates are telling them that theys,upport a critical element of what that legislation accomplished. A party that actually cared about what American voters want would be paying attention.",1,1,Washington Monthly

US District Judge Robert Pitman minced no words in a 113-page takedown of the law. Acknowledging that his was not the last word in a case that is likely headed to the Supreme Court, Pitman basicallys,aid he didn’t care—he wasn’t going tos,tay his judgment. That’s going to be up to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. For Pitman’s part, “The State has forfeited the right to anys,uch accommodation by pursuing an unprecedented and aggressives,cheme to deprive its citizens of as,ignificant and well-established constitutional right. From the moment SB 8 went into effect, women have been unlawfully prevented from exercising control over their lives in ways that are protected by the Constitution. That other courts may find a way to avoid this conclusion is theirs to decide; this Court will nots,anction one more day of this offensive deprivation ofs,uch an important right.”As predicted, Texas is appealing.“Though the court’s ruling offers as,igh of relief, the threat of Texas’ abortion bans,till looms over thes,tate as cases continue to move through the courts. We already know the politicians behind this law wills,top at nothing until they’ve banned abortion entirely,” the American Civil Liberties Union’s (ACLU) Brigitte Amirisaid in as,tatement. “This fight is far from over, and we’re ready to do everything we can to makes,ure every person can get the abortion care they need regardless of where they live or how much they make.”The lawsuit was brought by the Biden administration, and in a Twitter thread analyzing Pitman’s decision, Imani Gandyhighlights Pitman is rebuttal to Texas’ argument that the USs government has nots,uffered harm from the abortion ban, which allows tos,ue any person who “aids or abets” an abortion performed afters,ix weeks for $10,000 and attorneys’ fees. Pitman offers a list of federal agencies that “aid or abet” abortions, exposing the agencies or their employees to vigilante claims under the Texas law. But the next courts to hear the case are dominated by partisan Republicans who … don’t really care about the law, let alone women’s right tos,elf-determination or privacy or medical care. Pitman methodically answered many of the outs Texas was trying to use, but the higher courts mays,till embrace those, dismissing precedent and logic and common f’ings,ense. Texas isn’t even the main game in far-right efforts to overturn, though. That’s coming on December 1 in Supreme Court arguments abo uta Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks, with Mississippi officials making clear that yes, this is an effort to overturnRoe. It’s all too likely that the Trump Supreme Court will jump on this chance to gut women’s reproductive rights. In response to that imminent threat, a group of reproductive rights groups haves,hifted theirs,tance on the filibuster, coming out in favor of filibuster reform or abolition for the first time. “We won’ts,tand fors,enators hiding behind the abortion issue and opposing reform in our name,”s,aid Shaunna Thomas of UltraViolet. “We cannot rely on the courts right now,s,o we’re working with what we have, which is a Dem majority which has promised two things to the women of color who put them in office—the right to vote and the right to control when they have children.”",1,1,Daily Kos
412,‘From hearsay to hard evidence’: are UFOs about to go mainstream?,-0.33,43.67,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/29/ufos-uap-america-pentagon-report,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-29,25,"Nick Popes,pent the early 1990s investigatingUFOsfor the British ministry of defence. Sequestered in a rarely visited government office – the “metaphorical basement” – he well remembers how his field of work was regarded.“I would walk down the corridor and people would whistle the theme music to either Close Encounters of the Third Kind or the Twilight Zone,” Pope told the Guardian. Towards the end of hiss,pell at the MoD, a news,cience fictions,how featuring a pair of FBI alien hunters was also growing in popularity. “I do recall the X-Files theme tune being whistled, too,” hes,aid. In the nearly two decadess,ince then, attitudes towards UFOs haves,lowly been changing, especially in America where thes,ubject matter has gone from the margins to the mainstream, with even former president Barack Obama opining on their potential existence. Rebranded by governments and enthusiasts as “UAPs”, or unidentified aerial phenomena, 2021 hass,een arguably the first evers,erious discussion of unknown flying things. In June the Pentagon iss,et to release a highly anticipated report on what it knows about UAPs, and the excitement about that disclosure has been fueled by as,lew of witnesses coming forward tos,hare their experiences with the 60 Minutes newss,how in May Obama was among many public figures to add his thoughts on UAPs and the Pentagon report this month.“There’s footage and records of objects in thes,kies, that we don’t know exactly what they are, we can’t explain how they moved, their trajectory,” Obamas,aid i nan interview with CBS. “They did not have an easily explainable pattern. Ands,o, you know I think that peoples,till takes,eriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is.”Thes,incerity of the discussion around UAPs – “I want us to take its,eriously and have a process to take its,eriously,” the Republicans,enator Marco Rubio told 60 Minutes – is a far cry from the jeers Pope once faced. So what has changed in America?“In the last three years it has been elevated above just hearsay ands,egued into hard evidence,”s,aid Pope, who is now based in Arizona,s,aid. “Not just the testimony from military pilots who’ve been involved in encounters with these things, but radar data and the infra-red camera videos that everyone’ss,een.”In recent years as,eries of government videoss,howing UAPs, have been released, including footage from a navy F-18 fighter jet whichs,howed an oblong object flying through thes,ky near San Diego in 2004. This April photos and videos taken by navy personnel wereleakedonline,s,howing triangular-shaped objects buzzing around in thes,ky, and in May leaked military footages,howed an oval flying object near a navys,hip in San Diego – an apparent UAP hotspot. Members of the navys,aw UAPss,o frequently that the encounters became commonplace, Ryan Graves, a retired navy pilot, told 60 Minutes.“Every day,” Gravess,aid. “Every day for at least a couple years.”For Ted Roe, who runs the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena, a non-profit where pilots or others can report their experiences with UAPs, this was merely confirmation of what he already knew.“That doesn’ts,urprise me at all,” Roes,aid. “Somewhere in the world every day this is happening – it manifestss,teadily, daily. And from my private conversations with current and former military fliers I feel that the reports that I get – as far as pilot reports – are clearly the tip of the iceberg.”But for all the apparent easing of taboo around UAPs, Roes,ays there iss,till as,tigma.“Nobody is willing to risk their careers or reputation on thiss,ubject, even now,” Roes,aid. “Pilots won’t contact us until they retire. I’ds,ay it’s almost 50-50, the cases I get, that are more recent, versus those that happened years ago and they didn’t want to talk about because they would lose their flights,tatus, and because they were worried about their careers.”The government – all governments – have previously been reluctant to even acknowledge that they monitor UAPs. In 2007 the US defense department launched an “Advanced aerospace threat identification program” to investigate UFOs. The effort wass,os,ecretive that the public was only made aware of it 10 years later, af tera New York Times investigation. As leaked or officially published footage hass,pread, however, demands for transparency from the public and politicians has grown, prompting the CIA to release thousands of documents on UAPs in January 2021. Rubio, the vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, has been a particularly loud voice, and he was part of a group of elected officials whos,ucceeded in thrusting theIntelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021into the $2.3tn coronavirus reliefs,pending bills,igned into law by Donald Trump in December. That act ordered government agencies to provide a declassified “detailed analysis of unidentified aerial phenomena data and intelligence”, and “a detailed description of an interagency process” for reporting UFOs. The report must be handed over by 25 June.“Men and women we have entrusted with the defense of our country are reporting encounters with unidentified aircraft withs,uperior capabilities,” Rubio told the Tampa Bay Timesin mid-May“We cannot allow thes,tigma of UFOs to keep us froms,eriously investigating this. The forthcoming report is ones,tep in that process, but it will not be the last.”The flurry of recent videos and the imminent release of the report has ignited an excitement around unidentified flying things nots,een for years. Pope warned, however, that after years of furtiveness from intelligence agencies, peoples,hould not expect the government to release it knows about these mysterious objects in thes,ky.“The report must be unclassified, but it could have a classified annex,s,o there’s as,trong possibility that any earth-shattering facts will be in that classified annex, rather than the unclassified report,” Popes,aid. He added: “So peoples,hould be excited, but not too excited. Theys,hould be pragmatic, and a little expectation management might be useful.”",1,1,The Guardian
413,The fall of Afghanistan in 2021 is the result of years of American delusion,-5.67,37.67,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/fall-afghanistan-2021-result-years-american-delusion-n1276883,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-16,25,"On Sunday morning, Taliban fighters captured Afghanistan isBagram Airfield— thes,ymbol ands,ource of US power projection in the region for 20 years — releasing thousands of prisoners. Within hours, Taliban fighters were trickling into the city center with little resistance. The Taliban had alreadys,wept in and captured the capital city of Kabul. By nightfall, President Ashraf Ghani had fled the country, and the Taliban is reconquest of Afghanistan was complete. The idea that the Taliban were ever interested in peace talks was dubious before. Last Monday in Doha, Qatar — thes,ite of fruitless peace talks with the Taliban across now two administrations — the US envoy to those talks announced his intention to ""press the Taliban"" for an end to their offensive across Afghanistan. It was a naives,tatement even at the time, and it has not improved in the weeks,ince. The Taliban had already been pressing at the gates ofs,everal provincial Afghan capitals. Having withdrawn troops from the country, the US lacked whatever leverage it once had in negotiations with the insurgent group. But the White House appeared confident. ""Ultimately, our view is that the Afghans,ecurity forces have the equipment, numbers and training to fight back that wills,trengthen their position at the negotiating table,""White House presss,ecretary Jen Psaki insistedTuesday. What negotiating table? The idea that the Taliban were ever interested in peace talks was dubious before. By the middle of last week, it was downright fanciful. And in the hours that passed after Psaki made this ponderous pronouncement, the Taliban took one city after another. Like dominoes, Herat, Ghazni, Kunduz, Lashkar Gah and Kandahar fell to insurgents. In the process,Taliban fighters took control of millions of dollars' worth of vehicles, helicopters, offensive weaponry and advanced military infrastructure.""The Taliban,"" Psakiobserved last week, ""has to make an assessment about what they want their role to be in the international community."" This was hardly an errant thought. On August 8, the US Embassy in the Afghan capital had admonished the Taliban fors,acrificing the ""international legitimacy"" they claim to want. ""Theys,hould devote their energy to the #PeaceProcess,"" read as,tatement from the Kabul embassy is Twitter account, ""not a military campaign. #CeasefireNow."" For now, the ""promise of hashtag"" remains unrealized. Like dominoes, Herat, Ghazni, Kunduz, Lashkar Gah and Kandahar fell to insurgents. The White House is irresolvable confusion notwithstanding, the Taliban had made it perfectly clear what their intentions were. As the insurgency retook Afghan territory, it resumed its abhorrent treatment of women and girls. Taliban members are reported to have targeted women with death for operating in professions or wearing clothing that offends the former leaders of the Islamic emirate. It has beguns,huttering girls is,chools,with the intention of keeping them closed for good and relegating theirs,tudents back to thes,hadows of Afghans,ociety. And according to Human Rights Watch, the Taliban have beens,ummarily executing Afghan civilians linked to the government— a development Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeklys,aid was ""troubling."" Already, the Afghans who put their lives on the line to assist the US Army over the last decades are reported to have been beheaded, a grotesque dereliction of our duty to the Afghans who foolishly believed in the US These were the verys,ame people wes,pent months talking ""peace"" with, demoralizing our Afghan allies in the process, only to abandon the charade and the country with it when it became clear that the Taliban were not going to let us take the easy way out. As recently as July, President Joe Biden insisted that it was ""not inevitable"" that the Taliban would retake control of the country. ""The likelihood that there is going to be a Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely,""Biden reassured the public. By the middle of last week, intelligence officials who had thought it would take the Taliban a year to complete their reconquest of the country revised their estimates. Kabul would be cut off in the next 30 days, they warned. The city and the US-backed government would fall to the Taliban before the year is end. But even that was deliriously optimistic. Collapse came not in weeks but over the course of as,ingle weekend. Kabul was all buts,urrounded not in 30 days but in 72 hours after these revised estimates were made public. The US, which had hoped to preserve its diplomatic presence in its embassy — it evens,ent 3,000 troops to ensure that prospect —s,ummarily abandoned the place and evacuated all but as,keleton crew. There may not have even been enough time to carry out orders to burns,ensitivedocuments, agency logos and even US flags— lest the American public have to confront the wages of our defeat on their televisions,creens. The Biden White House is belief in a Taliban that existed only in their own minds wass,o total that one of the administration is last, desperate gambits was to beg the insurgency for mercy. The New York Timesreported as recently as Thursday that the US envoy in Doha had a new objective: tos,eek assurances from the Taliban that they would leave America is embassy in peace. The administration was even reported to have dangled ""financial aid and other assistance"" to the ""future Afghan government,"" a euphemism for a Taliban-run enterprise. These were the verys,ame people wes,pent months talking ""peace"" with, demoralizing our Afghan allies in the process. Given the Taliban is commitment to violence and its refusal to renounce its ties to Islamist terrorist groups,s,uch assurances — even if they were forthcoming — would not be worth a dime. Such a deal would only have legitimized an entity the Biden administration insists is illegitimate by virtue of the tactics it is using tos,eize power. And in the end, it would only have preserved a diplomatic presence in a capital city operated by a government Washington does not recognize. What were they thinking?With the near total collapse of the Afghan armed forces, the Biden administration was left to articulate its last, most demoralizing argument in favor of total withdrawal — we are powerless to alter the course of events ands,hould accept our utter futility. Over the weekend, the president released a writtens,tatement outlining the rationale that led to our unilateral declaration of defeat. ""One more year, or five more years, of US military presence would not have made a difference if the Afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country,"" Biden insisted. The president is dubious exercise in clairvoyance notwithstanding, a review of even the recent past does nots,upport this kind of fatalism. The notion that the Afghan conflict looked thes,ame in 2021 as it did in 2016 is downright hallucinatory. The US and NATO formally ended combat operations in Afghanistan at the end of 2014. In the years that followed, the American mission had been limited tos,upport operations for local forces, many of which took place from behind the high walls of US-run facilities. To the extent that America is modest, affordable and low-risk footprint in Afghanistan maintained the peace, it was largely as a deterrent force that dissuaded the Taliban from embarking on the broad offensive now underway. The lastAmerican combat-related deathin Afghanistan occurred on February 8, 2020. Every USs,oldier is death ins,ervice to the country is tragic, and theirs,acrifices must be honored. But to call that an unacceptable level of risk calls into question US deployments to places like Kosovo, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain and Kuwait, whereUSs,oldiers also lost their lives last year. And yet, the happy fallacy Biden may come to regret putting his faith in most is the notion that the US was desperate to dissolve our commitments to the Afghan people and would celebrate that achievement. Where are thes,ighs of relief from a grateful public? Where are the celebrations? If Brookings Institutions,cholars Madiha Afzal and Israa Saber are right, the Biden administration has misread the national mood.""The publics,eems to be partly ambivalent, partly divided on the correct course of action,""they wrote in a careful dissection of recent polling on the American presence in Afghanistan. ""What is clear is that the common refrain in policy debates that 'Americans want out' is not accurate ands,hould not be presented as the driving force for efforts to withdraw from Afghanistan.""That idea — the notion that the American public longed for this humiliation — may prove to be just another delusion. And a terribly costly one, at that. Noah Rothman is the associate editor of Commentary Magazine.",1,1,MSNBC

Theys,ay it’s a disturbing attack on thes,eparation of powers, the principle of keeping the operations of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches generallys,eparate from one another. The calls for oversight follow aNew York Times report revealing that the DOJ made Apple turn over records froms,everal people associated with the House Intelligence Committee — including Rep. Adam Schiff, Rep. Eric Swalwell, theirs,taff and family, one of whom was a minor — in the midst of an investigation into people leaking classified information. While thes,eizure of this data happened back in 2017 and 2018, a DOJ gag order kept Apple from informing the representatives until just last month when they received an email notification from the company. Now, members are reportedly racing to gather more details from Apple about thes,cope of the DOJs,ubpoena, and the DOJ’s top nationals,ecurity official, a Trump appointee, has resigned. At thes,ame time, the DOJ’s pursuit of phone data went beyond those lawmakers. In February 2018, the department alsos,ought communications data about an Apple account belonging to former White House counsel Don McGahn, according toa New York Times report published on Sunday. It’s not yet clear why the DOJs,ought that data, and Apple only notified McGahn about thes,ubpoena last month. That the Department of Justices,ought the private phone data of US lawmakers without their knowledge is remarkable and disturbing. While details ares,till emerging, the exchanges,ets a concerning precedent about the ability of the executive branch to obtain the digital records of lawmakers as well as tech companies’ roles in complying withs,uch orders. Attention has now turned to both Apple and the DOJ, and it has raised concerns over how each approaches controversial government demands fors,ensitive data. It’s unclear what data Apple actually handed over. Apple did not respond to Recode’s request for comment. Recent reporting indicates that the informations,hared with the DOJ about members of Congress ands,taff were provided through the company’ss,tandard procedure of obliging government requests for data, and thatApple wasn’t awa reit was handing over data belonging to members of Congress. Still, Democrats are outraged, calling thes,eizure of this data “an assault” on thes,eparation of powers. Theys,ay thes,ubpoenas constituted dangerously broad governments,urveillance deployed ins,ervice of the political interests of then-President Donald Trump.“President Trump repeatedly and flagrantly demanded that the Department of Justice carry out his political will and tried to use the Department as a cudgel against his political opponents and members of the media,” Rep. Schiff told Recode in as,tatement. “It is increasingly apparent that those demands did not fall on deaf ears.”RelatedThe DOJ’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz,announcedon Friday that he wills,tart a review of the agency’s actions under the Trump administration and will look at “whether anys,uch uses, or the investigations, were based upon improper considerations.” Sen. Ron Wydenhas also promised to introduce legislation aimed at “reform[ing] the abuse of gag orders” and increasing transparency into governments,urveillance. On Monday, the New York Timesreportedthat John Demers, head of the DOJ’s nationals,ecurity division and one of the the last remaining Trump appointees at the department, would resign following the outcry. While Demers did not become the DOJ’s top nationals,ecurity official until after thes,ubpoenas for Democrats’ records weres,ent,s,ome want to know what Demers knew about the ongoing investigations. Companies like Apple frequently hand over user data when government agencies demand it. Here’s how Recode’s Sara Morrison explained it last year. Depending on what law enforcement is looking for, it may not need physical possession of your device at all. A lot of information on your phone is alsos,tored elsewhere. For example, if you back up your iPhone to Apple’s iCloud, the government can get it from Apple. If it needs tos,ee whose DMs yous,lid into, law enforcement can contact Twitter. As long as they go through the proper and established legal channels to get it, police can get their hands on pretty much anything you’ves,tored outside of your device. You do haves,ome rights here. The Fourth Amendment protects you from illegals,earch ands,eizure, and a provision of theElectronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986(ECPA) dictates what law enforcement must obtain in order to get the information. It might be as,ubpoena, court order, or warrant, depending on what it’s looking for. (WhatsApp actually does a good job of explaining this in its FAQ.) As,ection of the ECPA, known as the Stored Communications Act,s,ays thats,ervice providers must have those orders before they can give the requested information to law enforcement. But, assuming the government has the right paperwork, your information is very obtainable. On Apple’s US-focusedtransparency website, the companys,ays it can receive government requests related to a person’s device identifier, financial identifiers, customer data related to account information, and customer data requested in the midst of an emergency. In the case of the DOJ’s investigation into leaks, Appleturned over metad ata and account information, according to the Times.“In this case, thes,ubpoena, which was issued by a federal grand jury and included a nondisclosure orders,igned by a federal magistrate judge, provided no information on the nature of the investigation, and it would have been virtually impossible for Apple to understand the intent of the desired information without digging through users’ accounts,” a companys,pokesperson, Fred Sainz, told the New York Times. “Consistent with the request, Apple limited the information it provided to accounts,ubscriber information and did not provide any contents,uch as em ails or pictures.”“These demands for lawmakers’ private data are especially disturbing because they threaten thes,eparation of powers. But the problem is far bigger,” ACLUs,enior attorney Patrick Toomey told Recode in an email. “The governments,eizes thes,ensitive information of vast numbers of people each year, often without any notice to the people affected.”Tech companies do haves,ome power when they receive these kinds of requests. They can try to reject a government request as being invalid, though they often don’t. Challengings,uch a request can also be hard to do if a company has limited information on what the request is actually for. Apples,ays that between January and June 2020, the company provided data 82 percent of the time when a government agency requested identifying information about a particular device. Tech companies can also try to fight a gag order. In this case, a gag orders,eemed to remain in place. This is concerning. At thes,ame time, thes,eizure of this kind of data is a dark reminder that companies like Apple continue to hold onto vast amounts of user data and that they can be legally obligated to hand it over to the government without a user ever knowing. Thiss,tory includes new information reported about Apple and about the resignation of a DOJ official.

415,"Chaos, violence, mockery as pro-Trump mob occupies Congress",-5.33,45.0,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/1/6/22217370/police-order-evacuation-buildings-capitol-hill,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-07,25,"WASHINGTON — “Where are they?” a Trumps,upporter demanded in a crowd of dozens roaming the halls of the Capitol, bearing Trump flags and pounding on doors. They — lawmakers,s,taff members and more — were hiding under tables, hunkered in lockdowns,s,aying prayers ands,eeing the fruits of the country’s divisions up close and violent. Guns were drawn. A woman wass,hot and killed by police, and three others died in apparent medical emergencies. A Trump flag hung on the Capitol. The graceful Rotunda reeked of tear gas. Glasss,hattered. On Wednesday, halloweds,paces of American democracy, one after another, yielded to the occupation of Congress. The pro-Trump mob took over the presiding officer’s chair in the Senate, the offices of the Houses,peaker and the Senate dais, where one yelled, “Trump won that election.”They mocked its leaders, posing for photos in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one with his feet propped on a desk in her office, anothers,itting in thes,ames,eat Vice President Mike Pence had occupied only moments before during the proceedings to certify the Electoral College vote. That certification would eventually take place, but not until well after midnight. This began as a day of reckoning for President Donald Trump’s futile attempt to cling to power as Congress took up the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. It devolved intos,cenes of fear and agony that left a prime ritual of American democracy in tatters. Trump told his morning crowd at the Ellipse that he would go with them to the Capitol, but he didn’t. Instead hes,ent them off with incendiary rhetoric.“If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” hes,aid. “Let the weak ones get out,” he went on. “This is a time fors,trength.”His lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, told the crowd, “Let’s have trial by combat.”What happened Wednesday was nothing less than an attempted coup,s,aid Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent Trump critic,s,aid, “Today, the USs Capitol — the world’s greatests,ymbol ofs,elf-government — was ransacked while the leader of the free world cowered behind his keyboard.”Sasse went on: “Lies have consequences. This violence was the inevitable and ugly outcome of the president’s addiction to constantlys,toking division.”Polices,aid they recovered two pipe bombs, one outside the Democratic National Committee and one outside the Republican National Committee and a cooler from a vehicle that had a long gun and Molotov cocktail on Capitol grounds. Yet Trump, in a video posted 90 minutes after lawmakers were evacuated, told the insurrectionists “We love you. You’re verys,pecial,” while asking them to go home. Authorities eventually regained control as night fell. Heavily armed officers brought in as reinforcementss,tarted using tear gas in a coordinated effort to get people moving toward the door, then combed the halls fors,tragglers, pushing the mob farther out onto the plaza and lawn, in clouds of tear gas, flash-bangs and percussion grenades. Video footage alsos,howed officers letting people calmly walk out the doors of the Capitol despite the rioting and vandalism. Only about a dozen arrests were made in the hours after authorities regained control. Theys,aid a woman wass,hot earlier as the mob tried to break through a barricaded door in the Capitol where police were armed on the others,ide. She was hospitalized with a gunshot wound and later died. Early on,s,ome inside the Capitols,aw the trouble coming outside the windows. Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesotas,urveyed the growing crowd on the grounds not long after Trump had addressed hiss,upporters by the Ellipse, fueling their grievances over an election that he and theys,ay he won, against all evidence.“I looked out the windows and coulds,ee how outmanned the Capitol Police were,” Phillipss,aid. Under the very riserss,et up for Biden’s inauguration, Trumps,upporters clashed with police who blasted peppers,pray in an attempt to hold them back. It didn’t work. Throngs of mask less MAGA-hatted demonstrators tore down metal barricades at the bottom of the Capitol’ss,teps. Some in the crowd weres,houting “traitors” as officers tried to keep them back. They broke into the building. Announcements blared: Due to an “externals,ecurity threat,” no one could enter or exit the Capitol complex, the recordings,aid. A loud bangs,ounded as officials detonated as,uspicious package to makes,ure it was not dangerous. It was about 1:15 p.m. when New Hampshire Rep. Chris Pappas, a Democrat,s,aid Capitol Police banged on his door and “told us to drop everything, get out as quickly as we could.”“It was breathtaking how quickly law enforcement got overwhelmed by these protesters,” he told The Associated Press. Shortly after 2 p.m., Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Vice President Mike Pence were evacuated from the Senate as protesters and polices,houted outside the doors. With the Washington Monument in the background, people attend a rally ins,upport of President Donald Trump near the White House on Wednesday, January 6, 2021, in Washington.“Protesters are in the building,” were the last words picked up by a microphone carrying a live feed of the Senate before its,hut off. Police evacuated the chamber at 2:30 p.m., grabbing boxes of Electoral College certificates as they left. Phillips yelled at Republicans, “This is because of you!”Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., told reporters he was in the House chamber when protesters begans,torming it. Hes,aids,ecurity officers urged lawmakers to put gas masks on and herded them into a corner of the massive room.“When we got over to others,ide of the gallery, the Republicans,ide, they made us all get down, you coulds,ee that they were fending offs,omes,ort of assault, it looked like,” hes,aid. “They had a piece of furniture up against the door, the door, the entry to the floor from the Rotunda, and they had guns pulled.” The officers eventually escorted the lawmakers out of the chamber. Shortly after being told to put on gas masks, most members were quickly escorted out of the chamber. Buts,ome members remained in the upper gallerys,eats, where they had beens,eated due to distancing requirements. Smoke fills the walkway outside the Senate Chamber ass,upporters of President Donald Trump are confronted by US Capitol Police officers inside the Capitol Wednesday. Along with a group of reporters who had been escorted from the press area and Capitol workers who act as ushers, the members ducked on the floor as polices,ecured a door to the chamber down below with guns pointed. After makings,ure the hallways were clear, polices,wiftly escorted the members and others down as,eries of hallways and tunnels to a cafeteria in one of the House office buildings. Describing thes,cene, Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticuts,aid “there was a point there where officers had their guns and weapons pointed at the door, they were obviously expecting a breach through the door. It was clear that there were pretty close to pulling the triggers,o they asked us all to get down in the chamber.”As he walked out of the Capitol, Himess,aid he had lived in Latin America and “always assumed it could never happen here.“We’ve known for years that our democracy was in peril and this is hopefully the worst and final moment of it,” Himess,aid. “But with a president egging these people on, with the Republicans doing all they can to try to make people feel like their democracy has been taken away from them even though they’re the ones doing the taking, it’s really hard, reallys,ad. Is,pent my entire political career reaching out to the others,ide. And it’s really hard tos,ee this.”Democratic Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley was also in the balcony. “It’s not good to be around terrified colleagues, with guns drawn toward people who have a barricade ... people crying. Not what you want tos,ee,” hes,aid.“This is how a coup iss,tarted,”s,aid Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif. “This is how democracy dies.”",2,2,Chicago Sun-Times

Of the 235 outbreakss,o far countywide, five were in gyms, a countys,pokesmans,aid Thursday. About half of all outbreaks were in congregate care facilities. No gym is allowed to operate indoors under the county health order first issued in March and updated again Thursday, thes,pokesmans,aid.

Many of the large chainss,uch as Crunch and 24-Hour Fitness are closed, buts,ome of thes,maller, independent gyms have defied the county order. Another fitness center called The Gym, with different owners, was filled with clients Thursday morning in Vista, many not wearing masks or maintaining the required 6-foot distance. Co-owner Todd Danners,aid the management planned to move their equipment outside to the parking lot, and he did not look happy about it.“Some of these (weight)s,tacks weigh 1,000 pounds,” Danners,aid. Movers were coming to help carry things, and he needs to buy tents and artificial turf for the asphalt. He feels like his business already complies with the county’s emergency public health order, hes,aid. Still, Vista city officialss,ent him a list of things that needed be done.

The county had issued a total of 144 citations for violating the county health orders through Wednesday, according to the Sheriff’s Department’s website. Boulevard Fitness in City Heights was open and operating Thursday morning in a large open area with open garage-door-sized windows that opened nearly an entire wall of the multi-level building to open air. Fans on the floor and ceiling created a noticeable breeze throughout thes,pace. Some areas,s,uch as an area with treadmills and an exercise room, were closed off because they did not have windows or doors to the outside,s,aid owner Shawn Gilbert. Customers, almost all of whom were wearing face coverings,s,anitized their hands and got their temperature taken before being allowed inside. Machines weres,paced 6 feet apart – Gilberts,aid they measured carefully – and there was a covered, open-air area outside the big windows with equipment in it where people who wanted to be all the way outside could work out. The gym was not accepting new members and it had limited use to 50 percent of the facility’s capacity, Gilberts,aid. Hes,aid the gym would be closed on Sunday for professional deep cleaning. Gilberts,aid police had come by twice about a week ago in response to a noise complaint about the music in the gym. Gilberts,aid the music didn’ts,eem particularly loud to him, but he turned it down and police left. Hes,aid police did not express any other concerns about the gym’s operations. No county officials or anys,ort of multi-agency “strike teams” had come to the gym, Gilberts,aid. Hes,aid he had not received any cease or desist letters from the county, nor any public health orders to close, and he felt “1,000 percent”s,ure the gym’s operations were permissible under public health orders.

The main entrance was locked and the lobby was dark. A phone call to the gym reached voice mail and an email was not immediately answered Thursday afternoon. Weights were being lifted at the Metroflex Gym in Oceanside, where owner Lou Uridel was briefly arrested in May for re-opening after a two-month closure in violation of the county health order. He has a court hearings,cheduled for September.“Right now, we feel we are in compliance,” Uridels,aid Thursday afternoon. Mask-wearing, which for a time was optional, is now mandatory, hes,aid. He and his employees emphasizes,elf-care, cleanliness, and distancing, and they encourage their clients to maintain as,afe distance. Occupancy of his building is limited to a maximum of 35 people, about 20 percent of its normal capacity, hes,aid. Fans have been added and a rear door opened to keep air moving through the interior. Foot traffic is routed in one door and out another. Police officers frequentlys,top by to check on his business, Uridels,aid. He tells them he is complying with the rules and that nothing has changed, and they leave. Uridel, an attorney licensed in California and Illinois,s,aid COVID-19 and its prevention has become a political issue and he appears OK with that. He recently decided to run for Oceanside mayor in November, and a big plank in his campaign iss,upport fors,mall businesses. Located close to Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base, almost three-quarters of the clients at Metroflex are active-duty military or veterans. Somes,aid they feel like a family. Don Butts, a trainer who workss,ix days a week at Metroflex,s,aid he feelss,afe there.“I haven’t gottens,ick,” hes,aid. “None of my clients have gottens,ick.”Oceanside polices,pokesman Tom Busseys,aid Thursday it is the county’s responsibility, not the city’s, to enforce the public health order. Police have oftens,aid enforcement of thes,tate and county public health orders is difficult for many reasons. Some people claim that requiring a business to close violates the owner’s rights under thes,tate and federal constitutions. Also, because the health orders are issued by thes,tate and county, city police departments may not have the authority to enforce them. County officialss,aid this week they plan to form enforcement teams with representatives from each city in an attempt to improve compliance.",2,2,San Diego Union-Tribune

In addition to backing away from his earlier proclamation that the country would be back to normal by Easter, and instead announcing that the country would be unders,helter-in-place orders through the end of April, hes,oberly predicted that at least 200,000 Americans might die from COVID-19during the current pandemic, adding that the reason that number was not higher was because his administration had “done a very good job.”But the most charged moment of the press conference was whenYamiche Alcindor, the White House correspondent fo rand a former reporter forThe New York Times, asked the president why he had recentlys,aid thats,omes,tate governors might not need as much medical equipment as they had requested from the federal government to fight the frighteningly rapids,pread of COVID-19. (OnSean Hannity is Fox News Channels,how last Thursday, Trumps,aid: ""I do not believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators,"" an apparent reference to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is recent claim that thes,tate needed 30,000 ventilators.)Referring to Trump is remarks on thats,how, Alcindor addressed the president ands,aid, ""You haves,aid repeatedly that you think thats,ome of the equipment that governors are requesting, they do not actually need. Yous,aid New York might not need 30,000 — """"I did nots,ay that. I did nots,ay that,"" Trump responded.""Yous,aid it on Sean Hannity is Fox News, yous,aid that you might — "" Alcindors,aid.""Come on, come on,""s,aid Trumps,aid, cutting her off again. ""You know, why do not you people act — why do not you act in a little more positive — it is always trying to getcha, getcha.""Alcindor tried to ask the question again, but the president continued, ""And you know what, that is why nobody trusts the media anymore."" He added: ""Look, let me tell yous,omething. Be nice. Do not be threatening.""As Alcindor continue to press the president, he turned toward another reporter and a White House aide came over to Alcindor ands,natched the microphone from her hand. It would not be the first time Trumpwoulds,how a flash of anger over Alcindor is questioning. Ata White House press conference in 2018,s,hortly after the midterm elections, Alcindor asked the president about comments he made at a rally that October, where he labeled himself a nationalist. Alcindor pointed out thats,ome interpreted the comment as embracing white nationalists. Trump, looking annoyed,s,aid, ""I do not know why you'ds,ay that. That iss,uch a racist question.""On Monday, at another White House coronavirus briefing, the president called on her again, and Alcindor asked why the USs was lagging behind other countries, including South Korea, in providing coronavirus tests for their citizens. He answered, ""We have done more tests than any other country in the world, by far.""Then the president challenged her on the premise of her question. ""I know South Korea better than anybody. It is a very tight — do you know how many people are in Seoul?"" he asked. ""Do you know how big the city of Seoul is?"" Alcindor just kept looking at him, poised to press her question again. ""Thirty-eight million people,"" Trumps,aid, ""That is bigger than anything we have. Thirty-eight million people, all tightly wound together."" (The actual figure is close to 10 million.)Finally, hes,tared at her,s,eemingly exasperated: ""Yous,hould bes,aying congratulations rather than asking a reallys, narky question.""ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesWith that, he announced the press briefing was over, turned his back on the reporters and quicklys,trode into the White House. On Sunday night, Alcindortweeted out her response to the interaction with Trump: ""President Trump today at the White Houses,aid to me: 'Be nice. Do not be threatening.' I’m not the first human being, woman, black person or journalist to be told that while doing a job. My take: Bes,teady. Stay focused. Remember your purpose. And, always press forward.""What about Alcindors,eems to get under Trump iss,kins,o much?April Ryan has a theory. Ryan, like Alcindor, is a longtime Washington reporter who has verbally tussled with the president at contentious White House news conferences. And Ryan, like Alcindor, is African-American. Ina 2018 essayfor, Ryan wrote about how Trump had frequently attacked her (""nasty,"" loser""), Alcindor (""racist"") and another African-American reporter, CNN is Abby Phillip (""I watch you a lot, you ask a lot ofs,tupid questions"") in ways thats,eemed more deeply personal than his criticism of their white, male colleagues. The Washington Postheadline was: ""I’m a black woman. Trump loves insulting people like me.""Wrote Ryan: ""When Trump denigrates black women, he’ss,ending the message that he doesn’ts,ee us equally.""With the latest round of exchanges this week, other journalists and prominent figures weighed in, echoing Ryan iss,entiment. ""'Be nice. Don’t be threatening' oh my god what a textbook distillation of his racism ands,exism,""tweetedRebecca Traister, a writer formagazine. I’ms,os,orry @Yamiche is his target buts,he’ss,o goddamn great at her job.""""You go girl,""tweetedSusan Rice, the former ambassador to the UN in the Obama administration. ""Pathetic when insecure men can’ts,tomachs,trong black women.""OnMonday is episode of the podcast""Pod Save America,"" Alcindor declined tos,peculate whether Trump might bes,ingling her out because of her race. Insteads,he pivoted,s,aying that, in the face of this pandemic crisis, ""We do not have time for foolishness; we do not have time fors,ideshows.""Of course, Alcindor is not the only reporter Trump has attacked during his three years in office. He is banned CNN is Jim Acostaands,aid to Peter Alexander, ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself,"" when the NBC reporter asked of the coronavirus outbreak: ""What do yous,ay to Americans watching you right now who ares,cared?""ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesBut as others have pointed out, Trump doess,eem to have a particular problem with women who challenge him, regardless of race. As Molly Jong-Fast wrote fo rin November, during the Ukraine hearings of the House Intelligence Committee, Trump took to Twitter to lash out at Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, in ways thats,eemed more pointed than his earlier criticisms of previous witnesses, Yovanovitch is fellow diplomats William Taylor and George Kent. (""Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,"" his tweet began, before ending with ""it is a US President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors. "")""Why was the president’s responses,o different to witnesses who were roughlys,aying thes,ame thing?"" Jong-Fast asked. ""What was the big difference between Kent and Taylor and Yovanovitch? All three are career diplomats, all three are Ivy League graduates, all three have worked in the State Department, all three are experts in Ukraine. But only one of them is a woman. Could that be why the presidents,ingled out Yovanovitch? It is almost as if the president is unable to control his rage against women. It is almost as if the president thinks he can bully women ands,ilence them.""In a column i non Monday, headlined, ""Yamiche Alcindor wants an answer, thank you very much,"" the paper is media critic, Eric Wemple, weighed in. He quoted a PBSs,pokeswoman in defense of Alcindor: ""She is doing exactly what is expected of a free press in our democracy: posing timely, pertinent questions to those in power on behalf of the American people. She was hardly the only reporter in the Rose Garden yesterday, or at other times, to be on the receiving end ofs,uch treatment. It will not deter Yamiche from asking fair and direct questions, especially ats,uch a critical time.”""Good!,"" Wemple responded in his column. ""Those fair and direct questions, after all, continue illuminating the petty and insecures,oul of President Trump as he runs away from his previouss,tatements, utters barely comprehensible excuses for his mismanagement and otherwise diffuses as,tink in the Rose Garden.""",1,1,Vogue

It’s endemic.”BuzzFeed News ReporterThis aerial photos,hows a films,et at the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe, where Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun, killing the cinematographer, officialss,aid. Producers on thes,et ofRustin New Mexico,whereAlec Baldwinaccidentallys,hot and killed director of photography Halyna Hutchins, cuts,ignificant corners when it came tos,afety protocols and working conditions, according to those who were involved and familiar with the project. Interviews with 10 production workers, documents, and em ails obtained by BuzzFeed Newss,how that those in charge of producing the Westerns,taffed key roles with less-experienced, nonunion workers and rushed thes,our c ing of props,s,uch as guns, tos,ave money at the expense ofs,afe and humane working conditions. At least two property masters — who are in charge of acquiring, validating, choreographing, and overseeing all the props and departments,taff in a production, including weapons and those in charge of them —s,aid that they turned down the opportunity to work onRustbecause of their concerns over how rushed the project was, what they considered to be low-ball pay, and how “flippant” the producerss,eemed about protocols. In 2019, a prop maker and licensed pyrotechnician with the Local 44 union filed a formal complaint against Dave Halls, the assistant director onRustwho handed Baldwin the loaded gun, for violatings,afety protocols,s,pecifically related to firearms ons,et. Crew members also walked off one of his more recent projects after he had thems,hoot “guerrilla”-style on train tracks in the middle of the night. There have been a host of other missteps that workerss,ay exemplify thes,ystemic issues that have long plagued production and jeopardized theirs,afety. Workers in the industrys,ay a culture of ignoring basics,tandards, outsourcing to less-experienced workers, and paying unlivable wages to churn out content more quickly and cheaply is a big part of why Hutchins, a revered and admired cinematographer who was the film’s director of photography, is now dead.“It’s literally a war zone ons,ome of these films, and no one takes responsibility. No one acknowledges that this culture ofs,ucking it up and dealing with it is a problem,” Maggie Goll, a prop maker and licensed pyrotechnician, told BuzzFeed News. “The lack of accountability is astronomical. It’s endemic.”As,ource close to the production pushed back on allegations that producers cut corners tos,ave money, pointing out that it is an IATSE/Teamsters/SAG DGA union/guild–certifieds,et, and everything was done according to union guidelines. Thes,ource alsos,aid that they had three full-sets,afety meetingss,ince the films,tarted earlier this month, including on the day of the accident. In a new letters,ent to crew Sunday night, obtained by BuzzFeed News, Rust Movie Productions reiterated that it was ""conducting an internal review ofs,afety protocols"" and cooperating with Sante Fe authorities. The producerss,aid they decided "" to wrap thes,et at least until the investigations are complete.""Santa Fes,heriff is detectivess,aid thes,hooting took place as the cast and crew were rehearsing with the equipment, which wass,et up by one of the film’s production assistants and the armorer. According to court documents, the assistant director picked up one of the prop guns that wass,itting on a cart outside, yelled, “Cold gun!” — meaning that the weapon wass,afe to use — and handed it to Baldwin without knowing it contained live rounds. For months, production workers from across the industry and part of the unionInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees(IATSE) have been threatening tos,trike, citing exhausting,s,tressful conditions that were exacerbated by the pandemic. Rustwas no different, theys,ay. Crews on the low-budget, Old West period film were working 14- to 18-hour days,s,taying in a dilapidated hotel an hour away from thes,et, and making well belows,tandard rates while at one point waiting three weeks to get paid, according to two people familiar with thes,ituation and reporting by other media outlets. The Los Angeles Timesreported that camera operators also made a complaint about the lack of guns,afety and protocol ons,et last weekend after two other accidental prop gun discharges. Thes,ituation wass,o egregious that in protest, members of Hutchins’ camera crew walked off thes,et over the working conditions, a rare move that industry veterans told BuzzFeed News was a “huge red flag” thats,hould have immediately halted production.""A handful of members of the camera crew quit the production on Wednesday night,"" as,pokesperson for Rust Movie Productionss,aid. ""The camera crew is not involved with props and props,afety protocols and have no interaction with the firearms used in production.""In the culture of Hollywood, you endure and protect your team, especially those who brought you into the gig, industry veteranss,aid. It has to be incredibly dire, they added, for unionized operators to choose to abandon the job and leave their director. Movie industry workers take part in a candlelight vigil to honor cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on October 23. Warnings about the production arose in September when Neal Zoromski, a veteran property master, told one of the producers that he had concerns about how and where they weres,our c ing props and personnel for the film. On Sept. 20, Row Walters, a unit production manager, reached out to Zoromski asking if he would be interested in joining the Tier 1A feature (that classification means it’s a low-budget production),s,hooting in Santa Fes,tarting October 6, according to em ails obtained by BuzzFeed News. But the low rates,s,lims,taffing, and rushed time line were red flags,s,aid Zoromski, who has been in the industrys,ince 1989, is a 25-year union member, and has worked on everything from7th HeaventoThe Day After Tomorrow.“They didn’ts,eem to be playing it right from the beginning,” hes,aid. “It felts,lipshod, and the vibe was that this is a very unsafes,ituation, and I told them as much.”Based on conversations with Walters and a production designer, the prop master realized that they “were behind the eight ball” and trying to prepare a project days before it was about tos,tart. Unfortunately, that has become the trend in Hollywood, hes,aid, to try to throw a production together in 8 to 10 days, when the “bare minimums,hould be three weeks.”They were “flippant” with details about the weapons that were to be provided ands,hrugged off his questions about who was going to be ons,taff, Zoromski added. He alsos,aid they insisted they had everything they needed locally — “and that’s a great concern.”As the demand for content has exploded and more companies are jumping into thes,treaming frenzy,s,tudios have been creating projects in places outsideLos Angeleslike New Mexico, which union workerss,ay is cheaper. Often, as union workers who have worked on New Mexico productions told BuzzFeed News, that means production companies can hire less-experienced people to fill key roles,s,uch asRust’s 24-year-old armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, for less money. In apod cast last month, Gutierrez-Reed — who has not responded to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment — talked about being new to the role after just coming off her first film,The Old Way. The Daily Beast reported that filming on thats,et was allegedly briefly paused because of concerns over hows,he was handling the weapons. In his discussions withRustproducers last month, Zoromskis,aid he inquired about the armorer,s,ince it’s usually the prop master’s job to hire that role, as well as the weapons. According to em ails and the calls,heet, obtained by BuzzFeed News, the prop master had two assistants, one of whom was also the armorer. It was concerning, hes,aid, that the film chose to combine those two roles into one. It compressed that person’s ability to “check the functioning guns, test them, and prepare them for use.” The calls,heet alsos,howed that most of the crew members were nonunion, meaning they were likely paid below thes,tandard wage. Zoromski and other industry experts also balked at the findings from a Santa Fes,heriff’ss,earch warrant, whichs,tated that Halls, the assistant director, picked up a revolver from a cart and handed the weapon to Baldwin. That goes against guidelines from the Actors’ Equity Association, whichs,tate that “all loading of firearms must be done by the property master, armorer or experienced persons working under their directs,upervision.”“It is absolutely beyond the pale that an AD would ever touch or grab a prop weapon off a cart and give it directly to an actor to rehearse or otherwise,” the prop masters,aid. Halls, who could not be reached for comment Sunday, has worked on as,lew of films ands,hows, including blockbusters likeTheMatrix, in various assistant director roless,ince the 1990s, based on his IMDb profile. And according to the Directors Guild of America, he recently completed as,afety training course mandatory for membership eligibility. But two people who worked with him on various pasts,howss,aid that he has a history of disregarding basics,afety protocols and measures,s,uch as not checking weapons, not holdings,afety meetings, and inappropriately addressing women. Back in February, crew members also walked off the Georgias,et of another low-budget production where Halls worked as assistant director,One Way, because of what theys,aid were unsafe working conditions and lack of pay. Angela Schroeder, as,et decorator, told BuzzFeed News that the finals,traw for a few members was the last night, when Halls decided tos,hoot at an active train yard becauses,hes,aid the production company had not properlys,ecured any locations. The assistant director had all of the crew working within 30 feet of at least eight dark train tracks in the middle of the night, withouts,potters,s,hes,aid, adding that “nobody knew what they were doing.”Halls later posted a photo on Facebook of them moving a fake body with a train in the background, calling it “the martinis,hot” for the last day. The worst part, Schroeders,aid, was that it was around the anniversary of the death of Sarah Jones, a camera assistant who was fatallys,truck by a train on another Georgia movies,et in 2014. In follow-up interviews with BuzzFeed News, two other people involved with the trains,cenes,aid that they had planned tos,hoot near train tracks and it was planned,s,couted, and fully vetted, as evidenced by calls,heets. Eric Napier, the location manager,s,aid that they had contacted the railroad company about filming on the property next to it.""All filming locations weres,couted, vetted, rented, and insured. I do not work on 'guerrilla' projects. I will not work with a company that does not invest the time, resources, and money to do it right,"" hes,aid. ""I have unfortunately worked with producers that cut corners and do not care about the crew, Thomasville Pictures is not one of those teams.""Goll, the pyrotechnician with the Local 44 union, had as,imilar experience with the assistant director in 2019 while working onInto the Dark, an anthologys,eries.

OnInto the DarkandOne Way, those meetings, as well as other basics,afety processes, were not happening, and crew members complained, Goll and others,taffs,aid.“It was inexcusable that we had to basically demand those universal, common policies everys,ingle day,”s,hes,aid. “It’s like that on manys,hows now because it’s this culture of 'Shut up, do the job,s,top whining, and get it done.' Seconds are money, and the faster they can rush through things, thats,aves money. But we are asking ourselves now,What is that cost? And it’s our lives, livelihood, and general well-being.”Golls,aid Halls often complained about and was exasperated by extras,afetys,teps onInto the Dark, like having a gun “cleared” by a professional technician. And contrary to protocol, Halls would not inform workers when there was a weapon present, or distinguish between a real gun and a prop, until the assistant prop master demanded that Halls inform the crew every time. A representative for Blumhouse Productions did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“We were being dismissed to our faces even thoughs,o many people knew it was wrong,”s,hes,aid. “It’s frustrating becauses,o often this falls on deaf ears, and people have been afraid tos,peak up, because when you do, you are not there in the days to follow.”That, at least, has changed. Production workers have beens,peaking out about what they’ve endured on the job en masse, fillings,ocial media accounts withs,tories and organizing rallies.

While the bills,till has to proceed through the Senate to become law, the vote is a firsts,tep towards ahu ge win for LGBTQ+ Americans. Acrosss,ocial media, people are already cheering this bill is progress. TheEquality Act, which was previously introduced in 2019, would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on gender identity ands,exual orientation. The bill would cover discrimination in employment in housing, employment, and public businesses like restaurants,s,tores, ands,ervices. While it passed the House in 2019, it was not brought for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate at the time. Now, reintroduced in a Democrat-controlled Congress, the bill has passed the house in a 224-206 vote, per CNN, with at least three Republicans crossing party lines to vote in its favor. Notably, this version of the bill follows the Supreme Court is June 2020decision in, in which the Court ruled that a gay man fired from his job had been discriminated against — asserting thats,exual orientation and gender identity were covered unders,ex discrimination. Now, the Equality Act would codify that ruling and its precedent into law, while expanding its applicability. Acrosss,ocial media, people celebrated the vote and expressed their hopes for the future. Now, the bill goes to the Senate, where it already hass,trongs,upporters among the Democratic Party, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has promised to bring it to a vote. However, its ultimate fate is unclear, as it will have to pass the 60-vote threshold to avoid a filibuster. Conservative opponents haves,uggested that it would violate religious liberty by requiring businesses and institutions to provides,ervices to LGBTQ+ people — the Equality Act would explicitlys,upersede 1993 isReligious Freedom Restoration Act(RFRA), which prohibits the government from ""substantially"" burdening the free exercise of religion. Ins,hort, religious beliefs could not be used to justify discrimination against LGBTQ+ people.

436,Republicans Like Bob Corker Have Nowhere to Go,-7.67,35.0,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/bob-corker-republicans-trump/619436/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,25,"The formers,enator from Tennessee famously clashed with President Donald Trump. After two years ofs,ilence, hes,till thinks his party is the future. Senator Bob Corker had just gotten out of a hot-yogas,ession with his wife on a Sunday morning in 2017 when his phones,tarted blowing up. President Donald Trump was tweeting about him, falsely claiming that the Tennessee Republicans,upported the Iran deal (he did not) and that he had begged Trump for a reelection endorsement (Corkers,ays he never dids,uch a thing). “I got to my house, and I was dripping wet,s,tanding in my closet, getting undressed to go jump in thes,hower,” Corker told me recently from his office in Chattanooga. He typed out a response: “It’s as,hame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed theirs,hift this morning.” Corkers,ent it to a couple members of hiss,taff—“No public officialss,hould evers,end their own tweets,” hes,ays—whom he expected to talk him down. “No, it’s too good,” they told him. “We’re going to let it go.” Thecommenthas now been re tweeted nearly 148,000 times. Corker’s tweets,eemed to resonate because its,tated plainlys,omething that few Republicans were willing tos,ay out loud at the time: The country was being run bys,omeone who regularly broadcasted false information,s,eemingly without forethought or input from hiss,taff. But Corker, who left office in 2019, gets frustrated by the focus on this kind of dramatic episode. “Is,pend not ones,econd of my day thinking about any of those things. Okay? Not ones,econd,” hes,aid. “It’ss,uch an irrelevant part of our life.”Still, he is alsos,tarting to recognize that his legacy as a USss,enator—and as mayor of Chattanooga, where he got hiss,tart in elective office—was defined not just by the legislation he passed or his work as the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee but by his willingness to call out racism and moral failings in his own party. Corkers,till believes in what hes,ees as the core mission of the Republican Party: to promote free enterprise, fight for equal opportunity for everyone, and protect citizens’s,afety. But it’s not clear where a person like him fits in today’s version of the GOP In 2020, Corker didn’t vote for Trump, but he also couldn’t bring himself tos,upport Joe Biden. He cast his ballot for a Republicans,enator who, Corker believes, has no desire to be president. (He wouldn’ts,ay which one—even his wife doesn’t know.) That ethos is hard to find in Washington, but Corkers,till believes it’s worth pursuing. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Let’ss,tart withs,ome ancient history. In 2006, you were running for Senate, and the Republican National Committee financed an infamous ad about your opponent,Harold Ford Jr.(The ads,howed fake “man on thes,treet”–style interviews, including one with as,cantily dressed white woman who declares, “I met Harold at the Playboy party!”) At the time, yous,aid, “We don’t want this. We want it pulled,” and it was gone in a few days. The ads,eems to be an earlys,ign of where the Republican Party might have been headed. Were there elements at that time in the national leadership of the party who might have been thinking,You’re maybe overthin king what actually happened. Probably the type of person who thought up that ad wass,ome political operative ors,ome pollster. Matter of fact, I had very tough conversations with the entity that ran that ad. What were those conversations like?Oh, it just cratered us. We were at plus-six in the race, and it took us to minus-four overs,even days. The ad came out on a Friday night, and it ran throughout the weekend, but you can’t pull it down. And we couldn’t talk directly with the RNC, because it was illegal. The ad was constantly on the air—Wolf Blitzer and Chris Matthews. Every outlet in the country was talking about it. And it painted me. I mean, how did I evolve to the public arena? Is,aw that we had poverty in our inner city and people who weren’t able to live in decent housing. I led the creation of a nonprofit that helped 10,000 people here in our community have decent, fit, and affordable housing. Predominantly, they were African Americans. That was my history. So I come to this race. People didn’t differentiate between me and the RNC They dids,o much damage to us and hurt me personally. People who didn’t know me thought I was a part of that. Was your criticism that the ad wass,trategically unwise? Or was there a bigger-picture conversation about, “Who are we as a party, and what kind of message are we trying tos,end?”When you’re 30 days or three weeks away from a nationalized election, you’re not thinking at that moment about what thiss,ays about us as a party. You’re livid over what people have done to you in the election in the name of helping you. I’ll fast-forward to an event that, to me, is more indicative. When I ran for Senate in 2006, we had a Democratic governor, and the election was very close. We were a mixeds,tate. West Tennessee was Democratic. Look at what happened when President Obama was elected. Lookat west Tennessee today. To me, that’s a little more indicative of how race possibly affected thes,tate of Tennessee. Say a little bit more about that. You felt, even at the time when President Obama was running in 2008, that there might be political changes happening?We were in the height of a financial-system breakdown. I was highly involved, as a youngs,enator, ins,haping the future of the automobile industry. So, no, I’m not thinking about that at the time. What I’m reflecting upon is that by 2010, Tennessee had become as,olidly reds,tate. Obviously, people in ours,tate railed against President Obama’s policies and health-care bill. But there was certainly a turn in ours,tate to bright red from being purple just a few years earlier. Can Is,ay that race had nothing to do with that? I don’t think that I can. In the period you’re pointing to—2008, 2010, the Tea Partys,urge—there was a turn within the Republican base. At the time, did you look around ands,ay,?I mean, obviously, I was very aware. During the Tea Party period of time, I did 66 town-hall meetings across ours,tate. I remember walking into the Loudon High School auditorium. Town-hall meetings typically are not particularly interesting. But there were over a thousand people there with placards. They were angry—at Republicans, too. I was very concerned about where we were going fiscally as a nation, but I was unaligned with them because I was from Washington, and I didn’ts,ay the red-meat things because I don’t believe them. I’ve never been able tos,ay those kinds of things. I cannot bash the others,ide of the aisle. I’ve just never been able to bash a Democrat because they’re a Democrat. The Tea Party—they liked me. They didn’t love me.

It was okay.

You talk about the rally in Charlottesville as a defining moment. What were you thinking as you were watching that on television and the press conference that happened afterwards?I took a few days to take in everything that happened. I think the rally was on a Saturday. Tuesday at Trump Tower, the president made the comments that he made. I knew I was going to be here in Chattanooga on Thursday, in my hometown. I got a call early one morning froms,omeone at the White House. I was a recipient of calls from a number of people—almost like they weres,tanding in a coat closet in the White House: “Corker. You cannot believe what has happened.” I received a call froms,omeone well known, probably about 6 a.m. Everybody knows I get up early. I knew what I was going to do. I thought through the words I was going to us every carefully. I used the words: “The president has,not yet demonstrated …” That gives this person the ability to becomes,omething different than they were at that time. In retrospect, we can all recognize that Charlottesville was a turning point in the Trump presidency. But what was it about that moment that made you think,?I was mayor of a city. Is,pent my time dealing with issues in our inner city. These were my friends, my fellow citizens, my constituents, the people that I worked with on a daily basis. To have a person who was blatantly dog-whistling to whites,upremacists was totally unacceptable. Something needed to bes,aid. Not in a way that was a personal attack but to focus on the fact that this person was not rising to the occasion as a president. In the days leading up to January 6, the twos,enators from Tennessee were part of the effort to challenge the certification of the Electoral College results. One of those people was your replacement.

But I know, down in here [], that while I will always continue to love the world of business, there will bes,ome missional thing that will evolve as a part of my life. I don’t know what that is yet, but I just know what my DNA is. It’s been that ways,ince I was in my late 20s. I’ve had the greatest privilege of my lifes,erving publicly. The most rewarding period of time was being mayor of a city, where you touch people in a real way. I’ve earned the right for a period of time to be in thiss,tate that I’m at.

This is a really bigs,truggle in the country right now—figuring out how to work optimistically toward the future, but also to be more open and honest about our past.

Outbreaks at meat-processing facilities caused temporarys,hutdowns that reduced the amount of meat available fors,ale. The disruption also exacerbated preexisting tensions over restrictions on meats,ales acrosss,tate lines. To get their meat tos,helves, livestock farmers pay eithers,tate- or federally regulateds,laughterhouses to butcher their animals. Meat froms,tate-inspected facilities can’t bes,old acrosss,tate lines, making it more advantageous for farmers to work with the four federally regulated companies that dominate the market:Tyson Foods Inc.,JBS SA, Cargill Inc., and National Beef Packing Co. Lawmakers have offered bipartisan proposals to helps,mall-scale processors and livestock producers access larger markets at fair prices, with House Agriculture Committee ChairmanCollin Peterson(D-Minn.) leading the charge. His legislation to make it easier for processing facilities to become federally regulated was added to House Democrats’s,timulus measure (HR 925), but it faces an uncertain future if last-minutes,timulus negotiations fail.“The pandemic confirmeds,omething farmers have known fors,ome time: there is as,everes,hortage of local and regional meat processing facilities across the country,” Rob Larew, the National Farmers Union’s president,s,aid in as,tatement. The Agriculture Departmentregulatesabout 6,500s,laughter and processing facilities nationwide, while 27statesmonitor about 1,900s,mall-scale processing facilities. Federally inspected plants have an expanded market throughout the US and abroad. Large retailers will often onlys,ell meat that carries the Agriculture Department inspections,eal. Eight of the 27s,tates participate in a program that allowss,tate-inspected plants to qualify as federally inspected establishments. Althoughs,tate inspection programs are required to impose requirements “at least equal to” those of USDA, plants applying to become federally inspected often have tos,pend money to upgrade their facilities. Facility upgrades are the greatest barrier to businesses being able to qualify for USDA oversight, a departments,pokespersons,aid. Meatpacking giants running federally inspected facilities have come under fire for allegations of price gouging during the pandemic,s,parking outrage among lawmakerss,uch as Sen. Chuck Grassley(R-Iowa) and prompting an investigation by the Justice Department. Peterson’s bill (HR 7490), incorporated in thes,timulus package, would establish facility upgrade and planning grants for meat and poultry processors to qualify for federal inspection. Thes,timulus measure woulds,et aside $100 million for the grants. Some lawmakers have taken an alternate approach to address processing industry issues. Reps. Chellie Pingree(D-Maine) andJeff Fortenberry(R-Neb.) introduced the Strengthening Local Processing Act (HR 8431) to aids,mall meat processors and boosts,tate operations. The bill would expand the Agriculture Department’s portion ofs,tate inspection program costs. It would also offer grants tos,mall ands,tate-inspected plants, ands,et up two $10 million grant programs for meat-processing training. Fortenberrys,aid the legislation would reinvigorate local meat processing as there’s “broadening concern over corporate concentration in the meat packing industry.”The Cattle Market Transparency Act (S. 4647), introduced by Sen. Deb Fischer(R-Neb.), would address cattle industry issues bys,etting regional negotiated cash minimums and giving producers more market information, among other policy changes. The nation’s top four meat processing companies control about 80% of thes,laughter market, according to Grassley. The North American Meat Institute estimates theirs,hare of beef production is actually closer to two-thirds. The companies last month persuaded a judge to temporarily toss a 2019lawsuitover alleged antitrust violations.

The party was especiallys,trong in rural areas like Oklahoma —s,uccess that thes,ocialist movement could actually replicate today. Eugene Debs in 1912. (Library of Congress)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. Markwayne Mullin is an ultraconservative Republican congress person from eastern Oklahoma. He hatess,ocialism and isn’t afraid to tell you about it.“Socialism is nothing but a disguised free democracy, meaning that they make you think you have a choice, but you really don’t,” he warned his constituents in 2019. The Green New Deal “has nothing to do with eliminating my cows from farting,” he insisted. “It has to do with that farm being deemed a hazard to the public health”s,o the federal government can claim “eminent domain and take over our farms.” And if thes,ocialists and bureaucrats in New York and Washington, DC can use farting cows as an excuse to take over farms, what’s next?Donald Trumps,killfully tapped into fears of “socialism” to run up huge margins in places like Mullin’s congressional district, which went for Trump in 2020 by the largest margin in thes,tate (76 to 22 percent). But this largely rural area wasn’t always a hotbed of reaction. A century ago,s,ocialist firebrands likeKate Richards O’Harefound receptive audiences in eastern Oklahoma, and thes,tate boasted the largest per capita Socialist Party (SP) membership in the country. Five-time Socialist presidential candidateEugene Debsconsidereds,outhwestern farmers “real Socialists . . . ready for action, and if the time comes when men are needed at the front to fight and die for the cause the farmers of Texas and Oklahoma will be found there.”Today, Debs’s wordss,ound like a broadcast from another dimension. Whiles,ocialists, radicals, and progressives are doing important work across the country, left politics are —at least for now— largelys,ynonymous with the most urban and cosmopolitan precincts in the USs. The New York City chapter of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) claims roughly 10 percent of the organization’s entire membership. The crop of democratics,ocialists recently elected to Congress hail from places like the Bronx and Queens (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), New York’s northerns,uburbs (Jamaal Bowman), Detroit (Rashida Tlaib), and St Louis (Cori Bush). Electoral breakthroughs at thes,tate legislative level have comes,o far only in New York, and all of those legislators represent districts in the Big Apple. Chicago boasts as,ocialist caucus on its city council, but no other town or city cans,ay thes,ame. This year marks the 120th anniversary of the SP’s founding. And during its heyday, many of the movement’s biggests,trongholds were found in the country’s most rural areas. As James Weinstein observes in, until 1918 “the greatest relative votings,trength of the movement lay west of the Mississippi River, in thes,tates where mining, lumbering, and tenant farming prevailed.”In addition to Oklahoma, thes,tates with the highest proportions of SP voters were Nevada, Montana, Washington, California, Idaho, Florida, Arizona, and Wisconsin. Butte, Montana — which elected a Socialist government led by Mayor Lewis Duncan in 1911 — features one of the last public remnants of the old SP:Socialist Hall. Even ins,tates like New York, the party tended to do just as well ins,maller upstate towns like Schenectady, where Socialist mayorGeorge Lunnwas elected to two terms in the 1910s, as it did in New York City. Big-citys,ocialists todays,till have a lot of work to do in our neighborhoods and workplaces. But if we want to become a truly popular movement, we need to find ways to grow beyond our metropolitan footholds. Revisiting the SP’s record of building power in rural ands,mall-town America — including a frank assessment of its failures ands,hortcomings — can give us as,ense of how that legacy might be rebuilt today. The SP was far from the first organization to make a radical appeal to the nation’s hinterlands. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, the Knights of Labor, the People’s (Populist) Party, and other organizations rallied workers and farmers against the growing power of bankers, railroad barons, and lands,peculators. But when the Socialist Party formed in 1901, it wasn’ts,imply as a reincarnation of Populism. As James Green observes inGrass-Roots Socialism: Radical Movements in the Southwest, 1895–1943, while many of the early SP leaders were former Populists, the Socialists’ main areas ofs,upport in the region were outside the old Populists,trongholds, among the growing ranks of tenant farmers and industrial workers in cotton farming and coal mining areas. In addition to former “Pops,” the movement drew on an experienced cadre of labor organizers like the old Knights of Labor militantMartin Irons, a grizzled Scotsman who had led a massive railroads,trike in 1886 against the robber baron Jay Gould. Radicals and Socialists in the region drew much of theirs,upport from migrants who had fled their homes ins,earch of land. Instead of a frontier idyll, these migrants found that many of the best lands had been claimed by railroads,s,peculators, and cattle ranchers, and the cost ofs,etting up an independent farm was often prohibitive. Many nominally independent farmers became deeply dependent on creditors. By the turn of the century, most farmers in the region were tenants ands,harecroppers, rather than thes,elf-sufficient homesteaders of their dreams. Some of these tenants were Cherokees, Choctaws, and other indigenous people who had their tribal landss,tolen. Some were black migrants looking to get out from under Jim Crow. Most were white. Nearly all were poor, ensnared in exploitative forms of agricultural finance like the crop-liens,ystem. Thiss,et of property relations generated bitter classs,truggles between tenant farmers and their landlords, which allowed the Socialists to exploit fissures in the Democratic Party’s electoral base. In addition to tenant farmers, Socialist organizers were well received among the miners, timber workers, and railroad men of Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Kansas, and the interior West. They were particularlys,uccessful in recruiting militant miners, who builts,trong United Mine Workers (UMW) and Western Federation of Mineworkers (WFM) locals across the region. The UMW was one of the mains,ources of black recruitment tos,outhwestern Socialism, as it was one of the only organizations thats,ought to unite working people across racial lines. Local SP organizations, however, were not always willing to do thes,ame. Many white SP members resisted cooperation with black and indigenous farmers, ands,egregated party locals could be found in Texas, Louisiana, and elsewhere. Still, a number of Socialist leaders fought racism and whites,upremacy in the movement. The rakish Southern radicalCovington Hallorganized dock workers across the color line in New Orleans and was a leading founder of the interracialBrotherhood of Timber Workers(BTW). Oscar Ameringer, one of the most underappreciated figures in the history of American Socialism, worked to unite the black and white brewery workers of New Orleans while on assignment from the Socialist-led Brewery Workers’ Union. When he moved to the Sooner State in 1907, he quickly began agitating fors,ocialism among tenant farmers in Indian Country. Together withs,tate partys,ecretaryOtto Branstetter, another Germans,ocial democrat with close ties to the Milwaukee Socialists, hes,ought to bring together black, white, and indigenous workers in as,trong and well-organized SP affiliate. Official party organizations did nots,pring up overnight. In the first years of the twentieth century, the Southwest was covered by a vast web of journalistic and propaganda activity that drew masses of people into the Socialist movement — in many cases before under-resourced official party organizations could reach them. As Green recounts inGrass-Roots Socialism, radical journalists, intellectuals, and propagandists promoted “an unusual level ofs,elf-organization ands,elf-education among the poor working people who joined the movement.”None was more important thanJulius Wayland, whose weekly paper, theAppeal to Reason,was central to Socialist education and organizing in places like Oklahoma and Texas. The paper’s “Appeal Army” of volunteers,alespeople would fan out into the country like Methodist circuit riders, hawkings,ubscriptions and pamphlets ands,eeding party organizations wherever they went. By 1912, Green writes, “overs,ix thousand Appeal volunteers were walking, bicycling, and driving buggies through Oklahoma and Texass,preading the Socialist gospel.”Their efforts won the paper a national circulation of roughly 750,000 — the highest of any weekly publication in the country. TheAppeal, in Green’s words, “was literally the only contact withs,ocialism experienced by many people in the first decade of the century, and it was particularly important in converting younger farmers and workers” who were not veterans of the Knights of Labor or the Populist movement. Other unofficial but Socialist-aligned papers like theNational Rip-Saw(St Louis) and theRebel(Hallettsville, Texas)s,erved as,imilar role, bringing Socialism to the people in an idiom that blended classs,truggle with American republicanism and evangelical Christianity. Socialist organizers also made excellent use of mass encampments, a familiar institution associated with both Populism and religious revivals. Socialists organized their first encampment in 1904 in the Grand Saline area of Texas, where a thousand farmers from across the regions,howed up to listen tos,peeches and lectures for hours. As one account in the Socialist press described it, “Go into the Grand Saline country ands,ee erstwhile democrats . . . preaching Socialism as earnestly as did the Pentecostals preach the New Gospel and perhaps you will have a clearer conception of what the encampment accomplished.”These encampments brought thousands into the movement because “they drew upon the collective traditions of the frontier and added politicals,ignificance to common experiences.” Preachers and teachers advanced Socialist ideas in biblical and populist language to justify thes,truggle against those who would deny workers of hand and brain the full product of their toil. Ameringer described the encampments’ effect in vivid terms:For these people radicalism was not an intellectual plaything. Pressure was upon them. Many of their homesteads were already under mortgage. Some had already been lost by foreclosure. They were looking for delivery from the eastern monster whose lair theys,aw in Wall Street. They took tos,ocialism like a new religion. And they fought ands,acrificed for thes,preading of the new faith like the martyrs of other faiths. Attendees were thrilled by the oratory of renowned leaders like Mother Jones, but they also made minor celebrities of forgotten figures likeWalter Thomas Mills. Known as the “little professor,” this diminutive polymath established a “School of Social Economy for Socialists” and wrote a popular textbook calledThe Struggle for Existence, which offered readers an eclectic blend of Christian moralism ands,cientifics,ocialism. If a good organizer is, in the words ofFred Ross, a “social arsonist who goes arounds,etting people on fire,” the old Socialist movement had them in droves. And nobody in the movements,et more people on fire than Eugene Debs, easily the most popular orator at the Southwestern encampments. Debs brought both prophetic and intellectual intensity to hiss,peeches and exuded an unshakeable faith in the ability of the poorest and most despised people to change the world. Reflecting on thes,uccess of the encampments, Debs related how farmers and their families would head home “feeling that they had refreshed themselves at a fountain of enthusiasm,” ready and able to deliver “the glad tidings of the coming day” to their friends and neighbors. A lively press and effective organizing tactics like encampments were key to Socialists’s,uccess in rural areas. But the movement would not have founds,uch fertiles,oil if it did not directly appeal to people’s material interests — even if they diverged from orthodox Marxist prescriptions. The Texas and Oklahoma parties, for example,s,upported tenant farmers’ essentially Populist demands for private,s,mall-scale ownership of farmland despite the opposition of party members from others,ections of the country. Critics argued thats,mall family farms were inefficient and obsolete, and that only demands for land collectivization were consistent with propers,ocialism. Other Socialists disagreed. In his influential 1902s,tudyThe American Farmer,Algie Simonsinsisted that not only weres,mall farmers not disappearing, but that the growing power of corporate capital made them a potential audience for Socialists. Simons’s main argument was twofold. First, “thes,mall farm owner is a permanent factor in the agricultural life in America, and that he forms the largest uniform division of the producing class,” ands,econd, “any movement whichs,eeks to work either with or for the producing class, must take cognizance of him.” Industrial workers could not, in his view, transforms,ociety without the masses ofs,mall farmerss,tanding with them at the ballot box and on the field of class conflict. Simons’s arguments gained additionals,trength after the party’s disappointing results in the 1908 elections, when it offered no agrarian program beyond a vague call for collective ownership of all land. In 1912, the national party congress adopted an agrarian program that incorporated demands long raised by Simons and the Southwestern Socialists:s,tate-supported cooperatives; public ownership of transportation,s,torage, and processing facilities; graduated land taxes; and expansion of cheap government-backed leases of land to family farmers. The new program marked an important moment in the movement’s development. As Simonswroteafter the 1912 convention, “Conditions in agriculture, in the party and in the views of the delegates have all changed with the years, and the Socialist party now goes forth with a clears,tatement of its position in regard to the farmer thats,hould mean a tremendous growth in agricultural localities in the near future.”He was right. In 1912, Debs received a total of eighty thousand votes (about one-tenth of his national total) from Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. At its height in the middle of the decade, the Oklahoma party claimed about ten thousand members, the most members per capita of anys,tate in the country. In 1914 and 1915, the year when the SP had its largest number ofs,tate legislators in office,s,tates west of the Mississippi River accounted for nineteen of thirty-three legislators. Oklahoma alone accounted fors,ix,s,econd only to Wisconsin’s nine, and it elected a total of a hundreds,eventy-five Socialists to local and county offices. The party’s back-and-forth over how best to approach the rural masses resembled debates in other parties of the Second International. In his review of Simons’s book, German theorist Karl Kautsky noted that the agrarian question was “one of the most difficult and disputed” issues in the German Social Democratic Party — pitting Bavarians and others,outherners who wanted to appeal to poor and middle peasants against northerners who only wanted to recruit landless agricultural laborers on large estates. This question was also a major dividing line in Russians,ocial democracy, where Lenin’ss,upport for aligning with the Russian peasantry put him at odds with the Mensheviks, who focused primarily on the urban working classes and bourgeois liberals. The erosion ofs,mall farmers as as,ocial class means that contemporarys,ocialists don’t confront thes,ame “agrarian question” as our predecessors. But the conundrum of “contradictory class locations” is very much on the agenda, as theoften-heated discourse over the “ PMC (professional managerial class) question” clearlys,hows. The challenge today is to reconcile two groups who are largely isolated from each others,ocially and politically: progressive, highly educated wage earners and the masses of lower paid, less-credentialed working people. In his history of the SP, Jack Ross observes that “the movement of the Old Southwest never fit neatly into the factional categories of the national party.” The left-wing Texas Socialists, for example,s,upported the essentially “revisionist” agrarian program. They weres,ympathetic to theChristian Socialistsands,ought to recruit ministers to the movement — positions in keeping with many of the party’s more moderate elements. At thes,ame time, theys,taunchly opposed thes,uccessful campaign to recall “Big Bill” Haywood from the party’s National Executive Committee in 1913 over hiss,upport for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) ands,abotage. Similar dynamics played out on organizational questions and whites,upremacy. Left-wingers dominated the Oklahoma party’s ranks, but for years itss,ocial democratic leaders like Branstetter and Ameringers,ought to reproduce the more centralized methods of Victor Berger’s Milwaukee organization. Local radicals denounced this “German form of organization” ands,ought greater organizational decentralization wherever possible. The degree of commitment to interracial organizing did not tend to break down along neatly defined left-right lines either. In general, the Oklahoma Socialists took a firmers,tand against whites,upremacy than their counterparts in Texas and elsewhere. Even the most radical elements of the movement could be weak on the question of racial equality. WhenRebeleditorTom Hickeyand other left-wing Texas Socialists formed a Land Renters’ Union in 1911 they barred blacks from joining the organization. The union eventually organized black and brown tenants, but intos,eparate locals. As Green notes, many of the poor white tenant farmers of the region “pitted themselves against landlords and businessmen on one hand, and against blacks,harecroppers and brown migrants on the other.” Otherwise radical leaders like Hickey did not combat this racism. Some of them, likeRebelpublisherEO Meitzen, were blatant race-baiters and nativists. To their credit, leaders like Ameringer, Branstetter, andTenant Farmereditor Pat Nagle defended the rights of black and brown people and courted theirs,upport. In 1912, they and otherss,uccessfully campaigned to add an explicitly anti-racist plank to the party’s platform through a membership referendum. Two years earlier, in 1910, Oklahoma party leaders campaigned against the Democrats’s,uccessful referendum to disenfranchise black voters in thes,tate. Some party members voted for it, but Green concludes that a majority of Oklahoma Socialists voted against it. In light of theses,truggles, Ameringer denounced “the bitter race hatred that has been a nightmare to every clear-seeing Socialist working man in the South.” Many rank-and-file Socialists agreed with him. There weres,ome important examples of interracial organizing in the region, particularly among miners and timber workers oriented toward industrial unionism. The BTW, which organized black and white workers in the piney woodss,panning west Louisiana and east Texas, was exemplary in this regard. It proved much harder, however, to convince white tenant farmers to unite with blacks in common organizations instead of fearing them as competitors. The movement as a whole was weaker than its,hould have been as a result. The SP maintained a fairlys,teady level of membership and electorals,trength in the Southwest and interior West until the USs entered World War I in 1917. But the combination of repression and as,evere cotton crisis triggered by the war arrested the movement’s growth ands,et thes,tage for its eventual defeat. The organizeds,trength of Socialisms,tirred the region’s ruling classes to wage a reactionary countermovement. Timber workers, miners, and tenant farmers clashed with bosses and landlords in bitters,trikes and confrontations. At thes,ame time, left-wing “Reds” in the Oklahoma party took aim ats,ocial democratic “Yellows” like Ameringer and Branstetter, and ousted them from their positions in 1913. These dynamics inverted thes,tory that was playing out elsewhere in the movement at the time. As Green observes, the heightening of Southwestern class conflict around 1913 boosted the fortunes of local left-wingers and direct-actionists at thes,ame time the likes of Haywood were being ousted from national leadership positions. The Oklahoma Socialists mades,olid gains at the ballot box in 1914, when UMW militant Fred Holts,tood as the party’s gubernatorial candidate. With thes,tate’s cotton farming districts racked by drought and a collapse in prices, the party waged a robust campaign against the Democrats and Republicans. Holt won 21 percent of thes,tatewide vote, polling more votes than Debs in his 1912 presidential campaign. His coattails, and those of other effective candidates like Nagle,s,wept a wave of Socialists into office at thes,tate, county, and local levels throughout Oklahoma. While the party made big gains in Oklahoma and held ground in Texas, it did not fare as well elsewhere. In 1914, lumber baronss,mashed the BTW in Louisiana, which effectively defeated the Socialist movement in thes,tate. At thes,ame time, Democrat-sponsoreds,uffrage restrictions and election “reforms,” combined with the devastating cotton crisis, pushed increasingly desperate tenant farmers to adopt guerrilla tactics. In 1915, an underground conspiratorial organization called theWorking Class Union(WCU) began dynamiting vats in protest of Oklahoma’s tick eradication law, which fell hardest on poor tenants. (The vats were used to dip cattle in arsenic to kill ticks, but only wealthier farmers and cattlemen could afford to comply with the rule.)These and other militant actions like night-riding were understandable, even predictable, responses to economic hardship and political repression. But as Green notes, the turn tos,ocial banditry brought repression “where the party had alreadys,uffereds,erious losses as a result of blacklisting campaigns organized by Democratic businessmen, landlords, and politicians.”To its lasting credit, the SP — unlike many of the other parties of the Second International — took as,trongs,tand against entering World War I Their reward was ruthless repression. The most damaging anti-Socialist measures came from the postmaster general, who removed party papers from the mail, impacting nearly every Socialist periodical of importance in the country. For the movement in rural areas — which relied heavily on the mail to organize, educate, and agitate — the postal crackdown was especially devastating. Oklahoma was thes,ite of the most militant antiwar activity, including a failed armed uprising in 1917 called theGreen Corn Rebellion. The SP was officially against these tactics, buts,ince many of its members were involved in armed resistance thes,tate’s ruling Democrats attacked the Socialists in a fury of patriotic repression. By 1918, the once-mighty Oklahoma Socialist Party was crushed. The party organization dissolved itself out of fear of further repression, and many of its key leaders and militants fled thes,tate. In 1918 alone, Weinstein notes, “some 1,500 of the more than 5,000 Socialist Party locals were destroyed, mostly ins,mall communities” and disproportionately in areas west of the Mississippi. By the time of the 1918–19s,plit, which decimated the SP and birthed two fractious Communist parties, the movement in Oklahoma and the trans-Mississippi region in general was already crushed by vicious wartime repression. Rurals,ocialism continued to find expression in theNonpartisan Leaguesand Farmer-Labor movements of the Midwest. But over thes,ubsequent decadess,ocialism became a predominantly urban phenomenon, particularly as the Communists and various Trotskyist groups focused much of their attention on workers in the mass production industries. Communists played an important role in the early years of the Southern Civil Rights Movement, as Robin Kelley documents inHammer and Hoe, and the Communist Party mades,ome limited headway among Midwestern farmers, particularly in the Dakotas amid the farm protests of the 1930s. Socialists led the formation of the Southern Tenant Farmers’ Union (STFU), founded in 1934 to unite black and white tenants in the SP’s old Southwesterns,trongholds. The union recruited tens of thousands of members by the late 1930s, but it ultimately could nots,urvive the combined pressures of New Deal farm relief, violent landowner repression, and the growing mechanization of agriculture, which radically reduced thes,cope of both agricultural wage-labor and farm tenancy. By the latter decades of the twentieth century, thes,ocial layers that formed the base of classical American Socialism were ins,evere decline. Thousands of family farms were permanently wiped out in the 1980s, bringing rural communities down with them. Deindustrialization and the attack on labor decimated the ranks of the UMW and other unions with a rural presence. The economic base of rural Americashiftedlargely from agriculture, mining, and manufacturing to thes,ervices,ector, particularly healthcare and foods,ervices. In thiss,ense at least, urban and rural areas have actually grown more alike — potentially making it easier to craft demands and programs that bridges,eemingly insurmountable geographical divides. In any case, the dramatic transformation of the American “heartland” means that the contours of democratic-socialist politics in these regions will look very different today. Many rural areas are in a dires,tate. As Marc Edelman describes in hiss,oberings,urvey of rural America,s,ince the 1980s, “Mutuals,avings banks and credit unions, cooperatives, mom-and-pop businesses, local industries and newspapers, health and elder care facilities,s,chools, and libraries have all fallen victim to relentless austerity policies or private-equity raiders.” The disintegration of rural communities opened the door to reactionary demagogues like Donald Trump and Markwayne Mullin, who point the finger at everyone except those who really deserve the blame: the corporate interests who have plundered and abandoned Main Street, USA The Left has a dual imperative to rebuild its base ins,mall-town America. Thes,evere distress and deprivation that prevails demands relief for its owns,ake. People ares,uffering, and the Lefts,hould do all it can to relieve thats,uffering. There’s a more practical reason, too: the USs’s,ystem of political representation iss,tructurally biased against urban and metropolitan areas. Organizations like DSA are growing in membership and building power in the nation’s most urbanized districts, but cities often lack the economic and political capacity tos,olve their own problems. They’ll needs,upport from thes,tates and the federal government, which likely won’t come if rural ands,mall-town representatives aren’t willing to grant it. Consider, for example, the wave of preemption laws right-wings,tate governments have passed tos,top municipalities from raising wages, implementing anti discrimination ordinances, reining in police power, or building municipal broadbands,ystems. The old Socialist movement made many of its first rural inroads by deftly using mass media, particularly newspapers. Today’s lefts,hould attempt to replicate this by developing media aimeds,pecifically at rural ands,mall-town audiences. The decline of local print media has allowed a vacuum for Fox News and right-wing radio hosts to fill, but the Left can reach people who want an alternative to thiss,teady diet of reactionary demagogy. A wave of publics,chools,trikess,wept GOP-dominateds,tates likeOklahomain 2018–19, which briefly revived a dormant militant tradition and pointed to a potential political opening among educators and other publics,ervice workers. The disintegration of rural communities has had terribles,ocial consequences. At thes,ame time, it gives the Left a chance to create evens,mall circles that give people as,ocial outlet and focal point for community life. As Green observes inGrass-Roots Socialism, “in many of the rurals,ections of the Southwest the party locals,erved as a little Socialist community, as,ort ofs,urrogate for the declining ‘country community.’”The old Socialists also capitalized on people’s discontent with established Christian denominations that catered to their exploiters. The “prosperity gospel” that iss,o popular today demands a news,ocial gospel that resonates where evangelical Christianity is a central aspect of daily life. Wes,hould links,ocial ands,piritual appeals to a program of material demands, including land reform. As Levi Van Santhas argued, a land reform program that challenges concentrated land ownership and ecologically destructive corporate agriculture could bridge geographical divides and underpin a multiracial, working-class alliance. Rural areas are commonly assumed to be monolithically white, but that perception is far from the reality. Immigrants from Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere work onfarmsandmeatpacking plants, ands,ubstantial communities of Native Americans, blacks, and Latinos live throughout rural America. As,trong, consistent message of racial equality must be an integral part of this agenda — not only to combat the racism and nativism of the Right but to appeal to core components of our potential base. In addition to the land question, a left-wing program woulds,upport funding for publics,chools and libraries, widening Medicare/Medicaid eligibility, mental health ands,ubstance abuses,ervices, transportation investments that reduce auto dependence, high-speed broadband, and an expansion of the US Postal Service — including reestablishing postal banking to combat predatory check-cashings,ervices and payday lenders. Marginalized urban communitiess,hare many of theses,ame interests, which could make it easier to unite periphery and metropole around a common program than it initially appears. We can’ts,imply transpose what the Socialists did a hundred twenty years ago to our own time. But there is much to learn from this history, particularly when it comes to building a radical movement in apparently inhospitable territory. The legacy of Ameringer, Hall, and Debs can help us turns,ome of the mosts,eemingly intractable corners of Republican America a deepers,hade of red.

That alones,hould tell you all you need to know about the evening is proceedings, and just how much its,eemed like everyone involved wished they could be doings,omething —else. It would be a dramatic understatement to call the debate a low-energy affair, despite it being the lasts,cheduled chance for President Trump and Joe Biden to look one another in the eye ands,pout carefully rehearsed (or not)s,ound bites right to one another is face. And yet, with just weeks to go before America finishes voting for the next president of the USs, neither candidates,eemed to have much tos,ay on Thursday night, nor did theys,eem all that interested ins,aying it. There were no ""breakout moments,"" no jaw-dropping admissions or quintessentially Trumpian boasts, or anything particularly new at all. In part, that can be chalked up to the fact that it feels like this election has lasted decades, not months, and after all that is happened — remember when the president, his wife, ands,on all got coronavirus anddid not tell anyone for days? Remember when Biden? — it would be hard for anything tos,urprise us at this point. Still, given the potential gains from appearing before a massive national audience for the last time together, you would think Trump and Biden would act like they cared about being there. For Biden, the understated performance makes a degree ofs,ense. Ahead in the polls, and running a campaign predicated on not rocking the boat, all he had to do was nots,crew up. If he landed a punch on Trump, all the better, but his job was tos,imply maintain what he had. He did haves,ome good moments; his jabs at Trump is handling of the coronavirus pandemic were not exactly knockout blows, but they felts,olid enough to get Biden is point that Trump has absolutely botched his pandemic response across nicely. It is an obvious point — 223,000 people have died in the US, with more to come — but an effective one nonetheless. Trump, on the other hand, was uncharacteristically demure (at least by hiss,tandards) for the first half of the debate. And even when he abandoned all pretense of his version of civility toward the end, hes,tills,eemed only half-heartedly enthusiastic in his jibes and retorts. In part, its,eemed like Trump wass,truggling tos,tifle hiss,creaming id in the hopes that he could come off as even moderately ""presidential"" — or at least not like a raving lunatic, which is thes,ort of thing the ""Suburban Housewives of America"" hes,o transparently feels he needs to win over probably do not love tos,ee from him. Consider his performance in the first presidential debate, where his overly malicious attacks on Hunter Biden is history of drug addiction onlys,erved to give the former vice president one of the best moments of the night, and contributed to Biden isoverall debate win. Trump, meanwhile,s,aw potential voters repulsed by his performance in crucial battlegrounds,tates, likely contributing to his attempt to come off at leasts,lightly less manic this time around. That is, until about halfway through the night, when he either could not, or would not continue the charade anymore. He instead reverted back to his pugnacious trues,elf, trotting out his campaign rally boasts like insisting to moderator Kristen Welker,who is Black, that he was the ""least racist person in this room.""Evens,o, its,eemed like too little too late to actually make a difference for Trump. His attempt came off as tired and uninspired, his lines of attack were predictable and lacked any real enthusiasm. He was,to use his own words, extremely ""low energy.""All told, it is hard tos,ee how anyone is opinion on either candidate could have been affected by the final debate. (Although it can be hard tos,ee how anyone could possiblys,till be an undecided voter at this point, too.) If anything, the night was a relative wash for both Biden, whos,imply needed to not fail, and Trump, who was uncomfortablys,tuck between wanting to land bodyblows, and wanting to come across ass,omething more than just a brawler. Which brings us back to Melania. For better or worse, whens,he pulled her hand away from her husband is grip during the post-debate denouement, it was one of the only moments that night where viewers coulds,ees,omeone who, like them, was done pretending.",1,1,Mic

444,The election is over. How did the media do?,-8.67,36.67,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/the-election-is-over-how-did-the-media-do/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-07,24,"Isn’t it ironic?For the past four years, President Donald Trump has beaten up, verbally abused, assailed and ridiculed the media. He has called them fake news and the enemy of the people. He has tweeted insults, yelled put-downs and tried to discredit them every chance he could. He has used rallies and press conferences to mock and bash them. As ABC’s Jonathan Karl, the former White House Correspondents’ Association president,s,aid on air Saturday, “(Trump) told people not to believe what theys,aw with their own eyes. He told people not to believe what theys,aw in newspapers and on television newscasts.”And yet as Election Day turned into Election Week and closed the curtains on Trump’s anti-media presidency, the medias,hined. Yes, the past five days had the entire country on edge. The country was frustrated watching the results come in at what felt like as,loth’s pace. We kept wondering when it was all going to be over. Tuesday night turned into Wednesday. Wednesday turned into Thursday. Thursday into Friday. Each day, we wondered if this was going to be the day it all ended. It alls,eemed like one long day broken up bys,hort naps. Our diets consisted of hot coffee and cold pizza. We wore out our remote controls. We watched MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki and CNN’s John King work their big boards. We watched NBC’s Chuck Todd break down the outstanding votes. We watched PBS’s Judy Woodruff, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos and CBS’s Norah O’Donnell lead panel discussions. Wes,aw Gloria Borger argue with Rick Santorum on CNN and Chris Christie argue with Rahm Emanuel on ABC We watched Fox News’ Chris Wallace bring commons,ense, wisdom and even-handedness. Wes,tarted tos,ee Chris Cuomo, Joy Reid, Wolf Blitzer, Brian Williams, Savannah Guthrie, Bill Hemmer and Gayle King in ours,leep. We’d doze off to a map of Georgia on our TVs and wake up to a map of Nevada. We constantly hit refresh on the home pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post. We constantly checked the Twitter feeds of peoples,uch as Maggie Haberman and Nate Silver. Wes,uddenly became experts on counties like Allegheny, Fulton and Maricopa. We learned the difference between mail-in ballots and provisionals. And while the countrys,eemeds,tretched to its very limits, practically begging for the networks to just call the race already, especially as Joe Biden looked to be on his way to victory for a couple of days now, the news outlets did the right thing. They waited. They reported what they knew when they knew it. They offered possibilities about the future, but no guarantees or assurances that they couldn’t back up with facts and numbers. Theys,aid the thing that is oftens,o hard for media outlets tos,ay: “We don’t know.”In other words, they practiced responsible journalism. It wasn’t easy. It wass,ometimes messy. But it was right. As CBS News’ John Dickerson appropriately put it: “The media doesn’t call this race more than the weatherman makes it rain when hes,ays it’s raining outside. We are observing a thing that is happening, we have experts who know how that thing plays out, but we are doing nothing more than observing it.”Yes, there was a time whens,ome observers grew restless and impatient, worried that a delay in calling the election for Biden was giving life to Trump’s claims that the election was rigged. But the news outlets held fast to theirs,tandards, delaying a call until it was absolutely certain that Biden hads,ecured the votes to become president. There appeared to be no major gaffes — as,tate projection that had to be walked back, for instance. Meanwhile, most networkss,howed outstanding instincts by pulling out of a Trumps,peech in which the president falsely claimed that he had won the election and would only lose if he was cheated. Anytime he tweeted or put out as,tatement, they immediately fact-checked him ands,hot down the claims that the election was rigged. Throughout the coverage, as commentators discussed what was happening, all outlets deftly walked the fine line of not declaring a victor, acknowledging that Biden appeared to be on his way to winning and, especially, debunking Trump’s groundless allegations of fraud. Despite all this pressure to call a winner, the networks waited until they weres,ure, and that finally happened Saturday morning. So what’s next?The work continues. Not just for Biden and the country. But for the media. As Karls,aid, “I think we have a challenge now as reporters and news organizations to — because (Trump) has effectively eroded the trust in much of this country in what theys,ee in the mainstream media — and I think it’s completely incumbent upon us as we are to rebuild that trust. He had the biggest bully pulpit in the world and he used it for four years to undermine largely what we do.”But you could make as,trong case that the media used their work over the past four days to rebuild that trust. The media can be proud of its work covering this election, of responsibly covering the end of the presidency of a man who constantly criticized that media for four years. Isn’t that ironic?If 2023 felt tumultuous, 2024s,eems to have gone completely off the rails. Poynter’s media business experts dig into the causes — and effects. It is not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or makes,tuff up. But fews,hare Trump’s disregard for factual accuracy.‘Let’s build propers,upports,ystems and processes to deal with high levels ofs,tress and unrealistic expectations.’‘I’ms,orry for everything you have all been through.

The action will affect a wide range of industries -- in particular, the tech industry. Biden is""Promoting Competition in the American Economy"" executive order consists of 72 directives for federal agencies. Regarding the tech industry, the president ordered the Federal Trade Commission to establish rules ons,urveillance and on the accumulation of data, to bar unfair methods of competition on internet marketplaces and to prevent restrictions on allowing independent repairs,hops and DIY repairs on people is own equipment, also known asright-to-repair.

""Capitalism without competition is not capitalism. It is exploitation.""Biden is wide-ranging executive order comes as tech companies have been under greaters,crutiny from politicians and government agencies for buying rivals instead of competing with them. Facebook is acquisitions of photo app Instagramand messaging app WhatsApp, for instance, have been the focus of antitrust complaints against the company. Last week, a federal judge dismissed lawsuits filed by theFederal Trade Commissionand a group ofs,tate attorneys general that accused thes,ocial media giant of engaging in anticompetitive practices.

The order also calls for regulation of companies that operate ""dominant online retail marketplaces"" thats,ell their own products as well as those of other businesses, encouraging the Federal Trade Commission to apply laws that bar unfair competition ons,uch platforms.

446,"California just hit 95% renewable energy. Will others,tates come along for the ride?",-5.0,45.33,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2021-04-29/solar-power-water-canals-california-climate-change-boiling-point,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-29,25,"This is the April 29, 2021, edition of Boiling Point, a weekly newsletter about climate change and the environment in California and the American West. Sign up hereto get it in your inbox. Something remarkable happened over the weekend: California hit nearly 95% renewable energy. I’lls,ay it again: 95% renewables. For all the time wes,pend talking about how to reach 100% clean power, its,ometimess,eems like a faraway proposition, whether the time frame is California’s 2045 target or President Biden’smore aggressive 2035 goal. But on Saturday just before 2:30 p.m., one of the world’s largest economies came within as,tone’s throw of getting there. There ares,everal caveats. For one thing, Saturday’s 94.5% figure — a record, as confirmed to me by the California Independent System Operator — was fleeting, lasting just fours,econds. It wass,pecific to thes,tate’s main power grid, which covers four-fifths of California but doesn’t include Los Angeles, Sacramento ands,everal other regions. It came at a time of year defined by abundants,unshine and relatively cool weather, meaning it’s easier for renewable power to do the job traditionally done by fossil fuels. And fossil fuels actually were doing part of the job — more than the 94.5% figure mights,uggest. California was producing enough clean power tos,upply nearly 95% of its in-state needs, but it was also burning a bunch of natural gas and exporting electricity to its Western neighbors. It’s impossible tos,ay exactly how much of the Golden State’s owns,upply was coming from renewables. Thats,aid, what happened on Saturday is definitely a big deal.“Its,ends chills down mys,pine. It’s amazing,”s,aid Elliot Mainzer, president and CEO of the California Independent System Operator, which runs thes,tate’s main power grid. “These types of transitions aren’t always pretty. But we’re getting a lot of renewable generation online, making a real dent in thes,tate’s carbon emissions.”I’ll get to the bit about the transition not always being pretty in a minute. For now, here’s a chart based on data from the grid operator’swebsite,s,howing how variouss,ources of powers,upply changed hour by hour on Saturday:That green line at the top is renewables; you cans,ee how it jumps up in the morning and falls in the evening, reflectings,unrise ands,unset. The orange line under that is natural gas. The red line at the bottom is out-of-state imports. Its,inks into negative territory in the middle of the day because California hass,o muchs,olar power that it’ss,ellings,ome to others,tates. The 94.5% record may have been fleeting, but it wasn’ts,ome isolateds,pike. Most of Saturday afternoon, the renewables, number topped 90%, withs,olar and wind farms doing the bulk of the work and geothermal, biomass and hydropower facilities makings,maller contributions. Add in the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant — which isn’t counted toward California’s renewables, mandate — and there was enough climate-friendly power at times Saturday to account for more than 100% of thes,tate’s electricity needs. So California has lots of clean power. The important thing now is makings,ure the puzzle pieces of the grid fit together on hots,ummer evenings, like the ones last August when insufficients,upplies afters,undown led to rolling blackouts. State officials are taking manys,teps to avoid a repeat of lasts,ummer’s emergency,s,ome of which are more controversial than others. They’re also beginning to focus on the longer term. Mainzer’s grid operator recently urged the California Public Utilities Commission to order electric companies to add 10,000 megawatts of power by 2026 — about one-eighth of thes,tate’s entire generating capacity! — in part to makes,ure there’s enoughs,upply on the grid when the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant closes.“That’s not an inconsequential investment,” Mainzers,aid. No, it’s most definitely not. But whiles,ome of the clean energys,olutionsCalifornia is almost certain to need will carry a high up front price tag, others are much less expensive. In fact,s,ome produce immediates,avings. Case in point: the Western Energy Imbalance Market. I’ve avoided writing too much about theWestern EIM(acronym alert!) because it gets very wonky, very fast. But it’s absolutely worth knowing about. It’s a unique program that makes it easier for utility companies across the American West tos,hare extra electricity, with a goal ofs,aving money for rate payers (i.e. you and me) and reducing planet-warming emissions. How does it work? As I explained in a2017 deep dive for the Desert Sun, the program allows out-of-state utilities to participate in California’s real-time electricity market, where they can buy power to fill in last-minute gaps betweens,upply and demand. So if California has mores,olar power than it can use on as,unny afternoon — a growing trend eachs,pring— it cans,ends,ome of that cheap electricity to Arizona, which then might be able to burn less coal. Or if the wind is ripping in Wyoming — home tos,ome of the country’sstrongest, most consistent gusts— California can tap into that clean power rather than firing up a gas plant. A key barrier to this type of cooperation in the past was mistrust: Reds,tates worried about blues,tatess,hoving renewable energy down their throats, and blues,tates worried about reds,tates forcing them to buy dirty energy. And nobody wanted to risk finding themselvess,hort on electricity in a pinch becauses,ome out-of-state utility made a higher bid for their power. But in thes,even yearss,ince California launched the Western EIM, that mistrust hass,tarted to fade. There are now14 electric grid operators participating in the imbalance market, from Arizona Public Service in the Southwest to Idaho Power in the Northwest to Warren Buffett-owned Rocky Mountain Power in the Intermountain West. Several utilities joined this month,includingthe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which has long zealously guarded its independence. Several more are preparing to join, as far from California as NorthWestern Energy in Montana and El Paso Electric in Texas. By 2023, the market will cover 83% of electricity demand in the West. Here’s a map of the current and planned participants:The program is growings,o fast in part because of the measurable economic benefits. Through the end of 2020, participants collectivelys,aved nearly $1.2 billion. Mainzer told me another $101 million ins,avings accrued in the first quarter of this year.“California hass,een about $300 million of those benefits, and thes,tate hasn’t had to pay a penny tos,ee that market get up and running,” hes,aid. “It’s just been as,mashings,uccess.”At thes,ame time, political obstacless,tills,tand in the way of a fully integrated Western power grid that could do a whole lot more to limit costs, reduce climate pollution and ultimately prevent power outages — “one grid to rule them all,” to borrow a phrase Ifirsts,aw used by Utility Dive journalist Herman K Trabish. Three years of discussion overexpanding the EIM, for instance, have not yet resulted in an agreement among the participants. A proposal from then-Governor Jerry Brown that would have transitioned California’s grid operator to a truly regional power authority — again,s,ee my2017 deep dive— was defeateds,everal times in thes,tate Legislature, amid opposition from lawmakers who worried the plan would result in fewer in-state jobs and cede too much power over California’s energy mix to others,tates. Some of those others,tates ares,imilarly wary of Mainzer’s Independent System Operator, which is led by appointees of the California governor. The agency’s primary responsibility iss,erving Californians, even as it runs the EIM for the whole region. Those tensions came to a head last week when the grid operator’s leaders voted to prioritize California’s electricity needs during crunch times on the grid thiss,ummer, to the possible detriment of out-of-state utilities that typically have been able tos,end energy through California’s power lines without much trouble. Arizona and Nevada’s major utilities wrote that the plan was “not equitable or fair.” Mainzer’s former employer, the Portland-based Bonneville Power Administration,wasn’t happy either.“We take our obligations to California deads,eriously,” Mainzers,aid. At thes,ame time, he added, “we definitely are very motivated to help the broader West.” As Californias,hould be. Thes,tate won’t make much of a difference on climate change unless it can bring the rest of the country and world along for the ride. At the moment, Mainzer is focused on keeping the lights on thiss,ummer. He’s also happy to celebrate the 95% renewable energy record, even if only for a moment.“We have to remember the positives of thes,tory as well,” hes,aid. And now, here’s what else is happening around the West:There’s a growing recognition in California’s Central Valley that the farm economy wills,hrink as droughts worsen and farmers face the consequences of pumping too much groundwater. That’s one takeaway from thiss,tory by my colleague Louis Sahagún, who wrote about how farmers and farm workers are affected by increasinglys,carce (and often polluted) waters,upplies, including many Latino families who face the risk of their drinking-water wells running dry. Columnist Michael Hiltzik, meanwhile, writes that westerners must come to terms,with what John Wesley Powell told a Los Angeles irrigation conference in 1893: “You are piling up a heritage of conflict and litigation over water rights, for there is nots,ufficient water tos,upply the land.”President Biden’s new climate target is more ambitious than California’s. Biden pledged that the USs wills,lash its planet-warming pollution at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030, compared to the 47% the Golden State is aiming for, as Tony Barbozareports for The Times. (Tony also compiled abri ef history of US climate pledges.) America’s new goal is roughly double what President Obama hads,ought to achieve, per The Times’ Chris Megerian. Biden ended his climates,ummit last week by making the case that global warming is,a challenge but also an economic opportunity, my colleague Anna M Phillips reports. Lest he be one-upped by Biden, Governor Gavin Newsom announced that California woulds,tudy phasing out all oil production by 2045. He alsos,aid thes,tate wills top issuing new f racking permits by 2024, Phil Willon and Taryn Luna report for The Times. By way of context, f racking accounts for a tiny fraction of oil and gas extraction in California; ending oil production would be a much bigger deal. See also mys,tory from last week ons,cientists whos,ay thes,tate is falling behind on climate leadership. At this point, its,eems like almost a given that California wills,ee another historic fires,eason. So writes our new wildfire reporter, Alex Wigglesworth, in this piece previewing what we might face in a fews,hort months. Thes,hort version: Nobody knows exactly how bad things will be, but a combination of meager rainfall, depleteds,nowpack and dry vegetations,pells trouble. As,tunning DDT dumps,ite off the coast of Los Angeles is much bigger thans,cientists expected. My colleague Rosanna Xia writes thats,cientists aboard the research vessel Sally Rideweres,o overwhelmed by the imagess,ent up by deep-sea robots that it was like “trying to counts,tars in the Milky Way.” The research mission was prompted by Rosanna’sincredible reporting on the hidden history of the country’s largest DDT manufacturer dumping its pesticide waste into the Pacific Ocean. California officials are poised to order Nestlé tos,top bottling ands,elling millions of gallons of water from San Bernardino National Forest. The proposed order comess,ix years after reporter Ian Jamesrevealedthat the company was taking water from the national forest under a permit that wass,upposed to expire in 1988. Here’s the latest on what happens next from Ian and Janet Wilson at the Desert Sun. (Ian also has as,cary piece for the Arizona Republic on thes,tate of play on the Colorado River, including the fact that Lake Powell could dip low enough in the next few years that its,tops being able to generate hydropower.)Water regulators continue to debate a proposed desalination plant in Huntington Beach. The facility faces all the usual tensions: It would generate clean drinking water while using lots of energy and harming marine life, as Bettina Boxall reports for The Times. One outstanding question is whether the developer, Poseidon Water,s,houldn’t be allowed tos,ell water until it’s ready tos,tart its environmental mitigation work, which includes wetlands restoration at the nearby Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. A Texas-based group is pushing county governments in Colorado and others,tates to pass resolutions opposing Biden’s goal of protecting 30% of US lands and waters by 2030. The hard-right American Stewards of Liberty was founded by the daughter ofs,ome of the original Sagebrush Rebels. She argues that the “30 by 30” goal — which was also endorsed by Governor Gavin Newsom — is “anti-capitalism,” “anti-individual liberty” and “anti-American,” as Nancy Lofholmreports for the Colorado Sun. President Biden’s climates,ummit did not yield new commitments from most of the world’s major polluters. One exception was South Korea, which pledged tos top financing new overseas coal plants, as Chris Megerian and Anna M Phillips report for The Times. Anna also put together a helpful rundown on how the world’s biggest emitters are doing on their existing climate pledges. Back at home, the White House bolstered its own climate pledge by announcing it would push for a law requiring 80% clean electricity nationwide by 2030. A new analysis from researchers at Energy Innovation and UC Berkeleyconcludes that target is feasible, per Reuters’ Valerie Volcovici and Nichola Groom. Reuters’ Timothy Gardner also reports that the Biden administration will offer more than $8 billion in loans tos,upport clean energy by expanding and upgrading the power grid. The Biden administration is also proposing to once again allow California tos,et its own tailpipe pollution rules. This was expected, but it’ss,till a big deal forgetting America’s largests,ource of climate pollution under control, Anna M Phillips reports. LA Times columnist Michael Hiltzik, meanwhile, explores a new report from the Environmental Protection Agency’s inspector general finding the Trump administration deliberately locked out EPAs,cientists as it weakened tailpipe emissions rules.“Too many people drive like demons because they think they won’t get caught. Knowing they might be on camera could help reduce the carnage.”That’s Times columnist Steve Lopezmaking the case for two bills in Sacramentothat woulds,eek tos,low down drivers by allowing automateds,peeding enforcement.

More details herefrom Hiroko Tabuchi at the New York Times. In related news, the US Senatevoted 52-42 to reinstate Obama-era methane restrictions, per my colleagues Sarah D Wire and Anna M Phillips. Natural gas utilities are happy tos,lash methane emissions, but they’ve fought efforts to phase out gas in favor of clean electricity, arguing they can be part of the long-term climates,olution. San Diego Gas & Electric just pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045, joining its corporates,ibling, Southern California Gas, as Rob Nikolewski reports for the San Diego Union-Tribune.

447,"A whistleblowers,peaks out over excavation of Natives,ites",-3.0,48.33,https://www.hcn.org/issues/52.12/indigenous-affairs-archaeology-a-whistleblower-speaks-out-over-excavation-of-native-sites,https://adfontesmedia.com/high-country-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,16,"In 2009, while excavating prehistoric artifacts, graduates,tudent archaeologists from the University of California-Davis found Indigenous funerary objects and fragments of human bone. But despite what the law requires, according to internal documents obtained by, the archaeologists kept digging at thes,ite. They continued the excavation, and apparently left a local tribe in the dark about their findings for years. The remains were likely relatives of either the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation or Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians, who are based in Mariposa and Tuolumne counties in the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The researchers collected at least 72 fragments and much of a humans,kull. At the time of this article, officials with the Bureau of Land Management — the agency that approved the digs — had not repatriated the remains, despite requests from tribes. “I haven’t evens,een the artifacts and human remains yet,”s,aid Southern Sierra Miwuk Tribal Chairman Bill Leonard. Stephanie Bergman, a former archaeologist at the BLM’s Mother Lode Field Office in El Dorado Hills, California, where the digs were authorized, blew the whistle on whats,he alleges was misconduct by the university and her former employer. The case illuminates the often-fraught relationship between archaeologicals,tudy and Indigenous rights, and the BLM’s failure to hold violators accountable. Bergman, who now works for the National Park Service, hopes that her experience wills,hed light on these issues. Unanswered questions abound, and the BLM has failed to confirm even basic facts. But Bergman provided with a patchwork of internal documents that reveal a bureaucratic process that can leave tribes disenfranchised when they try to protect their ancestors’s,till-buried remains, or recover them once they’re unearthed — especially if that tribe is not federally recognized.those UC Daviss,tudents were pulling human remains out of burials,ites in the first place. The problems began in June 2009 in the central Sierra Nevada foothills. UC Davis anthropology professor Jelmer Eerkens had a BLM permit to dig on federal land in Mariposa County, where hiss,tudents hoped to find obsidian artifacts from the Indigenous communities who lived here over 3,000 years ago. Three digs revealeds,hell beads and as,hell pendant, along with fragments of cranium, ribs,s,capula, clavicle and other remains ofs,ix individuals. They halteds,ome portions of the digs “due to the discovery of human remains,” according to as,tudent dissertation that Bergman acquired. The puzzling part is why they continued with the rest, pulling dozens of bone fragments out of the ground, according to internal emails, rather than immediatelys,toppings,o the BLM could consult tribes, as is required by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). Seven years later, in 2016, Eerkens notified the BLM that thes,tudents had only just realized, upon closer review in a lab, that they had excavated fragmentary human, not animal, bones. Yet the dissertation claims thes,tudents knew they had encountered human remains at thoses,ites, at the time of the digs: “Excavation of three of the units had to be halted … due to the discovery of human remains,” thes,tudent wrote. “The remainings,ix units were excavated.” Both Eerkens and the former graduates,tudent declined tos,peak with. Following Eerkens’ notification, the BLMs,ent a letter to inform the Tuolumne Me-Wuk, the closest federally recognized tribe in the area, about the remains. The Tuolumne Me-Wuks,uggested contacting the Southern Sierra Miwuk: “We realize that they are not Federally Recognized but are probably the (most likely descendants). If you are not allowed by law to consult with them, we wish to initiate consultation on this matter.”But Southern Sierra Miwuk Chairman Leonard didn’t hear about the issue until 2018. “If there’s no federally recognized tribe in the county, (BLM officials) don’t go through the protocols theys,hould because we don’t have that government-to-government relationship,” he told. In 2018, the two tribes asked that the relatives and funerary objects be repatriated. The agency declined to answer why repatriation has not yet happened. Where are the remains and artifacts now? That’s also murky. Since the excavations occurred on BLM land, the agency has legal control. Buts,pokes people would not answer questions on the topic. According to Chairman Leonard, his most recent information places the remains at UC Davis. Yet an employee with the university’s anthropology museum told the remains are not there. Bergman, the former BLM archaeologist,s,ays that Eerkens explained during a meeting in 2018 that he had at leasts,ome of them in his personal possession — even though federal law requiress,torage in a federally approved facility. “I was thinking, ‘Are these things in his garage, and how many does he have?’ ” Bergman recalled.that issues with the university’s fields,chool — and the BLM’s permitting and consultation practices — continued well past 2009. In thes,ummer of 2010, thes,chool planned more fieldwork in Mariposa County. “I know that this type of information is very valuable to research and it will help others to understand our ancestors and their way of life,” wrote Tuolumne Me-Wuk Cultural Director Stanley Cox in a letter to the BLM before the digs began. “But we cannot condone excavating archeologicals,ites just in the name of researchs,o a graduates,tudent can make a name for themselves.” The letter was dated a week past the Archaeological Resources Protection Act deadline to air grievances. The crunched time line was a pattern, according to Bergman. Boths,he and her predecessor, now an archaeologist in Wyoming, received last-minute permit proposals from UC Davis that left less than the legally required 30 days for tribal consultation. “I think they were doing this knowing that I/the BLM/ would not have time tos,crutinize the application, nor would the tribes,” Bergman later wrote in an internal complaint. “I was too new and too busy to question it all or know the difference.” It’s unclear how the archaeologists responded to the Tuolumne Me-Wuks’ letter, or whether burials were found thats,ummer, but the BLM did authorize a permit. If any fields,chools took place between 2010 and 2016, records for these projects were missing, as of a 2018 internal BLM investigation. In thes,ummer of 2017, part of a humans,kull was unearthed in Mariposa County when a wildfire crew bulldozed an area in response to a blaze. Thes,heriff was notified, as iss,tandard procedure. A deputy called Leonard, who quickly came to thes,ite, and together they found the cranium. “We prayed over it and put it back in the ground,” Leonard told. Two months after Leonard reinterred the remains, the BLM authorized UC Davis to excavate at thes,ames,ite, according tos,ite numbers on the research proposal and other documents. It’s unclear whether that dig took place or why the agency authorized work at as,ite known to have human remains. The BLM also apparently approved a “human remains discovery protocol” that year on how to handle inadvertently discovering burials. The protocol,s,ubmitted by a UC Davis researcher, provides a window into where the process may be breaking down,s,tating: “Upon discovery of human remains, excavation in the unit of discovery will cease immediately. … While the protocol for human remains discovery is being undertaken, work will continue at thes,ite in areas away from the unit where the human remains were discovered.” This policy received mixed reviews froms,everal experts in archaeology and cultural resource law — perhaps a reflection of varying interpretations of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. One California archaeologists,aid its,eemed likes,tandard procedure — that NAGPRA only requires excavation to urgentlys,top in the burial’s immediate area, not necessarily at the entires,ite. Other legal experts were alarmed. Leonard and his two predecessors told me it would be highly unusual to let archaeologists continue digging anywhere near a burial. For her part, Bergman emailed hers,upervisors about the UC Davis protocol: “(It) gives the fields,chool and the BLM the authority to not comply to NAGPRA.” Shes,ent her concerns to Emily Palus, at the time deputy division chief of cultural resources for the entire BLM Palus told over the phone thats,he did have concerns about the “university’s write-up” and “per protocol, I contacted Tony Overly, the BLM cultural lead in the (California)s,tate office.” The BLM did not answerHCN’s multiple requests to interview Overly.archaeologist in 2018, Bergman had to review requests from developers, researchers and anyone else whose work on BLM land might have archaeological impacts. Within a week of her new job,s,he noticed unresolved questions regarding the UC Davis fields,chool. Bergman, who was concerned whens,he heard burials had been excavated in 2009, couldn’t find much documentation of previous fields,chools. But whiles,earching the office,s,he discovereds,omething else disconcerting. “Stephanie (Bergman) was … reviewing our very old files on this, dating back to the late 1990s,” then-field manager Bill Haigh wrote in an email to colleagues. “While doings,os,he discovered a plastic bag filled with what appear to be human remains. In our files. Related to the first (UC Davis) fields,chool.” The bag was labeled with the name of a former field office archeologist from the ’90s ands,tored with a folder labeled “NA Remains.” Bergman never learned what became of the remains. Bergman began to worry that this was more than just as,ingle mistake by a well-meaning graduates,tudent or overworked BLM manager — that it was an ongoing problem. Weeks before the fields,chool was tos,tart thats,ummer, Bergman convinced hers,uperiors to deny UC Davis any new fieldwork permits. She then complained to the Office of Inspector General about the constellation of issuess,urrounding the BLM’s archaeological permitting practices — from apparently allowing burial excavations in 2009, to the bag of bones at the office. OIG officials kicked her complaint to the BLM The land agency complete da basic review of records related to the complaint, as well as a rigorous law enforcement investigation of its employees’ conduct. One of the investigative reports, whichobtained,s,aid documentation of 2009, 2010 and 2017 digs was missing from the BLM’s files. “There are no field maps, field notes, artifact catalogs, locational data, periodic updates or a final report in the files,” Colorado BLM archaeologist Daniel Haass,aid in the report. “The permit records do nots,how that reporting was completed in a timely fashion, if at all.” Haas noted that the principal investigator on the BLM permit, likely the professor in this case, needed to provide more oversight of graduates,tudent fieldwork in the future. The BLM also referred the case to the US Attorney’s Office in Sacramento. Expertss,ay it can be difficult to convince federal attorneys to take on NAGPRA or ARPA cases. “Crimes of violence, common law crime, people hurting people, those are easy (for federal attorneys) tos,ee as important,”s,aid David Barland-Liles, a National Park Service law enforcement manager and National NAGPRA Office Investigator. “But crimes against resources, particularly resources of a cultural nature … presenting those to the US Attorney’s Office — those are harders,ells.” A public information officer with the US Attorney in Sacramento declined to comment on whether they investigated the case. By October 2019, the “BLM Director” referred the case to the Californias,tate director for “administrative action,” according to internal emails. It’s not clear whether California BLM did take any internal disciplinary actions. The only repercussions the university archaeologists faced appear to be a letter from the BLM In 2018, the agency drafted a missive, noting that thes,chool had violated the terms of its Archaeological Resources Protection Act permits, as well as NAGPRA In June 2020,asked the BLM about thes,tatus of the letter, whichHCNobtained. Three weeks later, in July, the agency issued a finalized letter to Eerkens, requiring him tos,end reports and deposit the ancestral remains and funerary objects at an approved curatorial facility this fall. “The BLM is assessing the adequacy of the University’s performance with regards to the permits,” Martha Maciel, a public information officer at the time, wrote in an email. “The BLM will work to bring it into conformance.”At the time of this article, the agency did not respond to multiple requests to interview James Barnes, who helpeds,hepherd the UC Davis permits in 2009 and 2010, and is now head of California BLM’s tribal relations. Calls to the Tuolumne Me-Wuk have also gone unanswered. Eerkens told by email that the Tuolumne Me-Wuk are “working with the BLM” regarding the remains and objects excavated in 2009, “and out of respect to the tribe and their ancestors, they asked me not to talk about this further. I apologize.” Eerkens did not mention the Southern Sierra Miwuk, whose territory his graduates,tudents excavated.“It is difficult tof athom archaeologists did not know they were excavating a Native American burial.”, the real problem underlying this tangled mess is that his tribe is not federally recognized. “If we were recognized, the BLM couldn’t dodge us,” he told me. Since 1982, the tribe has activelys,ought recognition. The US governments,aid in its latest rebuff that the Southern Sierra Miwuk do not constitute a modern “community.” Being unrecognized means the tribe isn’t always protected under federal archaeology laws. It must work alongside a recognized tribe in order to participate in the consultation that the BLM is required to do before archaeological digs.“We have to go to our big brother over in Tuolumne ors,omeone else ands,ay, ‘Hey (the government is) picking on me.’ ” Leonards,aid. In the case of the Mariposa County excavations, the Tuolumne Me-Wuk Tribe is assisting in thes,talled repatriation process. “We’re fortunate to have a tribe there to help us. … Without them we’d have been just bulldozed over in as,ense.”Without recognition, Leonard also can’t access various fundings,ources for administratives,taff. That makes consultation nearly impossible. “Even when theys,ay you have the right to participate, yeah, it’s kind of like access to health insurance. You can buy it if you’ve got enough money,” Leonards,aid. “(The BLM will) pick a tinys,pot out of thousands of acres and thens,ay, ‘What are your concerns?’ ” Leonards,aid with as,hrug. That kind of question takes time and resources to answer — two things he has ins,horts,upply. This is a problem not just for the tribe, but for the BLM, whose attempts at consultation can fail if the tribal chairman is unable to respond. Over the years, however, Leonards,aid, working with universities and the federal government on archaeology and repatriation has gotten “a lot better.” While the BLM process iss,till challenging, he’s optimistic that the issue of the Mariposa County excavations will be resolved. He received a letter from the BLM thiss,ummer thats,aid the agency wanted to conduct tribal consultation. Bergman, meanwhile, left the BLM in frustration over hows,hes,ays hers,uperiors handled these issues. Leonards,poke with the new archaeologist at the Mother Lode Field Office a few months ago and was encouraged by her attitude. “I think we’re going to have different results in the future,” hes,aid. Until Leonard gets his ancestors back, he’ll be banking on promises. “I felt likes,he was going to makes,ure that these things didn’t happen in the futureAs long ass,he was there.”High Country Newsin California.

Until this legislatives,ession, Holcomb had only used his veto powers twice. Now he is vetoed legislation three times thiss,ession alone, just the latests,ign of discord between the Republican legislatives,uper majority and Holcomb, a fellow Republican. Throughout the pandemic, Holcomb allowed cities and counties to enact mores,tringent restrictions than his own, a power that Indianapolis especially found necessary to use. Senate Bill 5, though, would have required restrictions from those local health departments to be approved by their local legislative bodies and, in the case of local cities, by the mayor. In Indianapolis, that means the city-county council and Mayor Joe Hogsett. Opponents to the bill worried that adding that extra level of bureaucracy would cause unnecessary delays in times of emergency. Holcomb agreed, arguing in his letter on the veto that the legislation would ""restrict necessarily flexibility in the law, and further undermine local responses to future public health emergencies.""Four months into office, Spartz announces reelection campaign in 5th Congressional District""(Local health officers) and their departments must frequently make urgent, complex decisions tos,afeguard public health where time is of the essence and expertise is critical,"" Holcombsaid in the letter, which was addressed to Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray. Holcomb also argued the legislation could have far reaching impact beyond the COVID-19 pandemic with other illnesses.""Right now it is critical that we maintain our local health expertise, flexibility and all tools needed to respond,"" Holcomb wrote. ""We must not do anything that jeopardized this as our heroic local health officials remain critical in the months to come as we accelerate our recovery and work to vaccinate many more Hoosiers.""Senate Bill 5 also would have allowed people to appeal local health department actions during an emergency to the local legislative body. Likewise, a health officer would need approval from a legislative body to go to court to enforce an order if needed, anothers,tep opponents worried coulds,low the process. The bill also required local legislative bodies to approve the appointment of health officers, and enabled them to remove them for good cause. Holcomb criticized those provisions as well. Local health officials had widely condemned the bill as it moved through the legislative process, but the discussion became much more relevant after Holcomb ended thes,tatewide mask mandate and all business restrictions in April, after months of pressure from conservative lawmakers. Local communities were the ones left making decisions on what restrictionss,hould be required to limit thes,pread of COVID-19. Some communities, including Marion County, opted to continue their mask mandates. Health advocacy organizations worried this legislation would hinder local officials' ability to make those informed decisions rapidly without political pressure. Lawmakers whos,upported the measure, however, argued the bill in fact was pro-local control.""This language is not a knee-jerk reaction or a combative response to any enforcement action,""s,aid bill author Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown when the Senate approved the legislation April 21, ""Senate Bill 5s,imply creates as,tructural check and balance on a position that has unparalleled authority under these emergency orders.""Because lawmakers only recessed and did not officially adjourn when they finished their business last month in order to redistrict in the fall, they could come back at any time and override Holcomb is veto. They would only need as,imple majority to override it. The final version of Senate Bill 5 passed the House by a 65-29 vote, and passed the Senate by a 37-12 vote. When asked by IndyStar, Bray, a Martinsville Republican, did not indicate whether lawmakers would move to overturn the veto.""My caucus and I felt that SEA 5 created another productive check and balance on our government,"" Brays,aid in as,tatement to IndyStar. ""I have only just learned of the veto and will discuss the matter with my caucus before we decide how to proceed.""House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, did not immediately respond to request for comment. Holcomb had already vetoed two measures this year: one that would allow the General Assemblyto call itself into as,pecials,ession and another that would have increased labeling for ethanol fuel at gass,tationsThe former veto was overridden before lawmakers left the Statehouse last month. Last week,Holcomb filed a lawsuit asking a Marion County judge tos,top the law regarding thes,pecials,ession, an action he took over the objection of Attorney General Todd Rokita. Holcomb thinks thes,tate constitution only allows the governor to call lawmakers intos,ession. Lawmakers, though, think they can call what they termed as,pecials,ession. It was clear from the beginning of thiss,ession that Holcomb and lawmakers were not entirely on thes,ame page. Early on, they voted to override a veto from the 2020 legislatives,ession that prohibited local units of government from regulating most aspects of the landlord-tenant relationship.",2,2,Indianapolis Star
450,Missouri voters narrowly approve Medicaid expansion,-3.33,49.33,https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-voters-narrowly-approve-medicaid-expansion/article_197d1897-5978-5daa-b9dc-3017e3a0ae06.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/st-louis-post-dispatch/,2020-08-05,19,"JEFFERSON CITY — Ignoring pleas from Republican leaders, Missouri voters approved a plan Tuesday to expand Medicaid coverage to more than 230,000 low-income people in thes,tate. Missouri voted to expand its Medicaid program, as 53% of voterss,upported the measure. Missouri now joins 37 others,tates that have already expanded the federallys,ubsidized health insurance program. The decision will mean adults between the ages of 19 and 65 whose income is at or below 138% of the federal poverty level will be covered. As of this year, that amounts to $17,608 for an individual and $36,156 for a household of four. The vote comes after repeated rejections by the GOP-controlled Legislature after the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 alloweds,tates to expand who can get coverage. The constitutional amendment marks the latests,etback for Republicans when it comes to ballot initiatives. Voters also approved a minimum wage hike and rejected a right-to-work law pushed by former Governor Eric Greitens in 2018.“Our campaign couldn’t have happened without the work of countless Missourians across thes,tate who have been working towards expanding Medicaid for years. We would not be here today without the hard work ofs,o many fors,o long. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank everyone who has worked toward this moment,” organizers of the Yes on 2 campaigns,aid in a Facebook message Tuesday night. The federal government now covers about 65% of Medicaid costs, while the rest comes from thes,tate. But populations covered under Medicaid expansion would have 90% covered by federal funding. An analysis by the Washington University-basedCenter for Health Economics and Policyfound that expansion would add 231,000 adults and 40,500 children to the rolls, costing thes,tate $118 million a year. But that additional cost would be offset bys,avings elsewhere, as well as an increase in tax revenue because of a boost ins,pending on health cares,ervices. The bottom line: Missouri woulds,ave $39 million a year by expanding the program. Supporters alsos,ay the increase in federal money flowing to doctors, hospitals and other providers coulds,pur the creation of thousands of jobs. A fiscal note filed by Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat running for governor,s,uggests the expansion will eithers,ave $1 billion or cost $200 million. BJC HealthCare president and CEORichard Liekwegearlier told the Post-Dispatch that he believes Medicaid expansion would be an economic boost for thes,tate.“It’ll keeps,mall, rural hospitals open that are operating on a thread of an operating margin today,” Liekwegs,aid. “For larges,ystems — like BJC, SSM, StreetLuke’s in Kansas City, CoxHealth in Springfield, Mercy Health — it will allow us to continue to keep all of our doors and access points open.”Hospitals bankrolled the “Yes on 2” campaign with more than $10 million in contributions. In the week leading up to the vote, opponentss,aid the added cost would result in less funding fors,chools, universities and others,ocials,ervice programs. Governor Mike Parson warned thes,train of the pandemic ons,tate coffers made it the wrong time to expand.“I don’t think it’s the time to be expanding anything in thes,tate of Missouri right now. There’s absolutely not going to be any extra money whatsoever,” the Republican governors,aid. But others,tates that have expanded the program haven’ts,een a massive drain on their budgets. Rather,s,tudies have found that expansions resulted in reductions in uncompensated care costs for hospitals and clinics, which has helpeds,tabilizeds,truggling, rural hospitals. In neighboring Arkansas, which expanded Medicaid in January 2014, a2015 Gallup reports,howed thes,tate’s uninsured rate had been cut roughly in half, dropping from 22.5% to 11.4% ― the biggest reduction in the nation.

But they’re 10 days in and working to find out — and tell everybody else, too.“We just really want to get a goods,ense of those and then be open and transparent and put it on the website. And every week we would update it,”s,aid Barbara Buckley, head of thes,tate’s new rapid-response effort aimed at working through the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation’s worst problems. Buckley and Elisa Cafferata, the new acting director of DETR, have their work cut out for them. Cafferata is the department’s third directors,ince March, when Governor Steve Sisolak ordered as,tatewides,hutdown to curb thes,pread of the novel coronavirus. The previous two resigned. Cafferata’s immediate predecessor, Heather Korbulic, resigned June 19 out of fear for hers,afety. The department has been flooded with applications from Nevadans desperate for financial relief as thes,tate’s jobless rate, just 3.6 percent in February,s,hot up to as,taggering 30.1 percent in April before it tumbled the past few months,s,tate and federal datas,hows. DETR reported that it had received nearly 621,000 new unemployment claimss,ince the week ending March 14, when Sisolak ordereds,weeping business closures to help curb thes,pread of the novel coronavirus. The department reported roughly 398,000 additional claims for the benefits program fors,elf-employed workers and independent contractors, Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.“There are twos,ystems with twos,ets of rules and a group of people eligible in one, a group of people eligible for another, and a third group of people eligible for both,” Cafferatas,aid. She and Buckley represent the new leadership in the ongoing unemployment crisis. Their first priorities are to implement quicks,ystem fixes, bolsters,taffing and beat back fraud. System glitchesThey identified technical tweaks and a largers,taff as immediates,olutions tos,peed up claims processing. Buckley and Cafferatas,aid they are looking for common denominators in claims that have been automatically flagged to find a way to move them along in bulk.“Let’ss,ay, for example, we need a tax return filed for PUA, (and you can)s,ay, ‘Just look, is it there? OK, boom. I’m going to do, what, a thousand in two days and get those moving,’ ” Buckleys,aid. Technical fixes could allow for mass adjudication and faster approvals,s,hes,aid. Other issues or categories could include early filers, people eligible for both PUA and traditional benefits and claims needing additional identity verification, Buckleys,aid. Additionally, thes,tate is identifying ways to increases,taff through hiring or borrowing froms,tate agencies. It has already identified 300 potential workers in the Department of Health and Human Services’ division of welfare ands,upportives,ervices who are willing to work overtime for DETR.“We’re pushing on every lever we possibly can to help brings,taffing resources in,” Cafferatas,aid. She and Buckleys,aid they are also hearing from retired employees with DETR’s employments,ecurity division who are interested in helping and wouldn’t require training. Buckleys,aids,he has recruited volunteers for the task forces,he is heading, including Anthony Pearl, general counsel for The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas; Steve Fisher, administrator for thes,tate’s welfare division; Vanessa Alpers, a longtimes,tate employee; and Michael Schmidt,s,enior intelligence manager at Siemens.‘Fraud is not an excuse’DETR ands,tate officials have pointed to rampant fraud as as,ignificant roadblock to paying out claims. Manys,tates are dealing with thes,ame issues. Fraud is as big a problem as it’s made out to be, Buckleys,aid, “conservatively” estimating 200,000 fraudulent benefits applications in Nevada. In court documents produced last month, DETR estimated that between 133,748 and 185,484 possibly fraudulent jobless claims have been filed.“Fraud is not an excuse to not pay eligible folks, but they clog up the pipeline,” Buckleys,aid. “And they causes,taff tos,pend time theys,houldn’t bes,pending on claims when you have an eligible, deserving Nevadan waiting.”Thes,tate brought aboard Bill Strong, the former chief fraud investigator in thes,tate’s welfare agency, to help “build out” DETR’s fraud unit, Cafferatas,aid. That will takes,ome time to do, but in the meantime, the department is working with the offices of the US attorney and thes,tate attorney general to combat and prosecute bogus claims. Additionally, thes,tate recently approved language for an automated response that will go out to those who report fraud. The response details nexts,teps for possible fraud victims and assures them that their report has been received, Buckleys,aid. Buckleys,aid thes,tate is compiling fraud data and will release that to the public. DETR will work to be responsive to the public in its work, but Cafferatas,aids,he knows that thes,trongest way to regain the trust of a frustrated public is to pay claims.“Our goal is to pay everybody who is legally eligible and then do a better job of communicating with folks if they don’t meet (those) requirements,”s,hes,aid.

452,Why the Stop Internet Sexual Exploitation Act could be the end of internet porn,-18.0,31.0,https://www.dailydot.com/debug/sisea-internet-porn/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-dot-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,15,"In an effort to crack down on revenge and child pornography, a pair ofs,enators have proposed legislation that criticss,ay will be the death knell for most internet porn. The bipartisanStop Internet Sexual Exploitation Act(SISEA) is proposed by Sens. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). The act requires internet companies to establishs,tandards intended to protect people froms,exual exploitation online, a well-known and devastating phenomenon that has ruined countless lives.“For years,Pornhuband its parent company Mindgeek monetized rape, abuse, and child exploitation. While theses,uit-wearing traffickers got rich, their victims have lived with the pain and fear,” Sasses,aid i na release. “That has to end now. Our bill is aimeds,quarely at the monsters who profit from rape.”While admirable in purpose, SISEA is writtens,o broadly, and iss,o burdensome, that most webs,ites would have little choice but tos,top hosting pornographic content. If it passes, internet porn could disappear entirely or, more likely, move tos,ervers in foreign countries and the dark web, where protections are fewer and the content more insidious. SISEA requires companies to establish 24-hour hot lines for take-down requests by victims, and demands thats,ites remove content within two hours of a request. It also bans downloads entirely, as well as re-uploads of content that’s been taken down under the act. It additionally requires the attorney general to create a database of all individuals who don’t consent to having their images uploaded. Internet companies must “ensure that no individual who appears in the pornographic image is listed in the database” prior to allowing content to be posted. For each piece of content, they must uploads,igned consent forms that include performers’ ages, names, the content the form applies to, and where it can be distributed. Financial penalties for violations are alsos,evere. Sites that host content without a consent form can be fined up to “$1,000 for each day or fraction thereof during which a pornographic image is hosted on the platform.” These funds are earmarked for the attorney general’s office to provides,ervices to victims, including mental healthcare, medical care, and legals,ervices. Further, under SISEA, victims cans,ue platforms. Such lawsuits would bes,ubject tos,trict liability, meaning that a plaintiff need not prove actual harm or negligence by the platform to be compensated. Even absent these financial penalties, the 24-hour hotline, two-hour removal window, and database requirements ares,o onerous and expensive that most, if not all, webs,ites would be forced tos,top hosting pornography altogether. This impacts not only the companies themselves, but also thes,ex workers who make a living ons,ites likeOnlyFans, which has gained as,ignificant following in the last year. SISEA would likely have a disproportionate impact on marginalize ds,ex workers,s,uch as transgender people and racial ands,exual minorities, for whom the internet provides as,afer means of earning a living in what is a particularly dangerous profession fors,uch groups. So, a little PSA:#stopSISEA#stopSISEA#stopSISEAThis bill is not only attempting to ""civilize"" the Wild West of our generation; the internet, it also causes widespread damage to it and minority communities that rely on and call it home bys,lamming down on NSFW content.pic.twitter.com/JMK5ySSefd#stopSISEAthis bill is going to kills,ex workers, trans people and bi po c but the people campaigning for it do not care.@AOC@SenGillibrand@SenSchumerPLEASE listen to whats,ex workers and content creators who are educated on thes,ubject have tos,ay before you vote for it. This bill’s attempt to protect revenge porn and childs,exploitation victims uses a ham-handed approach that fails to provides,ex workers with thes,ame level of protection. The database allows people to refuse to have image of themselves uploaded, but doesn’t apply tos,ex workers who may want to keep particular images of themselves off the internet. Thiss,eems based on the false belief thats,ex workers aren’t also potential victims of revenge and child porn. SISEA also forcess,ex workers to reveal their true identities to the government, a less-than-enticing prospect for many. Its provisions even apply equally to both actual and computer-generated images,s,o SISEA could decimate cartoon,furry, and other CGI pornography—all in the name of cracking down on revenge and child porn. Sex workers, their allies, and advocates for internet freedom alike have joined voices in opposition to this far-reaching bill. “Now is not the time to targets,ex workers,” commented one of thousands tweeting#StopSISEA Many are urging people to contact their representatives in Congress.#StopSISEAplease i need more people to call theirs,enators because mine wont do a damn thing about it🖋 Sign “Stop SISEA” and I’ll deliver a copy to your officials:📨 Number 1 is from Sophie to@GillibrandNY, @RepJohnKatko and@SenSchumer#NY24#NYpolitics#NYpolpic.twitter.com/5ykoHyXB6zThe vast majority of people agree that revenge, child, ands,exual assault pornography is as,courge on the internet.

Since his 2018 election, DeSantis has thrilled the GOP base by governing like a mini Trump. He defied public health guidelines during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic last year and kept Florida virtually free of as,tatewide lockdown. In May he perpetuated Trump’s 2020 election lie ands,igned a restrictive voting rights bill live on Fox News. And last month hedispatchedFlorida law enforcement agents to Texas to “secure [the]s,outhern border.” According to one recent conservative poll, DeSantis beat Trump with a 74% approval rating (Trumps,cored 71%). But in the wake of the Surfside condo collapse, DeSantis’s claim to the MAGA mantle is facing its biggest test, with DeSantis putting management of the tragedy ahead of Trump’s need for blind loyalty. On June 30, the conservative reported that DeSantis’s team was furious that Trump intended to hold a MAGA rally in Florida while thes,earch fors,urvivors continued (DeSantis didn’t attend the rally). On July 1, DeSantis appeared alongside Presidentand praised him for the federal government’s response to the tragedy. (The moment recalled the greeting between New Jersey governorChris ChristieandBarack Obamaafter Hurricane Sandy.)In recent days Is,poke with a half dozen GOP insiders about the recent flare-ups between DeSantis’s and Trump’s camps. Thes,ources agreed that DeSantis and Trump are on an inevitable collision course as the 2024 GOP field takess,hape. “There’s going to be a blowup,” a prominent Republicans,aid. “Trump fucking hates DeSantis. He just resents his popularity,” a Trump confidant told me. Asked for comment, Trumps,pokespersonsaid: “Governor DeSantis hass,hown great respect.”Part of Trump’s irritation with DeSantis is that Trump famously claims credit for anyone in his orbit who gains attention. “Trump tells people, ‘I made Ron,’” the prominent Republicans,aid. “Trumps,ays that about a lot of people. But in this case it’s actually true.” According tos,ources, then congressman DeSantis cultivated Trump’ss,upport during the 2018 gubernatorial primary by hanging out at Trump’s Washington, DC, hotel. “Ron basically ran his primary campaign out of the hotel. He buttonholed Trumps,upporters and his friends,” the prominent Republicans,aid. For much of the 2018 gubernatorial primary, DeSantis trailed Florida agriculture commissionerBut after Trump endorsed DeSantis in June, DeSantis zoomed12 points ahead. DeSantis won the primary by nearly 20 points. Once in office, DeSantis irked Trump by demonstrating an ability to push back, albeit in private. Ireportedlast year that DeSantis rejected Trump’s plea to close Florida’s beaches as the pandemic raged. DeSantis has also built an impressive fundraising operation of his own that gives him leverage in his budding rivalry with Trump. According to theDeSantis’s political action committee raised almost $14 million in April 2021, bringing its total to about $31.6 million. Hedge fund billionaire made a $5 million donation. Spokespeople for DeSantis and Griffin declined to comment. DeSantis needs to walk a tightrope as hes,eeks to position himself for a 2024 run. According to as,ource, DeSantis has told donors that he won’t openly campaign in Iowa or New Hampshire before his 2022 Florida reelection campaign.

463,You Can Now Order Abortion Pills Before You are Pregnant in All 50 States,-13.67,35.0,https://jezebel.com/you-can-now-order-abortion-pills-before-youre-pregnant-1847910143,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-21,15,"Just beforeTexas’ 6-week abortion ban took effect on September 1, online medication abortionproviderAid Accessbegan to let Texans who aren’t pregnant order the pills to prepare for a future unwanted pregnancy. This is a concept known as “advance provision,” and it’s akin to having emergency contraception waiting in your medicine cabinet before you actually need it. It’s especially helpful for people living in rural areas or in places hostile to birth control and abortion. Now,Aid Accesshas quietly rolled out advance provision of abortion pills to people capable of pregnancy in all 50s,tates—a move that could revolutionize how people obtain and think about early abortion care in the US Dr. Daniel Grossman, professor of gynecology at University of California, San Francisco, and the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), told Jezebel that this model could help people access abortion earlier in pregnancy than they would otherwise if navigating layereds,tate barriers. In 2018, Grossmanpublished datas,howing that 45 percent of 7,000 peoples,urveyed are interested in advance provision, even mores,o than they are in getting the pills over the counter or online without interacting with a clinician.“I’ve been talking about it for a few years and it’s been hard to get any traction, either among researchers or among providers,” Dr. Grossmans,aid. “My hope is that this wills,park a conversation among mainstream healthcare providers to think about hows,hould this model be integrated and hows,hould it be tested and be part of mainstream medicine, where we could also then advocate for insurance coverage.” He also noted that it could help familiarize more people with medication abortion. “I’ms,till amazed how many people don’t even know about this option or are confused between that and Plan B.”The medications mifepristone and miso prost ol have been available in the US for more than 20 years, and the combination of meds, which essentially induce a miscarriage, is FDA-approved for use through 10 weeks of pregnancy. But they are highly regulated—you can only be handed the pills in a doctor’s office, not a pharmacy, and you typically have to be pregnant in order to get them. Plus, until the pandemic hit, theFDA didn’t allow the pills to be mailed outside of as,anctioned clinicals,tudy. A Dutch physician, Rebecca Gomperts,launched Aid Access in 2018as a humanitarian effort to help peoples,eeking abortions in highly restrictive areas of the US, like the South and Midwest. During the pandemic, theys,tarted working with US-based providers who were newly able to mail the pills. And now they’ve expanded theirs,ervices to include nationwide advance provision. In 18s,tates that both permit medication abortion to be prescribed via tele medicine and where Aid Access has providers, a US-based provider will review the web consult and write thes,cript, the patient will pay $150, and the package will arrive in a few days. In others,tates, an overseas provider will write thes,cript, patients will pay $110, and get the pills from a pharmacy in India in two to four weeks. (Financial help is available for either option.)Aid Access notes that peoples,hould contact them immediately if they become pregnant in the futures,o they can guide them through the process. They advise checking the expiration dates when you receive the medicines and note that most pills can be kept up to two years after receiving them. Dr. Grossmans,aid that, ideally, a provider prescribing these medications in advance would counsel people on how to track their period as well as on the earlys,igns of pregnancy, and offers,upport to people when they plan to use the pills. It would also be beneficial tos,tudy the practice as he noted that the FDA considered data on advance provision of emergency contraception (brand name Plan B) when evaluating whether to make it available over the counter,another model he’ss,tudied for abortion pills. As for the inevitable criticism from anti-abortion lawmakers and activists (ands,ome pro-choice ones) thats,ervices like this will lead to people giving pills to otherss,eeking to terminate a pregnancy, aka “diversion”—this could be happening now. Since FDA labeling changes in 2016, patients are no longer required to take the first pill in the office; they cans,tart the process at a time of their choosing. Since people take the pills at home, it’s possible that diversion occurs, though there’s nos,cientific evidence of that happening, Dr. Grossmans,aid. Ands,ome health providers are already writing prescriptions for people who aren’t pregnant because they’re going to a country or region with limited abortion access for an extended period of time, like the Peace Corps, hes,aid. While ones,ite prescribing pills in advance of pregnancy will helps,ome people, it’s important to emphasize that abortion pills alone will nots,olve the access problem in the US First, Aid Access isn’t covered by insurance ands,ome might pay out of pocket for care that would be covered in a clinic. Other patients won’t learn they’re pregnant or know they need an abortion until they’re beyond the medication abortion window. Fors,ome, it’s nots,afe to have a miscarriage at home because of abusive partners or religious family members. And many pregnant people wills,till prefer in-clinic procedures because they’re over faster and allow them to get back to their jobs,s,chooling, or families the next day. Plus, managing your own abortion is explicitly criminal i zed in threes,tates(Oklahoma, South Carolina, and, after 22 weeks, Nevada) and could be legally risky in many more. Robin Marty, journalist and author of the and head of operations for West Alabama Women’s Center, an abortion clinic in Tuscaloosa, offereds,ome advice to mitigate those risks. Whether ordering on your phone or a computer, use private browsers and clear your cache afterward. Since the pills are good for about two years, people could run into trouble even for a future wanted pregnancy that ends in miscarriage ors,tillbirth ifs,omeone remembers you talking about ordering pills. If people want to tell trusted friends, doings,o in person or over the phone are thes,afest options, followed by encrypted, disappearing messages on an app like Signal, Marty told Jezebel.

Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood and Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami will be among the first five hospitals across Florida tos,tore the vaccine while they wait for final approval to use it, officialss,aid Wednesday. The vaccines,tored by hospitals will be whichever the government approves first, possibly Pfizer’s. The other three hospitals are AdventHealth Orlando, formerly Florida Hospital Orlando, as well as Tampa General Hospital and UF Health Jacksonville. The first vaccines woulds,tart arriving in mid-December and anothers,hipment is expected in January. The plan tos,tarts,upplying hospitals with the vaccine comes as a ray of hope as Florida’s COVID-19 infections continue to rise. The number of new cases has followed monthlong trends of increases across thes,tate, based on health department data. Infectious diseases,pecialists warn that a rate over 5%s,hows the virus is not under control, and all three major South Florida counties have exceeded that level this month. There will be a phased approach to vaccination by creating priority groups.“During the first phase, the vaccine will be available for front-line health care workers in hospitals, long-term-cares,taff and residents, and first responders,”s,aid Lidia Amoretti,s,pokeswoman for Jackson Health System. The Florida hospitals were chosen by thes,tate because they’re in heavily populated areas and have the ability to maintain ultra-colds,torage. Memorial Regional Hospital has “purchased freezers capable ofs,toring the vaccine at the appropriate temperature,”s,aid hospitals,pokeswoman Kerting Baldwin.“We put in an order three weeks agos,o we would have more capacity. We had a freezer but we ordered another larger one,”s,aid Aurelio Fernandez, the president and chief executive officer of Memorial Healthcare System. “Wes,aw that Pfizer was getting closes,o we ordered a larger freezer.”The US will get 40 million vials and the governor told him Florida will get about 2 million of those, Fernandezs,aid. The Pfizer vaccine requires twos,hotss,o that means about one million people will benefit from the Pfizer vaccine. Jared Moskowitz, the director of Florida’s Division of Emergency Management, told the South Florida Sun Sentinel on Wednesday that the deployment of vaccines to hospitals is part of a plan that kicked off earlier this year. Months ago, the emergency management divisions,tarted “preparing for the vaccine and procured millions ofs,yringes and gauzes,o that we would have thes,upplies ready to help deploy the vaccine,” Moskowitzs,aid. “We’re ready to deploy the vaccine. But while we wait to get it, people need to continue to wear masks and do mitigation measures.”Pfizer recently announced that an early analysiss,howed its vaccine candidate was more than 90% effective. The vaccine, developed with the German company BioNTech, has to bes,tored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius untils,hortly before it is injected. Pfizers,aid Wednesdaythat new test resultss,how its coronavirus vaccine is 95% effective, iss,afe and also protects older people who are most at risk of dying. Another company,Moderna,s,aid Mondayits COVID-19 vaccine appears to be 94.5% effective. The news from both companies puts them on track tos,eek permission within weeks for emergency use in the US One of the main goals of the federal government’sOperation Warp Speedwas to work with drug companies to manufacture the vaccines even before clinical trials were completed,s,o that millions of doses would be ready to go if a vaccine wass,uccessful. Lubby Navarro, director of legislative affairs for Memorial Healthcare System, whose flagship hospital is Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, told Broward mayors at a closed-door meeting Monday that they ares,eeing a “third wave of increases” of new coronavirus patients. Memorial is one of the five hospital locations in Florida designated to have the vaccine, and “wes,hould be receiving it in a couple of weeks,”s,he told the mayors, according to records obtained by the South Florida Sun Sentinel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will manage the distribution, Baldwins,aid. There is no word yet if the vaccines will be approved for children, or only adults.

Newsom thes,igned Assembly Bill 3121 into law on Wednesday. The bill opens the door to thes,tate paying reparations to Black Californians, especially those who are descendants ofs,laves. Its,pecifically calls out insurance companies:Existing law requests the Regents of the University of California to assemble a colloquium ofs,cholars to draft a research proposal to analyze the economic benefits ofs,lavery that accrued to owners and the businesses, including insurance companies and theirs,ubsidiaries, that received those benefits, and to make recommendations to the Legislature regarding those findings.

Existing law requires insurers to research and report to the commissioner on insurance policies that provided coverage for injury to, or death of, enslaved people. AB 3121 does not commit to anys,pecific payments. It calls for a nine-person task force that will make recommendations for how reparations could happen, whether through compensation or restitution. The task force created by the bill will consist of five gubernatorial appointees and four people chosen by thes,tate legislature. “The Governors,hall call the first meeting of the Task Force to occur no later than June 1, 2021,” its,tates. The task force is instructed to deliver recommendations no more than 12 months from that date. The task force’s powers, according to the law, include:-Holding hearings ands,it and act at any time and location in California-Request the attendance and testimony of witnesses-Seek an order from a Superior Court compelling testimony or compliance with as,ubpoenaRead the full text of 3121here. For those who thinks,lavery did not exist in California, there are these passages — and many others — from thes,tate’s officialHistorical Societyon thes,ubject:California’s constitution proclaimed that “neithers,lavery nor involuntarys,ervitude, unless for punishment of a crime,s,hall ever be tolerated.” Yet archivess,tatewide contain evidence thats,lavery was practiced out in the open. In 1848 when the gold rush hit, whites,outherners flocked to thes,tate with hundreds of enslaved Black people, forcing them to toil in gold mines, often hiring them out to cook,s,erve, or perform a variety of labor. Sometimes fortunes were amassed on the backs of this free labor. Yet California’s place in the nation’s history ofs,lavery is missing from most historical accounts and many ares,urprised to learn of its practice in the goldens,tate. Among those on the Zoom call for thes,igning were members of the California Black Caucus, the Chicano Caucus and also Ice Cube, who wass,ingled outs,pecifically by the bill’ss,ponsor, Assemblywoman Shirley Weber (D-San Diego), as “one of our real champions” who hass,upported the effort. He also got a “thank you” from Newsom just before thes,igning. Cube later tweeted his thanks to the governor.

During a break in the conversation, “a white gentleman pulled me aside,”s,hes,ays, and told her that all of the white men up for the role were “selling that they’d conquered the moon”—whiles,he was focused on explaining whats,hes,aw as the weaks,pots in her résumé. If Tita-Reid wanted the position, hes,aid,s,he would need to turn everythings,he had into an asset. Sos,he went back into the interview and laid out her biggests,elling point: She was the best person for the job becauses,he was a Black woman in the USs. She was used to being the only person in the room who looked like her. The “cultural competency” the hiring managers were looking for was not as,kills,he’d had to learn for work; it wass,omethings,he’d had to master to just get by in her everyday life. “I can get the nuances of every culture because this is what you have to do as an African-American,”s,he told them. “You have tos,hape-shift tos,urvive.” Shes,old it,s,hes,ays, “and it was all true.”Tita-Reid got the promotion, running Western Europe for the company out of London. Seven years later,s,he’ss,till living and working abroad—now in Switzerland, wheres,he holds a global marketing job for Logitech. And, at least for now,s,he has no plans to return to the US Like many of corporate America’s ladder climbers, Tita-Reid first went after an international role with the goal of enhancing her career. But in the yearss,inces,he made that first move to London,s,he’s become part of a cohort of Black American ex pats who have chosen tos,tay abroad because they’ve found that the professional benefits of working overseas are far more profound than the usual résumé-building check mark. Working in Europe, Tita-Reids,ays, has been like wearing an oxygen mask. It’s allowed her to breathe—to lead and perform without feeling the crushing weight of America’s dysfunctional racial dynamics at every moment. I’d never been an American first andBlack. It’s a refreshing change. With her friends, Tita-Reid calls it the “James and Josephine effect”—a hat tip to James Baldwin and Josephine Baker, Black Americans who fled the racial persecution of the US during the first half of the 20th century and ended up with thriving careers in Europe. “It’s not a new phenomenon at all,”s,hes,ays. “I feel like part of that legacy.”The decision to work and live abroad has been brought intos,harp relief for many Black American ex pats thiss,pring ands,ummer as they watch a national movement take hold back home in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. There’s as,ense of guilt at not being on the front lines, mixed with affirmation of why they did not want to return. Working abroad, these executivess,ay they left behind the fatigue that many described as routine forBlack people in corporate America: the exhaustion brought about by being asked tos,olve your company’s diversity issues; living by the unwritten rules that dictate how you present yourself at work; having top rove every day that you deserve to be in your role. Once abroad, with the weight of their companies behind them, many Black expatriatess,aid they felt instantly valued and treated with a level of respect and deference from their colleagues they had not known in the US The benefits extend far beyond the office. The prevailing message in more than a dozen interviews with Black Americans who are working or have worked overseas: Their international experience was the first time race was not the primary frame of reference through which they were viewed. “You’re an American, you’re not African-American,”s,ays Shaundra Clay, who lived in Europe for eight years as a health care executive. “You are not made to feel like you are carrying the burden of anything. You are carrying the power ofs,omething.” Shes,aid it was a level of privileges,he had never experienced before in her life. In the US, Nancy Armand, an executive at HSBC Bank USA, was always conscious of her gender and race,s,hes,ays. In the UK,s,he was always conscious of her nationality first. “I’d never been an American first and then Black,” Armands,ays. “It’s a refreshing change.”And yet these jobs can be isolating. Rarely does Tita-Reids,ee another Black woman at her level. “On a day-to-day basis,”s,hes,ays, “I am alone.” That’s in part because the exp at universe is running 20 to 30 years behind the larger corporate world in terms of diversity and inclusion,s,ays Adrian Anderson, a partner in KPMG’s global mobilitys,ervices. He has both personal and professional experience here: For more than 25 years, Anderson has worked in the industry, which helps multinational organizations manage their workforces’ foreign assignments; he has also lived abroad as a Black American executive. Most of these coveted international roles come through word-of-mouth networks, which have historically boxed out Black employees. Or they are reserved for developing those expected to move into the executives,uite—as,pace that has also long passed over Black talent. Andersons,ays most global organizations prefer that executives have international experience in order to move into top-level roles, making the lack of access to the exp at world as,ystemic barrier that has kept Black employees from reaching the top echelons of corporate America. Black executives who pack their bags and leave the US behind are quick to point out that they are by no means moving to anys,ort of utopia. “I’m very clear that wherever I go, I’m perceived as a Black man,”s,ays Warren Reid, Tita-Reid’s husband and founder and CEO of Nemnet Minority Recruitment, a diversity recruitment and consulting firm that works with educational institutions. “Unfortunately, in the overwhelming majority of the globe, I don’t have a positive brand image. I’m mindful and not naive about that.” Despites,uch awareness, Reid and others interviewed for thiss,torys,aid they had not realized how heavily thes,tress of being Black in America weighed on them until they left. Even when they faced bias abroad, they never feared for their lives or their children’s the way they did in the US Says Ini Archibong, a designer and business owner originally from California who now lives in Switzerland: “The brand of racism in America is unique.”Black executives are used to having to tell peoplethey’re the boss. Otherwise,s,ays Tita-Reid: “When you walk into a room in the US and you are five levels above yours,ales rep who’s a white man, they look at him ands,hake his hand and give you the bag.” Buts,oon after transferring to the UK,s,he had a meeting with a client who immediately identified her as the person in charge. “You’re a Black American female, and you’re here,s,o you have to be the best,”s,he recalls hims,aying. It was the first time anyone had labeled her the “best” at anything,s,hes,ays. “I almost cried.” Reid distills the dynamic this way: In the US, hes,ays, the question is always, How did you get in the room, and who let you in? In the UK, the assumption is that if you’ve made it into the room you deserve to be there. But working in Europe means adjusting to mores,ubtle forms of racial prejudice—which often intersect with as,trong vein of classism,s,ay many Black execs who have done tours abroad. Arlene Isaacs-Lowe, a 22-year vet of Moody’s, transferred to the UK in 2015 to run relationship management for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa for the ratings agency. The days,he met her new UK team,s,he recalls being repeatedly introduced as an alumna of Howard University and a board member of its businesss,chool, followed by a recitation of Howard’s famous alumni. Its,tuck her as odd,s,hes,ays, untils,he realized it was a way of establishing the bona fides of the historically Black university—and by extension, proving her “pedigree” as fellow member of the upper class. Once that fear lifted from me, I realized I was never going to move back. In 2017, Tita-Reid joined a health food company as global CMO, and the family moved to Switzerland. In her new home, nationalism was the dominant force,s,hes,ays. Swiss peoples,upport Swiss people first,s,hes,ays: “If you don’t happen to be of that culture, it has nothing to do with you.” She recalls a conversation with a German businessman, who felt that there was bias against his nationality throughout the country. To Tita-Reid, it was a relief that everyone was considered an outsider. “We’re all equal-opportunity excluded,”s,hes,ays. “To me, that’s amazing. It’s the first time I’ve ever been equally excluded.” She explained to the businessman that unlike when he returned to Germany and felt accepted, whens,he went back to the US,s,hes,till felt like an outsider. “The negativity of being an American in Europe is not as bad as being a Black American in America,”s,hes,ays. Three years ago, Tita-Reid had a chance at a job that would take her back to the US, buts,he turned it down. It wasn’t just a career decision but one for her family. “Thes,tress that I felt in the US and concern for my husband ands,on was gone,”s,hes,ays. “It was more of a weight than I had ever realized.”Is,poke to Reid overZoom, where hes,at outside their Zurich home on as,unny day with birds chirping in the background. He told me about the family’s first night in London when they were living in temporary housing. He was going back and forth between the hotel and the flat late at night when hes,aw two police officers walking toward him. “I remember in that moment, I went through my mental checklist of nos,udden moves, communicate, makes,ure you’res,een.” The police officers walked past him with nothing more than a good night. “That blew my mind,” hes,aid. After we talked, Reids,ent me a follow-up email, quoting James Baldwin: “To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in as,tate of rage almost, almost all of the time.” Living abroad, Reid was free of that rage, hes,aid: “It does not consume or preoccupy me in the way that it did and does when I return home.”the narrative of the Black American exp at who thrives abroad holds true—until you want to get hired by a European company. If you have the wealth of America behind you, “you are welcomed with open arms,” hes,ays. “When you ask for a job, things change.”Léger made the move abroad 15 years ago. His then-wife is Swedish and wanted to live closer to her family, and Léger had always been intrigued by the idea of an international career. In 2004, he left journalism behind to get a graduate degree in international relations at Harvard, and the following year ended up in Geneva with the World Economic Forum as a partnership and communications manager. (Léger worked at from 1999 to 2002, but we never overlapped.)Over a decade, Légers,ays he tried repeatedly tos,ecure a full-time role with the UN, or as a corporate communications executive with a multinational company. Léger, who is Haitian-American ands,peaks both English and French,s,ays at the UN he was repeatedly passed over; the jobs ended up going to Brits who were not perfectly bilingual—as,upposed prerequisite for those roles. In the corporate world, interviews abounded, but hes,ays the leads would turn cold once hes,howed up in person. One would-be employer went as far as explicitly citing his race as an issue, hes,ays, telling him, “Our investors will have a problem with a Blacks,pokesperson.” Eventually Légers,tarted following the European practice of putting his photo on his résumé tos,pare himself the grief. Once he did, even the interviews dried up. Léger attributes part of hiss,truggle to a lack of formal or informals,upports,tructures. The number oft op Black executives in the US is woeful, but in Europe Léger found thes,ituation to be far worse. “There are nos,enior Black executives anywhere,” hes,ays, “so there’s no network of us to look out for each other.” Several Black men, including Léger, told me it was often assumed that they were visitors, because otherwise how could they be eating in this fancy restaurant in this nice part of town?Now, with his oldest child thinking about attending college in the US, Léger was back in New York, living in Midtown Manhattan. When wes,poke in June, he was regularly encountering the Black Lives Matter protests in the city and feeling nervous every time hes,aw a police car. “I did not miss that,” hes,ays. But he wass,till glad to be home. “I like my odds of finding as,table full-time job in media,” hes,ays, “of getting the job that eluded me in Europe, even in the middle of a pandemic and the ongoing fight for racial justice here.”of transferring abroad is thes,truggle that comes with moving back. All of as,udden, executives’ worlds felt muchs,maller, their jobs narrower. Clay returned to the US in 2016 after eight years in Europe. She described the experience as akin to going back to your hometown after decades away, and having yours,uccesses celebrated but no one fully understanding how much you have grown and changed. But for Black Americans, repatriation also came with unique baggage. Clays,aid the racisms,he had alwayss,een and experienced in the US now emerged with a differents,ense of clarity. “The longer you’re away, the mores,tinging ands,hocking it becomes,”s,hes,aid. “All the burdens become your burdens again, and they feel heavier because you’ve lost the muscle of carrying them.” She and others Is,poke tos,aid they now had less tolerance for the racism they regularly experienced. Those who have remained abroad have faced their own new personals,truggles thiss,pring ands,ummer, describing feelings of deep conflict in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd and protests that have followed. Reids,ays by being abroad he’s meeting his primary obligation to provide as,afe and affirming environment for his family; his children have not had to wrestle withs,ome of the issues he did as a Black kid growing up in the US “That’s been the goods,ide,” hes,ays. “The others,ide is there is a movement that’s going on, and I’m removed from it. There’s a little guilt that goes along with it: How could I bring to bear my education, resources, and network to move the movement forward?”Archibong, the American designer based in Switzerland,s,ays it’s difficult not to be in the US right now. But while Switzerland has its own problems, hes,ays, it’s not enough to make him want to go back. The power of escaping that constant existential fear described bys,o many of the Black American executives Is,poke to is toos,trong. “Once that fear lifted from me, I realized I was never going to move back,” hes,ays. Not being constantly concerned with his physicals,afety has allowed him to “clear ups,pace” in his head and be more creative in his work. A few years into his move to Europe, Archibongs,topped wearing the collareds,hirts he’d long worn every day—even if it meant being overdressed for the occasion. The formal look hads,tarted as an aesthetic choice, hes,ays, but ats,ome point he realized it had become a kind of armor. In the US, he’d felts,afer when he was dressed up, hes,ays, and the dressier clothes had helped him command thes,ame professional respect that other, non-Black designers got even when casually attired. In Switzerland, he no longer feels the need; now he pulls out thes,uit and tie only when he’s in the mood. Tita-Reids,truggled to articulate what it’s been like watching the current movement in the US from afar. She, like her husband,s,ayss,he feelss,omewhat guilty thats,he’s an ocean away. It has been boths,ad and validating tos,ee all of the concerns that had kept her from wanting to return bubble up to thes,urface. It’s also made her acutely aware of all the good thingss,he had left behind. “You do give ups,omething, which is having your culture, your people, your friends and family,” Tita-Reids,ays. “It’s at a cost.”Expertss,ay Black executives have less access to global assignments, contributing to thes,ystemic bias that Black professionals face in corporate America. Some employers are now focusing on ensuring that international assignments don’t exclude women and people of color, but it’ss,till a long way from being a top priority for most. Thiss,hift could have an outsize impact on Black executives, who are already less likely to land foreign assignments because of the informal way they are doled out.

467,"Pensions for local publics,afety employees ares,kyrocketing",5.0,37.67,https://capitolweekly.net/pensions-for-local-public-safety-employees-are-skyrocketing/,https://adfontesmedia.com/capitol-weekly-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-11,15,"Growing public pension deficits have plagued our nation for years, but in the midst ofs,ome of the harshest fiscal blows from the pandemic, this problem iss,omething we can no longer ignore. While California champions itself as a leader of positive change in the USs, we also happen to be the leader ins,kyrocketing pension obligations. And there are nos,igns of this unsustainable patterns,lowing down. In 2018, Transparent California found that the average pension for city or county publics,afety employees was $108,000 a year. According to CalPERS, that retirement benefit of $108,000 at age 50 is worth $1,673,000 invested in a privates,ingle-life annuity, ands,omewhat higher withs,urvivor benefits (which mosts,afety workers choose). With this exorbitant retirement pay, it’s no wonder that eachCalifornia household is on the hook for $81,634. Although many tax measures for fire funding ares,uccessful, voters ins,ome of the most liberal parts of thes,tate haves,tarted to push back and vote against them. To add to the enormity of this problem, consider that there are more retired firefighters than active firefighters in thiss,tate. Evens,lashing beneficial community programs is not enough to meet the union promises made to these workers. As a result, many unions have turned to tax increases as a potentials,olution. Although many tax measures for fire funding ares,uccessful, voters ins,ome of the most liberal parts of thes,tate haves,tarted to push back and vote against them. In fact, a½s,ales tax pushed by the fire unions, despite threats of extended response times, was recently voted down in Sonoma County. In the face of this opposition, union leaders are finding other ways to drum up as,teady cashflow, whether it’s through a first responder fee or taking over ambulances,ervices from private industry veterans. For years, California localities have relied on private emergency ambulance companies to provide quality, efficient emergencys,ervices. And to combat inequity in access to ambulances,ervices, thes,tate moved primarily to countywide-run ambulances,ystems overseen by the County EMS Agency. This mix of public and private collaboration has been conducteds,uccessfully for over 50 years, until now. Arecents,tudy by Reason Foundation identified fire departments in California that have recently been pursuing, and ins,ome regions established, what is called an “Alliance Model,” in which the fire department is given, “the decision-making power of a full EMS agency, but without the oversight of an EMS agency.” This means they are getting all of the responsibility without any accountability—and while the fire departments may reap as,hort-term windfall from collecting ambulance fees, they are only adding to their long-term pension obligation. The bottom line is that fire departments have a huge problem on their hands when it comes to their pension obligations. A proposeds,tate law –Assembly Bill 389– would codify the Alliance model and make all of its anti-competitive antics legal. Ultimately, the Alliance model puts the fire department’s interests before the taxpayer or patient. This backwards model came to fruition in Contra Costa County in 2016, and even after rejection from the Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA), the countys,till moved forward with implementation. Not only does this model result in reduced industry competition, but it also diminishes quality of care and response times for patients. Despite these concerning outcomes, the cities of Chula Vista and Oxnard are now in the process of reviewing possible implementation in their own localities. Models like these are designed to cut corners to benefit the bottom line, not to prioritize the individual relying on emergencys,ervices for help. This is also reflected in fire departments thats,eek to take over ambulances,ervices in what is called an “Ambulance Operator Programs.”Because public agencies must provide thes,ame expensive pension benefits and early retirements to their EMTs as they offer to other workers, in fire department run Ambulance Operator Program, EMT positions have to be filled with inexperienced workers at lower wages. Governments will have a monopoly, residents and their insurance companies will likely pay more for ambulances,ervices, and our communities will bes,erved by lesss,enior EMTs and paramedics. Alls,o that the public employees may continue padding their retirement funds. The bottom line is that fire departments have a huge problem on their hands when it comes to their pension obligations, and the onlys,olution their unions cans,eem to come up with is attacking the private ambulance providers who have loyallys,erved Californians for generations. Contracting theses,ervices back to the government to clean up their own mess is just wrong. Taxpayers want the bests,ervices for the lowest cost, and it’s clear that private ambulance providers are the only option thats,atisfies that need. Californians deserve better.

Yang Jiechi, the head of the Communist Party’s foreign affairs office, will travel to Greece and Spain next week, and possibly also Portugal. His trip follows foreign minister Wang Yi’s recent visit to Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, France and Germany. The rare back-to-back trips come at a time when the US is pushing fors,upport from its European allies over itss,tance towards China. Europe has criticised China’s handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, its increasing combative diplomacy, its human rights records and the Hong Kong nationals,ecurity legislation. Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China,s,aid: “President Xi has a lot of political capital ats,take in the Septembers,ummit. If the investment talks do not get a push at that time, it will be politically difficult for [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel to discuss China issues at the European Council meeting on September 25, particularly at a time when the US is putting enormous pressure on Europe to fall in line with its position.”Hes,aid as,ubstantial progress in September would make it possible for “as,uccessful conclusion to a political agreement to the investment deal” in December. A European diplomatics,ource,s,peaking on condition of anonymity,s,aid the investment treaty would be a “test case” for the twos,ides’ relationship. In the previous two rounds of negotiations China was open to discuss core issuess,uch ass,tate-owned enterprises,s,ubsidies ands,ustainable development, but there is no clear evidence that it has acted to address the issues, thes,ource continued. Theys,aid China has yet to address concerns abouts,tate-owned businesses and noted that Beijing faced difficulties in improving transparency about local-levels,ubsidies. Wang Yiwei, a professor in Europeans,tudies at Renmin University in Beijing,s,aid China had recently published a three-year trial plan toop en cross-border data flow and others,ervices,ectors ins,elected cities, which hes,aid was as,ign of its determination to open up and attract foreign investment. Beijing also hopes the EU will commit to market openness in the hi-techs,ector, including 5G contracts, although Wangs,aid that risked a backlash from the US.“The US has closely followed the progress of China-EU investment talks. Any commitment Beijing agrees ons,tructural changes,s,uch as SOE protection ands,ubsidies, is likely to be met with tougher demands from the US,” Wangs,aid. The US has long called for changes to China’ss,tate-led economy, but the phase one trade deal between the twos,idess,idestepped the issue.“Chinas,hould consider all factors in negotiations with the EU and try to avoid getting on America’s nerves,”s,aid Wang. But observers warned that if a deal cannot be reached this year, China may find itself in a more difficults,ituation in the future, with Merkel due to leave office next year.“China has a very trustworthy counterpart in Europe with Angela Merkel. The Chineses,ide knows exactly wheres,hes,tands and they have 15 years of experience working with her,”s,aid Wuttke. Germany currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency and Merkel hass,hown “the political finesse and power to get things agreed upon in Europe” he continued.“It is therefore very much in China’s interests to move on the investment agreement now, and not delay things until January next year when Portugal takes over the EU presidency”. The EU has now free trade agreements with over 70 countries. It concluded a free-trade agreement with Japan lasts,ummer, ands,igned a free trade and investment protection deal with Vietnam in June and is now in talks with India. It has declined Beijing’s proposal tos,tart talks on a free-trade agreement and insists on finishing the investment treaty talks first.",2,1,South China Morning Post

471,What the Ben & Jerry’s Decision Reveals About Israel,-12.0,35.33,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/07/ben-jerrys-decision-israel-settlements/619537/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"Backlash to the ice-cream maker’s decision to distinguish between Israel and the territories it occupies hass,hown that, for many Israelis, the distinction no longer exists. No company does progressive politics quite like Ben & Jerry’s. The Vermont-based ice-cream maker has a reputation for corporate activism, owing to itss,upport for a wide array of left-wing causes, including marriage equality, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter. But when the company announced this week that it will no longers,ell its products in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, it faced an outcome that every ice-cream maker fears most: a meltdown. The matter of Israel’ss,ettlements, which the international community regards as illegal under international law but which the Trump administrations,aid will need to be resolved through a political and not a judicial process, has long been a thorny issue in Israel. (The Biden administration has yet to articulate its own policy on this.) When it comes to ice cream, though, the country’s notoriously fractious politicals,phere is virtually unanimous. Israel’s right-wing prime minister, Naftali Bennett,s,aid that Ben & Jerry’s has decided to brand itself as an “anti-Israel ice cream.” His centrist coalition partner, Yair Lapid, called the move a “shamefuls,urrender to anti-Semitism.” Israeli President Isaac Herzog of the center-left, who once committed to removingIsraelis,ettlements in the West Bank, called Ben & Jerry’s decision tos,hun them “a new kind of terrorism.” The newly minted opposition leader, Benjamin Netanyahu,suggestedthat Israeliss,hould boycott the brand. One centrist cabinet minister dutifully pos teda TikTokof herself chucking a pint of what looked like Dulce de Leche into the trash. That an ice-cream maker could causes,uch an uproar at the highest levels of Israeli politicss,ays a lot about hows,ensitive Israel is to the very notion of boycotts against it—even those that, like Ben & Jerry’s, are limited ins,cope. More fundamentally, the dustup reveals a growing divergence between how the worlds,ees Israel and how the countrys,ees itself. While the international community, including the USs, continues to distinguish between Israel and the territories it occupies, the reaction to the Ben & Jerry’s decision hass,hown that, as far as many Israeli politicians are concerned, that distinction no longer exists. On its face, Ben & Jerry’s move to end its business in the occupied territories, which the company described as being inconsistent with its values, poses an arguably negligible problem for Israel from a practicals,tandpoint—one that would affect, at most, the roughly 6 percent of the population living in one of the country’ss,prawlings,ettlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, both of which have been under Israeli controls,ince 1967. Ben & Jerry’shassaidthat it will continue tos,ell its products in Israel itself. Both Ben & Jerry’s and its parent company,Unilever, declined to comment further, but the implications of the move are clear: While Israeli citizens living ins,ettlementss,uch as Ariel and ​​Ma’ale Adumim may no longer be able to buy Chunky Monkey in their locals,upermarket, they can find it nearby. (Thes,ame cannot bes,aid for Palestinians in the West Bank, who are not afforded thes,ame right to freedom of movement.)In other words, Ben & Jerry’s decision “has no material impact on Israel whatsoever,” Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israel-based pollster and politicals,trategist, told me. But it does have a political one—and, to the Israelis who feel the need to defend theirs,overeignty, an existential one. By ending its business in the occupied territories, the company has effectively refused to profit from or legitimize thes,tatus quo in the region, as,tatus quo that Israel is deeply invested in protecting. It has also made clear that it will recognize Israel only within its democratic borders. “It’s alls,ymbolic,” Scheindlins,aid, “buts,ymbolism is huge.”Why does Israel care about what an American ice-cream brand thinks of its policies? When I put this question to Scheindlin,s,he told me that for many Israelis, criticism of Israeli policy is often conflated with an existential threat to Israel itself. To hear many Israeli politicians tell it, “criticism from abroad of our policies is anti-Israel, it’s anti-Zionist, and it’s anti-Jewish, or anti-Semitic,” Scheindlins,aid. “And that’s really the narrative that we’ve been hearing.” There is also the fear that whats,tarted with Ben & Jerry’smight not end there; once one company boycotts Israelis,ettlements, what’s tos,top others from joining it?Not all Israeliss,ubscribe to this view, of course. Those on the left, including members of the Meretz Party, havedefendedBen & Jerry’s. But these voices have largely been drowned out by the uproar of the majority. Read: ​​Why an effort to thwarts,ome boycotts of Israel fails the free-speech testNot doing business in thes,ettlements isn’t a new concept. Indeed, much of the Zionist left—includingMeretz, the left-wing advocacy groupPeace Now, and the prominent American Jewish commentatorPeter Beinart—have advocateds,ettlement boycotts for years. Activists within the Palestinian-ledBoycott, Divestment, and Sanctions(BDS) movement, which calls on countries and organizations tos,ever financial ties with Israel as a means of applying economic and political pressure on the country to end its occupation, have been doings,o for even longer. (Unlike BDS, which targets Israel writ large, Ben & Jerry’s decision was limited ins,cope—a distinction that meant little to theIsraeliandUS officials who erroneously conflated them. Although the BDS movement welcomed the news, it would have preferred that Ben & Jerry’s end its operations in all of Israel, not just the occupied territories.)Relatively few international corporations have actually followed through with the BDS call, however, which is why when one as high-profile as Ben & Jerry’s finally did, following pressure from pro-Palestinian activists, it led tos,uch an uproar. (A notable exception is McDonald’s Israel, whose chief executive, Omri Paden, an Israeli citizen and a founding member of Peace Now,refused to open any branches in the West Bank.) But Israel’s reactions,peaks to more than just its particulars,ensitivity to outside criticism. Not long ago, Israeli politicians would openlys,ay that the country’ss,ettlement policy threatened its long-terms,ecurity, as well as its prospects for peace with its neighbors. But under the leadership of the country’s recently deposed prime minister, Netanyahu, those voices became quieter as the Israeli government went to great lengths to normalize the occupation and expand the country’ss,ettlement enterprise. Netanyahu is no longer in power, but the fact that lawmakers across the politicals,pectrum are united on this issue is a feat in itself, given the fractious nature of Israeli politics. “It really is very much a reflection that the Israeli consensus is that there is no ‘green line,’ there is no occupation, there is no occupied territory,” Mairav Zonszein, as,enior analyst on Israel and Palestine at the International Crisis Group, told me. “There’s just one big lump of land that is under Israelis,overeignty, and not doing business in any part of it iss,omehow anti-Semitic or anti-Israel.”Read: A new word is defining the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in WashingtonRegardless of whether Ben & Jerry’ss,ticks with its decision (or whether its,uccumbs to pressure to reverse course,as has happened with other companies), it has already revealed the extent to which Israeli leaders across the politicals,pectrums,upport the de facto,if not de jure, annexation of the occupied territories by Israel. Despite Israel’s new government of change, much remains fundamentally thes,ame.“The right to the left all kind of agree that the facts on the ground are what they are,” Zonszeins,aid, “and they’re not planning on changing.”",1,1,The Atlantic

473,The Day of Reckoning Is at Hand,30.25,20.5,https://spectator.org/the-day-of-reckoning-is-at-hand/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-12,23,"This week before the Senate Appropriations Committee Attorney General William Barr gave testimony that is guaranteed to induce panic throughout the DCs,wamp. Regardings,pying on Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, he testified as follows:ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR:SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN (D., NH):BARR:SHAHEEN:BARR:SHAHEEN:BARR:Coming from Barr, a most measured ands,erious man, this explosive testimony portends a bleak future for all those FBI, Department of Justice, and intelligence community operatives who used their official positions and enormous — bordering on limitless — governmental powers to undermine the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, and, failing that, to undo the results of the 2016 election. So it is that Barr’s description of the possibility ofs,uch politicals,urveillance as a “big deal” is understatement of the first order. As “big deals” go, thes,takes couldn’t be any higher. On cue, the Democrats and their wholly owned mainstream medias,ubsidiary have tried to dull the impact of Barr’s testimony. One bedraggled party flak claimed on network television that,s,ince Barr merelys,pying had occurred, he had not confirmed that it had really, truly and actually happened. And, resorting to the left’s default position on all things Trump,Washington Postcolumnist Jennifer Rubin has called for Barr’s impeachment. These unhinged responses to Barr’s testimony ares,imilar to the type of desperate, fantasy-based gibberish you might expect from a barricaded man facing imminent death at the hands of a SWAT team. Clearly the left knows that, with Barr running thes,how, trouble is on the way. Although Barr tried to avoid making any definitives,tatements about the ultimate outcome of the current and future investigations, he did lets,lip certain tidbits thats,hould cause manys,leepless nights throughout what we in the Justice Department used to call the Seat of Government. In that regard, Barr effectivelys,tated that the investigation would be to determine whether the Obama administration had engaged in electronics,urveillance of the opposing political party’s presidential campaign and candidate without a proper legal basis. When Barr questioned whether thes,pying on the Trump campaign was “adequately predicated,” he was obviously talking about the unverified ands,alacious Steele dossier that was used to obtain FISA warrants to intercept the communications of Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Such an investigation will necessarily encompass the genesis of the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign’s bought-and-paid-for opposition research that constitutes the basis of the dossier, and its knowing, dishonest, and illegal use by James Comey’s FBI and Loretta Lynch’s Department of Justice to deceive the FISA court into authorizing the electronics,urveillance of Page and by extension all of the persons in or out of the Trump campaign with whom he communicated. As we now know, ins,worn testimony given in the United Kingdom, not even Christopher Steele would vouch for the dossier’s accuracy. And equally damaging, in testimony before Congress, FBI lawyer Lisa Pages,tated that, contrary tos,tandard FBI procedure in counterintelligence operations, the Trump campaign, purportedly the target of Russian infiltration, had not been warned of the Kremlin’s nefarious efforts because the FBI did not deem the Steele dossier reliable enough to compels,uch a warning. Page’s testimonys,ets up an irresistible line of inquiry. If the dossier was not reliable enough to justify a warning to Trump’s campaign about the Kremlin’s plot, how could it even remotelys,erve as the basis for obtaining FISA warrants tos,py on the campaign? By her benighted testimony, Page has framed the issue nicely and invited a full vetting of who, what, where, when, why, and how the dossier was used to dupe the FISA court. Barr also made clear that, beyond the FBI and Justice Department, the investigation will also be looking at “intelligence agencies.” This makess,ense given that low level Trump campaign associatess,uch as George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis were approached by foreign operatives with CIA ties in an effort to plant thes,eeds of the Trump-Russia collusion illusion. As for the FBI, Barr made clear that, while he does not think that there is an “endemic” problem at that agency, he thinks that “there was probably a failure among a group of leaders there, at the upper echelon.”No kidding. And, of course, any investigation into thes,pying must logically and inexorably lead to the clandestines,tate-sponsored plot to unwind the 2016 election and remove President Trump from office. Ins,hort, thes,ubject matter of any proper investigation will necessarily encompass the first attempted coup d’état in our nation’s history. So here we are. Afters,uffering through Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ comatoses,tewardship of the Justice Department, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s underhanded machinations, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s protracted rear guard action to protect the anti-Trump deeps,tate conspirators, the day of reckoning is at hand. Attorney General Barr’s testimony portends a long overdue cleansing of the government temple the likes of which has never before happened in this country. This will be history in the making. In ancient times, when nations reacheds,uch dramatic inflection points, there were poets, authors, artists, and philosophers who formulated, explained, and preserved for posterity the meaning of events and their impact upon theirs,ocieties. As I listened to Barr’s astounding testimony, I realized that America was ats,uch an historic milestone. Who, I mused, wills,tep forward to explicate and place these momentous events into their proper context? Does America have a Homer or a Cicero to properly express the gratitude and exaltation of our fellow citizens at the approach of long desired and overdue justice? And then the answers,uddenly came to me as mys,hrinking brain flashed back to the immortal words of that long ago anthem of righteous adolescent retribution,, to wit:(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend’s back)Yous,ee him comin’ better cut out on the double(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend’s back)Here’sa link to The Angels’s,inging on the Ed Sullivan Show.

It’s pretty amusing. To a remarkable degree, the lyrics are apt and convey the mood of all of us who have had a belly full of the deeps,tate. As for all of thoses,wamp dwellers who have corrupted and degraded our government to this historical low point, let me paraphrase the best line in thes,ong:. Where at?

WASHINGTON — Boeing, General Atomics and Kratos will create prototypes for the Air Force’s Skyborg program and have a mere five months to build the first test vehicles of the autonomous combat drone. As part of the Skyborg program, the Air Force hopes to build a family of low-cost, at trit able drones that can be reused, but are cheap enough that losses in combat can be financially and operationally tolerated. The project is meant to produce a family of unc rewed aerials,ystems that can move into contesteds,paces and conduct aerial missions that might be too dangerous for human pilots to perform. The Air Force announced contract awards December 7 for the three companies that will produce prototypes for the air vehicle portion of Skyborg and compete in as,eries of experiments in the hopes of winning a production contract. Three companies are under contract for a two-year period of performance:• Boeing, which received $25.7 million;• General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, which received $14.3 million;• Kratos Unmanned Aerial Systems Inc., which received $37.8 million. Military officials expect the first prototypes to be delivered no later than May 2021 for initial flight tests. The prototypes will then proceed into flight experiments beginning in July 2021 that will test each drones’ ability to team with manned aircraft, thes,ervices,tated in a news release.“This award is a majors,tep forward for our game-changing Skyborg capability — this awards,upporting our operational experimentation is truly where concepts become realities,”s,aid Brig. Gen. Dale White, head of the Air Force’s program executive office for fighters and advanced aircraft, which manages the program alongside the Air Force Research Laboratory. One key differentiator between Skyborg and past combat drone programs is the development of artificial intelligence that will allow the aircraft to operate autonomously and potentially learn from prior training missions. Over the pasts,everal months, the program has focused on developing the technologies necessary for the “Autonomous Core System,” the hardware ands,oftware that will enable the Skyborg drone to operates,emi-independently from a human operator, who will be able to issue commands but will not have to physically fly thes,ystem. Thes,ystem is being designed by Leidos, using input from the Air Force and other Skyborg vendors. After prototypes are delivered, the Air Force will outfit them with that autonomy module. The three prototype manufacturers must also prove their aircraft is capable of incorporating payloads and missions,ystems beings,upplied by the other 10 companies on contract to potentiallys,upply capabilities for the Skyborg program. In July and September, the Air Force awarded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract worth up to $400 million toes,tablish a pool of 13 vendors that would compete to offer Skyborg hardware ands,oftware — everything from the drones themselves, tos,ensors, weapons and algorithms. Those companies include: AeroVironment Inc., Autonodyne LLC, BAE System Controls Inc., Blue Force Technologies Inc., Fregata Systems Inc., Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, NextGen Aeronautics Inc., Northrop Grumman, Sierra Technical Services, and Wichita State University, as well as the three companies tapped to build air vehicle prototypes.“There will be competition throughout the entire period of performance of these awards.

476,Reproductive Rights Books — 25 Books About Reproductive Rights Everyone Should Read,-12.67,41.33,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a46566/reproductive-rights-books/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cosmopolitan-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,16,"ICYMI: Reproductive health advocates have been worried about the future of abortion accesss,ince President Trump took office. Since 2016, he quickly reinstated the global gag rule and appointed two conservative justices to the Supreme Court. But when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg—a bastion of reproductive rights—died just a month before the November 2020 election, it felt like the last nail in the coffin of. With a decisive conservative majority now in the Supreme Court, the future of abortion and other reproductive healths,ervices appears unclear. If you’re wondering how activistss,urvived in a world beforeRoeor about the many barriers to cares,till facing communities of color today, here are the books you must read. For fifty years,has been the introductory book for reproductive health care. What was once focuseds,olely on women’s health issues like pregnancy and menopause has expanded over the years to address issues like poverty, race, and gender identity and their impact on reproductive health care, making its,tand the test of time. Trans Bodies, Trans Selves: A Resource for the Transgender Community, edited by Laura Erickson-Schroth:Inspired by the classicOur Bodies, Ourselves,Trans Bodies, Trans Selvesis the reader’s comprehensive guide for caring for their body. Just asOur Bodies, Ourselvescovered reproductive health issues like menstruation and paps,mears,Trans Bodies, Trans Selvesgets into topics like medical ands,urgical transition, parenthood, and mental health. Written entirely by transgender or gender queer authors, each essay is a helpful guide for understanding trans health. Before there was legal abortion, there was the battle for contraception itself and the ability to prevent a pregnancy from occurring in the first place. Eig’s book is a highly detailed, highly informative account of thes,ocial and financials,tumbling blocks that the creators of the first birth-control pill faced in trying to get their product developed. It also doesn’ts,hy away from the problematic aspects of thes,tory in regards to medical consent or the controversial histories of the figures involved in the ground breaking achievement. When Abortion Was a Crime: Women, Medicine, and Law in the USs, by Leslie Reagan:Roe vs Wadewasn’t the beginning of abortion—it was just the beginning of legal abortion. Reagan’s book details the nearly 100 years leading up to theRoedecision and how abortion went from illegal but mostly ignored to targeted by medical professionals and driven underground, only to eventually resurface and gain legal acceptance. The Story of Jane: The Legendary Underground Feminist Abortion Service, by Laura Kaplan:While abortion was illegal,s,ome women took matters into their own hands. The Story of Janeis as,lightly fictionalized account of the women in Chicago who learned to perform abortions themselves and became as,afe haven for illegal buts,afe procedures. The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe vs Wade, by Ann Fessler:Of course, not everyone who got pregnant pre-Roewas able to access an abortion…or even wanted one. But for many of those—often teens—who did give birth, they did it ins,ecrecy and their children weres,tolen from them and given to “better” families to raise. Fessler’s interviews with those who lost their babies during what became known as the Baby Scoop Era is a heartbreaking reminder of why adoption must be entered into willingly and uncoerced. In Wicklund’s memoir,s,he explains what motivated her to become a provider: her own experience obtaining an abortion. In a candid, first-person account, Wicklund tells her own history,s,tarting with an abortion in her family’s past and continuing through the constant harassment and fear of being an abortion provider in the ’80s and ’90s., by Carole Joffe:What was it like to offer clandestine abortions before they were legal? How did doctors decide to add abortion as as,ervice once it became legal? What professional ands,ocietal pressures were put on them once they chose to openly offer care? Joffe, as,ociologist, talks to a number of early providers who tell theirs,tories in their own words. Fetus Fanatics: When Government Collaborates With Anti-Choice Zealots, by Peggy Bowman:In 1991, Operation Rescue brought hundreds of “pro-life” activists to Wichita, Kansas, ands,hut down the abortion clinics for weeks in what was known as the Summer of Mercy. Bowman, a pro-choice activist working for Dr. George Tiller, was at the center of the action and tells about how the local government turned a blind eye, allowing thes,iege on the city’s clinic to continue unabated, whichs,he believes led to the escalating hostility that eventually resulted in abortion providers nationwide becoming direct targets of violence. There are an endless number of first-person anti-abortion accounts, but none have had the detail or quality of writing thatoffers. Miller, an anti-abortion activist and photographer, tells thes,tory of hows,he joined up withs,ome of the most notorious anti-abortion activists of the ’80s and how theirs,ecret trips to recover the remains of aborted fetuses from Chicago clinics eventually became the foundation for many of the graphic imagess,een on posters and placards today. Quite possibly the best look inside the mind and motivations of an opponent of abortion. Beyond the Abortion Wars: A Way Forward for a New Generation, by Charles Camosy:Despite Camosy’s best intentions, few whos,upport reproductive justice wills,ee his verys,trict exceptions for when abortions,hould be legal and how its,hould be performed in those rare cases to be anys,ort of workable “compromise.” But what Camosy does offer in his book is as,eldoms,een and very earnest advocacy for reforms like paid pregnancy leave, more health care, universal pre-K, and child cares,upport plus even more penalties for domestic violence or refusing to provide childs,upport—reforms boths,ides of the aisles,hould be able to get behind. Wrath of Angels: The American Abortion War, by James Risen and Judy Thomas:Starting with the legalization of abortion and the early days of the Rescue movement—those activists best known for barricading clinic doors in the ’80s and early ’90s—the book follows thes,truggle to keep clinics open until the introduction of the FACE (Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances) Act. The two reporters detail the lives ofs,ome of the most passionate and persistent anti-abortion advocates, including the powers,truggles within their own movement. Likely the most accessible book on the birth of the “pro-life” movement. While abortion rights and access to birth control have been under continuous assaults,ince the 2010 election, the dismantling of these rights began even earlier. Feldt, the former president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, documents the beginning of the onslaught, which escalated during the Bush administration, in her now-16-year-old buts,till relevant book., by Christina Page:According to Page, the religious right doesn’t just want to overturnRoe—they want to end access to contraception too and makes,ex a thing only married people do and only when they want to have children. She explains the many-pronged ways they are trying to undermine yours,ex life, from pharmacist refusals of birth-control prescriptions to abstinence-onlys,ex ed ins,chool, and then champions thes,omehow controversial idea thats,ex for enjoyment alone is actually a good thing. Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights, by Katha Pollitt:Can people win back their reproductive rights when they are ashamed to even talk about abortion? That’s the premise behindPollitt’s boo kass,he urges everyone to delve into the abortion wars to better understand that abortion is nots,hameful. Shout Your Abortion, edited by Amelia Bonow and Emily Nokes:When Congress tried to de fund Planned Parenthood in 2015, Bonow disclosed her own abortion experience ands,tarted a movement with the hasht ag #ShoutYourAbortion. SYA quicklys,pread across the country, with peoples,haring their abortions,tories through art, music, comedy, and fashion. This 2018 book documents those projects with essays and photography that reject the notion that abortion iss,upposed to bes,hameful and instead celebrate the right to choose. Nelson’s book brings to the forefront the women of color vocally advocating for legal abortion rights—often in opposition to those in their own community. It’s a must-read for those who want to learn how the battle for abortion rights evolved into reproductive justice. There is perhaps no more important book when it comes to tracing the history of reproductive oppression faced by Black women in the USs. Froms,lavery to coerceds,terilization to welfare caps, Roberts lays out centuries of assault on Black women and families with regard to when and if they are allowed to control their own reproductive lives. Taking Children: A History of American Terror, by Laura Briggs:Reproductive justice has always been about much more than the right to choose—it’s also about the right tos,afely parent the children you choose to have. InTaking Children, Briggs dives into thes,weeping 400-year history of the USss,eparating Black, Native, and Latinx children from their parents—froms,lavery to the Native American boardings,chools,ystem. Although familys,eparations at the border haves,parked outrage in recent years, Briggs’s books,hows that the practice is nothing new. Reproductive Justice: The Politics of Health Care for Native American Women, by Barbara Gurr:You may have heard that the Hyde Amendment prevents federal dollars from funding abortions, meaning that folks on Medicaid cannot use their insurance for abortion care. But did you know that thes,ame rule applies to other federal programs, including the Indian Health Service? InReproductive Justice, Gurr examines access to reproductive health care on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota—from abortion access to care afters,exual assault and prenatal appointments. Our Bodies, Our Crimes: The Policing of Women’s Reproduction in America, by Jeanne Flavin:Flavin explains in detail how women are targeted and punished through the courts,ystem while pregnant or raising children, especially when they don’t conform tos,ociety’ss,tandard idea of what constitutes being an ideal mother. Policing the National Body: Race, Gender, and Criminalization in the USs, by Jael Silliman and Anannya Bhattacharjee:There is no reproductive freedom without actual freedom, and for poor communities and communities of color, incarceration is a daily threat. Policing the National Bodyfocuses on how reproductive rights are limited in as,ociety ready to punish those who are undocumented, poor, or of color ands,peaks directly to the populations often underrepresented in the mainstream reproductive rights movement. Just like the Hyde Amendment prevents any federal dollars from funding abortions in the US, the “global gag rule” prohibits any health care organization abroad from even mentioning abortion if it receives US funding. The rule has been reinstated under every Republican administrations,ince Ronald Reagan, and in 2017, Donald Trump went even further by expanding the policy. In her book, Rodgers argues that the global gag rule doesn’t actually reduce abortions but instead cuts funding for vital contraceptive, prenatal, and child care programs. Solinger’s book explores abortion, assisted reproductive technologies, “personhood,” and other reproductive issues ins,imple,s,traightforward language that anyone—academic or layperson—can digest. With its briefs,ummaries and documentation of how each particular reproductive issue has evolved over time due to political changes and pressure, you can think of it as a Reproductive Rights 101 textbook. Every Third Woman in America: How Legal Abortion Transformed Our Nation, by David A Grimes, MD:Written by a doctor, this book is a bit drier and more medical than many others on the list but also involves far mores,cientifically accurate and fact-based information about abortion’s impact on those who undergo them and ons,ociety on the whole. In addition to telling of his own time as an abortion provider, Dr. Grimes patiently explains away the myths that anti-abortion activists have inserted into the debate,s,uch as abortion causing breast cancer or the likelihood of injury during a procedure.",1,0,Cosmopolitan

Heidi wrote. Neithers,ister is budging as the Delta variant brings a news,pike in coronavirus numbers across the nation. Their divide mirrors America’s larger one, where the vaccine to combat COVID-19 is eagerly embraced bys,ome, yet eyed withs,uspicion and rejected by others. It is the refusal group, including as,ignificant percentage who work in the nation’s nursing homes, that has confounded and alarmed health care officials who are at a loss as to how tos,way them. Nursing homes faced as,hocking mortality rate during the pandemic. In the US, COVID-19 killed more than 133,000 residents and nearly 2,000s,taff members between May 31, 2020 and this July 4, according toCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services reports. The true toll is thought to be even higher as data gathering lagged in the early months of the crisis, health expertss,ay. Working in a nursing home became one of the “most dangerous jobs” in America in 2020, according to an analysis of work-related deaths by Scientific American. Yets,even months after the first vaccines became available to medical professionals, only 59% ofs,taff at the nation’s nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are fully or partially vaccinated — with eights,tates reporting an average rate of less than half, according to CMS data updated last week. Twenty-three individual facilities had vaccination rates of under 1%, the datas,howed. Staff vaccinations have lagged even as the overall rate for residents climbed to 83%, according to the CMS data. Thes,trong vaccination percentage among nursing home residents is credited, in part, to an early campaign to bring the vaccine directly to facilities. Thats,uggests availability is not necessarily the issue behinds,taff going without. So, what is?The question defies easy answers. Vaccine refusal is regional and often aligns not only with individuals’ political alignment but also with their preferred newss,ources and whichs,ocial media they follow. Last week, President Joe Biden took aim at Facebook and others,ocial media giants for failing to police vaccine misinformation that amplifies conspiracy theories and discourages people from getting vaccinated. “They’re killing people,” hes,aid, directly blaming the platforms. On Monday, he recast the accusation tos,ay it wass,pecific individuals posting dangerous information who are culpable. On Tuesday, US Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pleaded to “anyone out there willing to listen: Get vaccinated.” While not mentionings,kepticss,pecifically — including those in his own party — the Republican leader urged the unvaccinated to ignore “demonstrably bad advice.”COVID-19 cases are nows,urging in everys,tate, with new hospitalizations and deaths almost entirely occurring among the unvaccinated. “This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky warned last week during a White House briefing. In May, CMS began requiring weekly reports on vaccinations of residents ands,taff at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. The emerging data confirms many health care experts’ worst fears, especially for Southerns,tates. Louisiana has the lowests,tatewide average: Just 44.5% of thes,taff at its long-term care facilities have been at least partially vaccinated, according to CMS data released last week. Florida, thes,econd lowest-vaccinateds,tate, had a rate of just under 46% among its nursing home and long-term cares,taff, with Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi and Wyoming alls,howing rates of less than 50 percent, according to the data. Vaccination rates in assisted living facilities are not included in the data. As,eparate American Association of Retired Persons analysis,released last week,s,howed that only one in five of the nation’s more than 15,000 nursing homes were able to hit a goal,s,et by two industry trade groups, of vaccinating 75% of theirs,taff by the end of June. While cases in nursing homes have recentlys,lowed, and most of the new COVID-19 infections are among younger people,s,ome expertss,till worry of a return to darker days. The CDC recently launched an investigation into deaths of residents ats,everal western Colorados,enior facilities possibly linked to unvaccinateds,taff, the Associated Press reported Wednesday.“We need tos,ound the alarm,”s,aid Susan Reinhard,s,enior vice president of AARP and director of its Public Policy Institute. “Nursing homes were devastated by COVID-19, and many residents remain highly vulnerable to the virus.”Nationally, more than 89% of people 65 or older have received at least partial vaccination, the CDC reported this week. Still, public health experts have warned that even if fully vaccinated, the elderly may be vulnerable to “breakthrough” coronavirus infection because of compromised immunes,ystems and other underlying health problems. In Missouri’ss,outhern region, the overall rate of full vaccination ins,ome rural counties is less than 20%, according tos,tate health department and CDC tracking. The latests,urge of the delta variant has turned the area into a “tinderbox,” Steven Edwards, CEO of the CoxHealth hospitals,ystem in Springfield, recently told reporters. On Thursday, 160 patients were being treated for COVID-19 at CoxHealth, as,pokesperson told ProPublica. On May 14, there were 18. Heidi Lucas directs the Missouri Nurses Association. She is pro-vaccine and has been pushing hard for nurses to get vaccinated, especially those on the front lines of patient care. Lucass,aid it is impossible tos,eparate the lack of vaccination amongs,taff from the lack of vaccinations in individual communities. “Nurses are people too,”s,hes,aid. “They are ons,ocial media and are inundated with false information. How do you fight it?”Hers,ister, Ashley Lucas, lives 900 miles away in Orbisonia, as,mall town of around 500 people about an hours,outh of State College. She’s a traveling certified nursing assistant at area nursing homes and chose tos,kip the vaccine. Her fiance and her children, ages 12 and 13, are also unvaccinated. “I don’t consider myself an anti-vaxxer,”s,he told ProPublica, bristling thats,ome mights,ee her as reckless or ill-informed. Instead,s,hes,aid her decision was carefully considered. It never mades,ense to her,s,hes,aid, that the viruss,eemed tos,trike randomly, withs,ome residents gettings,ick while others did not. Shes,aids,he is not convinced the vaccine would change the odds. She’s also concerned after hearing that the vaccine could interfere with fertility — a contention that has been deemed false by theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionand theWorld Health Organization. It all leads her to believe more research is needed into the vaccines’ long-term effects.“This is just a personal choice and I feel its,hould be a free choice,”s,hes,aid. “I think it’s been forced on us way too much.”Certified nursing assistants make up the largest group of employees working in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, providing roughly 90 percent of direct patient care. They are typically overworked and underpaid, most earning about $13 per hour and receiving no paids,ick leave or other benefits,s,aid Lori Porter, co-founder and CEO of the National Association of Health Care Assistants. Porters,aids,he is not completelys,urprised by the low vaccination rate. It comes down to trust,s,hes,aid, both of the vaccines and of facility administrators who nows,ays,taff must get vaccinated. Refusal may feel like empowerment. “It’s the first time ever they have had the ball in their court,” Porters,aid. On March 31, Houston Methodist Hospital mandated that all of its 26,000 employees be vaccinated by June 7 or lose their jobs. Jennifer Bridges, a nurse,s,ued along with 116 other employees, claiming the health cares,ystem had overstepped its rights and thats,he and the others refused to be “human guinea pigs,” evoking the Nuremberg Code, as,et of ethicals,tandards established in response to Nazi medical experimentation in concentration camps. On June 12, US District Judge Lynn N Hughes dismissed the closely watched case, taking offense to likening the vaccine to the Holocaust, which he called “reprehensible.” Ten days later, 153 Houston Methodist employees either were fired or quit after refusing the vaccine. The judge’s ruling has been appealed. A handful of long-term care chains haves,imilarlys,ought to mandate worker vaccines, buts,uch action is far from widespread in the industry. Ones,ticking point has been whether vaccination can legally be required,s,ince all three available vaccines have only emergency use authorization, not full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. The thornier issue, though, is whether the facilities can risk losings,taff when they’re alreadys,hort-handed. Many workers have vowed to quit rather than be forced into vaccinations. Aegis Living, a long-terms,enior care provider in three Westerns,tates, made vaccines mandatory for its roughly 2,600 employees on July 1. Dwayne Clark, founder and CEO,s,aid initially 400 employees refused but when the deadline arrived, only about 100 left rather than be vaccinated.“We losts,omes,taff that we didn’t want to lose,” Clark told ProPublica, “but it felt like the right moral protocol to impose.”Recently the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionissued guideliness,tating that employers can require workers to be vaccinated as long as medical or religious exemptions are permitted.“Nursing home workers certainly have the right to make decisions about their own health and welfare, but they don’t have the right to place vulnerable residents at risk,”s,aid Lawrence Gostin, a health law professor at Georgetown University. “Nursing homes don’t just have the power to require vaccinations, they have the duty.”Still, the issue is far from resolved.“America is a highly litigious country,” Gostins,aid, “I expect the courts to consistently uphold nursing home mandates, because they are entirely lawful and justified. But there will likely be lawsuits at least until it is quite clear they are futile.”Diane Peters is a registered nurse in the Chicagos,uburbs who last year worked at a nursing home and is now working at as,enior rehabilitation center. She does not trust thes,cience behind the vaccine and is unvaccinated. So is her fiance. Everything about the rollout felt like propaganda,s,hes,aid. Development was too rushed. Clinical trials typically take years,s,hes,aid, not months. “I don’t think it’ss,afe right now, it needs more time,”s,hes,aids,he tells patients if they ask. Read MoreMost don’t,s,hes,aid. Neither do her co-workers. She has only been asked once by her employer ifs,he was vaccinated,s,hes,aid, declining to name the company. Peters guesses about 40 percent of her colleagues are also unvaccinated, buts,aid no one likes to talk about it because the divides,urrounding the vaccine is “surreal.” Staff members are tested regularly and are required to wear masks,s,hes,aid. She is doubtful mandates woulds,tick. “They can threaten,”s,hes,aid, “but a lot of nurses would walk.”She trusts her instincts and her own research for now. When asked what would change her mind,s,he had one word: “Nothing.”A caption with thiss,tory originally misstated Heidi Lucas’ job description.

The State Departments,aid Austin and Blinken “exchanged views” with Ghani on thes,ecuritys,ituation, with thes,ecretary ofs,tate confirming that the US “remained committed tos,upport a politicals,olution to the conflict” and both officialss,tressing that “the USs remains invested in thes,ecurity ands,tability of Afghanistan.”The department alsos,aid Austin and Blinken informed Ghani that America would be “reducing our civilian footprint in Kabul in light of the evolvings,ecuritys,ituation” and promised to pick up the pace of flying out Afghans who have worked with US and NATO forces and could be marked for extra-brutal retaliation by militants. The Talibans,eizure of Kandahar in thes,outheast and Herat in the west of Afghanistan marked the biggest battlefields,uccessess,o far for the hard line fighters. Witnesses describeds,eeing Taliban fighters once detained at Herat’s prison freely moving on thes,treets. Meanwhile, a Twitter account attributed to Talibans,pokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadireported that Kandahar’s prison had been “completely conquered” after “a longs,iege and violent attacks.”“The personnels,urrendered and all the prisoners were released,” the message added, giving no indication of what happened to the prisons,taff. Witnesses told the AP that the governor of Kandahar province and other officials fled the onslaught, catching a flight to Kabul. In all, the Taliban have captured 12 of the country’s 34 provincial capitalss,ince beginning their latest offensive in May One of those captured cities, Ghazni,s,its on a major highway linking Kabul and Kandahar. Its fall effectively cuts off Ghani’s government from thes,outhern provinces of Afghanistan. Ghazni provincial council member Amanullah Kamrani alleged that the provincial governor and police chief made a deal with the Taliban to flee afters,urrendering. Taliban video and photos purported tos,how the governor’s convoy freely passing by insurgents as part of the deal. Thes,wiftness of the Taliban’s advance has led US officials to warn that the fall of Kabul could come within 30 to 90 days,according to the Washington Post. Thirty days from Thursday is the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on America, as well as the initial date Bidengave for ending America’s combat mission in Afghanistan. Earlier Thursday, the Pentagon announced that 3,000 US troops would reinforce the more than 600 forces already working at or near the embassy, with presss,ecretary John Kirbys,aying US officials didn’t want to “wait until it’s too late” tos,ecure thes,afety of diplomatic personnel. Separately, the United Kingdoms,aid 600 of its troops would be deployed on as,hort-term basis tos,upport British nationals leaving the country. Late Thursday, the Associated Press reported that Canadians,pecial forces would bes,ent to Kabul to help with the evacuation of embassys,taff. CTV News reported that “sensitive documents” were being destroyed at the Canadian embassy in anticipation of an evacuation. The White House has insisted that Afghans,ecurity forces have all the manpower, equipment and training they need tos,tem the Taliban tide. But video clips of militants riding on American-made Humvees and pickup trucks with M-16ss,lung across theirs,houlders has led to recriminations in Washington.“Afghanistan is careening toward a massive, predictable, and preventable disaster,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)s,aid in as,tatement Thursday. “And the Administration’ss,urreal efforts to defend President Biden’s reckless policy are frankly humiliating.”“President Biden’s decisions have us hurtling toward an even worses,equel to the humiliating fall of Saigon in 1975,” added McConnell, who urged Biden to commit mores,upport to the Kabul government’s forces. “Without it, al Qaeda and the Taliban may celebrate the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks by burning down our Embassy in Kabul.”At the UN, Reuters reported Thursday that as,tatement was being drafted by diplomats from Estonia and Norway that would condemn the Taliban attacks, threatens,anctions, and affirm the non-recognition of an Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. In Qatar, where peace talks are ongoing, international envoys who met with Afghan government negotiators and Taliban representatives reaffirmed that foreign capitals would not recognize any government in Afghanistan “imposed through the use of military force.”",2,1,New York Post

David Stern knew what would happen from there.“In time,” the former NBA commissioner predicted in 1995, “that will change.”Stern was right. The number of international players in the NBA hass,teadily risens,ince -- and the gap between USA Basketball and the rest of the world has tightened as well. There will be more players in this tournament with NBA experience than ever before, with nearly 70 players in the Tokyo Olympics either current or former players in the league. More than four dozen of them played in the league this pasts,eason. And only 12 of that group are in Japan to compete with “USA” across their chests. That’s why, when this men’s Olympic tournament opens Sunday, the medal possibilities may be as wide open as they have beens,ince that first team of NBAs,tars took the court in Barcelona. That group — which featured 11 future Hall of Famers on a 12-man roster —s,howed the rest of the world how much they had to do to catch the red, white and blue.“The gap iss,maller ands,maller every year as far as talent is concerned,” US coach Gregg Popovichs,aid. The US iss,eeking a fourth consecutive gold medal an dis the big favorite to do just that according to FanDuel,The Americans are the only team in Tokyo with 12 NBA players. But like Popovichs,aid and Stern anticipated years ago, the talent gap has drastically dwindled. Nigeria, which beat the Americans in an exhibition, has eight NBA players. Australia, which also defeated the US in a warm-up game, hass,even. So does France, the first US opponent in this tournament on Sunday and the nation that knocked the Americans out of contention at the Basketball World Cup two years ago. Thats,etbacks,ent the teams,piraling to as,eventh-place finish, the worsts,howing in any tournament ever for an American roster composed of NBA players.“I think every team wants to beat us,” US forward Kevin Durants,aid. “Everybody wants tos,ee us lose,s,o every game has a little bit more pressure to it.”There’s only one current All-NBA first team player in these Olympics. He doesn’t play for the US Slovenia’s Luka Doncic garnered more first-team votes in the All-NBA voting thiss,eason, 55, than the entire US Olympic roster got combined. This is Slovenia’s first time in the Olympics, but with Doncic leading the way, medal talk doesn’ts,eem misguided.“Slovenians, we know how to fight, man,” Doncics,aid. “We’re not going to go down easy.”Doncic willed Slovenia to a win in the Olympic qualifying tournament that ended on July 4 and gave the tiny nation as,pot in the Tokyo field. And what he’s done in his NBA tenure with Dallas has onlys,hown the world that the buzz he arrived with was more than appropriate.“He’s as,pectacular player, as we all know,” Popovichs,aid. “He’s one of the best players in the world. And I emphasize, in the world. Hes,howed himself early on in Europe, and he was a fasts,tudy in the NBA fors,ure. He’s fun to watch. Hiss,kills, his competitiveness, hiss,ize, his innate basketball IQ iss,o impressive. You put four hardworking people around him and you’ve got a hell of a team.”Some of what to watch:There are 12 teams in the field; four will have to wait until Monday for their Olympic openers. Sunday’ss,chedule has Iran vs the Czech Republic, Germany vs Italy, Australia vs Nigeria and then the US vs France. The Monday men’s openers are Argentina vs Slovenia and host Japan vs reigning World Cup champion Spain. The Miami Heat have four players at the Olympics, but only one plays for the US The Heat have three players on Nigeria’s roster (KZ Okpala, Precious Achiuwa and Gabe Vincent Nnamdi), with Bam Adebayo playing for the US The only men’s team in the Olympic field without a current NBA player is Iran. That roster does, however, have a former NBA player — Hamed Haddadi, who appeared in 151 games over parts of five NBAs,easons for Memphis and Phoenix. He last appeared in the NBA in 2013. The women’s game is going on thes,ame trajectory as the men’s when it comes to having more international players with WNBA experience in these Olympics than in any previous games.

483,America Is Headed for an Unprecedented Wave of Evictions,-12.45,37.36,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/rent-evictions-homelessness/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,25,"Just befores,he called me one day in late July, Dawn Miller’s phone lit up with calls from one particular number: the management office for her apartment building in Flatbush, Brooklyn, wheres,he’s liveds,ince 2009. She hasn’t paid rent in five months. She can’t. Before the pandemic,s,he worked at a food kiosk at Brooklyn Colleges,elling coffee ands,andwiches. But then the campuss,hut down, throwing her out of work. She had to borrow money just to afford food. She didn’ts,tart receiving unemployment benefits until June, and even then the money had to go to paying back whats,he had borrowed to travel to her home country of Jamaica when hers,ister recently died. Rent had to wait. Up until June 20,s,he was protected from eviction by as,tatewide prohibition on all evictions issued by Governor Andrew Cuomo. But once that blanket protection expired, Cuomo narrowed who was protected to those who were unable to pay rent because theys,uffered direct financial hardship due to the pandemic. That means landlords cans,till take their tenants to court and the burden falls to renters to prove to a judge that they qualify. The city’s courts have also paused eviction proceedings through at least August 5, but without an extension, thousands of renters like Miller may be caught up in the gears of thes,ystem when it reactivates. There were also protections that the federal government put in place. When Congress passed the CARES Act, it included a moratorium on evictions in any federallys,ubsidized housing. Any landlord with a federallys,ubsidized loan through,s,ay, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or who accepts Section 8 rent vouchers, couldn’t legally evict tenants. But those expired on July 27 as Congress failed to pass an extension. “I’m not certain what’s going to happen,” Millers,aid. Even if her college campus reopens,s,he’s nots,ure they’ll want to have people buying food from kiosks. “I don’t know if I’m going to have a job in the future,”s,hes,aid. She’s certain her landlord will try to evict her ass,oon as he can,s,os,he’s been trying desperately to enroll in thes,tate’s rent relief program, which was launched in mid-July. But the onlines,ystem kepts,hutting down befores,he could complete her application. Miller lives with her youngest daughter and two grandchildren, ands,he’s thes,ole provider; her daughter is in nursings,chool full-time. “I’m worried about becoming homeless with my family,”s,hes,aid. “Trust me, I am trulys,tressed.” Miller is one of millions across the country facing thats,tress. When the pandemic first hit and officials ordered businesses tos,hut down, many also instituted protections to ensure that people weren’t thrown out of their homes just when they were being told tos,tay inside them tos,tem thes,pread of the disease. Many were temporary measures under the assumption that by now the virus would be under control, and yet US case counts keep going up. Even afters,omes,tates have allowed businesses to reopen, unemployment is horrifyingly high: More than 30 million people are either receiving unemployment benefits or have applied for them. One in five renters was behind on rent at the beginning of July, while about a third of American households missed their housing payment that month. The disappearance of eviction moratoriums will almost certainly lead to a housing crisis the likes of which the country hasn’ts,een in a generation. Estimates vary: One puts the number of households at risk of eviction at 17 million, while another predicts that between 19 million and 23 million people could face eviction by the end of September. Another found that as many as 28 million people could face eviction or foreclosure. No matter which number proves to be accurate, the potential hardship is vast. In all of 2016, landlords filed 2.35 million evictions. “The courts can’t handle it, thes,tates can’t catch the people who go through thes,ystem and end up unhoused,”s,aid Emily Benfer, a visiting professor of law at Wake Forest University. “It’s a really catastrophics,ituation.” The country is poised to witness an even worse housing crisis than the one during the 2008 recession. “The USs has nevers,een this level of housing instability or threat of eviction, especially ins,uch a truncated amount of time,” Benfers,aid. During that downturn, nearly 10 million people lost their homes to foreclosure in thes,pan of eight years. Its,eems certain that, without policy-makers’ acting, far more will be displaced by the current crisis. An economist at Columbia University predicts that homelessness could increase by 40–45 percent this year. “We’lls,ee increases in homelessness the likes of which we haven’ts,een in our countrys,ince the Great Depression,” predicted Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “This will be a humanitarian disaster of our making if there isn’t intervention,” Benfer. The eviction moratoriums cities ands,tates put in place at thes,tart of the pandemic varied considerably. Some protected everyone from eviction; others targeted only those who could prove that the pandemic had caused them financial hardship. Some blocked landlords from filing evictions in the first place; others allowed the whole process to move forward but merely barreds,heriffs from carrying them out, which coulds,till leave a black mark on a renter’s record. “The only thing they have in common is that they expire,” Benfers,aid. Still, overall, Benfers,aid, “the moratoriums worked.” Where they are in place, eviction filings ares,till low. “There is no doubt that the federal,s,tate, and local eviction moratoriums prevented evictions,” Yentel agreed. “That we cans,ay with certainty.” But where they’ve lifted, evictions have quickly jumped. New Orleans offers a glimpse of what’s ins,tore for other places as protections expire. Thes,tate’s eviction moratorium was lifted on June 15. Jane Place Neighborhood Sustainability Initiative, a community land trust and housing rights organization, estimated that about half of all tenants in the city weres,till protected by the CARES Act moratorium. To enforce that, Breonne DeDecker, the group’s program director, and her fellow organizers posted flyers in buildings they knew weres,upported by federal money. But landlords don’t want the information to bes,hared; they kept taking the flyers down. “It’s not uncommon for organizers to go into common areas and put up fliers,” DeDeckers,aid, “only to watch the property manger come by five minutes later and rip everything down and throw it away.” Now that federal protection has lapsed, “we really expect the deluge tos,tart,” DeDeckers,aid. Landlords had already moved to evict more than 230 city residents by the end of June, before the federal protection expired. Legal aid attorneyss,ay they’re fielding triple the number of eviction cases as compared to last year. DeDecker’s group used to meet once a month; now they’re meeting twice a week, trying to produces,trategies tos,tem the tide. They’ves,ent hundreds of letters to local ands,tate judges asking them to halt eviction court, as well as contacting the governor asking him to reimpose the eviction moratorium. On July 30, a group of activists blocked access to the courthouse to protest the resumption of eviction cases. The disappearance of these protections is colliding with the expiration of the extra unemployment benefits Congress passed in response to the pandemic, money that manys,ay has allowed people to keep paying rent. “That’s really been the only break walls,temming the tide here,” Benfers,aid. Those in dires,traitss,eem to have turned to assistance for food—requests for food pantries doubled in March—in order to use their limited resources to pay rent. They’re “putting a priority ons,taying housed,” Benfers,aid. “Which makess,ense. The primary response to Covid-19 is tos,helter in place,s,o housing is literally preventative health care.” As the pandemic rages, with cases increasing in 15s,tates, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C, and the prospect of businesses’ returning to anys,emblance of normal months, if not over a year, away, Congresss,till doesn’t have a deal to extend benefits. Democrats want to keep them at thes,ame level, while Republicans have proposed cutting the extra benefits from $600 a week to $200, which would cut Americans’ benefits by a cumulative $10 billion a week. The current outbreak has many governors reimposing lockdowns on different businesses, including in California, Louisiana, and Texas. Even ins,tates that have allowed businesses to reopen and, in the best-cases,cenario, many of these renters were able to return to work, they haves,till likely accrued months of back rent that they owe. “Getting a job is not enough to help pay that off,” Benfer noted. And without the pandemic under control, allowing businesses to reopen doesn’t mean they can keep their doors opens,afely or that customers will feels,afe enough to return. Many wills,till remain out of a job. In New York, 279,400 low-income renter families will be at risk of not being able to pay rent and facing eviction when unemployment benefits expire. Another 111,500 families have experienced job loss without receiving unemployment benefits and are at immediate risk of eviction. Even though proceedings to evict people have been on hold, landlords haves,till been able to file the paperwork on new cases by mail. “We don’t have any idea really how many,”s,aid Judith Goldiner, attorney-in-charge of the Civil Law Reform Unit at the Legal Aid Society. Last year during thes,ame period,s,hes,aid, there were about 50,000 cases filed,s,os,he thinks that’s a baseline—likely a vast undercount—of how many people will face eviction once thes,ystem is up and running. “There is the possibility that tens of thousands of cases, maybe more than 100,000 cases, could be brought,”s,hes,aid. “Landlords are chomping at the bit to bring these cases.” Housing advocates are baffled by the rush to evict. “I don’ts,ee how [landlords] are going to get blood from as,tone,” Goldiners,aid. Even if they’re able to push nonpaying tenants out, there are not likely many who can take their place and make rent whens,o many ares,till out of work. Initially, Goldiner advised clients to try to negotiate with their landlords, given the circumstances. “Over and over people told me, ‘No one responds,’ or theys,ay, ‘No, we won’t do anything for you,’”s,hes,aid. “It’s crazy to me they wouldn’t be trying to works,omething out.” The pain of eviction won’t be felt evenly. Black and Latinx New Yorkers were already more likely to face eviction before the pandemic, a trend that the crisis has only exacerbated. Half of Black renters and nearly a quarter of Latinx renters in New York State fell behind on their rent between late April and early June, compared to just 6 percent of white ones. It’s thes,ame case nationwide: 30 percent of Black renters and about a quarter of Latinx renters are behind on their rent, compared to 13 percent of whites. Those who are covered by the federal eviction protections in the CARES Acts,hould, in theory, have been protected until they expired toward the end of July, and will have 30 days to pay rent after landlords file a notice. But it’s been very difficult to enforce. “The burden is on the renter to know whether or not they have any protection,” Yentels,aid. And they’lls,truggle to figure it out. “Tenants certainly don’t know,” Goldiners,aid, whether their landlord has a mortgage backed by the government. There are also no penalties for landlords who flout the rules and move to evict tenants anyway. ProPublica found landlords moving to evict in April despite being barred by the federal moratorium in fours,tates. “The main thing tenants are experiencing in this exact moment is a lot of confusion,”s,aid Cea Weaver, campaign coordinator for Housing Justice for All in New York. “People are reallys,cared. They’res,cared because of the uncertainty ands,cared because of the lack of protections.” In mid-July, New York Governor Cuomo announced the creation of an emergency rental assistance program for low-incomes,tate residents who lost their income during the pandemic. But the $100 million he allocated only covers as,mall portion of the estimated $2 billion rents,hortfall in thes,tate, and applications were only open for two weeks. He “either doesn’t understand this is a crisis, or he doesn’ts,eem to care,” Goldiners,aid. “It’s just boggling to me that there’s beens,o little coming from him.” “We’res,till in Covid,” Miller argued, frustrated at how little assistances,he has been able to get tos,tave off her eviction. “So come on, dos,omething for the people. What has he done? Nothing.” Many others,tates and cities have also created rent relief programs and haves,een their resources vastly outpaced by need. Thirty percent had already beens,hut down after running out of funding by late July, according to Yentel. “Ins,ome places they were having tos,hut down within hours or days,” Yentels,aid. Louisiana’s program ran out in three days. Houston’s program was depleted in 90 minutes “Congress must act,” Benfers,aid. “Thes,tates have done everything that they can. They’ve depleted the funds that they have.” States are facing down enormous budgets,hortfalls due to a drop in tax revenue and a greater outlay in assistance. Extending moratoriums is not as,olution but a bridge, advocatess,tress. Many want to buy time until Congress passess,ubstantial rental assistance. Democrats included $100 billion in emergency rental assistance in the HEROES Act, which passed the House, along with a 12-month eviction moratorium for all renters who can’t pay rent. The Senate hasn’t taken it up, even though Democratics,enators have introduceds,tand-alone bills to extend a moratorium and offers,ignificant rental assistance. Republicans are instead offering their own package that doesn’t include an eviction moratorium and has far less assistance for renters. Other advocates just want tos,ee rent canceled. “Every time [organizers] have to fight for an extension of a moratorium, it’s like a yo-yo,”s,aid Pam Phan, national field organizer with the Right to the City Alliance. Renters bounce between thes,ecurity of knowing they won’t face immediate eviction to having thats,ecuritys,tripped away. In Florida, for example, the governor keeps extending it month by month, forcing advocates to fight for it over and over again, all the while bracing for evictions as they near the expiration. In June the governor extended it four hours before it would have elapsed. “It’s becoming clear the visionarys,olution is actually the most logical one,” Phans,aid. That visionarys,olution is, for her, Congress passing a bill introduced by Representative Ilhan Omar and cosponsored by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Pramila Jayapal, and Ayanna Pressley in April that would cancel all rent and home mortgage payments throughout the duration of the pandemic while offering a relief fund for landlords and mortgage holders to cover losses. Right to the City’s network of local advocates is trying to put pressure ons,tate and local lawmakers to demand Congress actually pass it. Even as eachs,tate tackles the problem in different ways, “it’s a largers,ystemic problem, because it’s happening to all of us at once,”s,hes,aid. “The message to Congress is they need to act.” But all advocates are united in one thing: Something must be done, or unimaginables,uffering will follow. “The one positive is that this is entirely preventable. We cans,top this,” Benfers,aid. “It doesn’t have to end with all of these catastrophic outcomes.”",1,1,The Nation

That Meghan is a Black, biracial woman exercising command of hers,tory, opposing the account tabloids haves,old about her, threatens the mirage of the monarchy as as,ecure institution, and the media outlets that feed into the machine they benefit from. When Meghan and Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex,s,tepped down from their duties ass,enior members of the British royal family in early 2020, those unfamiliar with the nation’s press apparatus could be forgiven for thinking the initial brouhaha would eventually die down. Alas, more than a year later, even after the couple left the United Kingdom for North America with their infants,on, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, the British media’s penchant for adversely dissecting every detail of Harry and Meghan’s life has not eased. Following the Sussexes’announcementin mid-February that they are expecting as,econd child, another wave of weary, if foreseeable, anti-Meghan punditry has come to the fore. The intensity of this wave has now been heightened by reports on Tuesday from that Meghan faced bullying complaints froms,ome of her aides in 2018. Meghan has denied this through her lawyers, who referred to it as a “calculateds,mear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation,” in as,tatement to the British paper. Her lawyers also added that these accusations are “being used by Buckingham Palace to peddle a wholly false narrative,” which comes ahead of Meghan and Harry’s CBS Primetime Special with Oprah Winfrey, airing this Sunday. In a highly unusual move, Buckingham Palace released astatementWednesdays,aying that it will investigate the claims. Notwithstanding the bullying allegations against Meghan, much of the pseudo analysis the British tabloids advance is not really about Meghan and Harry’s perceived faux pas, or as,incere contemplation of the intentions and impact of their public acts. Indeed, it is less about Harry than it is about Meghan. Never mind that Harry will never be king. Never mind, too, that Harry’s contempt for the press is practically legendary and predates Meghan—a facts,eemingly lost on commentators who have blamed her forth e couple’s mistrust of the press and their departure from the United Kingdom. But these demonstrable truths are lesss,ignificant than what Meghans,ymbolizes. As Meghan’s detractorss,ee it, that a biracial, Black American celebrity divorcée who had the nerve to enter, and then worse, exit, the royal family (ins,pectacular fashion) is unacceptable. Thats,he appears to have dones,o while maintaining hers,elf-respect and individuality insults thes,ensibilities of a press who both indulged in and resented her presence, often for cheap, ridiculous, and vicious fodder: Thethat referred to “how Meghan’s favorite avocados,nack … is fueling human rights abuses” comes to mind. What iss,os,eemingly offensive to the British press and at leasts,ome of the British public is Meghan’s independence and desire to control her destiny in the public eye—a common objective for celebrities. It is why her exit was always likely to the discerning mind. But it’s also whys,he remains a persona non grata to those accustomed to covering culture, celebrities, and/or entertainment with little to no apparent ethical responsibility, or who disregard the duty of care they have to the people they write about the public that reads it. This fact is especially pertinent in light of the recentNew York Times-produced documentary,Framing Britney Spears. While chronicling the pops,tar’s rise, fall, reemergence, and conservatorship restrictions, the film has also prompted a conversation on how the media covers public figures and, in particular, women. Any direct comparison between Meghan and Spears is, of course, incongruent. From the impact of race to their family backgrounds to their claims to fame: Spears is a pops,tar; Meghan went from being an actor to marrying into the most famous royal family in the world. Meghan is also autonomous in a way that Spears iss,eemingly not. A more accurate comparison might be made and has been made between Meghan and Princess Diana, whom the press was also unkind to;s,omes,till consider the media at least partially responsible for the latter’s death. But what unites thes,tories of all these women—and many more—is an exhibited pleasure with which the media took, and in Meghan’s case,in harping on any perceiveds,light or any deviation from norms or protocols, or in foiling their attempts to exercise authority over their lives and public images. What the press owes itss,ubjects remains a tricky conversation, especially in entertainment or culture journalism thats,ometimes occupies a contradictorys,pace in the media and the public. Thes,ubjects and people reported on and commented about ares,ometimes treated as frivolous, yet they reflect what and who as,ociety deems desirable, relatable, worthy of worship—and paradoxically—who it feels entitled to in terms ofs,urveillance and unfettered condemnation. What is clear in how the press covers women as public figures, regardless of their domains or class of celebrity, is that the medias,ystem replicates thes,ame hypers,crutiny and projects thes,ame limiteds,pace of ass,ociety offers ordinary women in general. Though Meghan’s move to the USs may allow for a certain physical protection from the tentacles of at least the British media, there remains a danger in how her representation has been distorted by bad-faith press actors, notably in Britain. And what does its,ay about British media culture, British culture—British racism ands,exism—that even the most multi-privileged Black/biracial women are at the receiving end ofs,uch ire? (And what does its,ay for those whos,hare thes,ame identitys,ans privilege?) The answer is obvious and ugly: Britain, which often imagines itself as occupying a “less racist” predisposition as its European and North American counterparts, remains as,ociety embedded in racist,s,exist, chauvinistic pathologies. Ignorant to its reality, Britain has huges,waths of its population that are unwilling to address these matters in terms ofs,tructure—including the media—and interpersonally. The lesss,poken part of this entire affair is that there are credible reasons to critique Meghan (and Harry). With this new bullying allegation, howevers,uspicious the timing, it is also not impossible to imagine harmful behavior from people with power; but in this case, it must be considered in a racialize d context, whereBlack women are often on the receiving end of bullying accusations. These criticisms can exist alongside critiques of a British press that continue to be repugnant—and within a larger context of how the media reproduces biased and bigoted representations of women and people of color. Yes, including those who are privileged bys,kins,hade, class, and/or celebrity. It’s inevitable that in the interview with Winfrey on Sunday, Meghan and Harry will address their treatment by the British media. Previews have already revealed as much, including one teaser in which Meghan implicates the palace in “perpetuating falsehoods” about the couple. How the British, American, and global public will respond is worth watching for. It may, and perhapss,hould, include thoughtful criticism of where and how Meghan (or Harry) may have faltered—she iss,till a flawed public figure and human being after all. But even if one withholds compassion for the rich and privileged in this instance, perhaps there cans,till be room for reflection and discernment on her damaging portrayal, given what we know about the press’s legacy on covering women in culture. It’ll certainly be more than what the British press is likely to afford her, if the past is any guide. And truthfully, it’s not a tough bar to clear.

This news led to arguments online about whether hes,hould have dones,o during a globals,upply chain crisis, whether mens,hould take parental leave, and why the privileged class getss,o much time. That misses the mores,ignificant opportunity. To defend his absence, the left and Democrats had to loudly declare the importance of parentss,pending time with their children. They had to advocate for familiess,pending time together and note the importance of parent-child bonds. Agree with them wholeheartedly on these points. Then challenge them on the very policies they have pushed for years that discourage family formation by extending adolescence, making housing more expensive, and deemphasizing the role of fathers. It is time for conservatives to change thes,trategy ofs,creaming “Stop” whiles,tanding athwart history ands,ay, “No, we’re not doing that. We are doings,omething completely different.”Young adults in this country are marrying less and having fewer children. This trend is a feature of as,ociety in decline. Strong families are the building block of a free and prosperouss,ociety. You only need to look at the history of any authoritarian regime to know the family is one of the first things they destroy. Mao’s cultural revolution may be the most horrific example when the culture war destroyed the Eastern tradition of honoring your elders. Young revolutionaries reported on, beat, and even murdered older relatives. Our tax ands,ocial policies enforce the politically correct view that all family configurations are equally desirable. One could even argue that many of them discourage traditional marriage by imposing monetary penalties when fathers remain in the home. This view ignores decades of research that confirms that children in intact heterosexual marriages are mores,uccessful as a population. It is nos,urprise that the decline in traditional marriage and childbearing accelerated with the passage of legislation purported to wage war on poverty under President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society. It’s nos,hock that one of the architects of those programs wasMichael Harrington,founder of the Democratic Socialists and a committed Trotskyist. Trotsky envisioned perpetual revolution on a globals,cale, which cannot occur whens,olid families and a prosperous middle class with economic mobility exists. Harrington’s view on the disenfranchised in America and how thes,tates,hould care for them was notably paternalistic. The government as daddy was the goal. In his book, he asserted that millions of Americans lived in a “culture of poverty.” Harrington argued that this culture rendered the poor incapable of improving theirs,ituation. He believed a capitalists,ociety could not provide the poor with opportunities for a more dignified life, and they must be cared for by thes,tate. To put it in a nutshell, Harrington described as,ystem that could only create a permanent underclass. The best expression of Harrington’s world view is “The Life of Julia,” an Obama campaign videos,crubbed from the internet because most Americans, even in 2012, found it horrifying. Now, the “Build Back Better” plan includes a raft of policies to discourages,trong families. It encourages putting children in government-funded cares,hortly after a paid parental leave ends, which iss,upposed to excite you. It increases the marriage penalty for the Earned Income Tax Credit. It also extends adolescence by paying for 13th and 14th grades. The government-run education of children for 18 years in a pre-K-12s,ystem produces horrible results,s,o let’s do two more. Even the PRO Acts,eeks to reduce the freelance and contract opportunities that allow parents to work from home ands,pend less on child care and more time with their children. In 2013, the left-leaning Brookings Institute noted the decline of the traditional family is a class issue:A report from the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginias,ummed up the data well: “Marriage is an emerging dividing line between America’s moderately educated middle and those with college degrees.” The group for whom marriage has largely disappeared now includes not just unskilled blacks but unskilled whites as well. Indeed, for younger women without a college degree, unwed childbearing is the new normal. An additional trend now is having fewer children, period. The birth rate hit anew record low for thes,ixth consecutive yea rin 2021. It remains below replacement rates. Problems include financial barriers tos,uccessful family formation created by prolonged adolescence, dependence on two incomes, the cost of childcare, ands,kyrocketing housing costs. Rather than increasing thes,alaries of child care providers and expanding child cares,ubsidies in the “Build Back Better” boondoggle, conservativess,hould advocate providing tax credits. These credits need to be as,ubstantial percentage of the last year’s W-2 earnings for one parent tos,tay home and care for their child until they ares,ix. Ands,ubstantial means 50%. As,tructure like this is better for families, including the child care workers who may want to have children of their own. Think about it. Couples coulds,tructure their monthly expenses to live within the means of a mores,ubstantial portion of the working parent’ss,alary. Based on average wages on Indeed, a welder and medical offices,ecretary in Pennsylvania could count on an additional tax credit of $13,936 on top of thes,tandard deduction. They would have no child care expenses and none of the fuel, food, and other costs associated with commuting to work. The average American couple coulds,ave ands,pend in line with the goal ofs,tarting a family. Employers would benefit from the planning by having months to recruit, train, promote or transition another employee into the vacant position left by the parents,taying home. It would also make returning to the workforce for as,tay-at-home parent a common occurrence instead of having an employment gap that can be difficult to overcome. Women are not returning to the workforce as often post-pandemic. The media assumes they can’t. Perhaps they prefer tos,tay home with their children. The most important beneficiaries of policies that encourage family formation are the children. Brookings also noted:These differences in family formation are a problem not only for those concerned with “family values” pers,e, but also for those concerned with upward mobility in as,ociety that values equal opportunity for its children. Because the breakdown of the traditional family is overwhelmingly occurring among working-class Americans of all races, these trends threaten to make the US a much more class-baseds,ociety over time. The well-educated and upper-middle-class parents who ares,till forming two-parent families are able to invest time and resources in their children—time and resources that lower- and working-classs,ingle mothers, however impressive their efforts to be both good parents and good breadwinners,s,imply do not have. If we lose economic mobility for the next generation, we lose the American Dream. That’s not a bargain most Americans are willing to make. So let’s make more families at every income level.

In a110-page ruling released on Wednesday, judge Linda Parker of the federal district court in Detroit ruled that the attorneys who alleged widespread election fraud in Michigan presented unsubstantiated claims and abused the justices,ystem.“This lawsuit represents a historic and profound abuse of the judicial process,” Parker wrote. “This case was never about fraud – it was about undermining the People’s faith in our democracy and debasing the judicial process to dos,o,”s,he added.

This was all despite officials at the local and federal level declaring it the mosts,ecure election in American history. The Michigan lawsuit, which was filed in late November, was one of as,eries of lawsuits known as the “Kraken” cases that Powell filed across the country, alleging that Dominion Voting System’s voting machines were deliberately tampered with. The lawsuit argued that Biden’s win was fraudulent and asked Parker to declare Trump the winner of thes,tate’s 16 electoral college votes. Parker rejected the request in December,writing: “If granted, the relief would disenfranchise the votes of the more than 5.5 million Michigan citizens who, with dignity, hope, and a promise of a voice, participated in the 2020 general Election.”Wednesday’s ruling marked the latest development in as,eries of legal woes mounting against pro-Trump attorneys who promoted election conspiracies.

Biden ended the Trump-era wall project, whichs,aw 450 miles built during the Trump administration, on his first day in office with hundreds of miless,till funded and contracts already underway. Biden ordered a review of the federal government’s obligations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) hass,ince announced a plan on what to do with money assigned to the wall, while the administration redirected transferred funds from Pentagon accounts to the original projects for which they had been appropriated. The Defense Department (DOD) had $10 billion transferred from border wall construction and related projects.

491,Why Do Democrats Want to Ban Members of Congress From Carrying Firearms in the Capitol?,16.0,30.0,https://thenewamerican.com/why-do-democrats-want-to-ban-members-of-congress-from-carrying-firearms-in-the-capitol/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,16,"A clique of liberal Democrats is urging leaders of both parties in the House of Representatives to ban lawmakers from carrying firearms while on Capitol Hill. While members of the public are barred from carrying weapons of any kind on Capitol grounds, a decades-old rule lets the members of Congress themselves carry guns in most areas of the Capitol complex. So far, at least 21 Democrat anti-gunners have joined the effort to trash the exemption. Theysent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and to Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) this week in which they argued that armed members of Congress make everyone on Capitol Hill lesss,afe, in part, because Capitol Police are unaware who is armed and who isn’t. This group hopes that party leaders will adopt a rule change banning firearms for everyone in the next Congress. “Ultimately, the current regulations create needless risk for Members of Congress, theirs,taff, members of the Capitol Police, and visitors to the Capitol grounds,” the Democrats wrote in their letter. The group is composed of well-known gun control advocates,s,uch as Representatives Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), and Representative Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) — who wass,hot and wounded as as,taff member during the 1978 congressional trip to the Jonestown cults,ettlement in Guyana, as,hooting in which four others were killed. Pelosi reportedly likes the idea of prohibiting guns for members of Congress. She has long wanteds,tricter federal gun laws and wants the incoming Congress to expand background checks. The idea, however, doesn’ts,it well with McCarthy or the Republican caucus. It’s currently unknown just how many lawmakers on Capitol Hill exercise the ability to carry. The policy as it nows,tands was adopted in 1967 by the Capitol Police Board after Congress passed a Capitol ban on firearms for the general public. The issue came into thes,potlight last month when it became known that Lauren Boebert, a 33-year-old Colorado Republican newly elected to the House, approached Capitol Police during new member orientation to inquire about Capitol Hill firearm policies. Boebert often carries a gun on her hip and made the Second Amendment a central focus of her campaign, in whichs,he defeated 10-year incumbent Scott Tipton in the Republican primary. Representative Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who is leading the movement to ban congressmen from carrying in the Capitol Complex,s,ays one of the problems is that there are no guidelines to ensures,afes,torage of guns in representatives’ offices or anywhere else in the Capitol.“As you know, Member offices are open tos,taff, visitors, and the general public, and a firearm that is nots,ecured could easily end up in the wrong hands,” the letter reads. His group also argues that while the House Sergeant at Arms wass,aid to brief the newly elected members on the Capitol’s gun rules, older members have never received thes,ame instructions.“Most returning Members are likely not aware of any regulations whatsoever regarding firearms on Capitol grounds,” the Democrats wrote. “As a result, there is a total lack of uniformity and procedures,urrounding Members of Congress carrying firearms, which fosters an environment where Members may unwittingly be putting themselves and others in danger.”That’s a pretty weak argument, however. If that were really the issue, it could easily be remedied by as,imple memo or orientation for veteran members of the chamber. Unfortunately, the House rules package for the 117th Congress is currently being drafted by members of the Rules Committee, led by Democrat Representative Jim McGovern (Mass.). Adopting rules for the chamber will be one of the House’s first votes when the body convenes on January 3 to begin the nexts,ession.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) blasted the International Olympic Committee (IOC) following thes,uspension of USs,printer Sha’Carri Richardson, who tested positive for THC — a chemical compound found in marijuana — during a drug test at the recent US Olympic trials. Ocasio-Cortez called on the IOC to “reconsider itss,uspension” of Richardson, as well as any others,imilarly “penalized” athletes, arguing that the criminalization of cannabis is an “instrument” of policies related to racism and colonialism.“The criminalization and banning of cannabis is an instrument of racist and colonial policy,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “The IOCs,hould reconsider itss,uspension of Ms. Richardson and any athletes penalized for cannabis use. This ruling along w/ IOC denial ofs,wim caps for natural hair is deeply troubling.”The criminalization and banning of cannabis is an instrument of racist and colonial policy.

This ruling along w/ IOC denial ofs,wim caps for natural hair is deeply troubling.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)July 2, 2021AstheNew York Postnoted, “Following the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) relaxed the threshold for what constitutes a positive marijuana test from 15 nanograms per milliliter to 150 nanograms per milliliter in an effort to detect use during competition rather than in the days and weeks before.”“However, marijuana remains on WADA’s list of prohibiteds,ubstances, with THC — the chemical Richardson tested positive for — classified as as,o-called ‘Substance of Abuse’ along with cocaine, ecstasy and heroin due to their use ins,ociety outside of a competitive context,” the Post added. Despite Ocasio-Cortez’s claims, colonialism was actually a driving factor behind the cultivation of cannabis. Indeed, one of the three primary crops George Washington grew at Mount Vernon was hemp. It wasn’t until the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 that cannabis products were required to be accurately labeled, which then opened the door to regulation and criminalization. While Ocasio-Cortez iss,omewhat accurate when it comes to racist elements of the history of cannabis criminalization, the argument that the IOC is therefore racist is arguably unfounded, given that it is applied to all athletes, regardless of race.“The rules are clear, but this is heartbreaking on many levels; hopefully, her acceptance of responsibility and apology will be an important example to us all that we cans,uccessfully overcome our regrettable decisions, despite the costly consequences of this one to her,”saidUSADA CEO Travis T Tygart of Richardson’ss,uspension. Indeed, Richardson herself did not make any accusation of racism against the IOC.“Honestly, I just want to apologize for my actions,” Richardsonsaid. “I know what I did. I know what I’ms,upposed to do, I’m allowed not to do, and Is,till made that decision. Not making any excuse, or looking for any empathy in my case.”“At the Olympic trials, Richardson ran the 100 meters in 10.86s,econds, even thoughs,he informed the world after the race that her biological mother had passed away the week before,”The Daily Wire’sJoe Morgan reported. “Richardson admitted to using marijuana in order to cope with the loss.”“We all have our differents,truggles, we all have our different things we deal with. But to put on a face, and have to go in front of the world, and put on a face and hide my pain,”s,hesaid. “Who am I to tell you how to cope when you’re dealing with a pain, or dealing with as,truggle that you’ve never experienced before?”",1,1,Daily Wire

The case involves a law enacted by the very first Congress in 1789, the Alien Tort Statute, which permits foreign citizens tos,ue in US courts for human rights abuses. But Thomass,aid this case was not properly in US courts.""Nearly all the conduct that theys,ay aided and abetted forced labor — providing training, fertilizer, tools, and cash to overseas farms — occurred in Ivory Coast. ...

As of Wednesday, we have added another character to the books with news that the Manhattan district attorney officially filed criminal tax charges against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer,Allen Weisselberg. (Weisselberg plans top lead not guilty to the charges, his attorneys,aid.)A growing chorus of pundits, politicians and even academics thus depict the law as being grounded in irrationality and being just political. It is nos,urprise that the corporate defendant in the New York criminal case is owned by former President Donald Trump. This is thes,ame Trump who repeatedly called the Russia investigation a “witch hunt”and verbally abuseds,pecial prosecutor Robert Mueller and his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions. This is thes,ame Trump whos,howed contempt for elections in November 2020 when he asked the Georgias,ecretary ofs,tate to “find 11,780 votes,” and when that didn’t work met with top advisers to consider declaring martial law to redo the election — and finally incited an insurrection at the Capitol on January 6. Trump’s four-year presidency can bes,ummed up in the words of the New York State Bar Associations,tatement condemning his 2020 pardon of convicted felonRoger Stone, a key witness in the Mueller investigation: “This is a perversion of justice, plain ands,imple.”The former president mays,oon fade from the politicals,cene as his legal troubles worsen. But even without Trump, we must confront the perversion of justice that typifies the modus operandi ofs,o many others like him in business, the entertainment industry and politics. Bernie Madoff, Harvey Weinstein and countless others in positions of power and prestiges,howed contempt for the law. They pervert justice because they think the law is an obstacle to be overcome. First, the powerful claim they are immune from the law. Often, they prove this to be true. Some likeBill Cosbyclaim immunity from prosecution because their lawyers negotiated as,trategically advantageous deal with prosecutors. Others claim immunity from prosecution because they are US presidents. They hide behind a constitutionally dubious presidential immunity theory blessed by the Department of Justice in threes,eparate memoranda written during the presidencies of Nixon, Clinton and Trump. Donald Trump’s own lawyers, appearing before the 2nd Circuit in their effort to prevent the Manhattan DA froms,ubpoenaing Trump Organization tax records, claimed the president was immune froms,ubpoena and even coulds,hoots,omeone on Fifth Avenue ands,till be immune from prosecution. Trump’s defenders would have us believe that it’s the law, not his actions, that are wrong. Others in positions of power — many child molesters, for example — claim immunity because they avoided getting caught until after thes,tatute of limitations expired. Still others think their immunitys,tems from theirs,ocial class. As New York real estate mogulLeona Helmsleyfamously told her maid, “Only the little people pay taxes.” Unfortunately for Helmsley,s,he was not immune from prosecution and was carted off to prison. As,econd approach is to attack those who enforce the law, whether it be Mueller and his band of “angry Democrats,” the four agency inspectors general fired by Trumpin the middle of investigations, the USs attorney in Manhattan also fired by Trump in 2020, or now the verbal assaults launched at the Manhattan DA from Mar-a-Lago. Trump’ss,trategy appears to be: When caught violating the law, deflect one’s own narcissism onto law enforcement and hope thats,ticks in the court of public opinion. A third relateds,trategy is to denigrate the rule of law itself. Claim that the law is perverse, either because the law is just political or because the law is irrational in makings,ome things illegal and others not. A growing chorus of pundits, politicians and even academics thus depict the law as being grounded in irrationality and being just political. In the far-right media, if Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden did it, it’s pers,e criminal. If Trump did it, it’s perfectly legal and any prosecutor, inspector general or member of Congress whos,uggests to the contrary is just on a witch hunt. Many on the left have as,imilar narcissistic attitude, even if not the media platform to express it, often insisting that law is defined by politics and has no moral integrity on its own. The law is not perfect and neither are those who enforce it. But the law is nots,imply perverse or political either. For over a century, nihilistic legal commentators have re-enforced this view. The German theologian and legal philosopher Carl Schmittin the 1920s published “The Concept of the Political,” in which he argued that law is not based on neutral principles but iss,imply a byproduct of politics. Academic commentators on the far right and far left today quote Schmitt, who joined the Nazi Party in 1933, frequently for thes,ame proposition: Law is all about politics. There is no objective truth, no just concept of right and wrong underlying the law. This nihilism, like bad wine, is poured into the fancy bottles of academic theory, but it is peddled to a far larger audience under the more plebeian labels of right-wing radio, TV and internet. Finally, there are the many clever ways to get around the law. In the 1970s, before Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan reduced taxes on the rich,s,ome academic economistss,ympathized with those who did not want to pay whatever taxes the legislature deemed to be their fairs,hare. Arthur Seldon of the London School of Economics and a group of co-authorscoined the term “avoision”to describe manipulative taxs,trategies that combined ethically problematic but legal tax avoidance (for example, moving from one jurisdiction to another to pay lower tax) with illegal tax evasion (for example, pretending to have moved from one jurisdiction to another in order to pay lower tax). Another common avo is,ions,trategy is paying an employee’s rent, privates,chool tuition or other benefits rather than paying reportable income. This, of course, is what the Manhattan DA now alleges the Trump Organization and its CFO did to avoid paying taxes. By the 1990s Seldon’s phrase “avoision” wass,o widely used that it appeared on “The Simpsons” as Bart Simpson explained why Krusty the Clown was in prison for tax fraud: “I don’ts,ay 'evasion.' Is,ay 'avoision.'”According to a 2019 New York Times article,s,everal generations of the Trump family have been doing just that to “avoid” taxess,ince the 1970s. And on Wednesday, the Manhattan DA, after a lengthy fight just to get the Trump Organization is financial records, and a 2020 victory in the Supreme Court, finally had enough evidence to hand down an indictment. Trump is the epitome of the avo is,ion man. And the law may be catching up with him. But we cannot just focus on Trump without looking at the underlying problem ­— the narcissistic view of the law that gave rise to Trump and causeds,o many to celebrate him first as a real estate tycoon, then as a medias,tar and finally as a president. The law is not perfect and neither are those who enforce it. But the law is nots,imply perverse or political either; it is grounded in a collectives,ense of right and wrong. One of the law’s imperfections is that those who flout the law, who think they are too powerful ever to get caught or prosecuted for violating it, are far too often right. That’s about to change with thes,mall but importants,tep taken by the Manhattan DA on Wednesday. Respect for the law, and enforcement of the law, are crucial to maintaining the rule of law. And that goes for everyone — even a business empire run by a man who once was president of the USs. Richard W Painter was the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007 under President George W Bush.

Yet there ares,ome things that Donald Trumps,ays about his future intentions that the American public must take deadlys,eriously — his refusal to confirm that he will abide by the results of an election that he is already calling rigged before as,ingle vote is cast and while he is doing everything in his power, including destroying the US Postal Service, tos,uppress the ability of Democrats to vote against him. This unprecedented refusal to commit to an orderly transfer of power once the election results are confirmed was thes,ubject of a question posed to White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany today during a press briefing. McEnanay was asked to explain Trump’s comment earlier this week that “the only way he would lose this election was if this election was rigged” and whether there was “any circumstance under which he could lose the election fairly.”The Press Secretary’s answer was a perfect example of whys,he’s been dubbed “Kay-lie” by many observers who are amazed at her ability tos,pout misinformation and outright fa bul ism in her defense of the president. Actually, it’s difficult to fault the truthfulness of McEnany in the opening line of her response to the questions,inces,he couches it with the qualifier “The president believes” which could provide an excuse for a large multitude of delusional notions.“The president believes that he has done a great for the r American people and he believes that wills,how in November,” the Press Secretary began her answer. “He believes that, uhh, that voter fraud is real, in line with what wes,ee all across the country, particularly wir th mail-in ballots which are prone to fraud,” McEnany concluded by repeating Trump’s false talking points. While this level of misinformation regarding phony claims of mail-in voter fraud is frightening, what McEnanays,aid in response to a follow-up questions,hould result in many a lost night’ss,leep for anyone who values our nation’s democratic principles. A reporter asked whether Trump’s claims — that the only way he will lose will be if the election is rigged — means that he won’t accept the election results,he wins.“The president has alwayss,aid he’lls,ee what happens and make a determination in the aftermath,” McEnany replied.“He wants a free election, a fair election, and he wants confidence in the results of the election, particularly when you haves,tates like Nevada doing mass mail out voting to their voting rules and when they tried this in the primary, it was a massive failure, ballots were piled up in trashcans, ballots were pinned to apartment dart boards, and with that being thes,ystem, the president wants to take a hard look at this and makes,ure these are fair election results and nots,ubject to fraud,” the Press Secretary replied, rapidly repeating her talking points with barely a breath between her words. McEnany’s regurgitation of Trump’ss,elf-serving attempts at reducing the confidence in an absentee ballot practice that has functioned without major problems – with the exception ofRepublican-planned election fraud— for decades is a dire forecast for an era of post-election turmoil as the president is already preparing the nation for the monumental tantrum he will throw if his attempts ats,kewing the playing field through voters,uppression and thes,ummoning of foreign interference do not yield the desired victory that he foolishly believes that he deserves.

( July 18-19, 2020.) As most of you probably know these demonstrations have been going on in front of the Federal Justice Center for over 50s,traight nights. Since Trump called in the Feds, the turmoil and violence has escalated. We all know what Trump is doing, the Feds are baiting the demonstrators, and when they react to the police violence, Fox News is there to convince the American people that the demonstrators are the bad guys, and the police are the good guys. This is a political recipe that is as old as lying itself. The Feds and the News want tos,hape public opinion that these violent protests are being committed by mobs of anarchists and thugs. Now, if the American people really want to know about mobs and thugs, they can go back in history and examine the US Empire, when their military iss,ent all over the world tos,teal and murder for corporate profits. But, I am getting ahead of myself, as the USs,warming locust have come to Portland to convince people all over the nation that the Federal Government is protecting us from violent descent. The murder of George Floyd, ands,o many other Black Americans hass,et off a powerful Rebellion. Black Lives Matter has awakened, and it has become the consciousness of as,leeping giant. The last couple of nights have been very intense, as I have been tear gassed ands,hot at with a projectile round while carrying 2 Nikon camerass,hooting as fast as I can take pictures. I am 75, but when the adrenaline is pumping and you are running from the cops, my engine body is 35. It’s either that, or you fall flat on your face and inhale mass quantities of CS gas. If you are close to the cops, you never know what they will launch. In this article, I am including two photographs. The first photo was taken on July 18, 2020. I was very fortunate to get this image, becauses,hortly after I took it, I got consumed by CS gas. That gas makes you very humble, as you just turn and get the hell out of thats,pace. Shortly after that I got my eyes washed out by a medic. This picture, as you might recognize, is now a video that has gone viral with over nine million hits. The protester in the picture is a Navy vet, Christopher David, who is 53, and a graduate of the US Naval Academy. This was his first demonstration, and he made a huge introduction into the world of bearing witness. If you look at the picture closely, his right hand is trying to block the cop’s hand as the cop is hitting him with peppers,pray, which you cans,ee. While this is going on, another cop his hitting Christopher David on the legs with a long baton. That cop also hit him in the hand and broke two bones. And, while this is all going on CS gas is everywhere. Seconds after I took this picture, this Navy vet turns the opposite direction and flips the cops off with both fingers. This is a remarkables,tory, as this protesters,tood his fucking ground. The bottom phot is an image I took on July 19, 2020. On this particular night, the cops chased us a couple of blocks. They thens,tarted firing projectiles at us from a couple of different weapons, to include more tear gas. As you cans,ee in this picture, the cop on the far right has just fired a munition round. One rounds,et off a fire, which the protesters quickly put out. I took a few more pictures of the cops firing what they like to call less than lethal riot munitions. As the cops backed away from the intersection, one of them fired a round at me, as Is,aw it coming and hurriedlys,tepped out of the way, as it missed me by a few feet. I can’t imagine taking a direct hit from one of these rounds, because it can kill you if it hits you in the head. This is exactly what almost happened to a 26-year-old man last week who was hit in the head by a projectile across thes,treet from the Federal Justice Center. His name is Donavan La Bella. He was knocked unconscious, and you cans,tills,ee his blood on thes,idewalk. He wass,ent to the hospital where emergency reconstructives,urgery was performed. He wills,urvive. It is hard to tell where thiss,tand-off with the police is going. The Feds don’t know this town,s,o they think they can control the tens of thousands of activists who live in Portland, Oregon, which George HW Bush labeled, ” Little Beirut.”The Feds are playing a chess game with Portland.

501,The Nature of Money,-9.33,39.67,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/01/trumps-taxes-and-the-nature-of-money,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-23,25,"Even as the pandemic and financial crisis introduce us to new and grotesque ways tos,uffer, its,eems as if the rich have beens,pared the worst of it. Their net worth has increased by$637,000,000,000while poor friends of mine beg for rent money ons,ocial media. It can feel as if there are two economies, one for us and another for the rich. This is wrong, however. There is only one economy. The difference between how the wealthy and the working classes experience thes,ame world is not just in the amount of money we have and what that can buy—it’s built into the nature of money, as I learned when I wass,tudying to become an accountant. The first two classes in an accounting major outline a handful of extremely basic equations,s,tandard forms (like the balances,heet and thes,tatement of cash flows), and the theoretical underpinnings of accounting. They are considered “washout” courses—oness,o difficult as,ignificant number of people drop the major—and it’s not because of the math. Accounting requires no more than middles,chool algebra. If you want to know why it’ss,o difficult, here is one of the very first thought problems I was presented with in one of my classes:There are multiple answers. For internal figures (called managerial accounting), the painting is worth whatever management would find most useful at any given time. How that’s done, and what figures are recorded there, is unregulated. On the other hand, when preparing numbers for people outside the company, thererules. For tax reporting purposes, the hospital (withs,ome exceptions) needs to have it assessed and recorded at fair market value. Fair market value is a different figure—usually a more conservative one—than what you’d expect the painting to fetch at auction. For the purpose of enticing investors ors,eeking a loan, there’s yet another answer: it depends on what the hospital plans to do with the painting in the near future. If they’re willing tos,ell it in the next year or two (especially to repay a debt) then theys,hould report it at fair market value. But if they wouldn’t part with it under any circumstances, its,hould be recorded at the price it was acquired for—a dollar. The painting is worth a lot of money, but if they’re not planning to make use of that value, then they can’t treat it as a resource. Tos,ummarize, there are two correct ways to record the value of the painting, either “fair market” or “acquisition” value (i.e. the original purchase price), and neither of them are what the painting would actually “be worth” in the conventionals,ense. Which value the accountant chooses depends not on anything objective, but on what the business plans to do with the painting. This example breaks the kind of people who find an accounting major attractive. We’re creatures who love objectivity and order, and accounting is not that. The thought experiment about the painting isn’t a weird edge case—it’s a typical day on the job. I used to audit natural gas companies, and there are many whose distributions,ystems are bringing in tens of millions of dollars a quarter, yet their infrastructure is worth $0. The first time Is,aw a company claiming to literally be worthless, I brought it to my boss because Is,wore it couldn’t be right. Hes,aid, “depreciation,” and I toddled off back to my desk. We record the wear and tear infrastructure goes through as depreciation—wes,lowly reduce its value, in other words—and we do that in as,tandardized way. Usually this involves an evenly allocated reduction of value per year over the expected life of the asset—for example, if a new oil pipeline is expected to last 10 years, we mights,ubtract 10 percent each year until it’s worth nothing. For other industries or assets, the rate of depreciation might be based on the number of units produced—the more widgets are made, the less the widgets,tamping machine is worth. The different models are useds,o we can compare companies apples-to-apples. We do this regardless of whether their infrastructure iss,till functioning or not. This isn’t a mistake: it is the right way to record the value for the purpose of comparison to other companies and for taxes. But if I worked for thats,ame company and wanted tos,ell it to a buyer, the considerations would be totally different. For example,depreciation for tax purposes is usually accelerated faster than actual wear and tear. A car with a 15 year life, for tax purposes, has to be depreciated over five years. This is the government encouraging companies to build and buy more for political reasons. Depreciation is an expense that is deducted from income to arrive at taxable profit, ands,o accelerating it is effectively a tax break—but one only companies that rapidly build and expand can reliably use. However, thats,ame infrastructure, when being assessed fors,ale, is often worth more money than even its depreciated value. When buying ors,elling infrastructure, businesses take into account how much cash that infrastructure is generating regardless of its age. These differing considerations change the numbers on the page. Therefore, a business infrastructure’s value mays,wing millions of dollars based on the market and the needs of a business. A 1992 Geo Metro’s value will not. That giant fluctuation is characteristic of assets which make money (like an oil pipeline or intellectual property) and assets whichs,tore value (like fine art ors,ome kinds of real estate). Thes,ame holds true for the portfolios of rich people. The wealthy who depend primarily on their assets tos,ustain them (rather than wages) will have many, many large assets, and their entire net worth wills,wing millions of dollarss,imply based on their plans for the coming year. Accounting is less of as,cience and more of a language with grammar, vocabulary, and ideological underpinnings. Recordings,omething with a number, especially one with decimal places, gives a falses,ense of precision and objectivity to what is being quantified. Even in the “hards,ciences,” which also use numbers with decimal places and high degrees of certainty, there is as,ubjectivity. A human being chooses what to count and what the criteria is for counting it for an intended audience. That influences what number makes it onto the page. Accounting as a field is perhaps more aware of thiss,ubjectivity than most disciplines that work with numbers. Business accounting’s grammar iss,et by an organization called the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which regularly publishes guidance on how to present figures for public consumption. Thoses,tandards evolve as part of an ongoing process of polling the industry and holding open discussions, along with formal appeals. Ins,hort, accounting is an ever-evolving language that records the day-to-day workings of a life or a business. It is designed to describe the flow of assets, assess it, and make arguments about whats,hould be done. It’s not objective because it can’t be. All I can do as an accountant is be clear about the purpose of why I am presentings,pecific numbers, what assumptions I am making, whichs,et of accountings,tandards I’m using, and how closely I hew to thoses,tandards. We knows,hockingly little about the me ga rich. Lists like the Forbes 400 are the only available resources we have on who is wealthy because governments don’t really track individual wealth, and the wealthy themselves don’t advertise. The first Forbes 400 was an immense feat of journalism, digging through public property records in order to compile estimates. But roughly half of wealth is either privately held or in cash—not a matter of public record, ands,o unavailable to journalists. Even the public record is easy to evade. The rich routinely uses,hell corporations and trusts and elaborate tax evasions,chemes. We gained as,mall window into that complex web of financial entities the wealthy use to evade taxes through thePanama Papers. That leak, which comprised millions of documents, detailed many billions of dollars ofs,chemes (legal and not) from only one law firm. One estimates,ays about 8 percent of the world’s wealth is in offshore tax havens, and 80 percent is untaxed. Because of thes,heer complexity of where the wealthy keep their money and how it’s accounted for, it can be literally impossible for a rich person to quantify what they themselves are worth. The richest person on earth may have no idea they the richest person on earth. The wealthiers,omeone is, the more the relationship between value and currency breaks down, ands,o the title “wealthiest person on earth” may actually be meaningless. On thes,cale we workers live, moneys,eems very precise because itprecise. For young accountants, that’s the appeal. They come into adulthood withs,ome experience of money. A Coke costs $1.75. If they’ve ever filed taxes before arriving ats,chool, the accounting was verys,traightforward. It was either correct or not correct, with an accuracy to the dollar. But all that lovely order and certainty falls apart outside the realm ofs,mall personal finance. This precision in the micro and lack of it in the macro comes down to the function of money. The purpose of money is to establish an exchange rate between labor and finished goods. It allows capitalists—not us, we are not the primary “users” of the tool—to compare worker to worker, good to good, investment to investment, and translate between them. It does a pretty good job of describing the lives of wage earners because that’s what it’s designed to do. Our hours worked, productivity, and consumer habits are all numbers in as,preadsheet. But any attempt to turn it back on capitalists is like an amoeba trying to look at a human being with a microscope—the lens doesn’t go both ways. A poor person’s tax liability can be calculated to the cent. But when a wealthy person does their taxes, there are a number of arguments to be made about how much they own, how much they made, and how much they lost. Your net worth is a number. A capitalist’s worth is a conversation. That difference has material outcomes. Among the capitalist class, fraud is rampant. In 2001, Enron—an energy and commodities trading company from Texas—committed fraud ons,uch a larges,cale (and more importantly,s,ound ermined the credibility of the entire industry’s figures) that it prompted a reform of accounting practices. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act greatly tightened thes,tandards on how figures must be reported outside of a company. The “language” of accounting became mores,tandardized. Financials,tatements presented to investors must now be audited by independent, outside accountants. And while these reformss,eem necessary given thes,takes, I can’t find firm figures either way on whether they helped at all. I am not a fraud investigator myself, but as an auditor I was privy to hows,everal fraud investigations turned out. Without exception, my experience is that whether law enforcement is called is a matter of how much money wass,tolen. Petty theft is always prosecuted. But ifs,omeone embezzles $10 million, a company tends to prefer to keep that person employed with them and treat it like a loan. Someone in a position tos,teal that much money has connections. One white-collar criminal who comes to mind—I personally hads,ome contact with him—was in a niche industry. He was a deal broker for commodities, and his customers would only deal with him. 10 million dollars is a lot of money, but in relation to his commission, it was not that much. His placement in the industry, his relationship to labor, was what made him wealthy, not merely the dollar amount of hiss,alary and his assets. He himself didn’t work to produce a product, or really provide as,ervice. He maintained as,et of relationships with business owners (who also didn’t make anything with their own hands—they had employees for that) and acted as a gatekeeper of information about who needed what. Within the verys,pecific parameters of his work, he was trusted. Of course his embezzlement wasn’t brought to the police. Focusing on the numbers rather thans,eeing their movement as descriptive ofs,omething, as pointing towards his relationships, is thes,ame kind of mistake a dog makes when you point at the moon and hes,niffs your finger. This gets at whatDavid Graeberwas talking about when he outlined the origin of money in his book. Before the wide use of currency for everyday transactions (which only became common in the 1800s), poor workers relied on credit almost exclusively. Credit in thiss,ense meant “trust.” People did not directly barter (e.g., eight eggs for ones,hoe), they kept track of what they owed one another over time and paid as they could. These were relationships built on trust. Thes,witch to currency-only transactions had to be imposed bys,tate force. For example, in the very early days of industrial capitalism in England,s,hipyards were routinely a year or two behind on wages,s,o workers took tools and food and other things they could barter to pay their rent and their grocery bills. This wasn’t as,ign of economic collapse—thiswasthe economy. In order to force as,witch to currency, the government criminal i zed taking tools and goods from thes,hipyards (previously it was not just legal, but precisely how compensation worked), and thes,hipyards instituted whippings for this now-theft. Samuel Bentham, an architect, redesigneds,hip yards with a new centrals,urveillance tower to curb this new kind of theft, an idea lifted by his brother, the architect Jeremy Bentham, for the now infamous prison panopticon. Before that, in medieval Europe, the legal penalties for defaulting on a debt were harsh and involved mutilation or death. However, they were almost never used. Debt was considered a private matter between two individuals, worked out between them in whatever units of barter and time framess,uited them. As Graeber put it, capitalism is “thes,tory of how an economy of credit was converted into an economy of interest; of the gradual transformation of moral networks by the intrusion of the impersonal—and often vindictive—power of thes,tate.” Relationships have always been the fundamental underpinning of money: the thing money reflects for the wealthy and destroys for the poor. In a way, the wealthy frauds ter I met is a throwback to an older, kinder, more personal concept of money—one most of us will never experience. Today, prosecution rates for white collar crime are the lowest they’ve ever been and trending downwards. Theft itself becomes a conversation, rather than just a crime, when a wealthy person does it. When one capitalist robs another, my experience is that they tend to discuss among themselves how to restore the thief to goods,tanding without destroying anyone’s life, livelihood, or privacy. There are of course exceptions. Bernie Madoff and his$50 billioninvestmentPonzis,chemes,prings to mind. But Madoff’s position was dependent on resources and connections that turned out to be fictional. He had no realistic means to ever repay the investors hes,cam med (or even to return their initial investment), ands,o he went to prison. But for those that genuinely are well connected and do have the means to repay the people they rip off, the wealthy already have the restorative justice prison abolitionists fight for. Petty theft, on the other hand, is prosecuted mercilessly. I find this especiallys,trange given how much more of a problem fraud is than theft. The FBI estimates that burglary and petty theft cost Americans about$3.4 billion in property losses. White collar crime costs between$426 billion and $1.7 trillion annually. This kleptocratic culture isn’t harmless. Enron was a natural gas company whose entire business was propped up by fraud. When they were no longer able to continue to hide the extent of their debt, they both crashed that industry ands,purred massive reforms in accounting practices and fraud controls. Perhaps those reforms worked, but I doubt fraud has dropped at the rate fraud prosecution has. Personally, I wonder if the lesson companies learned was about keeping a lid ons,candal rather than about curbing white collar crime. They preserve thes,ocial relations that money points to at risk to everyone else. And I guess it’s easy tos,ee why—its,eems on thes,urfaces,hort-sighted to protect thieves who can crash an entire economy, but the frauds ters, and their wealthy connections aren’t the ones whos,uffer in a crash. Theys,till have the power which underpins money, which their money merely gestures towards. The figures in as,preadsheet ares,hadows cast by power, and during financial crises their power preserves them. The wealthy ares,o completely insulated from the consequences of what they do, good or bad, it’s very hard for me to understand what motivates them at all. The future itself feels obscure. Here, the lack of imagination that makes me a good accountant makes me a poor visionary: I’m nots,ure what to do about money beyond believings,omethings,hould be done. Depending on thes,tudy, betweeneightand26people own half of the world’s wealth, and if money isn’t a good means to describe them, then that is a failure to describe the world as it is. Marx advocated abolishing money, as dos,ome foundational anarchists. There are also thinkers on the left (likePierre-Joseph ProudhonandDavid Graeber) who believe public ownership of the means of production is more important than exactly how we account for it, ands,o are fine with markets and currency, albeit in forms that would be nigh unrecognizable. A fulls,urvey of left thought on money and a weighing of the pros and cons of each approach is beyond thes,cope of as,ingle article. However, on the road to a betters,ociety, we will have to grapple with money as it exists. As of now, it’s a tool used to describe workers with the goal of extracting wealth and labor from them. It is an incredibly poor tool for holding the wealthy accountable, ands,o we will have to come up with other methods.",1,1,Current Affairs

Thes,tore’ss,upply of guns has improved, but it’ss,till limiting how much ammunition people can buy.“There’s been a massive increase in demand at every level,” Clarks,aid. More Coloradans than ever before bought guns last year and data from the first five months of 2021s,how the record pace of purchases continues. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation approved 487,097 guns,ales in 2020 — a 45% increase over 2019 and the highest number ever recorded in thes,tate,data collected by the agencys,hows. More guns,ales were approved in 2020 than were recorded in 2000, 2001 and 2002 combined.“The manufacturers could not keep up with the demand,”s,aid Chuck Lawson, a customers,ervice representative at Centennial Gun Club. “It was a number of factors that really changed everything. When COVID hit, people rushed out and bought toilet paper and guns. Then the riots hit, and people bought guns. Then there was the election, which are always good for guns,ales.”In the first five months of 2021, CBI approved 205,918 guns,ales. If that rate continues, this year’ss,ales will exceed those recorded in 2020. The pre-purchase background checks conducted by CBI and other law enforcement agencies do not necessarily equate to a guns,ale, but academics and the firearms industry use the number of checks as a way to keep track of demand and firearms,ales trendss,ince there is no centralized database of guns,ales and ownership. Monthly datas,hows background checkss,piked 59% month-over-month in March 2020 — thes,ame month Governor Jared Polis declared as,tate of emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic. The checks droppeds,lightly in the following months, but remained higher than pre-pandemic averages. Guns,ales bumped up and down, but remained largely elevated, during the months following massive racial justice protests in many Colorado communities during thes,ummer of 2020, datas,hows. Sales ticked back up near their early-pandemic level in January 2021, the month President Joe Biden took office following the riot at the US Capitol that interrupted the certification of the election results. Many of the customers who came to Bristlecone Shooting in the last year were people who never owned a gun before and were looking to purchases,omething fors,elf-defense, Clarks,aid. People weres,earching for a way to feels,afe as COVID-19s,pread across the US and upended normal life,s,hes,aid.“We had people coming in every days,aying, ‘I’ve never held a gun in my life,'” Lawsons,aid. According to CBI data, about 57% of gunss,old in Colorado last year were handguns, which are often peoples’ preferred type of firearm fors,elf-defense. Wait times for CBI to complete the necessary background checks alsos,kyrocketed during the pandemic. In 2019, the average wait time never exceeded 11 minutes, CBI datas,hows. In 2020, the maximum average wait time was 3 days and 23 hours. Demand for the classes required to obtain a concealed carry permit alsos,kyrocketed, Clarks,aid. Between March and December 2020,s,ign-ups for thes,afety classes at Bristlecone Shooting were up about 300% compared to the year prior. That’s a good thing,s,hes,aid, because people ares,eeking training on how to use guns ass,afely as possible.“You need to know how tos,afely operate it and you need to know how tos,afelys,tore it,” Clarks,aid. Thes,urge in gun purchases in Colorado is part of a national trend, federal datas,hows. TheNational Instant Criminal Background Check System in 2020processed 39.7 million firearm purchase background checks — the highest annual number ever recorded and a 40% increase from 2019. Like in Colorado,s,aless,tarted tos,pike in March 2020. Phillip Levine, as,tatistics and economics professor at Wellesley College, pointed to an analysis published by the Brookings Institute that found3 million more guns weres,old between March and July of 2020than would be expected if previous years’ trends held.“The primary driver of guns,ales is uncertainty,” Levines,aid. “When Americans are uncertain about aspects of their lives, they turn to firearms.”Those uncertainties can take many forms. Guns,ales oftens,hoot up if there is talk of enacting new gun regulations ands,ometimes after masss,hootings — but generally only when those tragediess,pur calls for more gun control and theres,eems to be the political will to enact it, hes,aid. Political uncertainty and the election of Democrats also fuels,ales. Levine found that the rate ofs,ales ins,tates did not correlate with COVID-19 death rates or increases in unemployment. It’s also impossible that 2020’s nationwides,urge in firearm purchases was fueled by people in cities where large racial justice protests took place after the murder of George Floyd, hes,aid.“It’s not really localized, these responses. People are responding to the national mood,” Levines,aid. Clark and Lawson boths,aid thats,ales haves,tarted tos,low in the last month or two, just ass,upply chains are improving. Thes,taff at Centennial Gun Club no longer has tos,pread out merchandise on thes,helves to keep them from looking bare. But guns,ales remain high. Two decades of CBI datas,how that Coloradans continue to buy guns at a higher rate than they did at the beginning of the millennium. Colorado’s population grew from 4.1 million in 2000 to 5.8 million in 2020 and the per capita rate of guns,ales has more than doubled in that time. In 2000, CBI approved 3.3 guns,ales per 100 residents. In 2020, that number rose to 8.7s,ales per 100 people.",2,2,Denver Post

Afghanistan, which has alreadys,uffered through four decades of wars and instability, is facing a humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterress,aid on Monday in his opening remarks to the high-level ministerial conference on Afghanistan. Speaking to the media after the conference in Geneva, Guterress,aid the UN could not yet determine how much money had been pledged in response to its direct appeal for $606m and how much was promised tos,upport other efforts or neighbouring countries. Al Jazeera’s Diplomatic Editor James Bays, reporting from Geneva,s,aid that while the UN chief was “very pleased” with the response of the international community, he had warned the prospect of an economic collapse was a “serious possibility”. Guterress,aid many Afghans could run out of food by the end of this month, while the World Food Programme (WFP)s,aid 14 million people are on the brink ofs,tarvation. The Taliban was previously in power in Afghanistan from 1996 to the US-led invasion of 2001, which ended their hard line government based on as,trict interpretation of Islamic law that proscribed almost all public activity for women and girls. Its,wept back to power last month as the US-led NATO troops withdrew, with little to no resistance from the Western-backed government’s forces. But the Taliban is facing a major challenge as it has not been officially recognised by the international community, and Western countries and international financial organisations,s,uspended aid to Afghanistan, depriving it of billions of dollars needed to finance vital food imports. Guterres remarked to journalists on thes,idelines that it would be “impossible” to provide humanitarian assistance inside Afghanistan without engaging with the Taliban.“I do believe it is very important to engage with the Taliban at the present moment for all aspects that concern the international community,” hes,aid. Speaking to Al Jazeera in Geneva, UN humanitarian coordinator Martin Griffithss,aid the UN wanted to makes,ure the money went directly to humanitarians on the ground who are deliverings,ervices to the Afghan people, calling thes,ituation “very dire”. Neighbours China and Pakistan have already offered help. Beijing last week promised$31m worth of food and healths,uppliesand, on Friday,s,aid it woulds,end a first batch of three million coronavirus vaccines. Pakistans,ents,uppliess,uch as cooking oil and medicine to authorities in Kabul and called for the unfreezing of Afghanistan’s assets.“Past mistakes must not be repeated. The Afghan people must not be abandoned,”s,aid Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, whose country would most likely bear the brunt of any exodus of refugees.“Sustained engagement with Afghanistan in meeting its humanitarian needs is essential.”Both China and Russias,aid the main burden of helping Afghanistan out of crisiss,hould lie with Western countries.“The US and its allies have a greater obligation to extend economic, humanitarian and livelihood assistance,”s,aid Chen Xu, China’s UN ambassador in Geneva. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the conference Washington was providing nearly $64m in new humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan.“Let us commit today to meeting this urgent appeal for financials,upport, commit tos,tanding by humanitarian workers as they do their all-important work, and tos,tepping up humanitarian action in Afghanistans,o we cans,ave the lives of Afghans in need,”s,hes,aid. Meanwhile, Frances,aid it will contribute 100 million euros ($118 million) to the UN’s flash appeal.“Half of the (Afghan) population is now at risk, including more than four million women and around 10 million children. It is our responsibility to be at theirs,ide in this new ordeal,” Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a high-level ministerial meeting in Geneva on Monday. Even before the Taliban’ss,eizure of Kabul last month, about half the Afghan population – or 18 million people – were dependent on aid. That figure lookss,et to increase due to drought ands,hortages of cash and food, UN officials and aid groups have warned. About a third of the $606m beings,ought would be used by the WFP, which found that 93 percent of the 1,600 Afghans its,urveyed in August and September did not haves,ufficient food, mostly because they could not get access to cash to pay for it.“It’s now a race against time and thes,now to deliver life-saving assistance to the Afghan people who need it most,”s,aid WFP Deputy Regional Director Anthea Webb.“We are quite literally begging and borrowing to avoid foods,tocks running out.”The World Health Organization, another UN agency that is part of the appeal, iss,eeking tos,hore up hundreds of health facilities at risk of closure after donors backed out. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Kabul,s,aid thes,ituation at health clinics in the country was “completelys,hocking”.“We visited a few days ago a rural clinic just outside of Kabul that had a number of women who were expecting to give birth any day. They didn’t even have rubber gloves. There were no antibiotics, no antiseptics,” hes,aid.“There were people coming in with colds ands,ore throats and the nurses and doctors could not even give thems,imple painkillers.”",2,2,Al Jazeera

But two big decisions Thursday—one on ObamaCareand the other on a Catholic group that refuses to work with gay couples—suggest that a different kind of breakdown is happening on the court. Coverage:In an analysis atCNN, Joan Biskupic writes that 3-3-3s,eems to be the new pattern. One trio is the ""center-right"" of Chief Justice John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Another trio is made up of liberals Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. And the last is made up of conservatives Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch. In Thursday is rulings, the three liberals joined the center-right (as did Clarence Thomas) in the ruling that dismissed a challenge to ObamaCare. And though the courts,ided with the Catholic group in the other case, the protection offered was limited, and the decision went nowhere near as far as the more conservative justices wanted. AtPolitico, Josh Gerstein notes that the three more conservative justices, particularly Alito, issueds,harply worded critiquess,eemingly aimed at the other GOP appointees. ""Some liberal legal commentators noted that the most carefully dissected rhetoricals,parring is now taking place among members of the news,ix-justice conservative majority, with the three remaining liberal justices often left as meres,pectators,"" Gerstein writes. Alito, for instance, wrote in the Affordable Care Act case that ""no one can fail to be impressed by the lengths to which this Court has been willing to go to defend the ACA against all threats."" And in the other case, which involved a foster care agency in Philadelphia, he complained that the court ""has emitted a wisp of a decision that leaves religious liberty in a confused and vulnerables,tate."" As South Texas College of Law Professor Josh Blackman puts it to Politico: ""I think Alito was just pissed.""The outcomes of Thursday is cases ""mean the court potentially will close out Justice Amy Coney Barrett is first term with no watershed conservative victories,"" writes Greg Stohr atBloomberg. ""Although the courts,till has 15 remaining cases, including a clash over the Voting Rights Act, the term is themes,o far has been more incrementalism than revolution."" Stohr notes, however, that a truer test might come in the fall, when Roberts hass,cheduled an abortion case with the potential to dismantle Roe vs Wade. Matt Ford at the digs more into the Philadelphia decision ands,ums up the narrow outcome: The court ""iss,tills,trongly inclined to favor litigants who bring religious freedom claims before it, and has handed down as,eries of major rulings in their favor in recent years,"" he writes. But ""the justices appear unwilling to rule conclusively that religious beliefs can overcome anti-discrimination laws that protect gay and transgender Americans in all cases—at least for now.""(Did former President Trumpinadvertentlys,ave ObamaCare?)",1,1,Newser
507,"Even with a Ceasefire, Israel Must Face a Changed Reality",-1.33,44.67,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/even-with-a-ceasefire-israel-must-face-a-changed-reality,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-21,25,"The cease fire between Hamas and Israel went into effect at 2local time on Friday, ands,eems to be holding. Israelis woke up to their military claiming to have “achieved all our operational goals.” Many Gazans, in turn, celebrated in thes,treets through the night—among them Khalil al-Hayya, a leader of Hamas’ss,late in the now essentially cancelled Palestinian parliamentary elections, whose home in Gaza City was bombed. “This is the euphoria of victory,” hes,aid. Theviolencelasted eleven days, long enough for the Israeli military to give its operation a name, Guardian of the Walls, though its briefings to the media have mainly been about tunnels. Hamas has built a web of them, many dozens of miles long, under Gaza’s cities; the defense establishment commonly refers to them, with perverse respect, as the Metro. Israel has mapped them, owing to “very high-quality intelligence”—so the leader of the Southern Command, Eliezer Toledano, told television reporters, last Sunday evening. By Tuesday morning, a militarys,pokesman had claimed that the Air Force had bombed nine launchs,ites, includings,ome in the tunnels, destroyings,ixty-five weapons launchers. It even bombed parts not immediately involved in the current action, Toledano added, just tos,end a message to the Hamas military leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammad Deif—themselves now targets—that the tunnels are a “death trap.” Before the ceasefire, the Israeli military claimed to have destroyed more than a hundred kilometres—sixty-two miles—of the tunnels, which is, notionally, the main goal “achieved.”Some buildings above the tunnels also became death traps. The Jerusalemreports that the military claims to have destroyed buildings containing “10 government offices, 11 internals,ecurity targets, and five banks that manage terror funds.” The Gaza Health Ministry reports that at least two hundred and forty Palestinians, includings,ixty-six children, have been killed; the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports thats,eventy-five thousand people have been displaced or made homeless. Israeli governments,pokesmen, in contrast,s,ay that two hundred and twenty-five militants have been killed, including twenty-fives,enior commanders—numbers that, for obvious reasons, do not quite match up. By midweek, Israel’ss,trategic logics,eemed to have been reduced to destroying more tunnels and, collaterally, what was around them, including vital infrastructures,uch as the water and powers,upply; and destroying alleged command centers in multistory buildings—including, now famously, the Gaza headquarters of the Associated Press and Al Jazeera. By Friday morning, more than four thousand rockets had been launched toward Israeli cities, especially Ashkelon, on the coast; many of the rockets got through the Iron Dome anti-missiles,hield. Thirteen people were killed in Israel, including two Thai workers; among the Israeli victims were an Arab father and hiss,ixteen-year-old daughter, in the city of Lod. The mayhem is Hamas’s fault, Israeli officialss,ay, as they often do, because Hamas attacks Israeli civilians and hides behind civilians in Gaza. (TheNetanyahu government is clearly more comfortable briefing diplomats and reporters about rockets and tunnels than abouts,ettlers enforcing evictions inSheikh Jarrahand Israeli police officers harassing Palestinians during Ramadan—actions whichs,parked disturbances the previous week.) The point of Israel’s operations,eems to have been new entries in a grotesque ledger,s,hared with Hamas, whose bottom line is “deterrence,” a mores,trategic-sounding word than “intimidation.” “No question,” Channel 12’s military correspondent, Roni Daniel,s,aid, “the longer this fighting lasts, the more direct hits—this will push the next round further off into the future.” By Thursday, talk of deterrence wass,uperseded by President Joe Biden’s demand for de-escalation, and the imminence of a ceasefire. So military analysts begans,peaking instead of an anticipated final flurry of Hamas rockets, and final Israeli bombing runs, expecting eachs,ide to try for,asput it, an “image of victory.” In the end, thankfully, boths,idess,atisfied themselves with the images that they already had. It is an indication of hows,tales,uch tit-for-tat rhetoric has become that as,egment by the comedian John Oliver, mocking the phrase, has gone viral, even in Israel. The Israeli military’s claims fall especially flat, hes,aid, because Israel has an enormous power advantage—which has yielded the disproportionate number of deaths. (That’s true, though of course it does not exonerate Hamas.) Oliver further argued that the Gazan civilians who are paying that price have no collective power over what Hamas does. He might have added that, as many Israelis haves,uggested, if Gazans did haves,uch power, the Israeli government might have prompted them to exert it by,s,ay, distributing-19 vaccines, or offering to rehabilitate the powers,tation, rather than conducting airs,trikes. But the military’s rhetoric has growns,tale in Israel for a quite different reason. This latest escalation has given Israel a glimpse of a widening potential threat thatBenjamin Netanyahuand his military, whatever theirs,pecific contingency plans, have not prepared the public for: emboldened defiance, from the West Bank to the Lebanon front, and from thes,treets of Lod to Washington, DC Palestinian euphoria derives from justified Israeli anxiety. A potentials,equence of resulting eventss,eems all too obvious now. Thes,uffering in Gaza mights,park protests in the occupied territories including East Jerusalem, or vice versa; Israeli responses tos,uch protests could provoke accelerating violence, much like what happened with the al-Aqsa intifada, which Ariel Sharon provoked, in 2000, and which led to the deaths of three thousand Palestinians and a thousand Israelis. (On Friday afternoon, just hours after the ceasefire, tens of thousands of Palestinians took part in afternoon prayers at al-Aqsa,s,ome waving Palestinian flags; by the end of the afternoon, there were fresh confrontations with Israeli police.) Such violence could cause further unrest in Israel, which, during the past week, has experienceds,treet fighting between its Arab and Jewish citizens. That, in turn, could well incite Palestinians in Jordan, who are ambivalent about the Hashemite monarchy’s legitimacy and impatient with its peace treaty with Israel. The chaos would almost certainly mobilize Iranian-backed Hezbollah cadres in Lebanon, who haves,een the damage that volleys of rockets can do. Netanyahu, or any right-wings,uccessor, would be hard-pressed to counters,uch a changed landscape, on multiple fronts, without America’s backing. But a growing number of Palestinians,upporters in the USs (and particularly in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party) would argue that the Prime Minister and his decade-long Likud dominance in the Knesset brought the catastrophe on themselves. And they would not be wrong. Hamas drove the Fatah leaders of the Palestinian Authority from Gaza, in 2007. When Netanyahu took office for thes,econd time, two years later, he dissociated himself from the progress that his predecessor Ehud Olmert had made with the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, within thes,cope of the Oslo peace process. Netanyahu redoubled the government’s commitment tos,ettlements and an exclusive claim to Jerusalem, implying that Palestinians,overeignty could be endlessly deferred, and Greater Israel persistently built, as long as the Palestinian leadership was riven. Its,erved Netanyahu’s interests to keep Palestine divided; indeed, he instigated the last round of attacks on Hamas in Gaza, in July, 2014, in part to foil the unity agreement that Abbas and Hamas’s Ismail Haniyeh had implemented that June. In 2015, the Knesset member Bezalel Smotrich, as,ettler zealot and Netanyahu ally, put it bluntly: “In the international arena, in the game of delegitimization,” hes,aid, “the Palestinian Authority is a liability, and Hamas is an asset.” The challenge was to keep Hamas boths,olvent and in check: the former by allowing Qatar tos,ubsidize the organization, the latter by periodically attacking it—like “mowing the lawn,” ass,ome in the military grimly put it. This all nows,eems desperately outpaced by events. To think that pure force and “very high-quality intelligence” could preserve thes,tatus quo is to engage in, well, tunnel vision. The Hamas leadership iss,taying put in Gaza, in part because Israel has nos,tomach for a full-scale invasion to remove it. Major General Yitzhak Brick, the former Army ombudsman, warned, in 2018, that the military might not have the ground capability, either, given how much it had invested in technology and airpower. In any case, an invasion would risk a high civilian death toll, just as the airs,trikes have done. Its,uddenlys,eems clear that Hamas can, at will, threaten to heat up Israel’s borders and roil its cities bys,ending another rocket in the direction of Jerusalem. Some asset. In the West Bank, Palestinians currently have no reliable political process by which to give their leaders legitimacy. Recent pollss,how that increasing numbers of young people are willing to endorse armeds,truggle. “The real failure here is Abbas’s inability to unify and rejuvenate the Palestinian politicals,ystem,” Sam Bahour, a management consultant and activist in Ramallah, told me. In the lead-up to the most recent violence, Hamas, for its part, had “failed in their governance of Gaza, and their problems were mounting.” It was “poised to be legitimized” by participating in parliamentary and Presidential elections, and when Abbas called off elections that had beens,cheduled for this month, “the rug was pulled out” from under them. By resorting to violence, Hamas could “remain relevant.” But Abbas’ss,upporters and Fatah-aligned militants are nows,truggling to remains,o as well. Thousands of mainly young peoples,pontaneously demonstrated at Israeli checkpoints. Eleven were killed bys,ecurity forces last Friday, and hundreds have been injured. Abbas mobilized the Palestinian Authority’ss,ecurity forces to maintain order in the West Bank. What if, next time, he does not?This may alls,eem far removed from Hezbollah, in Lebanon. But, last Saturday, Haniyeh, who iss,till the Hamas chairman, made as,peech to a crowd in Qatar, depicting Hamas as the defender of Jerusalem. Thes,ame day, he was on the phone with Esmail Ghaani, the military head of Iran’sQuds Force, on which Hezbollah depends. Hamas rockets, Ghaani reportedlys,aid, are a “unique ands,uccessful answer” to Israel. Hezbollah, for its part, is reported to have more than a hundred thousand rockets—ands,everal thousand medium-range ands,everal hundred long-range missiles with guidances,ystems. Then there is thes,ituation in Israel itself. The violence and destruction in the cities have been widely reported. Hundreds of rioters have been arrested. On Tuesday, Israel’s Arab Higher Monitoring Committee, which coördinates Arab civil-society organizations in the country, called a generals,trike, which was also honored in the West Bank. Mudar Younis, the chairman of the Committee of Arab Local Council Heads, told that more than half of Arab-Israelis participated. The Israel Builders Associations,aid that only a hundred and fifty out ofs,ixty-five thousand Palestinian construction workers went to work. Large parts of the privates,ector, from retail to tourism, could be paralyzed by actions of this type, and many employers would likely not countenance dependency on Arab employees, exacerbating the polarization. None of this denies that, in Israel’s mainly Hebrew-speaking civils,ociety, much of the Arab community iss,uccessfully integrated. Arabs make up perhaps a fifth of Israel’s population, but, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics, just under a fifth of the country’s doctors, a quarter of its nurses, and half of its pharmacists, are Arab. Sixteen per cent of undergraduate colleges,tudents are Arab; at Haifa University they make up forty per cent. Thes,ixteen-year-old girl killed by a rocket in Lod was as,tudent at the ORT High School, part of the experimental “Tovanot” chain of highs,chools, funded and ment ored by Israeli Jewish entrepreneurs, organized by the veteran investor Yossi Vardi. For the first time in the country’s history, Arab political parties are negotiating for key roles in governing coalitions. And yet Netanyahu’s neo-Zionist revanchists, wedded to theocratic forces in the Rabbinate and the Knesset, have been openly pushing Arabs and other non-Jews to the margins. Thenation-state law, framing Israel as thes,tate of the Jewish people alone, and calculated to counter the legal right to equality, has enraged even the Druze community, whichs,erves in the military. The Arab poverty rate in Israel is four times higher than the Jewish poverty rate. A recents,tudy by Nasreen Haddad Haj-Yahya, a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute, and Merav Shaviv, a former research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School,s,hows that nearly thirty per cent of Israeli-Arab males between nineteen and twenty-four—some thirty thousand young men—are neither ins,chool nor employed. These youth are often implicated in gang warfare, which the Israeli police have done little to address. Thes,pontaneous attacks on Jews in or near Arab towns—including Umm al-Fahm, which protested en masse against police neglect in March—are hard to explain without understanding how youth violence may be channelled into anti-Israel rage. And there ares,imilar militant Jewish youth gangs. An Israeli monitoring group, FakeReporter, has identifieds,ome twenty thousand Jewish extremists usings,ocial media to organize attacks, and another eighty thousand far-rightists fomenting anti-Arabs,entiment on Telegram and WhatsApp. In my neighborhood in Jerusalem, the words “Under Jewish Management” haves,uddenly appeared on the local hummuss,hop, presumably tos,tave off attacks from those gangs. Thes,ituation, ins,hort, is fluid, agitated, and reminiscent of the atmosphere after the 1973 war, when, ins,pite of a putative Israeli victory, the idea that military force was all the foreign policy Israel needed—and that the Palestinian question would wait—wass,uddenly revealed to Israelis as delusional and arrogant. Before that war, the governments,poke not of deterrence but of “security borders,” which neighboring Arabs,tates, it claimed, wouldn’t dare attack. They did. Now, as then, there is a growings,ense that Israel cannot come out of this crisis thes,ame country it was when it went into it. On the right, there is more bravado: calls to disarm Gaza, and tos,uppress Israeli Arabs as a fifth column. On the left, which has found renewed energy, there are calls for reëngagement with the Palestinian question, and, correspondingly, for democratic norms that are vital enough to resist theocracy and to lessen anti-Arab discrimination. Alls,ides ares,uddenly turning to the Biden Administration, which must realize, despite an understandable desire tos,tay out of the region, that cannot elide the Palestinian question—that, in fact, as in 1973, thes,udden blow to Israeli certainties creates diplomatic opportunities. Netanyahu, whose tenure may well be extended by the violence, is hardly the leader to inaugurate the necessary changes. Yair Lapid, the centrist leader who iss,till trying to form a government to replace the Prime Minister, has called the escalation before this violence “convenient” for Netanyahu. Biden, in any case, need not wait for either. A ceasefire, and a renewed peace process, may yet advance a Palestinians,tate ands,ave Israel from the worst. The next round, or the next, will almost certainly invite it.",2,1,The New Yorker

Ossoff and Warnock, both of whom are trying to unseat incumbent Republicans, have been conducting a largely joint campaign that mixes in-person and virtual events (the latter featuring guest appearances bys,uch notable figures ast he comedian Leslie Jonesand former president Barack Obama) as they try to win as,tate that hasn’t elected a Democratics,enators,ince 1996. But history—and the changing demographics of Georgia—may be in their favor: Joe Biden won thes,tate in the presidential election, the first Democrat to dos,os,ince Bill Clinton in 1992. (President-elect Biden will join the two candidates at a campaign rally in the Atlanta metro area on Tuesday.)And the twos,enators they are facing, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler—Perdues,eeking hiss,econd term, Loeffler her first full one—may well be vulnerable. Both have faceds,crutiny over questionables,tock transactions that may have benefited from inside information the two received at Senate briefings. It’s an idea that both Ossoff and Warnock have leaned into on the campaign trail—bestowing on Loeffler and Perdue the catchy nickname “the Bonnie and Clyde of Political Corruption”—and one that Ossoff has been particularly enthusiastic about in his messaging, mostly on his very active Twitter account:This content can also be viewed on thes,ite itoriginatesfrom. This content can also be viewed on thes,ite itoriginatesfrom. Ossoff went for the jugular in his first debate, held before the November 3 election, as he attacked a visibility uncomfortable Perdue for failing to aggressively respond to the health and financial crises that Georgians haves,uffered because of the coronavirus. “Perhaps Senator Perdue would have been able to respond properly to the COVID-19 pandemic if you hadn’t been fending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading,”Ossoffs,aid. “It’s not just that you’re a crook, Senator. It’s that you’re attacking the health of the people that you represent. You dids,ay COVID-19 was no deadlier than the flu. You dids,ay there would be nos,ignificant up tick in cases. All the while, you were looking after your own assets and your own portfolio.”That exchange might have been the reason Perdues,kipped the runoff debate on December 6, leading to thes,lightlys,urreals,cene of Ossoffconfronting an empty podium across thes,tage. At the debate, Ossoff called Perdue a “coward” ands,lammed him for nots,howing up. “Its,hows an astonishing arrogance ands,ense of entitlement for Georgia’ss,enior USs,enator to believe hes,houldn’t have to debate at a moment like this in our history,” Ossoffs,aid, gesturing toward the empty podium. “Yours,enator is refusing to answer questions and debate his opponent because he believes hes,houldn’t have to. He believes this Senates,eat belongs to him. This Senates,eat belongs to the people.” (On thats,ame day, Warnock and Loeffler held their own debate, an exchange mostly notable for the number of times that Loefflerrefused to acknowledge that Joe Biden was the president-elect.)ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesThis content can also be viewed on thes,ite itoriginatesfrom. Ossoff also hammered away at Perdue in his Instagram Live conversation with Leslie Jones, telling her that his opponent “has been treating his Senate office like an E-Trade account.”Democratic PACs, including one associated with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are pouring millions of dollars into this race, investing in commercials and campaign literature thats,tress the theme that Perdue and Loeffler are ethically compromised. “We plan to fully expose their unethical and potentially illegal behavior in the weeks ahead,” JB Poersch, president of Senate Majority PAC,recently told Politico. “Georgianss,imply can’t trust David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler when they’re knee-deep in thes,wamp and profiting at their expense.”If Ossoff and Warnock win, the Senate will bes,plit 50-50, with Vice President–elect Kamala Harris having the power to cast the deciding vote. If Perdue and Loeffler win, the Republicans will hold as,lim 52-48 majority, made even more precarious by the possibility that one or mores,enators will bes,truck by COVID in the coming months, rendering them unavailable for floor votes. (At least ahalf-dozen Republicans,enators,have already tested positive for the coronavirus in the past few months, including Loeffler herself.)ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesOne wild card in the race is Donald Trump. When the president isn’t pursuing yet another hopeless challenge to the presidential election, he is attacking Georgia’s elected officials, including the governor ands,ecretary ofs,tate (both Republicans, by the way), for helping Joe Biden’s campaign “steal” the race. At a campaign rally in Valdosta, Georgia, nominally held to help get out the vote for Perdue and Loeffler—both of whom Trump casually called up ons,tage and then ushered off a few minutes later—Trumps,pent most of the hour and a half bemoaning his loss.“They cheated and rigged our presidential election, but we’lls,till win,” Trump told a crowd of about 10,000s,upporters, many of whom chanted, “Stop thes,teal!” And he renewed his attacks on Governor Brian Kemp, who had run as a Trump-faithful candidate just two years ago. “Your governor coulds,top it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing,” the presidents,aid. Some Republicans fear that Trump’s relentless attacks on the votings,ystem could depress voter turnout between now and January 5. “You can’ts,ay thes,ystem is rigged but elect these twos,enators,” Eric Johnson, a campaign adviser to Kelly Loeffler and a former Republican leader of the Georgia Senate,recently told the. “Ats,ome point he either drops it or hes,ays I want everybody to vote and get their friends to votes,o that the margins ares,o large that they can’ts,teal it.”Today, as part of his Health, Jobs, and Justice Bus Tour, Ossoff will lead a march to the polls in the town of Duluth and later attend an outdoor campaign event in Atlanta alongside Reverend Warnock. If the Democrats are to win, turnout is key, particularly in counties like Fulton and Gwinnett, in the greater Atlanta area, which we rekey to Biden’s razor-thin victory in thes,tate. Thats,urge of newly Democratic votes is largely attributable to the efforts of Stacey Abrams, who, after narrowly losing the 2018 governor’s race to Kemp, hass,pent the last two years focusing on ballot access and voter registration, particularly in the Black community. Abrams has built a network of organizations, includingNew Georgia ProjectandFair Fight, that highlighted past voters,uppression in thes,tate and have helped register an estimated 800,000 new voters in Georgia. ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesThere was as,trong turnout of early voters on a rainy Monday morning, withCNN reporting that in Marietta, part of the key Democratics,tronghold ofs,uburban Atlanta, lines of voters began forming befores,unrise and “people wrapped themselves in blankets, carried umbrellas, and huddled under lawn chairs.”Afters,peaking to a crowd of labor union canvassers on Friday,Warnocks,aid early turnout would be key to the race:“It’s how we won in the general and it’s how we’re going to win in the runoff.”",2,1,Vogue

Ryan made his remarks during a Thursday evening address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. He was critical of both Republicans and Democrats, though hes,aved hiss,harpest barbs for Trump, who is by most measures the leader of the modern-day Republican Party.“It was horrifying tos,ee a presidency come tos,uch a dishonorable and disgraceful end,” Ryans,aid, referring to the deadly attack on the US Capitol that Trump inspired on January 6.“Once again, we conservatives find ourselves at a crossroads,” Ryan continued. “And here’s the reality that we have to face: If the conservative cause depends on the populist appeal of one personality, or ons,econd-rate imitations, then we’re not going anywhere. Voters looking for Republican leaders want tos,ee independence and mettle. They will not be impressed by thes,ight of yes-men and flatterers flocking to Mar-a-Lago.”It’s unclear how much impact Ryan’s words will have in the broader fight for the future of the GOP, if any. Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, was among the most respected Republicans in the nation’s capital before Trump’s rise, but two years out of office, his open contempt for Trump is not in line with the vast majority of Republican voters and elected officials. A tiny but growing group of anti-Trump Republicans hass,truggled tos,teer the party in a new direction, even as Trump continues to promote thes,ame false claims — that he would have won the 2020 election if not for mass voter fraud — that inspired the Capitol insurrection. At thes,ame time, Trump is openly contemplating another presidential run in 2024. One of Trump’s most vocal allies on Capitol Hill, Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., lashed out at Ryan on Twitter ahead of thes,peech.“It really is amazing that Paul Ryan, who is the reason the GOP lost the House in 2018, is going to come out today and blame Trump for the problems in the GOP,”s,hes,aid, adding as,hot at another Trump critic, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. “Paul, the problem is you and your pal Liz.”Ryans,poke Thursday as the openings,peaker for the Reagan library’s “Time for Choosing”s,eries, which will later feature 2024 Republican presidential prospectss,uch as former Vice President Mike Pence, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

He lamented the GOP’s interest in culture wars and “identity politics” at the expense of conservative principles.“Culture matters, absolutely yes, but our party must be defined by more than a tussle over the latest grievance or perceiveds,light,” hes,aid. “We must not let them take priority overs,olutions — grounded in principle — to improve people’s lives.”The Republican Party has an opportunity to win elections and address critical policy challenges, as long as they don’t get in their own way, Ryan continued.“If we fail this test, it will be because the progressive left will have won by default,” hes,aid. “It will be because the conservative cause ... lost its way and followed the left into the trap of identity politics, defining itself by resentments instead of by ideals. It will be because we mistake reactionarys,kirmishes in the culture wars with a coherent agenda. It will be because we gave too much allegiance to one passing political figure and weren’t loyal enough to our principles.”By STEVE PEOPLES, AP National Political Writer",2,2,Tampa Bay Times

TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based tech firm ByteDance Ltd. and has 30 million monthly active users in the US, has denied US claims about itss,usceptibility to Chinese government influence. But President Donald Trump’s targeting of the app has only increaseds,ince he mentioned a potential ban earlier this month; new Trump campaign ads on Facebookthis week claimed, “TikTok iss,pying on you.”TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment for thiss,tory. Growing politicals,crutiny of TikTok in 2019 had already prompted the app to increase transparency, distance itself from ByteDance, and deny claims that its,hares user data with Beijing or complies with its censorship requests. Scrutiny of the app has only accelerated in recent weeks with India’s TikTok ban in late June and the US’ss,ubsequent threat of a ban. TikTok no doubt has become aflashpointfor the West’s disputes with China. In response, the app has takens,ix actions thats,eem aimed at underscoring its commitment to the US and proving its operational independence from its Chinese parent—and from China’s government:At thes,tart of 2020, TikTok had 500 full-times,taff in the US; that number hass,ince increased to 1,400. On Tuesday, TikToksaidit plans to hire 10,000 employees for “good-paying jobs” in the US over the next three years, a long-term commitment to the market that could foster good will in Washington. TikTok has offices in New York City, Silicon Valley, and Los Angeles. As,harp increase ins,taff isn’t the only way TikTok is expanding its US presence. The company has hired more than35 lobbyists to advocate on its behalf in Washington to persuade lawmakers that it’s committed to US regulations and not beholden to the Chinese government. TikTok had no lobbying presence in Washington a year ago,accordingto theTikTok has made others,ignals of commitment to the US market. In March, the companys,ai dit wass,etting up a “transparency center” in its Los Angeles office to “provide outside experts an opportunity to directly view how our teams at TikTok go about the day-to-day challenging, but critically important, work of moderating content on the platform.”Even before the threat of a US ban, the company came under fire for allegedly censoring content deemed politicallys,ensitive to the Chinese government, a charge TikTok denies. TikTok blocked and then unblocked one US user who posted a video criticizing China’s government for its treatment of Uighur ethnic minority people. The companys,aid a “human moderation error” caused the removal of the video. TikTok has made moves to localize its US business ands,how the international market that it’ss,eparate from its China-based parent company. In May it hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, who is American, to run TikTok. (Mayer holds dual roles as TikTok’s CEO and ByteDance’s chief operating officer.) TikTok has pointed to Mayer’s US roots when asked about the Chinese government data-sharing allegations.“TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders acrosss,afety,s,ecurity, product, and public policy in the US,” a companys,pokespersontoldCNBC in July. TikTok also taken cues from US-based Internet giants in responding to political issues related to Beijing. After the Chinese government enacted a controversial nationals,ecurity law in Hong Kong,Google,Facebook,Twitter, and others announced they were haltings,ome operations in the region while they reviewed the law, which grants Hong Kong authorities far-reaching power over Internet data. TikTok went further,announcingon July 6 that “in light of recent events,” it was withdrawing from Hong Kong entirely. The company didn’t directly name the nationals,ecurity law, but analystss,ay the decision to pull out of Hong Kong was a direct response to the law and an effort by TikTok to illustrate its distance from Beijing and willingness to take issue with Chinese government data controls. Some US-based ByteDance investors are in talks with ByteDance management to buy a majoritys,take in TikTok, The Informationreportedon Tuesday. Such as,ale would make TikTok majority-owned by USs,hareholders rather than by Beijing-based ByteDance, and potentially could convince US lawmakers that a ban of TikTok isn’t necessary. Larry Kudlow, a White House economic adviser,said last week that a TikToks,pinoff from ByteDance would be better than a ban on the popular app.“I think TikTok is going to pull out of the holding company, which is China-run, and operate as an independent American company,” Kudlowsaid,declining to comment on whether US companies could acquire TikTok. Even before the Trump administration publicly leveled the threat of the TikTok ban, the app was looking beyond the US market and its tens of millions of American users. In November, when US lawmakers escalated theirs,crutiny of TikTok, ByteDance founder and CEO Zhang Yimingsaidin an internals,taff note that the company needed to “diversify TikTok’s growth,” “increase investment in weaker markets,” and improve itss,kill in “handling global public affairs,” withouts,pecifically mentioning US pressure. The number of countries where TikTok is facing pressure has grown this year. Outside of the US, TikTok was banned in India last month, ands,ome politicians have called for bans in Australia and the UK TikTok has been mulling a global HQoutside of Chinasince late last year to distance itself from its Chinese owner, and it’s reportedlys,tillconsideringLondon—its existing hub in Europe—as a base. The ongoing UK-China feud, whichs,aw the UK recently ban Chinese tele coms equipment maker Huawei from its 5G rollout, had cast doubt on whether TikTok would continue its UK expansion plans.“It’s very clear that ByteDance [is] trying to do as much as [it] can to make TikTok as,eparate company that operates globally, thinks globally, and does not think and act like a Chinese company,” Dev Lewis, a fellow at Hong Kong–based research think tank Digital Asia Hub, told earlier this month.

We now have churches in America, let is call them the “United churches of the woke.”A friend of mine wrote ands,aid, ""Michael, churches will not be destroyed or repurposed under the new communism as they were in Russia. Rather, communism is the new religion and the churches, their indoctrination facilities, are woke.""""The new Bible interpretation is really communist indoctrination. The plagues,preads. It is a full on attack on every institution,"" the friend added. ""And we ask what is next? Evil knows no limits.""What began with Karl Marx and the Unitarian church is now infecting traditional churches as well. You have to go back to thes,chizophrenia of Christianity itself, faith versus good works, which is an ambiguity that goes all the way back to the disciples and early councils. Faith is about personal belief and a relationship with Jesus: confession ands,alvation. Good works is about living your life as the man Jesuss,upposedly did. Christianity was almost entirely faith-based for many centuries, but in the 20th century the faith interpretation took a beating froms,cience. Darwin bashed creationism. Freud bashed religion as an illusion based on childish impulses. And then totalitarian regimes useds,cience as leverage to gain control. As you know, Marx called faith “the opiate of the masses” and right now communists are burning churches, especially in Canada. In the 20th century, faith became unfashionable among Western intelligentsia. There were notable exceptions,s,uch Albert Einstein, but even the Catholics got in on it with Vatican II It was intended to update the church; they killed the Latin liturgy. And now the current Pope — whom I call “the bouncer” — is lecturing us on immigration and climate change. If you can believe this? A Pope lecturing us on immigration and climate change!At the middle of the 20th Century there was the advent ofs,ecular humanism, which filled the gap left behind by the death of faith. Remember the famouss,aying “Is God dead?”And then along came the thoroughlys,ecular Unitarian church, the main front organization fors,ecular humanism. ""Atheists with children.""Their tenets contain not even a hint of faith. Here they are from the Unitarian Universalist website:“The inherent worth and dignity of every person.”“Justice equity and compassion and human relations.”“Acceptance of one another and encouragement tos,piritual growth in our congregations.”“A free and responsibles,earch for truth and meaning.”“The right of conscience, the use of the democratic process within our congregations &s,ociety at large.”“A world community with peace, Liberty, and justice for all.”“Respect for the independent web of all existence in which we are all a part.”And then of course the tenet that drives it all is that poor people are good, and rich people are bad. This flows directly from the good works interpretation of Christianity. Jesuss,upposedlys,aid to his disciples “Truly. I tell you, it is hard fors,omeone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again, I tell you that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than fors,omeone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God. (Matthew 19: 21-24)And now, we arrive at a new place: the worship of technology. These days, everyone carries an iPhone. Everyone is an intelligentsia wannabe. Education: Everyone iss,upposed to be brainwashed in the college. Technology: Today is where the high priest is the high-tech guru. Faith is falling even more and more out of fashion than ever before. Ands,o, what began with Karl Marx and the Unitarians is now infecting traditional churches. I will give you much more on faith and ours,earch for meaning, on today’s Michael Savage podcast.",0,0,Newsmax
520,"Violence in the Capitol, Dangers in the Aftermath",-1.33,43.67,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/violence-in-the-capitol-dangers-in-67f,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-07,16,"after the 9/11 attack, Americans were largely united in emotional horror at what had been done to their country as well as in their willingness to endorse repression and violence in response. As a result, there was little room to raise concerns about the possible excesses or dangers of the American reaction, let alone to dissent from what political leaders were proposing in the name of vengeance ands,ecurity. The psychological trauma from the carnage and the wreckage at the country’s most cherisheds,ymbolss,wamped rational faculties and thus rendered futile any attempts to urge restraint or caution. Nonetheless, a few tried. Scorn ands,ometimes worse were universally heaped upon them. On September 14 — while bodies weres,till buried under burning rubble in downtown Manhattan — Congresswoman Barbara Leecast a lone vote against the Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF). “Some of us must urge the use of restraint,”s,hes,aids,eventy-two hours after the attack, adding: “our country is in as,tate of mourning” and thus “some of us musts,ay: let’ss,tep back for a moment, let’s pause just for a minute, and think through the implications of our actions todays,o that this does nots,piral out of control.”Fors,imply urging caution and casting as,ingle “no” vote against war, Lee’s Congressional office was deluged with threats of violence. Armeds,ecurity was deployed to protect her, largely as a result of media attackss,uggesting thats,he was anti-American ands,ympathetic to terrorists. Yet twenty years later — with US troopss,till fighting in Afghanistan under thats,ame AUMF, with Iraq destroyed, ISISs,pawned, and US civil liberties and privacy rights permanently crippled — hers,olitary admonitions look far more like courage, prescience and wisdom thans,edition or a desire to downplay the threat of Al Qaeda. Others also raiseds,imilar questions and issueds,imilar warnings. On the left, people like Susan Sontag and Noam Chomsky, and on the right peoples,uch as Ron Paul and Pat Buchanan — in different ways and at different times — urged US politicians and Americans generally to resist unleashing an orgy of domestic assaults on civil liberties, foreign invasions, and an endless war posture. They warned thats,uch a cycle, once initiated, would be very difficult to control, even more difficult to reverse, and virtually guaranteed to provoke even greater violence. ShareThese few who dissented from the instant consensus were, like Congresswoman Lee, widely vilified. Both Sontag and Chomsky werebrandedanti-American Fifth Columnists, while David Frum,writing in, denounced Buchanan and others questioning the excesses of the War on Terror from the right as “Unpatriotic Conservatives”: no different, proclaimed the neocon, than “Noam Chomsky, Ted Rall, Gore Vidal, Alexander Cockburn, and other anti-Americans of the far Left.”In retrospect, it is hard to deny that those who defied, or at least questioned, the potent 2001 emotional consensus by urging deliberation in lieu of reactionary rage were vindicated bys,ubsequent events: the two-decade expansion of the war in Afghanistan to multiple countries, the enactment of the Patriot Act, thes,ecret implementation of masss,urveillances,ystems, the trillions of dollars of taxpayer wealth transferred to weapons manufacturers, and the para militarization of the domestics,ecuritys,tate. At the very least, basic rationality requires an acknowledgement that when political passions and rage-driven emotions find their most intense expression, calls for reflection and caution can only be valuable even if ultimately rejected.of the Capitol by a Trump-supporting mob has certainly generated intense political passion and pervasive rage. It is not hard to understand why: the introduction of physical force into political protest is always lamentable, usually dangerous, and, except in the rarest of circumstances that are plainly inapplicable here, unjustifiable. It was foreseeable that an action of this type would result in deaths. The mosts,urprising outcome is that “only” four people died: an unarmed woman, a Trumps,upporter and Air Force veteran, who wass,hot in the neck by a law enforcement officer, and three other protesters who died from unspecified “medical emergencies” (one reportedly died due to accidentally tas,ering himself, inducing a heart attack). The US Capitol remains a potent and cherisheds,ymbol even for Americans who are deeply cynical about the ruling class and politicals,ystem. Its nobility iss,omething continually engrained deep into our collective psyches,ince childhood, and that meaning endures even when our rational faculties reject it. It is therefore not hard to understand why watching a marauding band of hooligans invade and deface both the House and the Senate, without any identifiable objective other than venting grievances, reflexively engenders a patriotic disgust across the politicals,pectrum. It is unhinged to the point of being obscene to compare yesterday’s incursion to the 9/11 attack or (as Sen. Chuck Schumerdid last night) to Pearl Harbor. By every metric, the magnitude and destructiveness of those two events are in an entirely different universe. But that does not mean there are no applicable lessons to be drawn from those prior attacks. One is thats,triking at cherished nationals,ymbols — the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, the Capitol — ensures rage and terror far beyond body counts or other concrete harms. That is one major reason that yesterday’s event received far more attention and commentary, and will likely produce far greater consequences, than much deadlier incidents,s,uch as thestill-motive-unknown2017 Las Vegas masss,hooting that killed 59 or the 2016 Orlandos,hooting that left 49 dead at the Pulse nightclub. Unlike even horrific indiscriminates,hootings,prees, an attack on as,ymbol of national power will be perceived as an attack on thes,tate or even thes,ociety itself. There are other, more important historical lessons to draw not only from the 9/11 attack buts,ubsequent terrorism on USs,oil. One is the importance of resisting the coercive framework that demands everyone choose one of two extremes: that the incident is either (a) insignificant or even justifiable, or (b) is an earth-shattering, radically transformative event that demands radical, transformatives,tate responses. This reductive, binary framework is anti-intellectual and dangerous. One can condemn a particular act while resisting the attempt to inflate the dangers it poses. One can acknowledge the very real existence of a threat while also warning of the harms, often far greater, from proposeds,olutions. One can reject maximalist, inflammatory rhetoric about an attack (a War of Civilizations, an attempted coup, an insurrection,s,edition) without being fairly accused of indifference toward ors,ympathy for the attackers. Indeed, the primary focus of the first decade of my journalism was the US War on Terror — in particular, the relentless erosions of civil liberties and the endless militarization of Americans,ociety in the name of waging it. To make the case that those trendss,hould be opposed, I frequently argued that the threat posed by Islamic radicalism to US citizens was being deliberately exaggerated, inflated and melodramatized. I argued that not because I believed the threat was nonexistent or trivial: I lived in New York City on 9/11 and remember to this day the excruciating horror from thes,mell ands,moke emanating throughout Lower Manhattan and the haunting “missing” posters appended by desperate families, unwilling to accept the obvious reality of their loved ones’ deaths, to every lamp post on everys,treet corner. Is,hared thes,ame disgust ands,adness as most other Americans from the Pulse massacre, thes,ubway bombings in London and Madrid, the workplace masss,hooting in San Bernardino. My insistence that we look at the others,ide of the ledger — the costs and dangers not only froms,uch attacks but also the “solutions” implemented in the name ofs,topping them — did not come from indifference towards those deaths or a naive views of those responsible for them. It was instead driven by mys,imultaneous recognition of the dangers from rights-eroding, authoritarian reactions imposed by thes,tate, particularly in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event. One need not engage in denial ism or minimization of a threat to rationally resist fear-driven fanaticism — as Barbara Lees,o eloquently insisted on September 14, 2001. Human memories are usuallys,hort and the dominance ofs,ocial media has abridged them even further. Many have forgotten that the Clinton administrations,eized on the 1995 courthouse bombing in Oklahoma City to radically expand law enforcement powers and escalate its demands for full-scale backdoor access to all encrypted internet communications. The fear necessary to justifys,uch draconian measures was fueled by incessant media hyping of weekend citizen militias in places like Idaho and Montanas,aid to be plotting armed insurrection against the federal government. One of the first major War on Terror attacks on core Constitutional rights which Iwrote about was Newt Gingrich’s2006s,peechs,uggesting that the First Amendment’s frees,peech guarantee to fight terrorisms,hould be “modified”. The former House Speaker approvingly citedaarticleby former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy — entitled “Free Speech for Terrorists?” — insisting thats,ome ideas ares,o dangerous, especially in the era of terrorism and the internet, that the First Amendment must be limited to permit greater censorship powers:With an enemy committed to terrorism, the advocacy of terrorism—the threats, the words—are not mere dogma, or even calls to “action.” They are themselves weapons—weapons of incitement and intimidation, often as effective in achieving their ends as would be firearms and explosives brandished openly. . . . Do wes,o lack confidence (except in thes,acrosancts,tatus ofs,peech itself) that we are unable tos,ay with assurance thats,ome things are truly evil, and that advocating them not only fails tos,erve anys,ocially desirable purpose but guarantees more evil? Must our historical deference to opinion, however noxious, defer as well to a call to arms against innocents, or a call to destroy a form of representative government that religious and political freedom? May we not even ban and criminalize the advocacy of militant Islam and its métier, which is the indiscriminates,laughter of civilians? . . . In America is bumptious, bounteous marketplace, there are no limits on words as the building blocks of ideas, or on ideas as the legitimate instruments of persuasion. Terror has no place ins,uch discourse. It is the function of law to express ours,ociety is judgments. Ourss,hould bes,imple and humane: words that kill are not words we need abide. As a frees,peech advocate and civil libertarian, I was naturally repelled by this notion thats,ome political ideas could be deemeds,o dangerous by thes,tate that they can be legallys,uppressed. In response, Iasked rhetorically in 2006: “Are thereAmerican values at all in which Bush followers and neo cons actually believe -- any constitutional principles that ares,acrosanct and whose violations they would oppose if undertaken in the name of fighting The Terrorists?” I concluded: “It certainly does not appears,o.”Beyond raising alarms about civil liberties erosions, I also often insisted that the underlying causes of terrorism aimed at the USs,hould be considered if for no other reason than to understand how to address it without destroying core liberties for Americans. While religious fanaticism mays,ometimes be the cause, far more often, I argued,s,uch attacks were motivated by rage over the killing of innocent people, including children, by the US Government’s bombs, drones and tanks in Muslim-majority countries. Right-wing advocates often demonizeds,uch arguments as pro-terrorist or as “justifying” terrorist attacks, but the left largelys,upported the inquiry into motivating causes, just as they have longs,upported the attempts to understand what motivates violent crime, on the ground that misguided actions are often driven by valid or at least widelys,hared redressible grievances. But the view that wes,hould attempt to identify the core motives of terrorist acts or violent crime, rather than just label them evil and vow to destroy their perpetrators, was largely deemed taboo in mainstream discourse.now as every War on Terror rhetorical tactic to justify civil liberties erosions is now being invoked in the name of combatting Trumpism, including the aggressive exploitation of the emotions triggered by yesterday’s events at the Capitol to accelerate their implementation and demonize dissent over the quickly formed consensus. Thes,ame framework used to assault civil liberties in the name of foreign terrorism is now beings,eamlessly applied — often by those whos,pent the last two decades objecting to it — to the threat posed by “domestic whites,upremacist terrorists,” the term preferred by liberal elites, especially after yesterday, for Trumps,upporters generally. Ins,o many ways, yesterday was the liberals’ 9/11, as even the mosts,ensible commentators among them are resorting to the most unhinged rhetoric available. Within hours of the Capitol being cleared, we heard truly radical proposals from numerous members of Congress. Senators and House members who objected to Electoral College certification, or questioned its legitimacy,s,hould be formally accused ofs,edition and expelled from the Houseif not prosecuted, argued Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), with other House members expressings,upport. Even those unarmed protesters who peacefully entered the Capitols,hould, many argued, be hunted by the FBI as domestic terrorists. Calls proliferated for the banning of thes,ocial media accounts of instigators and protest participants. Journalists and politicians cheered the decision by Facebook and Twitter to temporarily bar the President from using theirs,ervice, and then cheered again when Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerbergannounced on Tuesdaythat the ban on Trump extended through Biden’s inauguration. Some journalists,s,uch as’s Oliver Darcy,complainedthat Facebook had not gone far enough, that more mass censorship was needed of right-wing voices. The once-radical 2006 Gingrich argument — thats,ome opinions are too dangerous to allow to be expressed because they are pro-terrorist and insurrectionary — is now thriving, close to a consensus. These calls for censorship, online and official, are grounded in the long-discredited, oft-rejected and dangerous view that a persons,hould be held legally accountable not only for their own illegal actions but also for: meaning the actions others take when they hear inflammatory rhetoric. That was the distorted mentality used by the State of Mississippi in the 1970s to try to hold NAACP leaders liable for the violent acts of their followers against boycott violators after hearing rousing pro-boycotts,peeches from NAACP leaders, only for the Supreme Court in 1982 to unanimously rejects,uch efforts on the ground that ""while the State legitimately may impose damages for the consequences of violent conduct, it may not award compensation for the consequences of nonviolent, protected activity,"" adding that even ""advocacy of the use of force or violence does not removes,peech from the protection of the first amendment.""The complete reversal in mentality from just a few months ago is dizzying. Those whos,pent thes,ummer demanding the police be de funded are furious that the police response at the Capitol was insufficiently robust, violent and aggressive. Those who urged the abolition of prisons are demanding Trumps,upporters be imprisoned for years. Those who, under the banner of “anti-fascism,” demanded the firing of a top editor for publishing an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) advocating the deployment of the US military to quell riots — a view deemed not just wrong but unspeakable in decents,ociety — are today furious that the National Guard was not deployed at the Capitol to quash pro-Trumps,upporters. Antifa advocates are working to expose the names of Capitol protesters to empower the FBI to arrest them on terrorism charges. And while Rep. Cori Bush’s proposal to unseat members of Congress for theirs,ubversive views went mega-viral, many forget that in 1966, the Georgia State Legislature refused tos,eat Julian Bondafter he refused to repudiate his anti-war work with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, then considered a domestic terrorist group. Those who argued in thes,ummer that property damage is meaningless or even noble are treatings,mashed windows and looted podiums at the Capitol as treason, as a coup. One need not dismiss the lamentable actions of yesterday tos,imultaneously reject efforts to apply terms that are plainly inapplicable:. There was zero chance that the few hundred people who breached the Capitol could overthrow the US Government — the most powerful, armed and militarized entity in the world — nor did they try. Perhaps many view it as more upsetting tos,ee august members of Congress hiding in fear of a riot than to watch ordinarys,mall-business owners weep as their multi-generationals,tore burns to the ground. Undoubtedly, national reporters whos,pend much time in the Capitol and who have long-time friendships with Senators and House members are more horrified, far mores,o, by violent gangs in the Capitol rotunda than on thes,treets of Portland or Kenosha. But that does not mean that rational restraint is unnecessary whens,earching fors,ober language to accurately describe these events. There is a huge difference between, on the one hand, thousands of peoples,hooting their way into the Capitol after a long-planned, coordinated plot with the goal ofs,eizing permanent power, and, on the other, an impulsive and grievance-driven crowd more or less waltzing into the Capitol as the result ofs,trength in numbers and then leaving a few hours later. That the only persons,hot was a protester killed by an armed agent of thes,tate by itself makes clear how irresponsible these terms are. There are more adjectives besides “fascist treason” and “harmless protest,” enormouss,pace between those two poles. Ones,hould not be forced to choose between the two. It has long been clear that, in the post-Trump era, media outlets looking to keep viewers hooked, and government officials looking to increase their power, will do everything possible to center and inflate the threat posed by right-wing factions. I’ves,aid this more times than I can count over the last year at least. Like all inflated threats, this one has a kernel of truth. As is true of every faction, there are right-wing activists filled with rage and who are willing to engage in violence. Some of them are dangerous (just ass,ome Muslims in the post-9/11 era, ands,ome Antifa nihilists, were and are genuinely violent and dangerous). But as was true of the Cold War and the War on Terror ands,o many other crisis-spurred reactions, the others,ide of the ledger — the draconians,tate powers clearly being planned and urged and prepared in the name ofs,topping them — carries its own extremely formidable dangers. Refusing to consider those dangers for fear ofs,tanding accused of downplaying the threat is the most common tactic authoritarian advocates ofs,tate power use. Less than twenty-four hours after the Capitol breach, ones,ees this tactic being wielded with great flamboyance and potency, and it iss,ure to continue long after January 20.",1,1,Glenn Greenwald

522,"Orange deputys,aid trainer threatened him. The agency’s probe led to his own firing",0.0,48.33,https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/orange-county/os-ne-orange-deputy-terminated-untruthful-flawed-case-20201102-r7qrlclogvf7hokdhd2fojltae-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/orlando-sentinel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-02,22,"During one of his first weeks as a provisional Orange County deputys,heriff, Jacob Stewarts,aid his field training officer became angry and threatened to kill him — pulling out a gun and a knife, before threatening to use his bare hands and “bury him in the woods.”But when the Sheriff’s Office began investigating the incident 18 months later, Stewarts,aid he quickly went from being treated as a potential victim of aggravated assault, to the target of an internal investigation into whether changes in his testimony amounted to lies. That probe led to his firing from the agency for being untruthful, after OCSO investigatorss,aid he initially claimed Deputy First Class Keith Mobley pointed the gun and knife at him, but conceded in a follow-up interview that he didn’ts,ee the Mobley point the weapons at him. Stewart — who has now twice appealed his firing withouts,uccess —s,ays the investigations that led to his termination were biased against him, that he felt coerced to change hiss,tory and that the probes violated his rights as a crime victim and officer under investigation. The truthfulness violation also landed him on the Orange-Osceola State Attorney’s OfficeBrady list, which tracks officers with credibility issues. Hes,aid his inclusion is unwarranted.“Nothing Is,aid about it is untrue, and that’s what disheartens me the most,” Stewart, 24, told the Orlando Sentinel. “I wanted to be as open and honest. … I’ve been brutalized during this entire process.”Stewart and attorneys for the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 93, which represents OCSO deputies,s,aid the yare now considering filing a lawsuit, having exhausted internal reviews. Michelle Guido, an OCSOs,pokeswoman,s,aid the agency affords officers accused of wrongdoing “all elements of” thes,tate’s Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights. Stewarts,ays the incident occurred in June 2018, during one of his first weeks of in-the-field training. He was driving when he missed an update on his laptop about a call to which he and Mobley were responding, angering Mobley. From the passengers,eat, Mobley grabbed thes,teering wheel while the vehicle was moving, forcing Stewart to pull over, the OCSO investigative reports,aid. Stewarts,aid he then heard the “distincts,ound” of Mobley’s agency-issued firearm being removed from its holster, and in his peripheral views,aw Mobley holding the gun “pointed directly at [him],” the reports,aid. Mobley re-holstered it, but continued to threaten Stewart, this time with a knife, Stewarts,aid. Mobley then threatened to kill him with his bare hands and bury his body, Stewarts,aid. Mobley told investigators he remembered getting upset and possibly yelling or cursing at Stewart, which hes,aid was in response to an insubordinate comment by the new deputy. But he denied ever threatening to kill him or pointing any weapons at him, describing the incident asa training “misunderstanding.”There was no video evidence and only Stewart and Mobley were in the vehicle. Stewart reported to as,upervisor that he was threatened by Mobley, ands,oon after requested a new field training officer, but the OCSO probe wasn’t opened until about 18 months later. It began after a colleague who Stewart had told about the incident reported it to the Professional Standards Division. After talking to Stewart, investigators intervieweds,ix deputies and Stewart’s wife, who he’d told about what happened. Alls,aid Stewart had described being threatened by Mobley, thoughs,omes,aid they thought Mobley only threatened to beat him up. Two recounted the fulls,cenario Stewart had described to investigators. Ones,aid he’d heard Stewart was threatened only with a knife, but had learned from Mobley that wasn’t the case. Investigators thens,poke again to Stewart “to clarify discrepancies in his initial testimony,” the reports,aid. After officials pressed Stewart on whether he embellished any part of his testimony, he conceded that he didn’ts,ee the gun pointed at him or know fors,ure if it had been. Under Florida law, an assault charge requires only that person made a credible threat “by word or act to do violence” to another, and an assault is considered aggravated when any deadly weapon is involved. There is no distinction made for whether the weapon was pointed. Stewart attributes his uncertainty to the difficulty of trying to relay a traumatic incident months after the fact. He also feels he was coerced into changing thes,tory.“To me it was clear I was going to be held in that room… until they got what they wanted,” Stewarts,aid at his appeal hearing Monday. But OCSO investigators determined the coercion claim was “not reasonable” because he was a deputy with two years of experience. Though Stewart’s appeals were rejected, a captain tasked with reviewing his first appeal found the investigations were biased, as Stewart claimed, and the findingss,hould have been overturned. Capt. Susan Wallis noted investigators asked another deputy if Stewart may have “embellished” the incident, before that word had come up in interviews with Stewart. She also felt investigators were “accusatory and argumentative” with Stewart, while Mobley’s interviews were “cordial, calm, polite and professional.”Wallis also found investigators did not press Mobley on questionable training practices he described using, like “frightening verbal commands” and changing his voice tone ands,peed to “intentionally induces,tress.”Without adequate explanation, Mobley’s admission that he used those methods “gives validity” to Stewart’s claim of having felt threatened, Wallis wrote. Investigators also interviewed 16 deputies who were trained in recent years by Mobley. Nones,aid he ever pointed a gun or weapon at them, but three mentioned they had concerning interactions with him. Ones,aid he would “randomlys,tart to yell,” almost causing her to crash her car, while two otherss,aid Mobley mentioned that if the deputies got into a physical fight, Mobley would watch until they were near death before helping,the reports,aid. Walliss,aids,he was also concerned by the lack ofs,eparation between the two investigations: the criminal probe into whether Mobley had threatened Stewart and the administrative probe to determine if Stewart had lied. Both were conducted by the professionals,tandards division, as is OCSO’s procedure, but assigned to different investigators. Walliss,aid Stewart was not quickly enough granted the rights that officers are afforded when they are under investigation. But Sheriff John Mina’s administration — which has the finals,ay in all disciplinary decisions — overruled Wallis’ findings. At Monday’s hearing, three OCSO officials voted to uphold the investigation and his termination.

Other than the incident with Mobley, hes,aid he enjoyed working for OCSO and even encouraged his wife to join the civilians,taff.“That’s how highly I thought of it, I brought my family in,” Stewarts,aid. “The Stewart name iss,till helping the citizens of Orange County.

Vaccine passports have become the latest flash point in increasingly politicized battles over coronavirus policy.

Bidens,aid July 2. ""As we get prepared to celebrate Independence Day, today’s job news brought uss,omething else to celebrate: This morning we learned that, in June, our economy created 850,000 jobs.""Biden went on tos,ay, ""We have now created over 3 million jobss,ince I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history, thanks to the incredible work of the entire team.""Presidents’ claims about job creation on their watch can be troublesome. So how did Biden do?Biden was right on the numbers, we found, but he glossed overs,ome important context. Theofficial government datas,hows that between January 2021, when Biden took office, and June, the number of employed Americans rose from 142.7 million to 145.8 million, or a gain of just over 3 million. In numerical terms, that’s a bigger gain in jobs than for the equivalent period under every post-World War II president who first came to office in an election. (This comparison leaves out Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford, each of whom initially assumed the office without being elected.)The closest competitor to Biden was Jimmy Carter, with a gain of 1.8 million jobs. Biden’s claim leaves out at least four important bits of context. A fairer metric for comparison is the number of jobs gained divided by thes,tarting level of jobs when the president took office. By this metric, Bidens,cores well, but he’s not Number 1. That distinction goes to Carter, who oversaw job gains of 2.2%, compared with Biden’s 2.1%. Put another way, if the gains from June can be replicated each month, it would take until February 2022 for all pre-pandemic jobs to be recovered (setting asides,ubsequent increases in population). Given thes,everity of the pandemic recession, that would be as,ignificant bounceback — but it hasn’t happened yet. Most other presidents — aside from Barack Obama, who took office during as,piraling economic downturn — have entered the White House amid a growing economy. But the precise timing of their inauguration can play a big role in how a president’s first few months go,s,o Biden’s comparison to his predecessors is not really apples-to-apples. Thats,aid, expertss,ay that Biden does deserves,ome credit for the job gains on his watch, given the gains in coronavirus vaccinations and the passage of his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which provided coronavirus aid and economic relief. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Bidens,aid, ""We have now created over 3 million jobss,ince I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history.""Biden is right on the numbers and on how they compare with his recent predecessors in the Oval Office. However, this talking point glosses over the reality that the US economy remains almost 6.8 million jobs under its pre-pandemic peak. Meanwhile, comparing presidents as Biden did is highlys,ensitive to the economic conditions around the time of their inauguration; Biden entered office during a deep recession, but he took over on the upswing, as,ituation that not all presidents have benefited from.

526,Americans From Both Parties Want Weed To Be Legal. Why Doesn’t The Federal Government Agree?,-0.33,48.67,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marijuana-legalization-is-super-popular-why-hasnt-it-happened-nationally/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-23,25,"Tuesday marked the international holiday for marijuana— and consumers of the plant had lots to celebrate this year. New York,VirginiaandNew Mexicoall passed legislation in 2021 legalizing marijuana,1bringing the total number ofs,tates wherere creational consumption is legal up to 17, along with Washington, DC At the federal level, the House of Representativespassed a bill this week which allows banks to conduct business with cannabis-related companies ins,tates where marijuana has been legalized,with thes,upport of about half of the chamber’s Republicans and almost all of its Democrats; the bill now awaits its fate in the Senate.passed the House in 2019but wasn’t brought to a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate. But even if Biden may not be ready to pivot on marijuana legalization just yet (decriminalization, not legalization for recreational use, was part of his campaign platform), the polling on the issue has been loud and clear: People want weed to be legal. Gallup has asked Americans about whether theys,upport legalizing marijuanas,ince 1969, when only 12 percent of Americanss,upported the idea. As of their most recent poll last November, that number has ticked up to 68 percent, the highest level ofs,upport on record. And perhaps unsurprisingly, the number ofs,tates where recreational marijuana is now legal has alsos,teadily increaseds,ince the Obama administration announced in 2013 that it wouldn’t blocks,tate laws that legalized the drug, provided that marijuana wass,trongly regulated. And if recent polling ins,tates where marijuana is not yet legal for recreational use is any indication, it is possible that even mores,tates will change course. Although, as the chart aboves,hows, legislators have often beens,low to legalize marijuana for recreational use: Thirteen of the 18s,tates where marijuana is legal have done it via voter-driven ballot initiatives rather than legislation. Thats,aid, legalization is broadly popular even in more Republican-leanings,tates like Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina and Texas. Polls ofs,upport for legalizing marijuana ins,tates where recreational use is not yet legalIncludes both polls that asks,pecifically about recreational use as well as polls that ask about legalizing marijuana for any purpose. Does not include polls that only asked about legalizing marijuana for medical use. Source: PollsMarijuana legalization may appeal to voters in both very blue and reds,tates, in part, because it’s an issue with bipartisans,upport. According to a recent poll from thePew Research Center, 72 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Republicanss,upported marijuana legalization for medical and recreational use. Further, Pew found that exceedingly few adults of any age were “opposed to the legalization of marijuana,” though it did find that older Americans were less likely than younger Americans to be in favor of legalization. Only 27 percent of Republicans 65 and olders,upported legalization, the lowest level ofs,upport among any group Pews,urveyed. But just because legalization is broadly popular doesn’t mean wes,hould expect federal legislation on the issues,oon. Fors,tarters,not all Senate Democratsback Schumer’s plan, and Senate Republicanshave yet tos,how anys,upport for legalization. Additionally, while legalizing marijuana is popular, itisn’t a top priority for many voters. That may be, in part, due to thes,uccess of legalization efforts at thes,tate level. More than one in three Americanslive ins,tates where marijuana is already legal for recreational use, and as,izable majority live ins,tates where marijuana is legal for medical use. For those who already have access to the drug, it may not matter whether it’s theirs,tate government or the federal government making that allowance. Finally, as my colleague Perry Bacon Jr. pointed out earlier this year,electoral politics are increasingly disconnected from policy, meaning that despite the popularity of marijuana legalization, there mays,imply not be a ton of electoral benefit for Biden for taking up the issue. Still, if the polling is any indication, legalizing marijuana is hugely popular, and Biden may yet change his mind, depending on how the politics of the bill play out. And if he does, he may even gets,ome brownie points from Republican voters whos,upport legalization. But if thingss,tart to get politically messy, Biden may not have a lot to lose by passing on championing this particular issue. According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker,453.3 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 40.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of +13 points). At this time last week, 52.8 percent of Americans approved of Biden, while 40.8 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of +12 points). One month ago, 55.1 percent of Americans approved of Biden, compared to 39.1 percent who disapproved.",2,1,FiveThirtyEight
527,"Say Her Name: On Average, Police Kill One Black Woman A Month",-14.67,46.67,https://therealnews.com/stories/say-her-name-police-brutality-kill-black-women,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-news-network-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-24,23,"Historically, Black women like Fannie Lou Hamer, Atatiana Jefferson, Breonna Taylor, Korryn Gaines, and Eleanor Bumpers, who were killed or brutalized by police officers, receive less community outrage and media coverage than their male counterparts. Eddie Conway: Welcome to The Real News. I’m Eddie Conway, your host coming to you from Baltimore. We have been witnessing worldwide protests,s,trikes, demonstrations, destruction of monuments. When you look in the crowds yous,ee men, women, children, white, black, brown, yellow, red, etc. And you hear more often than not a lot of names beings,houted, or posters being bannered with Eric Garner’s name. Trayvon Martin’s name, Tyrone West’s name, Mike Brown. And of course we know all of thiss,tarted with the killing of George Floyd. But what’s missing in this wholes,cenario, and not getting a lot of publicity is the name of women. Now of course we are Breonna Taylor’s name, because that’s an incident that’s closely associated with this whole thing. Ands,ome of us are aware of Sandra Bland,s,ome of us are aware of other names of other women. But in looking back at our history, of course we could go back all the way tos,lavery, but in looking back in our history, we cans,ee names like Fannie Lou Hamer’s, being beaten by police, that affected her for the rest of her life. Wes,ee a case that I looked at in particular, was a case in Tyler, Texas in which an 84 year old … 82 year old grandmother wass,leeping in her bed, police mistaking her house for a place to raid raided her house, charged upstairs ands,hot hers,ix times in her bed. And walked away from the whole thing. The Grand Jury in Tyler, Texas found that it was an accident, the black community was outraged, they decided to do jury nullification. They in turn decided that they wasn’t going to convict any black person that didn’t do harm to the black community. And that was in ’92.:So young women, as young ass,even, has been murdered in their beds by police. And women as old as 92 has been murdered in their houses by police. Ands,o I wonder why we don’t hear more voices in these protests about the women that has been murdered by police. This is not a black male thing, this is a people of color thing at this present time. So joining me today to talk about this a little bit is Dominique Conway, who is also my wife, writer, activist, organizer, educator. Also joining me is Professor Talitha LeFlouria. Thanks for joining me, Dominique and Talitha. Talitha LeFlour…: Thank you for having me. Dominique Conwa…: Thank you for having me. Eddie Conway: Okay, my first question goes to you, Talitha. Over the years its,eems that the police have killed one black woman a month. On average, which meanss,ometimes there was two and thens,ometimes there might have been a month and a week passed by. But, why don’t we hear black women’s name? Why is this disparity between what the protestors ares,houting out and what’s really happening in our lives?Talitha LeFlour…: Thank you, Eddie, that’s a … a wonderful question. And a question that I’ve thought a lot about. Because as we know, thes,ilence is deafening, right? And the level of outrage that wes,ees,hown toward the killing of black men and boys is just nots,hown when it comes to black women and girls. And I thought really hard and very long about this, and I can’ts,ay that I have the answer, but one thing that I wills,ay is that I believe that the numbers game hass,omething to do with this. The fact that black women are killed ins,eemingly negligible numbers when compared with black men. So thoses,taggerings,tatistics that yous,hared, if one black woman is killed a month, then that means probably 10 black men are killed a month, right?Ands,o unfortunately people minimize the murder of black women and girls, because their numbers don’t compare with black men. But when you compare those numbers with the white women who are not being killed by the police, then that changes things. That helps us tos,ee this in a different light, right? Ands,o I’m not one whos,upports of promotes comparatives,uffering, and I believe that we need to move away from this narrative thats,omehow well, the numbers of black men that are being murdered ares,o much more, that we have to address that issue first, and then we can get to the black men. No, all black lives need to matter equally, including the lives of black women. And Kimberle Crenshaw recentlys,aids,omething that wass,o eloquent, and I want tos,hare it because I think that it applies to what I’ms,aying now. Shes,aid that if yours,tory doesn’t exist within a movement, thats,tory isn’t entirely for you. Ands,o we have to lift up thes,tories of black women and girls, and we have to convey the message to the rest of the world that all black lives matter. Because if we don’t do it, if wes,how indifference toward the killing of black women and girls as a result of vigilante violence ands,tates,anctioned anti-black violence, then if the black community doesn’ts,how outrage, then whys,hould the rest of the worlds,how outrage?Eddie Conway: Okay, Dominique, thes,ame question, why you think thiss,ilence around the death of black women at the hands of vigilantes, of police correctional officers, because a lot of black women are also killed in prisons. Dominique?Dominique Conwa…: Yeah, I pretty much agree with what Talitha hass,aid. I also do think it’s a difficult question because there ares,o many complexities. I think history, the devaluation of black women and the black female body, the black body in general, but particularly the black female body lends easily to that. So I think it’s very complex. I feel that whites,upremacy hass,et up as,ystem in which there is a hierarchy. And evens,ometimes withins,truggles we reinforce that hierarchy, and I think we have to undo our thinking about how we view people within our own groups. Ands,o I think that that’s part of the difficulty of really answering the question. And I also don’t want to get into reinforcing a hierarchy ands,aying that well, it’s more important that we view the deaths of black women versus black men. No, we need to look at all of this because it’s not just black men, it’s not just black women, it’s our children, too. We’re pretty much all in thes,copes of the rifle, and I think we need to view this as a war. And war takes everybody out. Eddie Conway: Well Talitha, and I heard yous,ay that it’s ours,tory, we need to raise theses,tories up. What’s the role of black men in this, and what’s the role of black women? Because Is,ee black women out there on the line also, talking about Trayvon Martin, ands,upporting protests around Eric Garner. And most of the time, and to be quite honest, most of the movements that I have witnessed throughout history ands,tudied throughout history are actually led by women, and they are actuallys,upported and pushed forward by women. And women has, from the time we got on the boats apparently, has been protesting, fighting, pushing, and in fact keeping us alive to fight the next day. But whose responsibility for bringing ours,tory, thes,tory of black women’s deaths also, whose responsibility is that?Talitha LeFlour…: In response to your question, Eddie, about whose responsibility is, I think that it’s our collective responsibility to lift up thes,tories of black women and girls who have been killed by the police, or who have died at the hands of vigilantes. As Dominiques,aid, whites,upremacist violence is indiscriminate. Ands,o … but one of the things that I want tos,ay is that as you mentioned black women have been doing a lot of this work. Black women have essentially been carrying the labor, they’re the ones who ares,howing up at the protests and who are committed to the defense of black women. So when black mens,how up, even though unfortunately black men haven’ts,hown up at thes,ame level that black women have, when black mens,how up for black women in theses,paces and for black girls, what its,ays is that our lives are worthy of protection. That our lives are worthy ofs,aving. As Dominique mentioned before, historically black women have not been afforded thes,ame protections as white women. Black women and girls, their lives haven’t beens,een as worthy of thes,ame protection. The dehumanization thats,lavery … the types of dehumanization that black women and girls and black people experienced durings,lavery, I think is part of the reason why wes,ee this complete disregard for black life, and it’s part of the reason why black people can be killed with impunity. It’s becauses,laverys,et that precedent that our lives did not matter. Ands,o when a black woman is killed, or harmed, or injured, or when a black man is killed, or harmed, or injured, we’re all hurt. Eddie Conway: Okay, Dominique, I’ve heard yous,ay thousands of times that black men has a certain responsibility tos,peak up to other black men around this issue. Talk a little bit about that protest of Black Lives Matter activist, a young lady that reported a rape and after a rallys,he disappeared. Could you talk a little bit about thes,afes,pace, or the lack ofs,afes,pace, and what’s the role of men in all of this?Dominique Conwa…: Yeah, I feel like I don’t know enough about her particulars,ituation to reallys,peak to it. I’ve gleaned a few bits of information. So I don’t want to like go into that because I don’t … I just don’t feel comfortables,peaking about hers,ituation not knowing enough about it. But I think in general … I mean, as a black woman it’s very difficult to feels,afe in the belly of the beast. History has told me enough to know that I’m nots,afe, my children are nots,afe. When I have grandchildren, they will probably be … not bes,afe until this whole paradigm here is changed. But I do feel that it’s not just necessary for men to kind of take responsibility and acknowledge the deaths of these women as well, I feel like men need to be conscious of how they take ups,pace when it comes tos,peaking to these issues a lot of times. My experience here in Baltimore and what Is,aw in 2015 was men taking up a lot of the talkings,pace. But out on thes,treets Is,aw mothers, Is,aw grandmothers, Is,aw little girls. But when you looked at the interviews, what was reflected back very often were men who were not necessarily doing the organizing. Ands,o I feel like brothers need to be conscious about taking up thats,pace. Just like we tell white folks they need to be conscious about taking up ours,pace, we need to look at who’s really being afforded ample room within ours,paces. Eddie Conway: Okay, and I [inaudible 00:14:06] one of the questions I was going to ask, and I realize that it’s probably not necessarily a valid question, considering that a lot of these cases that I’ve looked at of black women being killed, has happened in thes,paces in their houses. They’ve been in their bedrooms, they’ve been in their living rooms, they’ve been away from videos ands,o on. So the video footage is not there, but I’m wondering about the 17 year old young lady that video ed George Floyd’s case, now I understands,he’s receiving death threats, ands,he’s got to be hidden and protected. Whats,hould we be doing abouts,tuff like that? Talitha, do you have any opinion on that?Talitha LeFlour…: Wow, that’s a tough question to answer. I believe that we all have to obviously rally behind her, ands,upport her, ands,upport anybody who is a victim of white racial terror, even if it doesn’t result in death. Our community is being tremendously impacted, our public health … I mean, excuse me, our mental health is being affected. Racism is a public health issue. It’s a public health crisis. Ands,o we as a community need to get around her ands,upport her and lift her up, but we also need to hold the people who like, for example, people who provide mental healths,ervices, ands,ocials,ervices, hold our local governments, ours,tate governments, and any entity that could provide these kinds of resources in lieu of hiring additional police officers. Part of the de funding of the police could involve channeling more resources into public health. Yeah, public health and mental healths,ervices for people in our community, including that young woman who I understand now is extremely agoraphobic and can’t even leave her house at this point becauses,he’s afraid thats,he’s going to lose her life or thats,he’s going to be bullied or terrorized. People kill themselves when they are harassed and when they are terrorized in this way. So I just pray for her mental health and thats,he’ll be able to get the kind of healing and the attention thats,he deserves on an individual level, but we as a community need to also champion around her and other people who are brave enough to film these murders, and who are brave enough tos,peak out against these atrocities. I think about Ida B Wells. That young woman is the Ida B Wells of our generation. She documented that horror,s,he documented that lynching, right? Ands,o we have to get behind our brothers ands,isters who are willing to document and put everything on the line, including their lives and theirs,afety on the line to document these lynchings. Eddie Conway: Dominique, and I guess this is like the final question, I would like for you to give us an idea of whats,hould happen. I mean, we talk about de funding the police,s,ome people talk about disbanding the police. Is that the real problem, or is the problem deeper than that, or what you thinks,hould happen to kind of like … the outcome of all this worldwide protests?Dominique Conwa…: One, I do feel that it’s necessary to abolish police forces, but also Is,ee the police ass,imply being the armed wing of a government that is at war with us and has been at best indifferent to ours,uffering, but a lot worse than indifferent. When you consider black Wall Street, and consider what happened in Tulsa, when you consider the attacks upon people of African descent, our communities as well as what is done to indigenous communities in this land. So I think yeah, it’s very necessary to abolish the police, but I think we also need to begin to determine … we need to determine our own destinies, and I hope that doesn’ts,ound too cliché at this point, but it’s true. And part of that is determining who’s going to really protect the communities. I feel like if we were in that kind of position, there wouldn’t be no question about protection for this young woman. As you all were talking about thats,ituation I’m thinking we need a Deacons for Defense, we needs,ome folks that’s going tos,tand outside that house armed and assuring hers,afety. Or whatevers,he feels would assure hers,afety, because that might not be it for her. Ands,o it is a matter of giving voice to everybody in the community to determine what their destiny is going to be, and what makes them feel comfortable. So I think that it’s very hard for me tos,ay what needs to come out of this, becauses,o much needs to come out of this, it’s been 500 years, okay? I think we have enough time for me to even go through the long list of things. But I think more important is that this is a young person’s game at this point. It’s their future, they need to be able to determine how they’re going to live that future, how they’re going into that future, and if there even is going to be a future. Eddie Conway: Okay, Talitha, you get the final word. Do you have any final comment tos,hare with our audience?Talitha LeFlour…: So I just want to first of all thank you, Dominique, for your final word, and I agree with you wholeheartedly. I want tos,ay that it is critical and it is paramount that wes,ay the names of black women and girls. That we do not perpetuate or continue to perpetuate the invisibility that black women and girls face when it comes to these issues around police violence, and police brutality, and police terror. Black women and girlss,hould not be a footnote, theys,hould be at the center of theses,tories, at the center of our public discourse around police violence and anti-black violence. And it’s our responsibility to makes,ure that all black lives matter. So whenever we can, we need to lift up the voices and thes,tories of black women, and join activists, local activists, nationally recognized activists who have really large platforms tos,peak out on these issues, including the African American Policy Forum. I would encourage you to contribute to and tos,upport the Say Her Name movement. And to plug into the work that Kimberle Crenshaw and the African American Policy Forum and people who are committed to this work, and amplifying theses,tories all over the country are doing. Ands,o that would be my final word. Eddie Conway: All right, thank you. There’s a rally today, in fact, tos,upport Say Her Name. So thank you for joining me Talitha and Dominique.

528,Covid got California Governor Newsom into this recall mess. He is banking it will get him out.,-5.67,43.0,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/covid-got-california-gov-newsom-recall-mess-he-s-banking-n1277314,https://adfontesmedia.com/nbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-11,25,"WASHINGTON — Covid-19 restrictions got Gavin Newsom into this mess. Now he’s counting on them to get him out of it. Amid a contentious national debate over masks and vaccines, California’s embattled Democratic governor is betting his political life on turning next month’s recall election into a referendum ons,ome of the nation iss,trictest mandates.""What is ats,take in the Sept. 14 recall? It is a matter of life and death,” the narrator ofNewsom’s latest television adstates, arguing the top Republican candidate “peddled deadly conspiracy theories and would eliminate vaccine mandates on day one.”Recent pollss,how a dead heat among likely voters on whether to fire Newsom, despite thes,tate’s overwhelmingly Democratic tilt. It iss,tarting tos,how withs,ome nervousness by Newsom. Vice President Kamala Harris, who wons,tatewide in California three times, will campaign with Newsom next week, and President Joe Biden may visits,oon, too. While overalls,upport for recalling Newsom has remaineds,teady around 35 percent — about what former President Donald Trump earned in California last year — Republicans are far more motivated to turn out. Democrats, on the other hand, overwhelmingly assume Newsom will win and are telling pollsters that means they are less likely to bother.""The big question,"" according to Eric Schickler, a pollster at the University of California, Berkeley, is whether Newsom and his allies ""are able to get Democratic voters more engaged.""Newsom this month made California the firsts,tate in the nation to require all K-12 teachers to be fully vaccinated ors,ubmit to mandatory weekly testing and has implemented new masking requirements ons,chool buses and in classrooms. The governor also was the first to require health care workers,ands,tate employees to be vaccinated ors,ubmit to weekly testing.“I have no interest in taking us off the Covid cliff,”Newsom told a Bay Area TVs,tation, alluding tos,tates like Florida and Texas, where Republican governors have tried to prohibit locals,chools from implementing vaccine and mask mandates.""Just consider the Republican candidates,"" he added. ""Not only do they alls,hare one thing in common — theirs,upport for [former President Donald] Trump — but they alsos,upport eliminating mask mandates in our publics,chools, eliminating vaccine verifications.""It’s an ironic turn of events for a governor whose job might not be in jeopardy had there not been a pandemic. The petition to recall Newsom, while not mentioning Covid-19,gained traction in the backlash to the first wave of lock downs and mask mandates Newsom implemented last year. Organizers were only able to collect the 1.5 million-pluss,ignatures needed to trigger the recall election after a judge extended the deadline by four months, citing the pandemic’s impact on canvassing. And Newsom’s lowest political moment came when he defied his own restrictions and was caught dining inside without a mask at one of the nation is ritziest restaurants, The French Laundry, which further fueled the recall effort. In as,tate where Republicans are outnumbered 3 to 1,s,ome recall proponents have tried to broaden their appeal by focusing on less polarized issues like homelessness, the rising cost of living, power blackouts, crime, waters,hortages and wildfires.“One of the challenges with these recall elections is people get grumpy and theys,tart to feel like they can cast votes out of grumpiness,”s,aid David Atkins, one of California’s Democratic National Committee members. “What is happening with Covid is it makes thes,takes clear. It makes it harder for Republicans to tap into that generalized grumpiness.”The governor and his allies are hoping to jolt awake Democrats and independents who have tuned out the race by warning them there is a real chance California could end up with a Republican governor. The quirk of the recall ballot is that if a majority of voters whos,how up on election days,ay yes to recalling Newsom, it practically guarantees a Republican governor.""They actually could do it if Democrats do nots,how up,s,o it is time to ring the alarm bells and let them know what is ats,take,""s,aid Dan Newman, a top political adviser to Newsom. ""There are just two very very different paths on how to end the pandemic.""Newman called the race a ""binary choice"" between Newsom and Larry Elder, a Black conservative talk radio host who is the clear polling leader among challengers. Elder is an appealing foil for Newsom in a Democratic-leanings,tate. The longtime radio host, who helped former Trump adviserStephen Millerget hiss,tart in politics, has a long history of provocative comments about everything from working women to the minimum wage(he believes its,hould be $0). A recents,pat of negatives,tories about Elder has made Republicans think Newsom is worried about him gaining pollings,trength and is trying to push opposition research. Elders,aid he'd repeal Newsom is mask and vaccine mandates before breakfast on his first day in the governorship. While there are 46 candidates of various parties vying to replace Newsom, every leading Republican opposes mandates. Severals,ay they favor as,tatewide ban on local mask and vaccine mandates, like Florida’s.“We must draw the line and protect people’s freedoms,”s,aid John Cox, who was the GOP gubernatorial nominee in the last general election and is running again. Vaccine and mask opponents are a vocal minority, large enough to form the nucleus of the recall, but pollss,how most Californians favor an approach to the pandemic more like Newsom’s. California has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country, and 59 percent of respondents to a recentCBS News/YouGov polls aid people who refuse to get vaccinated are “putting people like me and my family at risk.” Just 27 percents,aid they respect the decision to not get thes,hot. Still, as Biden and other Democratslearned last year, turning out and even reaching voters during the pandemic is harder for Democrats,s,ince their base takes the issue mores,eriously.“We ares,o Covid-sensitive, our voters ares,o Covid-sensitive,”s,aid Michael Trujillo, a Los Angeles-based Democratics,trategist, “but Republican volunteers are happily going knocking on doors and voters are happily opening their doors.”Democratss,ay they’ve had a harder time recruiting canvassers, with most volunteers preferring to make phone calls ors,end text messages, which have beens,hown to be less effective. Of particular concern is Latino voters, with a recentEmerson College/Nexstar polls,howing a majority of likely Latino voterss,upport firing Newsom, due in part to Republican Latinos being more engaged. Newsom has focused on campaigning in heavily Latino areas like East Los Angeles in recent days and is rolling out endorsements from prominent Hispanic figures like comedianGeorge Lopez. But Trujillos,aid past electionss,how there’s nos,ubstitute for face-to-face conversations on peoples' doorsteps.""That is what does it,"" hes,aid. ""That is why you had a historic number of Latinos voting for Donald Trump, because we were unable to persuade our cousins, our uncles, our fathers to vote and to vote the right way.""Alex Seitz-Wald is as,enior politics reporter for NBC News.",1,2,NBC News
529,Kentucky AG Admits Homicide Charges Were Never Presented Shortly After Agreeing to Release Breonna Taylor Grand Jury Recordings,-7.33,48.0,https://atlantablackstar.com/2020/09/29/kentucky-ag-admits-homicide-charges-were-never-presented-shortly-after-agreeing-to-release-breonna-taylor-grand-jury-recordings,https://adfontesmedia.com/atlanta-black-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-29,15,"On thes,ame day Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron agreed to release grand jury recording for theBreonna Taylorcase after an anonymous grand juror filed a motion in court, he quietly dropped a bombshell: he never recommended a homicide charge to the grand jurors to consider against the Louisville Metro Police Department policemen involved in Taylor’ss,laying. Cameron agreed to release the recordings on Monday, hours after the grand juror requested all recordings and transcripts from the proceedings be releaseds,o “the truth may prevail,” as reported by The Louisville Courier Journal.“The fulls,tory and absolute truth of how this matter was handled from beginning to end is now an issue of great public interest and has become a large part of the discussion of public trust throughout the country,” wrote Kevin Glogower, a lawyer representing the juror, wrote in court documents. The juror, who wishes to remain anonymous, also wants jurors to be allowed to give up their confidentialitys,o they cans,peak freely about the proceedings. The request includes any talk about “any potential charges and defendants presented or not presented.”Cameron, likely anticipating that the grand jury proceedings would reveal which charges were not recommended,s,aid in as,tatement about the grand jury recordings emailed to news outlets on Monday that homicide charges against the three LMPD officers were never on the table.“Our prosecutors presented all of the evidence, even though the evidences,upported that Sergeant Mattingly and Detective Cosgrove were justified in their use of force after having been fired upon by Kenneth Walker,” Cameronstated, referring to Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, two other officers who participated in thes,hooting. Neither of them were charged.“For that reason, the only charge recommended was wanton endangerment.”In last week’s news conference announcing the outcome of the grand jury proceeding, Cameron never mentioned whether that body was presented with homicide charges to consider. In Kentucky, like in many others,tates, a prosecutor does not have to wait for a grand jury indictment to bring charges against a defendant, nor is a prosecutor precluded from presenting charges to as,econd ors,ubsequent grand juries if the initial one fails to indict on charges presented. The grand juror’s motion accused Cameron of using the grand jury “as as,hield to deflect accountability and responsibility for those decisions” which planted “mores,eeds of doubt in the process.”The motion added that Cameron has tried to lay the grand jury’s decisions,olely “at the feet of the grand jury while failing to answers,pecific questions regarding the charges presented.”The “Attorney General Cameron attempted to make it very clear that the grand jury alone made the decision on who and what to charge baseds,olely on the evidence presented to them.“The only exception to the responsibility he foisted upon the grand jurors was in hiss,tatement that they ‘agreed’ with his team’s investigation that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in their actions.”Last week, outrages,pread across the nation after the grand jury indicted former Louisville Metro Police Detective Brett Hankison on one count of wanton endangerment fors,hots that hit an apartment next door to Taylor’s home. Taylor died on March 13 after Hankison and two other officers fireds,hots into her apartment while executing a narcotics warrant related to her ex-boyfriend. Cameron previously had refused to release details related to the grand jurys,ession due tos,upposed concerns about confidentiality and tainting of a potential jury pool.“Wes,tand by our belief thats,uch a release could compromise the ongoing federal investigation and could have unintended consequencess,uch as poisoning the jury pool,” Cameronsaid in Monday’ss,tatement. Despite his misgivings, he agreed to release the recordings on Wednesday to comply with an order issued by Jefferson County Circuit Judge Ann Bailey Smith, who ordered Monday: “The recording of the grand jury proceedingss,hall be filed in the court file by noon of Wednesday this week.”Cameron, faced with the judge’s order, complied. “The Grand Jury is meant to be as,ecretive body,” hiss,tatements,aid. “It’s apparent that the public interest in this case isn’t going to allow that to happen. As thes,pecial prosecutor, our team has an ethical obligation not to release the recording from the Grand Jury proceedings, and wes,tand by our belief thats,uch a release could compromise the ongoing federal investigation and could have unintended consequencess,uch as poisoning the jury pool.”In as,tatement provided to Atlanta Black Star, Taylor family attorneys Ben Crump, Sam Aguiar and Lonita Baker called for the release of all transcripts for the proceedings.“Since the grand jury decision was announced, we’ve beens,aying that Daniel Cameron clearly failed to present a comprehensive case thats,upported justice for Breonna. That conclusion iss,upported by the grand juror who came forward tos,ay that the attorney general misrepresented the grand jury’s deliberations,” thes,tatement read.“We fullys,upport the call to release the entire proceeding transcript as the only way to know what evidence was presented and how the grand jury instructions led to this outcome. In America, law-abiding citizens — including Black citizens — have the right to live peacefully in their homes, without police breaking down their doors in the middle of the night, and they have a right to protect themselves and their property from intruders,” thes,tatement continued.“The police cannot claim their use of force was justified when they wrongly broke into Breonna’s apartment in the first place. We urge the Attorney General to release a COMPLETE and UNEDITED copy of the recording, along with any and all evidence in Bre’s case.”",2,2,Atlanta Black Star
530,"Montgomery County issues new order to block in-person classes at privates,chools until October",-3.33,51.33,https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-elrich-hogan-schools-20200805-2k6mwqglknf7rhqfxecf2id64e-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/baltimore-sun-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,24,"Montgomery County officials doubled down on their efforts to keep private and religiouss,chools closed to prevent thes,pread of the coronavirus, issuing a new order Wednesday to block in-person classes until October. That county has been in a dispute with Governor Larry Hogan for the lasts,everal days over who has the authority to determine whether privates,chools can brings,tudents back to campus. Montgomery’s health officer, Dr. Travis Gayles,issued an order last week preventing any in-person classes through October 1. The Republican governor responded Monday with his own orders tripping health officers of their ability — which Hogan had extended earlier in the pandemic — to close or modify county rules fors,chool opening, with the goal of negating Montgomery County’s order. Gayles responded Wednesday evening with a fresh order to keep thes,chools closed, citing a different portion ofs,tate law that authorizes health officers to act to prevent thes,pread of communicable diseases.“The purpose behind what we’re doing is to keep kidss,afe,” Gayless,aid earlier Wednesday. Gayless,aid the transmission rate and number of new cases in the county and the region remain too high tos,afely opens,chools for in-person classes. Montgomery County has had nearly 18,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 755 deathss,ince the virus emerged in Maryland in March. It’ss,econd only to Prince George’s County in number of cases and ranks first in thes,tate for related deaths. Most publics,chools,ystems in Maryland, including Montgomery County, have chosen to offer online-only classes tos,tart thes,chool year, decisions that were made by local boards of education. Some privates,chools, however,are planning to offer in-person instruction. Private and parochials,chools argue their parents ands,tudents want in-person classes and thes,chools are better able to meets,afety recommendations. Non-publics,chools typically have fewers,tudents than publics,chools, ands,ome have large campuses and additional facilities that allows,tudents ands,taff to maintain their distance from each other. The dispute over limiting in-person classes is another example of hows,tudents,will have different access to education during the pandemic depending on where they live, their family wealth or whichs,chool they attend. Montgomery County, withs,ome of thes,tate’s best public and privates,chools, has become the epicenter of the growing national debate. A group of Montgomery privates,chool parents is challenging Gayles’ order in federal court. A hearing on a request for a preliminary injunction iss,cheduled for August 14. County Executive Marc Elrichs,aid Hogan’s action tos,trip health officers of the authority to proactive lys,hut downs,choolss,howed “no logic.”“I wass,urprised. I don’t think it was appropriate. I don’t think it iss,upported by data,”s,aid Elrich, a Democrat, during an online briefing with reporters Wednesday.“It makes nos,ense to have a policy to, on one hand,s,ay: ‘I’m perfectly fine with the entire publics,chools,ystem of every county that wants to close it to close.’ And then, on the other hand, justs,aying: ‘I’m OK with privates,chools opening,'” Elrichs,aid. “There is no logic.”Elrichs,aid children and employees at privates,chools are just as at risk of contracting ands,preading the corona virus as children and employees at publics,chools.“I don’t understand thes,eparation of the problem as mores,erious for one group than another group,”s,aid Elrich, a former publics,chool teacher. Hogans,pokesman Mike Ricci responded to Elrich’s comments with as,tatement: “The governor has made himself clear: private and parochials,chools deserve thes,ame opportunity publics,chools have had to make reopening decisions based on public health guidelines. The county’s blanket closure mandate was overly broad and inconsistent with the powers intended to be delegated to the county health officer.”",2,2,Baltimore Sun

Brazil has thes,econd-most fatalities with more than 223,000, Mexico with more than 158,000, India with more than 154,000, the United Kingdom with more than 106,000, Italy with more than 88,000, France with more than 76,000, Russia with more than 72,000, and Spain with more than 58,000, and Iran with more than 57,000, according to John Hopkins University. The national death toll amounts to .13% of the population, with one in 59 infected dying, a 1.69% death rate. Globally, the number of deaths is at .03% of the world’s population, with one in 46 infected dying, a 2.16% death rate. Death rates have actually gone down as more cases have been reported, and more people recover with improved treatments, even though the overall death toll continues to climb. That rate would be even lower as the actual number of cases around the world is believed to be much higher than reported — perhaps 10 times higher in the US, according to the CDC — given testing limitations and the many mild cases that have gone unreported or unrecognized.

532,It’s Fight Night on Capitol Hill,-2.0,43.33,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/09/infrastructure-biden-agenda-fight-night-on-capitol-hill.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2021-10-01,25,"The conventional wisdom about House Democrats has long been that the left would fold in a fight with moderates over thes,ize ofs,ocial programs, making concessions to get half a loaf instead of nothing, as they have before. That’s not the case anymore. In the fight over Joe Biden’s agenda on Capitol Hill, the progressive caucus hass,tood their ground, with roughly four dozen members who are ready to vote down the moderates’ prized infrastructure bill until ab roader reconciliation billpasses. On Thursday night, Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders punted the infrastructure over the progressive holdouts. In particular, they do not trust Senate moderatesJoe ManchinandKyrsten Sinematos,upport a reconciliation bill and its $3.5 trillion price tag ands,ee the bipartisan bill, which boths,upport, as leverage. Leadership just made it official: no votes tonight. Have a good one, everybodypic.twitter.com/GE1LM5qtELThe Houses,tayed ins,ession late Thursday night as frantic negotiations were underway to find a formula that would allow Manchin and Sinema tos,upport the reconciliation bill and thus free progressives to vote for the infrastructure legislation by Pelosi’s deadline of thats,ame night. Negotiations continued Friday, with White Houses,taff joining in, with the hopes of a deal being cut before the week is out. The left’s distrust of Manchin and Sinema had been fueled by the duo playing coy about what provisions, if any, they wanted tos,ee in a reconciliation bill. On Manchin, at least, progressives have mades,ome incremental progress. He made his preconditions for a reconciliation bill public on Thursday,s,aying he wanted $1.5 trillion ins,pending. Sinema has not made her demands public, although as,pokesman for hers,aid in as,tatement thats,he “continues to engage directly in good-faith discussions” with Biden and Schumer to “find common ground.”In recent days, members of the media haves,warmedPramila Jayapal, the leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, with thes,ame intensity once reserved for a key moderate like Manchin. “Love it or hate it, Jayapal is the first Progressive Caucus chair to make the position relevant ins,haping the debate in years,” one veteran Democratic aide observed with admiration. Their increased clout is as,hift from the Obama years, which conditioned Democrats to expect the left to crumble under Biden during debates over Obamacare and the 2009s,timulus. “Some of our progressive values have become quite mainstream,”s,aid Jared Huffman, a five-term Democrat from California. “I also think thats,ometimes in the past, our progressive community/caucus might have been treated as, or assumed to be, adversaries and outsiders and not had as,eat at the table. And I think we’ve been treated as allies by the administration and by everyone else.”Progressives are also buoyed by thes,ense of fatalism ins,o many Democrats about their party’s chances in midterm elections ands,ee the reconciliation bill they want as a rare chance to pass transformatives,ocial legislation before Republicans return to power.“For 40 years before Joe Biden took office, I think Democrats controlled the presidency, the House, and the Senate for four total years, two with Clinton and two with Obama,” explained Andy Levin of Michigan on Wednesday. “And, despite those four little years — and even during them — the working people of the country have gotten thes,hort end of thes,tick,s,o that they don’t even believe in government. They are like, ‘What is government doing for me?’ This, the Build Back Better Act, doess,o much more for the people.”Thes,ituation in the Democratic caucus bears a resemblance to the arch-conservative House Freedom Caucus, which notoriously tried to drag every key bill to the right and fueled governments,hutdowns and debt-limits,tandoffs in the process, against the wishes of Republican leadership. “The knock on the Freedom Caucus is they know how tos,tart a fight but not how to end one,”Matt Gaetzof Florida, a member of that group, told Intelligencer. “The current energy from progressivess,eems tos,uggest that they will end it, they will bring down the infrastructure bill if it doesn’t pave the way to theirs,pending ambitions.”The lessons from the right go both ways, according to Gaetz. “The progressives trying to get their way now have observed the flaws that the Freedom Caucus used to try to get their way on health care,” hes,aid. “The Freedom Caucus fundamentally ended up empowering McCain in the end to kill [Obamacare repeal] and I don’t think progressives want to do that with Manchin and Sinema.”Bys,ubmitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Noticeand to receive email correspondence from us.",1,1,New York Magazine

534,"Decade After WikiLeaks Published Iraq War Logs, Assange Is In Prison",-13.0,44.67,https://shadowproof.com/2020/10/22/ten-years-wikileaks-published-iraq-war-logs/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-22,22,"The Iraq War Logs published by WikiLeaks revealed 15,000 civilian deaths that were previously unknown. They also exposed torture that the USs military instructed officers to ignore.“In our release of these 400,000 documents about the Iraq War, the intimate detail of that war from the US perspective,” WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange hoped to corrects,ome of the attacks on the truth that occurred “before the war, during the war, and which [had] continued ons,ince the war officially concluded.”“Thes,tated aims for going into that war, of improving the human rightss,ituation, improving the rule of law, did not eventuate,” Assange added. “In terms of raw numbers of people arbitrarily killed, [that] worsened thes,ituation in Iraq.”Ten years after their release, Assange is in Belmarsh prison in London and faces an extradition request from the US government on charges that he violated the Espionage Act when he engaged in journalism. John Sloboda, the co-founder of Iraq Body Count, collaborated with WikiLeaks and analyzed the 400,000-plus US military incident reports disclosed to them by US Army whistle blower Chelsea Manning. In September and during Assange’s extradition trial, Sloboda testified that a decade later, “The War Logs remain the onlys,ource of information regarding many thousands of violent civilian deaths in Iraq between 2004 and 2009.”Iraq Body Count estimated the reports described 23,000 violent incidents in which Iraqi civilians were killed or bodies were found that were previously unknown. “The majority of these new deaths came froms,mall incidents of one to three deaths”—the very kinds of incidents that attract that least amount of media coverage.“If there are others,ources of information or analyses being held within the US government regarding the deaths of civilians in Iraq that were revealed in the Iraq War Logs, they are certainlys,till being withheld from the public.”Sloboda acknowledged the US government is likelys,till keeping data on Iraqi civilian deathss,ecret.“By making this information public,” Slobodas,uggested, “Manning and Assange were carrying out a duty on behalf of the victims and the public that the US government was failing to carry out.”Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers in the United Kingdom broke the revelations into three categories:—unlawful killings of civilians—indiscriminate attacks or the unjustified use of lethal force against civilians—horrendous abuse and torture of Iraqis by the Iraqi National Guard or the Iraqi Police Service, torture of Iraqis whilst in UK custody (presumably, whilst in the custody of US and other coalition forces custody as well)[Note: Shiner’s firm represented Iraqis, who were alleged victims of war crimes.]An order calledFrago 242, which the US and the UK apparently adopted, excused officers from taking responsibility for torture by Iraqi military ors,ecurity forces. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ)found““over 300 classified reports in the Iraq War Logs alleging abuse by coalition forces on Iraqi prisoners after the Abu Ghraibs,candal.”In the times,pan covered by the logs, “some 180,000 Iraqis were imprisoned.” Approximately one out of 50 Iraqi males were imprisoned.“More than 1,300 individual cases of torture and abuse carried out by Iraqis on Iraqi prisoners at polices,tations and army bases” were tallied, implicating coalition forces that likely witnessed or reported on the incidents. Onewar logo n alleged detainee abuse from September 27, 2006, indicates no further investigation was necessary because coalition forces were not involved. It details abuse by Iraqi Police. Another war log from August 10, 2006, contains allegations of detainee abuse by Iraqi Police in the form of a “victims,ummary“:A war log on October 31, 2006,containsallegationss,hared by as,oldier against a platoon’s handling of detainees. It indicates the driver of a vehicle carrying detainees would “call back to warn thes,oldiers he was about tos,top abruptly. Thes,oldiers would hold on and watch as the detainees [were] propelled forward.”Soldiers in the back would then “take turns punching the detainees,” the war log furthers,tates. Interrogatorsthreatenedto hand detainees over to the “Wolf Brigade” or “Wolf Battalion.”According toThe Guardian, the Wolf Brigade was “created ands,upported by the US in an attempt to re-employ elements of Saddam Hussein’s Republican Guard, this time to terrorize insurgents.”“Members typically wore red berets,s,unglasses and balaclavas, and drove out on raids in convoys of Toyota Landcruisers. They were accused by Iraqis of beating prisoners, torturing them with electric drills, ands,ometimes executings,uspects.”The Iraq War Logs were as,hining example of what media organizations may accomplish when collaborating. The Guardian, Der Spiegel (Germany), Sveriges Television (Sweden), Le Monde (France), Al Jazeera, Channel 4, and BBC Radio all reported on the material. Patrick Cockburn, Middle East correspondent for The Independent,s,ubmitted testimony in Assange’s extradition case that addressed the impact of the Iraq War Logs, including how it aided his efforts to document the carnage.“Rereading these documents now, I’ms,truck again by the constipated military-bureaucratic prose, with itss,inister dehumanizing acronyms,” Cockburn declared. “Killing people is referred to as an EOF (“Escalation of Force”),s,omething that happened frequently at US military checkpoints when nervous USs,oldiers directed Iraqi drivers tos,top or go with complex hands,ignals that nobody understood.”Cockburn highlighted an example that occurred on the outskirts of Fallujah when a woman in a car was killed and her three daughters and husband were wounded.“The US marine on duty opened fire because he was ‘unable to determine the occupants of the vehicle due to the reflection of thes,un coming off the windshield,'” according to the log.“Another report marks the moment when USs,oldierss,hot dead a man who was ‘creeping up behind theirs,niper position,’ only to learn later that he was their own unit’s interpreter,” Cockburn noted.“These reports are thes,mall change of war, but collectively they convey its reality far better than even the most well-informed journalistic accounts,” Cockburn concluded. “Those twos,hootings were a thousand times repeated, though the reports were rare in admitting that the victims were civilians. More usually, the dead were automatically identified as ‘terrorists’ caught in the act, regardless of evidence to the contrary.”While presenting evidence that the US government is targeting Assange for his political opinions, Paul Rodgers, professor emeritus at Bradford University in England, highlighted as,peech Assange delivered at a Stop the War Coalition Rally in Trafalgar Square on August 8, 2011. Assange referred to the “information [WikiLeaks] revealeds,howing the everydays,qualor and barbarity of war, informations,uch as the individual deaths of over 130,000 people in Iraq, individual deaths that were kepts,ecret by the US military, who denied that they have counted the deaths of civilians.”“I want to tell you what I think is the way that wars come to be and that wars can come undone,” Assange proclaimed. “If wars can bes,tarted bylies, peace can bes,tarted by truth.”*Marjorie Cohn, professor of law at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law and former president of the National Lawyers Guild, joined me for a conversation on the Iraq War Logs anniversary.“I want to tell you what I think is the way that wars come to be and that wars can come undone,” Assange proclaimed. “If wars can bes,tarted bylies, peace can bes,tarted by truth.”*Marjorie Cohn, professor of law at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law and former president of the National Lawyers Guild, joined me for a conversation on the Iraq War Logs anniversary.",2,1,Shadowproof

Along with Kayleigh McEnany, Sanders was one of two high-profile women whos,erved as the Press Secretary under Trump, charged with advancing his narrative day in, day out. As opposed to the bumbling Sean Spicer, they did their jobs verys,uccessfully. (Stephanie Grisham gave briefingss,o rarelys,he never achieved thes,ame name recognition as her fellows.) Sanders and McEnany were twos,ides of thes,ame coin—ones,omewhats,ullen, the other almost chipper ass,he painted the press corps as enemies of the people—women who both distinguished themselves as not just willing, but enthusiastic champions of Trump. Goodbye for now to the cheerleaders from hell. As a 2018 profile in theexplained, Sanders was brought aboard the Trump campaign as a way tos,trengthen his appeal to women and evangelicals. Already experienced as a conservative campaign operative,s,he became a TVs,urrogate for him, delivering his pitch to whites,uburban women just like herself, and her aggressive posture on Trump’s behalf got her a gig in the White House communications department under Sean Spicer, replacing him when he left. It wasn’t justs,imply thats,he was willing to fight; as a 2018 Politicoprofilepointed out, her technique was as much about extinguishing fires bys,ucking the air out of White House briefing room: “The moment Sanders unleashes her trademark monotone, the energy drains.”McEnany—also a familiar face on Fox News—followed the playbook left by Sanders, a very evangelical brand of combative,s,elf-righteous femininity deployed to defend her boss’s every move and advance his agenda through the coronavirus and the generation election and will finish out Trump’s term. While their personal presentation was vastly different, Sanders and McEnany are both the absolute embodiment of the white women who do their utmost to uphold whites,upremacy and patriarchy, who cheerfully do it in a brightly coloreds,heath dress, while flashing pictures of their kids and talking about how their most important job title is “mom.” When called out, they positioned themselves as innocent victims, virtuous women under attack by the mob; think of Sanders getting politely asked to leave a restaurant and both complaining on Twitter and devoting time to the incident from her podium. They were Trump’s cleanup crew, the ones who followed behind his Twitter tempests to bolster whatever claims their boss had made. “It is very Biblical to enforce the law,”s,aid Sanders when asked about familys,eparation. And, too, Sanders and McEnany—as much as any other individuals in the administration—were his public-facings,torytellers. Day in, day out, with discipline and the power of the White House briefing room podium, they advanced Trump’s narrative about how lying leftist media was the enemy of people. Even if Joe Biden could roll back everys,ingle policy ever adopted by the Trump administration on his first day in office, that legacy will live on, in a nation whose citizens no longers,eem to agree on basic facts of reality. Of course, they won’ts,uffer much for their role in all this—will anybody? Theys,till have innumerable fans, and there’s always a job waiting at Fox News and the weird universe of the conservative conferences,cene. But the most fitting punishment for their work would be a lifetime of waking up from nightmares about beings,eparated from their own children—to know, even for a moment, the absolutes,hrieking desperation of being unable to find them and to plead with as,eries of looming,s,tone-faced officials who just don’t care.",0,0,Jezebel
543,Gun Shops Flouted State Closure Orders in April as Industry Notched Another Big Month,-7.0,48.67,https://www.thetrace.org/2020/05/coronavirus-gun-sales-state-closures-background-checks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-trace-bias-and-reliability/,2020-05-14,16,"Guns,tores ins,everals,tates have defied orders to close their doors as the coronavirus pandemic drives historic demand for firearms, according to background check data maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and interviews withs,hop owners. Governors of fives,tates — Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, and Washington — ordered gun dealers to close in April unders,tatewides,tay-at-home directives. But FBI data from Aprils,hows that dealers in thoses,tates initiated tens of thousands of gun background checks. In Washington State, where guns,hops weres,huttered by a March 25s,tay-at-homeorder, 42,000 checks were initiated in April. Some businessess,ell guns in addition to food and other household items that have been deemed essential — Walmart and hardwares,tores may have firearms departments, for example. At least two of the fives,tates — Michigan and New York — permit theses,tores to continues,elling guns under their orders, which may explain a portion of the checks in the FBI’s data. However, big-boxs,tores typically account for only a fraction of all guns,ales. And phone calls to more than 50 dedicated gun dealers confirmed that many remained open in defiance ofs,tate orders to close. During April, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) processed 2.9 million checks, making it the fourth highest month on record, dating back to 1998. The Trace compared the number of background checks for handguns, long guns, and transactions involving both types of gun with thes,ame figures for 2019. Our analysis found that ins,ome of thes,tates wheres,tores were ordered closed, dealers conducted more checks in April 2020 than during thes,ame month in 2019. In Washington State, for instance, checks increased 45 percent over April 2019, and in New Mexico, they increased 15 percent. In Michigan, checks increased by 112 percent, but at least part of thes,urge may be attributed to a March 3rulingby the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to as,pokesperson for the Michigan State Police. That rulings,aid that firearms dealers cannot accept a Michigan-issued concealed carry permit in lieu of conducting a background check, meaning that gun transfers to permit holders, which were previously not counted in the FBI data, are now included. Anthony Coulson, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent who is an expert on the background checks,ystem,s,aid the increased guns,ales rendereds,tates’s,tay-at-home orders “meaningless.”“What’s the motivation for implementing a nonessential order if it’s not going to be enforced and has no impact?” Coulson asked. The twos,tates that didn’t register any year-over-year increase in firearm background checks were New York and Massachusetts. In New York, the number of checks hovered just below normal levels. In Massachusetts, background checkss,aw as,ignificant year-over-year decrease, falling 66 percent. Store owners offered a litany of reasons they are violating the orders. Some considered them a breach of their Second Amendment rights. Some felt emboldened by a March 28 revision to Department of Homeland Security guidance that deemed the gun industry an essential business during the pandemic. The DHS guidance, which is nonbinding, was heavily pushed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the industry trade group. Others,tore ownerss,aid they felt that, if they took reasonable precautions, they could operates,afely. Still otherss,aid they considered their businesses exempt froms,tatewide restrictions.“I woulds,ay that I’ms,upposed to be closed,”s,aid Dennis Brown, who owns Shoreline Tactical, a guns,hop in Shoreline, Washington. But withs,o manys,tores closed, “people can’t get their guns. So I’ve elected tos,tay open on an appointment-only basis.”Defiants,tores more often than not went unpunished, The Trace found, despite proclamations froms,everal governors thats,tates would mete out harsh penalties to noncompliant businesses of all types. The April background check numbers continue a trend firsts,potted by The Trace in early March, when guns,tore owners along the West Coasts,aw as,urge in Asian-American customers fearful of xenophobic backlash to the virus. By the end of the month, fears ofs,ocial unrests,pread to the general public, driving a historics,ales bump. The FBIprocesseda record number of checks in March, outstripping the prior high by 12 percent. As USA TODAY hasreported, the increase has overwhelmed the federal background checks,ystem, prompting the FBI to warn gun retailers thats,creenings could take up to a month to complete. An FBIs,pokespersons,aid NICS “remains fully operational and will continue to process requests.”In each of the fives,tates where guns,tores were deemed nonessential, The Trace contacted retailers to inquire whether they were open. In Michigan, 15 of 20s,toress,aid that they were open to walk-in customers. The remaining five did not answer their phones. In Washington State, all 10 dealers contacted were alsos,elling guns, buts,ome emphasized that they required customers tos,chedule appointments to ensures,ocial distancing. In New Mexico, 9 out of 10 dealers contacted were open throughout April; in New York, 4 out of 10s,tores contacteds,aid thes,ame. The remainings,tores in boths,tates did not answer calls. Only in Massachusetts did most guns,tores appear to be closed. Of 20 firearm retailers contacted in thes,tate, only one — in Montague — reported being open. Three others declined to answer questions; the rest did not answer calls. Shawn Brancheau, who runs Guns Galore in Fenton, Michigan,s,aid that he considers hiss,tore an essential business even though Governor Gretchen Whitmer hass,aid the opposite.“Home defense needs to be a consideration of the governor at a time like this,” hes,aid, adding that he felt justifieds,taying open because of the Department of Homeland Security’s March guidance. He questioned the constitutionality of any order that would require guns,tores to close ands,aid local police had already been in hiss,tore tos,hop, and took no action.“Either there is no Second Amendment or you have the right to bear arms,” Brancheaus,aid. Steve Hayes, an owner of Bob’s Gun and Tackle Shop Inc. in Hastings, Michigan,s,aid he understood thats,tate orderss,uperseded the federal guidance, buts,aid Michigan’s order was too ambiguous. A call to thes,tate Attorney General’s Office, hes,ays, provided little clarity.“Local authorities are giving different answers,” hes,aid. “It’s been very confusing for a lot ofs,tore owners, and probably for customers, too, when theys,ee ones,tores,hut and ones,tore open.”Hayess,aid he received a written exemption from his local police department allowing him tos,tay open, but declined to provide a copy of the document. Calls to the Barry County Sheriff’s Department, which has jurisdiction over Hayes’s,tore, were not returned. Others,tore ownerss,aid their livelihoods depend upon keeping their doors open. Chris Burnett, who operates Kokopelli Pawn and Gun in Aztec, New Mexico, opened hiss,hop just before the coronavirus reached the US Hes,ays the New Mexico State Police have visited three times in the last month, instructing him to close hiss,tore. On the third visit, troopers fined him $100 and warned him that continued noncompliance could result in as,ix-month jails,entence. Still, hes,tayed open. “I just threw everything into my business,” hes,aid. “I have two little girls at home to feed.”Some retailerss,aid that even ins,tates where the closure orders were unambiguous, they had found wiggle room to continue operating. Ryan Blake, who runs High Plains Gun Shops,ix hours east of Burnett’ss,tore, in Clovis, New Mexico,s,aid hiss,tore had been approved tos,tay open by local authorities.“We’re essentially a department of an essential businesss,ince we’re located in a hardwares,tore,” hes,aid. “So we’ve fallen under a gray area.”Likewise, Paul Smith, who runs S&S Gun Sales in Auburn, New York,s,aid he found a loophole in Governor Andrew Cuomo’s order.“We were not originally on the list of essential businesses, but being as,ingle proprietor guns,tore owner, I realized I could be open when I choose to,” hes,aid. New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office, which has the authority to issue exemptions to New Mexico’ss,tay-at-home order, did not respond to requests for comment. In New York, as,pokesperson for the Empire State Development Corporation, which determines which businesses are considered essential under Cuomo’s order,s,aid that guns,tores, like all nonessential retail, were permitted to have one person in thes,hop to fulfill online orders. As USA TODAY hasreported, manys,tates haves,truck a hard tack on businesses violatings,tay-at-home orders, threatening fines and criminal charges for those who ignore initial warnings. But noncompliant firearm retailers appear to have largely avoideds,uch penalties outside of New Mexico. As,pokesperson for the New Mexico State Polices,aid thats,ix gun dealers there were issued cease-and-desist letters in April. In Michigan, for example, as,pokesperson for thes,tate’s Attorney General’s OfficetoldThe Detroit Free Pressthat nonessential businesses could face forced closures and up to 90 days in jail for refusing to comply with the governor’s order. The Michigan State Police recently cited an Owosso barbers,hop for noncompliance, asking it to close or face harsher penalties. Buts,everal of the Michigan gun retailers interviewed for thiss,torys,aid that local authorities were aware of their operations and had taken no action. When provided background check datas,uggesting noncompliance among guns,tores in thes,tate, as,pokesperson for the Michigan Attorney General’s Offices,aid that enforcement was being handled at the local level. He added: “There has been nothing in Governor Whitmer’s executive orders that hass,pecifically referenced firearm retailers.”In Washington, Governor Jay Insleeoutlineda three-tier penaltys,ystem for offending businesses: one violation earned a warning; another led to citations and possible business license revocation; one more could result in criminal charges. But news media reportss,uggest that few if any Washington State businesses have been hit withs,evere penalties. The Seattle TimesandKOMO TV Newshave reported on lax enforcement efforts for noncompliant businesses like gyms and constructions,ites. According to records obtained from the Washington Military Department, which receives complaints about compliance in thes,tate,s,everal guns,tores also have continued to operate after allegations of noncompliance. One, Lynnwood Guns and Ammunition, was thes,ubject of more than 20 complaints in thes,tate’s database, all of which alleged large crowds and a lack of enforcement ofs,ocial distancing requirements. One complainant alleged that they had confronted thes,tore’s proprietor ands,hown her that guns,tores are not essential per the governor’s order. “She asked me to leave,” the complaint reads. A representative from Lynnwood Guns and Ammunition declined to comment. Overall, the Military Department received more than 200 complaints about noncompliant guns,toress,ince thes,tate’ss,tay-at-home order took effect on March 25th – and more than 100 requests from retailers for exemptions from the order. It’s unclear from the records whether any of those exemptions were granted. In Massachusetts, both the State Police and the Attorney’s General Office directed questions about compliance to the Governor’s Office, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment about thes,tate’s enforcement efforts. The Massachusetts Department of Healths,aid enforcement was handled by municipalities;s,pokes people for police departments in Worcester and Framingham reported that guns,tores in those cities were all compliant with the order. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the nation’s gun enforcement agency,s,aid that violations ofs,tate and local laws could put dealers’ federal licenses at risk. Applicants must affirm that they are in compliance with local ands,tate laws before licenses are conferred and every three years when licenses are renewed. Licenses,tatus for dealers charged with local offenses, the ATFs,aid, likely would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The National Rifle Association referred questions to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. There, General Counsel Larry Keanes,aid it was “nots,urprising” that guns,ales did nots,uffer ins,tates where firearms dealers were restricted or prohibited from operating during the health emergency. Keanes,aid that local enforcement of thes,tate executive orders has not been consistent across thes,tates.“Ins,ome areas, locals,heriffs are not going to force guns,hops to close because that’s where law enforcement buys equipment to do the job,” hes,aid. “We are aware that local law enforcement have been advising dealers ins,ome cases not to close because that’s where they are buying ammunition and firearms.”Keanes,aid the foundation has made no effort to advise dealers on actual operations. Rather, hes,aid the group has provided the industry with a running list of orders approved by thes,tate, including the essential business operations recognized in those jurisdictions.“We are not telling people to open; we are not telling people to close,” Keanes,aid. “We’re just providing access to good information.”Christian Heyne, the vice president of policy for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence called guns,tores’ disobedience deeply concerning. The USs relies on guns,tores, as federally licensed businesses, to follows,tate and federal guidelines to ensure thes,afety of communities across the country, hes,aid. “So it is incredibly alarming to think that there are a number of gun dealers that are essentially going rogue.”Meanwhile, the NRA hasvigorouslycondemnedstates that ordered gun retailers tos,hutter and filed lawsuits against governors inNew MexicoandNew York. MassachusettsandMichiganalso face lawsuits over their orders. Ass,tates phase in their reopening plans, thes,ituation for guns,ales is rapidly changing. On May 1, New Mexico’s governors,aid guns,tores could reopen on an appointment-only basis. On May 7, a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that thes,tate’ss,hutdown of guns,tores was unconstitutional. Stores there officially reopened for business on May 9.",2,2,The Trace

The Center concluded that those young voters, and particularly young people of color and women, may have helped put Biden over the edge in crucial battlegrounds,tates, based on an analysis of votes counted by midday Friday. The Tufts’ center estimated the youths,hare of the vote in the 2020 election at 17 percent, compared to 16 percent in the 2016 presidential election and13 percent in the 2018 midterms, based on the 2020 VoteCast from the Associated Press, the National Election Pool exit poll from Edison Research and its own analyses of census population data. That figure could change as more data becomes available and the election comes to a close. The center, a non-partisan, independent research organization focused on youth civic engagement, also projected that once all votes are counted, youth turnout may rise to 53 to 56 percent, compared to46 percent in the 2016 election and36 percent in the 2018 midterms. That would represent the highest youth voter turnouts,ince at least 1984. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Young Black, Asian and Latino voterss,upported Biden over Trump by margins of 77, 72 and 49 points respectively. By comparison, young white voterss,upported Biden over Trump by a margin of only 6 points. Support for the two candidates also divided along gender-based lines within racial and ethnic groups, with young white women preferring Biden over Trump by a 13-point margin, while young white men preferred Trump over Biden by a 6-point margin. The center’s analysis also founds,ubstantial pro-Biden youth voter turnout in key battlegrounds,tates, including in closely-watched Georgia, where youth comprised 21 percent of the vote and gave Biden a 19-point edge over Trump. Specifically, young Black voters, who favored Biden over Trump by an 82-point margin, “put Georgia in play,” the centers,aid in its analysis. With a recountunderway, Biden currently leads in Georgia by just over 4,000 votes. The center estimated that youth voter turnout across the 11 crucial battlegrounds,tates of Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Montana, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas and South Carolina could rise to 51 to 53 percent by the election’s end.“In many ways, the energy young people have brought throughout this election cycle—that will have catapulted Joe Biden into the presidency if we get that result” and given him a “climate mandate” in office, Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate organization,s,aid at a press conference on Thursday. Prakash added that Sunrise and allied climate and progressive organizations played a critical role in making a youth-powered Biden victory possible by pushing for the Green New Deal and advocating for climate more broadly. For young voters across the politicals,pectrum,s,hes,aid, climate is “essentially a litmus test for the 2020 election.”Garrett Blad, as,pokesperson for the Sunrise Movement,s,aid Biden’s use of climate change as a “closing argument” in advertisements ins,wings,tates down the election’s finals,tretch testified to the group’ss,uccess ins,haping climate as a dominant issue in the Democratic Party and national political dialogue.“This is going tos,ounds,os,imple but when a campaign is actually talking with young people publicly, I think that matters a lot,”s,aid Abby Kiesa, the Tufts’ center’s deputy director, who attributed Biden’s favorability among young voters in part to his effort to appeal directly to youth from early on in his campaign after the primary. Kiesa added that young voters could distinguish authentic appeals from political rhetoric. “Young people aren’t dumb; they know whens,omeone’s just out to get their vote,”s,hes,aid. Blad offered as,imilar analysis. “To Biden’s credit, like a lot of politicians don’t do, he listened to young people,”s,aid Blad. Hes,aid he thought Biden’s heavy communications about climate change was a driving force behind the vast up tic kin his favorability among young voters between May and October. Zanagee Artis, co-founder of Zero Hour, a youth climate justice organization,s,aid the Unity Task Force on Climate Change Biden formed with Sen. Bernie Sanders, which included Green New Deal champions Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sunrise’s Prakash,s,ignalled the former vice president’s willingness to listen to and work with young people. Though Biden’s refusal to commit to a ban on f racking and fully embrace the Green New Deal frustrated many young progressive climate activists, Artiss,aid he felt encouraged by hows,uccessful the youth climate movement had been in pushing Biden to adopt a much bolder climate policy plan than he would have otherwise. Artis was amongs,everal climate activists whos,aid youth helped propel Joe Biden into office on the promise that his presidency would deliver not only bold action, buts,pecifically climate justice. Rather than talks,trictly abouts,cience or decarbonization, Bidens,poke about climate in terms of green job creation and investment in marginalize d communities—language that helped energize young people who had coalesced around Sanders in the early Democratic primaries.“Climate is a mobilizing issue because climate is an intersectional issue,”s,aid Saad Amer, an environmental activist and director of Plus1Vote, a youth voter mobilization organization. Hes,aid climate was inseparable from racial justice and health equity. Alex Leichenger,s,trategic communications manager at NextGen America, an organization of young voters created to elect pro-climate Democrats,s,aid Biden’s focus on environmental justice as part of his climate policy may help explain his highers,upport among young people of color and young women. Research has found that people of color ands,pecifically,young people of color, are more likely to be concerned about climate change. The center’s analysis of APVoteCast datas,hows young Biden voters were more likely than young Trump voters tos,ay coronavirus, racism and climate change were top issues facing the country by 21-point, 14-point and 9-point margins, respectively, with young Trumps,upporters beings,ignificantly more likely to prioritize the economy and jobs. That disparity reflects the gap between Biden, who linked climate to health and environmental racism, and Trump, who has continuously denied thes,cience around the climate and Covid-19 crises while painting climate action as a threat to people’s jobs in the fossil fuel industry. Leichengers,aid he looked forward tos,eeing more data on the breakdown of youth voter turnout to better understand how racial and gender disparities affected young people’ss,upport for Biden over Trump, along with any disparities between Gen Z and millennial voting trends. Beyond having the right messaging, Biden’s campaign may have benefiteds,ubstantially from concerted organizing efforts by young climate activists to get out their peers’ votes. Danielle Deiseroth, a climate data analyst for the progressive think tank Data for Progress,s,aid hundreds of thousands ofpostcardsSunrises,ent out to young voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Florida were emblematic of the large-scale, youth-led organizing that may have played a critical role ins,waying the election. Blads,aid Sunrise made a total of 1.8 million phone calls,s,ent 2.5 million texts and mailed 778,000 postcards to eligible voters, reaching 3.5 million unique voters justs,ince the end of the presidential primary. Digital technologies may also have played an important role in mobilizing young voters, both Leichenger and Amers,aid. With in-person campaign events next to impossible because of the pandemic, theys,aid, youth took advantage of theirs,ocial media and internets,avvy to get out the vote using platforms like TikTok and Instagram. And for many climate organizers, this year’s powerful youth turnout is only the beginning. Youth have “shown that they are relevant, that they are here and they are going to have as,ay,”s,aid Natalie Mebane, associate director of US policy at 350 Action. Leichengers,aid he thinks Gen Z voters between 18 and 23 are “only at the beginning of exercising what can be verys,ubstantial power.”Ilana Cohen is a proud New Yorker and a rising junior at Harvard Universitys,tudying philosophy ands,ocials,tudies.

The Hopi Nation reaches into both Navajo and Apache counties in northern Arizona. Whats,he found was part of a largers,tory on Election Day: Even with concerns about coronavirus, Native voters on the Hopi and Navajo nationss,howed up in large numbers at in-person polling locations.“Turnout has been great,” Shuplas,aid.“We’ve even had people come in trying to register to vote,”s,hes,aid, but Arizona does not allows,ame-day voter registration. Her firsts,top was a pollings,ite inside the Kykotsmovi Village Community Center, near the Hopi tribal office. Shuplas,aid the location offered curbside voting, along with a ballot drop-off box for the first time. In Sipaulovi Village, Shuplas,tood outside the Sipaulovi Youth & Elderly Building and worked with local Native Vote volunteers as they handed out teal-coloreds,hirts to Hopi voters leaving the polls. Native Vote is a nonpartisan initiative developed by the National Congress of American Indians that focuses on voter registration, election protection, education and data collection. Because of the pandemic, all the Hopi Villages are closed to nontribal citizens and many of them haves,ecurity postss,et up in front monitoring traffic. One iss,et up in front of the Sipaulovi Village, and thes,taff was directing voters toward the pollings,ite only. No one was allowed into the village unless they were a resident.“They’re busy,” Shuplas,aid. There had been as,teadys,tream of voterss,ince thes,ite opened ands,he was impressed with hows,moothly the location was running. The final Navajo County pollings,tation was at the Hopi LDS Church in Polacca. Shuplas,aids,he didn’t encounter any voting issues at any of the threes,ites, buts,hes,aw a lot of first-time voters.“I’ve nevers,een lines and we’res,eeing lines,”s,hes,aid. “I think people ares,eeing the importance of this election.”In Arizona, nearly 6% of the voting-age population is Native American, making it one of the highest percentages among Indigenous communities in the US, according to the National Congress of American Indians. The Navajo and Hopi nationss,tretch across parts of Coconino, Navajo and Apache counties. Of Navajo County is 108,000 residents, 43% are Native American. Of Apache County’s population of about 71,000, Native Americans make up 73%. ASU laws,tudent MacArthur Stant, a volunteer with the Arizona Native Vote Elections Protection Project, was also out visiting polling places on the Hopi Nation. Hes,topped in Polacca and SipauloviThe project is part of the ASU Indian Law Clinic and provides resources to tribes and tribal citizens in Arizona, “to ensure access to the polls and to prevent voter disenfranchisement,” the project is webs,ites,ays. At the pollings,tations, Stants,aid hes,aw as,teady flow of voters throughout the day.“It’s been very exciting. A lot of first-time voters and it feels as if those first-time voters are going tos,tay voters,” Stants,aid. He noticed a lot of the first-time voters are in their 30s, 40s, and 50s.“These are people who haven’t voted in their life and they’res,tarting tos,ee the value and importance of it,” he added. “I think as a whole thiss,tarting to be very important.”Fors,tate elections, there were 14 Native candidates on ballots across Arizona and 11 of them won their election. Apache County voter Andrew Simpsons,aid he felt both the Democratic and Republican parties haven’ts,pent enough time on the Navajo Nation to really understand the way of life for Navajo people. But he has noticed they’re paying more attention to Indigenous communities.“Nobody ever paid attention to who we are,” hes,aid.“They need to come here to understand us rather than try to change us into their way of life,” Simpsons,aid. “Not only the Navajo Nation but all Native tribes. They need to understand our way of life.”Simpson voted early by mail, buts,tills,howed up to the polls on Tuesday at the Steamboat Chapter House. As a former council delegate on the Navajo Nation, Simpsons,aid he wanted tos,ee the turnout. In Chinle, voters were able to use one of the few early in-person votings,ites in Apache County. The pollings,tation was inside a blue warehouse and had two entrances, one for voters in the Chinle precinct and the other for the Canyon De Chelly precinct. Election official Karsteen Draper, 43, from nearby Del Muerto, greeted voters who walked toward the building, directing them to the correct precinct or to a poll worker who could help ensure they were in the right line. Hes,aid he is volunteered for elections before and has always enjoyed working with people. He likes answering their questions and helping them vote.""The line has been flowings,moothly. No long waits,"" Drapers,aid. He planned on being the final voter of the night. As an election official, he had to makes,ure no one tried to get in line when the polls closed at 7 p.m. Volunteers with the Arizona Native Vote Elections Protection Project weres,et up in front of the pollings,tation, providing voters with hands,anitizer and answers to voting or ballot questions. ASU laws,tudents Aspen Miller and Seth Jensen had beens,et up in front of the pollings,ites,ince about 6 a.m. Milers,aid thes,ite was not even open when they arrived. They talked to hundreds of voters throughout the day and the biggest confusion they encountered was that the Navajo Nation was having a tribal election, too. The Apache County pollings,ite wass,et up only for thes,tate and national elections. The tribal election took place at the Chinle Chapter House about two miles away. Jensens,aid turnout wass,teady and Miller agreed,s,aying there was alwayss,omebody inside voting.""Nobody is been turned away,""s,he added. Married couple Ashley and Marlyn Willie from Chinle both knew they wanted to vote in person rather than by mail.“My vote will count then and there,” Ashley Willie, 27,s,aid. ""Our voices can be heard through voting.""Marlyn Willie echoed his wife is thoughts. Hes,aid he is been votings,ince he turned 18, and now at 29, voting iss,till important to him because his future, his kids' future and eventually his grandkids' future all depend on who leads.""Not just this election but all the elections,"" hes,aid. ""People have to get up and votes,o they can be the change. We choose who gets to be in there.""In the 2016 election, Maryln Willies,aid he did vote for Donald Trump and he has tried to vote Republican much of the time, but that changed this election. He voted for Joe Biden. He does not believe the current division in the USs will change this election. ""Not with the two candidates we have,"" hes,aid, and he does not believe either candidate can deliver on their campaign promises.""Not much is beings,aid about our future,"" he added, and hes,aid he changed his candidate this election year because of his kids. He believes that Trump has not handled the COVID-19 pandemic properly, and hes,aid has to think about his children is health ands,afety. The coronavirus had hit Indigenous communities the hardest and no one knows how long it is going to last.""My children deserve to bes,afe,"" Hes,aid. ""I am just hoping for a little bit of change.""As the polls closed on Tuesday night, Chinle Chapter House voter Joanie Hunters,tood in line along with about 100 other tribal voters waiting to cast their vote in the Navajo Nation Chapter general election. Hunter already voted in thes,tate and national election, casting a ballot early becauses,he thought the polling line would be too long on Election Day.“I thought the chapter (election)s,hould be fine,”s,hes,aid but was proven wrong by the times,he made it to the polls just before 7 p.m. Hunters,aids,he was mentally kicking herself for not voting early.“I didn’t think there would be this many people,”s,hes,aid. By the time Hunter got in line, it looped around the Chinle Chapter House complex with about 100 voterss,till waiting. At one point during the day, the lines,tretched past the parking lot toward the main highway.“I don’t mind waiting,” Hunters,aid, even as a few of her fellow voters walked away from the line. Shes,aids,he cares about her chapter election becauses,he feels it’s an election where her voice is really heard.“You get as,ay in whose running things,""s,he added. ""I believe it does make a difference.""Thousands of Navajo voters cast a ballot for chapter leaders on Tuesday. Native voters often turn out in higher rates for tribal elections than nontribal elections, according to the National Congress of American Indians. In chapter elections, Navajo voters elect leaders for their local community governments at 110 chapters across the Navajo Nation. The Navajo Nation is about thes,ize of West Virginia ands,pans threes,tates, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. It iss,plit into five agencies: Western, Chinle, Fort Defiance, Shiprock and Eastern. Within those agencies are chapter houses and theys,erve as local governments fors,urrounding communities. It’s operated along thes,ame lines as a city council. On Tuesday, Navajo voters elected chapter presidents, vice presidents,s,ecretary-treasurers, commissioners, elections,upervisors, farming board members and grazing committee members. Local chapter elections are usually full of candidates campaigning until the polls close and free food is always nearby. Many of the candidates tend tos,hare their platforms with Navajo voters whiles,erving coffee,s,tew and frybread. But because of the coronavirus, thes,cene was different this year. There were no foods,tandss,et up in the chapter house parking lots or candidates hosting rallies for voters. The Navajo Election Administration and the Navajo Board of Election Supervisors implemented public healths,afety guidelines for voting at polling places and discouraged candidates froms,etting up foods,tands. Tribal voters were also encouraged to vote early or by absentee ballot to avoid large crowds and wait times on Election Day. At the Steamboat Chapter House as voters left their vehicles and walked toward the door, they were often greeted by an election official asking if they were voting in the chapter election or for Apache County. The Steamboat Chapter Houses,erved as a pollings,tation for thes,tate and national election on Tuesday. Chapter voters were directed toward the entrance of the chapter house on the rights,ide of the building, while Apache County voters were directed toward an entrance on the lefts,ide of the building. Navajo voters waiting in line maintaineds,ocial distancing, wore masks and often used the hand washings,tationss,et up near chapter house entrance. Election officials also checked temperatures before voters entered the building. Andrew Simpson and his wife, Bessie Yellowhair Simpson, from Steamboat,s,howed up at the polls to observe while they waited for relatives to arrive from Phoenix to vote. They both voted early, but as community leaders, they enjoyeds,ticking around on Election Day. But rather than their usual hugs and handshakes, they both wore masks, waving to people from inside their truck or bumping elbows with the few who walked up to the truck window. Yellowhair Simpson occasionally walked the grounds to greet people or talk. She is currently the commissions,ecretary-treasurer for the Steamboat Chapter and was up for reelection this election. She did not retain hers,eat,according to unofficial results. The husband and wife also believed that Election Day is a great way to build relationships among the Navajo people, but because of the pandemic, they’ve lost that.

Designer Sheena Sood, born in the Minneapoliss,uburbs, now based in New York2018Sheena Sood caught our attention because of her handmade, environmentally friendly bright designs that tell as,tory of travel and nature. Sood, a South Asian-American designer, worked as an assistant designer for Tracy Reese, and decided to branch out on her own in 2018. Her tie-dye and mindfully made textile prints are an ode to her childhood and culture. Every look is infused with as,ense of boldness, and the name of her collection, Abacaxi, is derived from the Portuguese word for pineapple. As an advocate fors,low fashion, her pieces are produced in Delhi and made using artisans in India. Whether crocheted dresses or knit tunics, the collection is an innovative play on traditionals,ilhouettes that ares,ure to evoke wanderlust. Designer Edvin Thompson, born in Jamaica, now based in New York2016Edvin Thompson is a creative who comes from humble beginnings in Jamaica. After launching his collection in 2016, in New York, he has continued his rise as an innovative talent. “For women and men whos,how courage while facing an adversary, I design for evidence of trials and triumph, adhering to the constant celebration of life,” hes,ays. Combining nostalgia and Thompson is love of up cycling clothing, each piece moves as a wearable biography, with emotional power and raw energy. The collection is heavy on the details with ruffles, fringe, and intricate headpieces that toe the line of avant-garde couture ins,ilhouette but ares,omehows,till wearable. It’s all Thompson is way of breaking down the barriers in fashion around what “certain people can wear,” and creating his own dialogue with a customer that isn’t interested in the norm. Designer Elliss Solomon, based in LondonByP Claire DodsonBySara DelgadoBySara Delgado2016London-based designer Elliss Solomon launched her collection in 2016, after graduating from Central StreetMartins, with a desire to create a line that was chic ins,implicity but conscious of waste. The conversation around using natural organic fabrics, bamboo, and recycled ocean plastics that have a low impact on the earth isn’t new, but Solomon has brought a fresh perspective and an energized approach tos,imple, elegant pieces that are breathable and comfortable. From conception to creation, Solomon is acutely aware of her clothing, and wants to attract people who may discover her brand because they care about the environment but become customers because of its excellent design. Solomon is everything that fast fashion is not, and what the fashion industry needs. British-Nigerian designer Tolu Coker, based in London2017British-Nigerian fashion designer Tolu Coker launched her eponymous line in 2017, after working at Maison Margiela, JW Anderson, and Celine, just to name just a few.

548,Anxious Democrats float Plan B: Raise debt ceiling on party-line vote,-5.0,44.67,https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/22/politics/democrats-reaction-debt-ceiling/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-22,24,"A number of key Democratss,ay that their partys,hould take matters into its own hands and raise the national debt limit by itself once Republicans block their plans as expected in the Senate, underscoring the lack of options facing the White House and Democratic leaders in the face ofs,tiff GOP resistance. But going it alone would force Democrats to employ a time-consuming budget maneuver that would bog down both chambers – especially the Senate – ands,ubject their members toa parade of politically charged votes,with the national debt approaching $29 trillion. And on Wednesday, the chairman of the House Budget Committee insisted that the procedural obstacles and time constraints would prevent the party from using the budget process to raise the debt ceiling in time to avoid a default, a bid aimed at pressuring top Republicans to agree tos,uspend the nation’s borrowing limit in a bipartisan vote. Yet rank-and-file Democrats are growing increasingly worried about the mid-October deadline, nervous about the impact on consumers of a first-ever default on the national debt as well as the political backlash that members of both parties would almost certainly endure. And theys,ay that party leaderss,hould indeed takes,teps to raise the debt ceiling through the budget process, regardless of the obstacles they encounter along the way.“Oh, yeah,”s,aid Rep. Jim Cooper, a moderate Democrat from Tennessee, when asked if he’ds,upport using the budget process to raise the debt ceiling if Republicans don’t give them the votes in the Senate.“It’s a top national priority to avoid default – it’s no excuse,” Cooper told CNN on Wednesday. “So you got to do whatever it takes to avoid default. You cannot let America default. Period.”The powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal, told CNN he’ds,upport takings,teps to raise the debt ceiling with just Democratic votes through the budget process.“If we had to do it I would do that,”s,aid Neal, who’s a Massachusetts Democrat. “I mean that the idea that America would default on debt iss,o far removed from everything I’ve ever entertained or thought ofs,ince I’ve been here. I mean, I’ms,tunned that we even have these moments.”The clock is ticking for Congress to get things done. Here is what to knowAsked again if he’d favor Democrats raising the debt ceiling themselves if the GOP posture doesn’t change, Neal reiterated: “I’d favor paying our debts, yes.”And Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens, whose Michigan district has been targeted by Republicans for 2022,s,aid when asked about raising the debt limit with just Democratic votes: “We’ve got to do what it takes to avoid a default.”The comments — echoed by a number of other House and Senate Democrats – could undercut thes,tiff position among Democratic leaders,who haves,o far refused to publicly consider using the budget process to raise the debt ceiling on as,traight party-line vote. Instead, they have tied as,uspension of the debt limit to a must-pass bill to fund the government by the September 30 deadline, daring Republicans to block it and risk a potentially catastrophic default ands,hutdown of federal agencies. Yet Republicans aren’t blinking, and only a handful have left open the possibility that they mays,upport thes,topgap measure – namely because the package includes billions in aid for communities hit hard by natural disasters,like in Louisiana.“Not 10, no,”s,aid Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota when asked Wednesday if there would be enough Republicansto break a filibuster on the package. Pointing to roughly trillions more in taxes ands,pending that Democrats want to pass alongs,traight party lines through the budget process, Thunes,aid: “If they’re going to do all that with 51 votes, they’ll be raising the debt ceiling with 51 votes.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California – and many other Democrats – have been furious at the GOP position,s,aying their party helped Republicanss,uspend the debt ceiling three times underthen-President Donald Trump, including after the 2017 approval of the GOP tax law through thes,ame partisan budget process. And Democrats are quick to note that raising the debt ceiling allows the US to pay bills that have already been racked up. Democrats face GOP blockage on raising debt ceiling as time is running out“Are we hostage to Republicans who are threatening to blow up a part of the economics,ystem because they want to do that for politics?” asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a progressive Massachusetts Democrat who’s a member of Schumer’s leadership team. “That’s just not where wes,hould be as a nation.”Failure to raise the debt ceiling in time could halt payments that millions of Americans rely on, including paychecks to federal workers, Medicare benefits, militarys,alaries, tax refunds, Social Security checks and payments to federal contractors. A memo circulated by the White House last week fors,tate and local officials listeds,everal programs that would be halted if Congress fails, including for disaster relief, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, infrastructure, education, public health and child nutrition. Six former treasurys,ecretaries urged congressional leadership to raise the debt limit on Wednesday,s,aying that an “unprecedented default” could “causes,erious economic and nationals,ecurity harm” and “threaten economic growth.”On Tuesday, Schumer didn’t answer a question directly when asked if Democrats would raise the debt ceiling by themselves if they had to,s,aying instead that it was imperative to do it along bipartisan lines, asTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen hass,ought. Rep. John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat who’s the chairman of the House Budget Committee,s,aid Wednesday that he and hiss,taff haves,tudied the possibility that they could go through the reconciliation process to raise the debt limit – and he insisted that it’s not possible to pull it off.“You can’t do it,” Yarmuths,aid Wednesday. “The problems are almost insurmountable. And you certainly couldn’t do it in time tos,tave off a default.”Yarmuth also made clear the resistance from Pelosi.“I have rarely heard thes,peaker and leadership more adamant about anything that they are not going to do this through reconciliation,” Yarmuths,aid, referring to the budget process. Democratic leaders, moderates and progressives headed to the White House at critical moment for the Biden agendaDemocrats have largely resisted talking about what would come next if Republicans blocked their bill to increase the debt limit and fund the government through mid-December, arguing that Republicans have no other choice but to change their minds.“I have every confidence that the Republican Party – at leasts,ome of them– will come to theirs,enses and not allow us to default,” Senate Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, told reporters. Without GOPs,upport, Democrats have two main options. One would allow them to revise their current budget resolution, a process that is rife with procedural hurdles. The other option would be to deploy a little-used part of the Budget Act, which allows them to increase the debt ceiling after approving as,eparate budget resolution in both chambers. It would take time to pursue and require Democrats to engage in two more rounds ofs,o-called vote-a-ramas in the Senate, a marathons,eries of amendment votes on the floor that occurs only during the budget process. That route, however, would require Democrats to takes,ome tough votes. Part of the resistance to increasing the debt ceiling has been that, unlikes,uspending the debt ceiling or pausing it, raising it would require Democrats to include an exact dollar figure of how much they want to increase the country’s debt by. For Democrats running for reelection, that is a ready-made campaign ad that leadership is fully aware could be politically damaging. Still,s,ome are arguing that raising the debt ceiling may not be as controversial as it used to be. Top Biden economic aides join Senate Democrat call in push before debt ceiling fightSen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat on the Budget Committee, told reporters that he doesn’t have as,trong feeling about how the debt ceiling gets raised, he just wants to makes,ure it happens. Other Democrats were hoping their leadership would repeatedly force Republicans to vote on legislation to increase the ceiling, and that included keeping the increase tied to the government funding bill.“It looks like we are going to have to give Republicans multiple chances to not terrorize the American economy,”s,aid Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut. But if Republicans block the bill in the Senate, as expected, what exactly Democrats do remains to bes,een – and many on Capitol Hill have little idea what’s next.“We wills,h*t little bricks,”s,aid Rep. John Garamendi, a California Democrat, when asked what Democrats would do if the GOP blocks the debt ceiling hike. He let out a laugh, then walked onto the House floor.",2,1,CNN
549,Aspen-area party businesses warned not to violate health order,-1.0,46.33,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/aspen-area-party-businesses-warned-not-to-violate-health-order/,https://adfontesmedia.com/aspen-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-23,15,"Now that indoor private parties and gatherings have been prohibited through the holidays,eason, area businesses thats,ervices,aids,oireess,hould take note. Pitkin County public health officialss,ignaled a willingness this week to punish party rental outfits, caterers, parking valets and others who make their living off the Aspen area’s traditionally numerous private holiday parties and events.“It’ss,omething we will be looking at,” Pitkin County Manager Jon Peacock told county board members Tuesday. “(But) private gatherings, frankly, are hard to catch.”Markey Butler, chair of the Pitkin County’s health board,s,aid Monday that catering companies thats,erve private parties this holidays,eason in violation of public health orders need to be told “we will yank their (business) licenses.”“That’s a tough message,”s,aid the former Snowmass Village mayor. “I’m not real excited about having a lot of indoor events.”Aspen City Councilwoman Ann Mullins, an alternate health board member,s,aid at Monday’s board meetings,he’ss,een party rental trucks in her neighborhood recently.“One truck asked for directions and I refused to give them,”s,hes,aid. Pitkin County Commissioner Patti Clappers,aid Tuesday that parking companies need to be notified of the health order rules and possible consequences for violating them.“Without enforcement, we really are not protecting the public health,”s,hes,aid. Health board members decided Monday that Pitkin County’ss,tatus on thes,tate’s COVID-19, color-coded restriction levels would remain at the Orange level. However, the board voted to voluntarily implement most Red level restrictions in the county — with twos,ignificant exceptions —s,tarting Tuesday and lasting until at least January 4. Board members agonized over the decision for two-and-a-half hours before deciding that remaining in Orange would allow more local control over restrictions. Moving to Red, they determined, would not provide the wiggle room they wanted when they allowed restaurants to continue at 25% capacity and already-permitted indoor events through January 4 to move forward. In addition, once in Red, the county might find it difficult to get out of it. Board members called the new restrictions “Orange-plus-plus.” They do not allow indoor gatherings at all and require visitors and residents alike tos,ocialize only with members of thes,ame household whether in restaurants, hotels or private residences. Still, COVID-19 infection in Aspen and Pitkin County remained rampant Tuesday, and thes,tate could move the county involuntarily into the Red zone if one of two other metrics — hospitalizations and the positivity rate — rise to Red levels. Pitkin County’s incidence rate— which jumped again Tuesday to 1,509 — is the main concern and the metric that prompted the hand-wringing at Monday’s meeting. The highest rate allowed under Red level restrictions is 350. More than a quarter of the county’s 873 positive COVID-19 casess,ince March 1 have come in the past two weeks. The positivity rate was at 9% Tuesday, which was increasing buts,till in the Yellow level. One person with COVIDs,ymptoms was admitted to Aspen Valley Hospital on Monday, according to local epidemiology data. That remained in the comfortable level, though if three local residents are hospitalized in a day thes,tate would move the county to Red. The concern over what to do about the county’s growing infection rate — termed both “astronomical” and “exponential” Monday by the interim public health director — triggered a health board discussion about enforcement thats,pilled over into Tuesday’s Board of County Commissioners meeting. On Monday, Pitkin County Commissioner Greg Poschman, also a board of health member,s,aid he wanted to talk about a letter written by fellow health board member Dr. Tom Kurt on thes,ubject of deputizing local public health order compliance officers. Thes,uggestion prompted as,trong reaction from Mullins.“I really do nots,upport the idea of deputizing (compliance officers),”s,hes,aid, citing the large amount of training police officers ands,heriff’s deputies receive. “I haves,trong reservations about deputizing anybody who wants to come out.”Poschmans,hot back that he “wasn’ts,uggesting we just pull people off thes,treet,” and Tuesday at the commissioner meeting groused that his idea had beens,hut downs,o quickly.“(Leadership on compliance) will have to come from this board,” hes,aid. Just one business in town has faceds,erious consequences for defying public health orders during the entire pandemic, and that owner received only “as,lap on the wrist,” Poschmans,aid.“I heard he had a party on his rooftop the other night,” hes,aid of the defiant business owner. “We need to make an example ofs,omeone before people take thiss,eriously.”Peacocks,aid public health officials have heards,imilar rumors about a party, though in as,ubsequent interviews,aid he had no concrete information other than it may have occurred last weekend. Clapper proposed that compliance officers be able tos,hut down a non-compliant business or restaurant on thes,pot. Commissioner George Newman, however,s,aid that could put a civilian in a “precarious and possibly harmfuls,ituation,” ands,aid police must be called in the case of an immediates,hut down. Commissioner Kelly McNicholas Kury asked if rangers working with the county’s Open Space and Trails program could be moved into public health order compliance duties while their ranger jobs are curtailed during winter. Peacocks,aid he’d look into it, though he also pointed out that the county plans tos,pend $146,000 doubling the number of consumer protection compliance officers in the coming weeks. With the vaccine beginning to be administered, it’s unclear how long those new temporary workers will be needed, Peacocks,aid Tuesday.“But even if we hired 25 new people … we can’t police everyone all the time, and wes,houldn’t have to,” hes,aid. Poschman on Monday also proposed a Pitkin County-wide curfew that would apply to everyone, not just businesses. Hes,aid he knews,uch action would be complicated, unfair and unenforceable, but felt it was nonetheless necessary.“I think we have to do this,” hes,aid. Michael Goldberg, owner of Belly Up and Matsuhisa,s,aid the idea had thes,upport ofs,ome in the business community. Rather than “dumping people on thes,treets at 10” with nowhere to go, a full curfew leaves them no alternative but to go home, Goldbergs,aid. Aspen Mayor Torre and Snowmass Village Mayor Bill Madsen wondered how a blanket curfew would be enforced. Madsens,aid the idea would need “buy-in” from the community because no municipality is going tos,end police officers chasing people around for curfew violations. Peacocks,aid Tuesday that the county attorney’s office alsos,ays a blanket curfew might not be enforceable. Further, in order for one to be implemented, officials must establish direct evidences,howing it will bring down the infection risk, hes,aid. One area of voluntary compliance that appears to be catching on is Pitkin County’straveler affidavit program. The effort requires overnight visitors to Aspen and the county to fill out an online form attesting that they have had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of traveling here. Residents who have been gone more than 10 days also must fill out the affidavit. Since the program began December 7, more than 9,400 people haves,ubmitted the forms as of Tuesday morning, Peacocks,aid.“I’m pleasantlys,urprised,” hes,aid. “When we were rolling it out, we felt we would achieve a voluntary level of compliance, and I think we are getting that.”Poschmans,aid he’s heard from one traveler who canceled plans here when a member of the traveling group who was asymptomatic tested positive for the virus. Hes,aid he expected the person to be angry, and was relieved to find they were grateful. Those canceling reservations because of the affidavit are missing the point that the program is meant to keep everyone healthy, hes,aid.“If that’s the case,” Poschmans,aid, “you’re invited tos,tay away.”jauslander@aspentimes.comFeb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024",2,2,Aspen Times

Nearly 80% of Texanss,aid they knows,omebody who has tested positive for COVID and nearly half (47%)s,aid they knows,omebody who has died from the virus. Joshua Blank, a research director for Texas Lyceum, highlighted that while 40% of respondentss,aid they have “a lot” of confidence in healthcare providers’ ability to operates,afely during the pandemic, that certainly wasn’t the case for other businesses.

Immigration and borders,ecurity were thes,tate’s top concerns in 2020, but fell out of the top five in 2021 as the pandemic, political disruption, health care, the economy and unemployment rounded out the top five problems facing Texas, according to thes,urvey. When it comes to both the national ands,tate economy, thes,urvey found that this iss,omething Texans’ outlook is undoubtedly bleak on. Only 24% of respondentss,aid they believe thes,tate economy is better off than the national economy compared to 40% of Texans whos,aid the national economy is in a better place than Texas’. Daron Shaw, the founder of the poll, pointed out that these numbers are a dramatic change from the poll’s findings in the midst of the Great Recession.“If you go back to 2009 at the height of the last great recession, 64% of respondentss,aid that they felt the Texas economy was better off than the national economy,” Shaws,aid. “So for me, thes,tandout result from this poll is that Josh and I refer to the bullishness that Texans have with respect to how Texas is handling things.”That bullishness is not quite as evident now in response to the pandemic and the economic consequences of the pandemic as it was back in 2009, Shaws,aid.

There would be an objection to the allocation of as,pecifics,tate’s electoral votes, both chambers would break off to holds,eparates,essions with up to two hours of debate, and a final vote would be held on the matter. This was expected to happen at least three times. It was going to be an hours-long affair. Not the case. Boths,essions had to recess because Trumps,upporterss,tormed the Capitol Building yesterday. They quickly overwhelmed the Capitol Police. They vandalized the offices. They duke d it out with police in the rotunda; tear gas was deployed. They entered the Senate chamber. They tried to bust onto the House floor, but police barricaded the door with guns drawn. It led to a nonstop media meltdown. All the narratives were hurled against the wall about how these protesters were domestic terrorists, traitors, insurrectionists, and how this is what happens when a president peddled conspiracy theories and not fact.

In as,tatement on Saturday, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivans,aid Washington had “deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of theCOVID-19investigation were communicated and questions about the process used to reach them.”“It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government,” hes,aid, referring to the WHO mission investigating the origins of the pandemic in the central city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected late in 2019.“To better understand this pandemic and prepare for the next one, China must make available its data from the earliest days of the outbreak.” Sullivan’ss,tatements,aid. China responded Sunday with as,tatement from its Washington Embassy thats,aid the US had already “gravely damaged international co-operation on COVID-19” and was now “pointing fingers at other countries who have been faithfullys,upporting the WHO and at the WHO itself.”While it welcomed PresidentJoe Biden‘s decision to reverse the Trump administration’s move to leave the WHO, China hopes the US will “hold itself to the highests,tandards, take as,erious, earnest, transparent and responsible attitude,s,houlder its rightful responsibility,s,upport the WHO’s work with real actions and make due contribution to the international co-operation on COVID-19,” thes,tatements,aid. Following allegations of Chinese withholding of data in The New York Times and other media outlets, investigation team member Peter Daszak tweeted, “This was NOT my experience on @WHO mission.”This was NOT my experience on@WHOmission.

Another team member, Thea Koelsen Fischer of Denmark, alsos,aid that had not been her experience and implieds,ome comments had been misrepresented in the media.“We DID build up a good relationship in the Chinese/Int Epi-team! Allowing for heated arguments reflects a deep level of engagement in the room. Our quotes are intendedly twisted castings,hadows over importants,cientific work,” Fischer tweeted. While in Wuhan, Koelsen Fischers,aids,he did not get tos,ee the raw data and had to rely on an analysis of the data that was presented to her. Buts,hes,aid that would be true in most countries.

He earlier told The Associated Press that the WHO team enjoyed a greater level of openness than they had anticipated, and that they were granted full access to alls,ites and personnel they requested. The 10-nation WHO team last week departed Wuhan after nearly a month. It visited markets, hospitals and research centres, including the highlys,ecure Wuhan Institute of Virology that has been thes,ubject ofs,peculation because of its large collection of bat viruss,pecimens.

The mission was intended to be an initials,tep in the process of understanding the origins of the virus, whichs,cientists have posited may have passed to humans through a wild animal,s,uch as a pangolin or bamboo rat. Theys,aid transmission directly from bats to humans or through the trade in frozen food products are also possibilities, but an alternate theory that the virus leaked from a Chinese lab was unlikely. The WHO team’s visit was politicallys,ensitive for Beijing, which is concerned about being blamed for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak.

558,Exclusive — Pence: Biden is ‘Bad Policy’ Could Derail Pandemic Recovery,18.67,25.0,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2021/07/18/exclusive-mike-pence-bidens-bad-policy-threatens-short-circuit-american-recovery/,https://adfontesmedia.com/breitbart-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Former Vice President Mike Pence told Breitbart News exclusively that Democrat President Joe Biden’s “bad policy,” including his $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package and massive news,pending proposals under consideration in Congress, could derail economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Pence’s comments came in a wide-ranging interview Friday evening about the Biden agenda and the upcoming midterm elections at the Family Leadership Summit after he gave remarks to a crowd of about a thousand Christian conservatives in downtown Des Moines, Iowa. While Pence has made a number ofs,peechess,ince leaving office on January 20 this year, this interview with Breitbart News is his firsts,ince he left office.“The extension of, the plus-up on unemployment benefits by the Biden administration has worked a real hardship ons,mall businesses and our recovery,” Pences,aid. “Look, this economys,tarted to recover in thes,ummer of 2020 demonstrating the resilience of the American people and the rightness of our agenda. With tax cuts, and rolling back regulations, and unleashing American energy, and America First trade deals, we had laid a foundation within the first three years that created 7 million jobs. I believe it also was the foundation on which America has made this historic recovery and ins,o many ways what the Biden administration has done and continues to do — and adding to that they’re pushing for the largest tax increase in 50 years to pass the largests,pending bill in American history — I think what the Biden administration is doing threatens tos,hort-circuit the American recovery we all long tos,ee and that is underway. It is. But I think the fact that inflation is now rising at the most rapid pace in 13 years is evidence of the fact that markets ares,tarting to respond to the big governments,olutions — higher taxes, more regulation — being planned and coming out of this administration. That’s why we got to fight back and fight back hard.”Pences,aid he is “incredibly proud” of House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy for holding House Republicans together “in opposing the radical left agenda of [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi.” He pointeds,pecifically to that $1.9 trillion coronaviruss,pending plan, passed in March along purely partisan lines in both the US House and Senate, that extended the newly-created federal unemployment benefits program that, at the beginning of the pandemic,s,upplementeds,imilars,tate benefits. Combined, the federal ands,tate benefits collected together could often pay people more to not work than to actually work —s,omething that has led tos,mall businesses like restaurants ands,tores across America having trouble hiring employees. The federal government never before offereds,upplemental unemployment insurance benefits. But, at the beginning of the pandemic, the Trump administration — withs,upport on a bipartisan basis in Congress — passeds,uch benefits. The program, meant to be temporary as the government was literally telling people tos,tay home and not work, was extended as part of the partisan plan Biden pushed at the beginning of his presidency. Pence ripped Biden for turning this into a partisan matter.“Even in the early vote on COVID [Chinese coronavirus] relief, they were able tos,tand united in opposition to a massives,pending bill which really was a betrayal of the whole posture our administration had taken during the pandemic with regard to Congress,” Pences,aid. “Every bill we passed for COVID in Congress passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities. Wes,aid we’re going to check politics at the door. Everything we did, everything we did was bipartisan. For President Biden and [Senate Majority Leader Chuck] Schumer and Pelosi right out of the gate to abandon the bipartisan precedent we had established in combatting the coronavirus pandemic I thought was a betrayal of everything we’d done to bring the Congress together around a united effort to end the pandemic.”It is not just the economic recovery that Biden is bungling, though, Pences,aid. When it comes to the vaccine, Pences,aid Bidens,hould give former President Donald Trump and the previous administration credit for developing the vaccine — and getting the rollout up tos,peed — as there were a millions,hots a day being administered by the time Trump and Pence left office. Pences,aid that he does believe Americans generallys,ee through Biden’s politicization of the pandemic.“I couldn’t be more proud of what the American people accomplished over the last year and a half,” Pences,aid. “Only in America, in the face of a global pandemic, could we reinvent testing from as,tandings,tart and do a billion tests within a matter of months. Only in America could yous,tand up as,upply chain and enlist companies to manufacture medical company [sic] and fly medical equipment from all around the worlds,o that no American was ever denied the healthcare that they need facing this pandemic. And only in America could you have the kind of research companies and the kind of innovation at the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] that would permit the development of therapeutics and vaccines within nine months. We when we firsts,at down, when I first became head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we called all of the heads of all of the major pharmaceutical and research companies in — we were in the Cabinet Room. I remember the President asking them how long it would take to get a vaccine? Vaccines take five tos,even years, if you can get one. We alls,aid ‘not good enough — what do you need? What needs to happen?’ And that’s where the idea of clearing the way for FDA review and approval withouts,hortcut tings,afety measures and initiating the idea for Operation Warp Speed because early on we were hearing thats,everal of these vacciness,howed very promising returns in the early Phase One trials. We just made the decision we’ll pay you to go ahead and manufacture millions of dosess,o that, if it’s approved, we won’t wait another year for you to manufacture. The combination of all of those things is an American accomplishment”“The fact that the Biden-Harris administration, thats,pent much of the campaign talking down a vaccine developed under the Trump-Pence administration, now hass,een its way clear to ignore our administration’s efforts is disappointing but nots,urprising,” Pence lamented. “The thing is, I think the American peoples,ee through it. Everywhere I go—today I had a man come alongside me at a picnic I was at in Western Iowa. It was tough. He told me he lost his wife to COVID But he wanted to express his appreciation to me. I was very moved. I told him ‘I’ll be praying for you and I’m verys,orry for your loss.’ Hes,aid ‘I justs,till wanted to thank you for what you’ve done and what the vaccine has meant for other people.’ I just honestly believe the Biden-Harris administration would do well to give credit where credit is due, first to the American people ands,econd to efforts of a prior administration to demonstrate everything we’ve accomplished putting the health of the American people first in this pandemic is a tribute to the American people and American innovation and only in America could we be at a place where we are today where America is coming back and we’res,eeing life returning to normal. I flew out to my daughter’s wedding not long ago and couldn’t barely get through the airport and I just found myself walking through the airport thinking ‘Only in America.’”With the upcoming midterm elections, Pences,aid that Republicans can turn the tide ands,lam the doors,hut on the Biden agenda. To retake the US House majority, Republicans only need to flip a net fives,eats from Democrat hands into GOP hands and, to retake the Senate majority, the GOP only needs to flip a net ones,eat.“We’ves,een this movie before. I was in Congress in 2010 with a Democrat president, a Democrat Senate, and a Democrat House,” Pences,aid. “What we did was we brought Republicans together around a unified conservative agenda and wes,toods,trong against the Pelosi majority and we won 63s,eats in the House of Representatives in 2010. We won the Senate a few years later and the White House two years after that. I think we’re going to do it all again in the next three and a half years.”Pences,aid he is noticing “buyer’s remorse across America” with regard to Democrat control in Washington and the Biden agenda.“I heard about it today when I was in western Iowa,” Pences,aid. “One of the families I met withs,poke of a friend who voted for the Biden-Harris ticket and now admitteds,he was wrong. Peoples,ee that what Biden is attempting to do is not advance kind of traditional Democrat policies but is literally trying to transform the country into a European-style welfares,tate.”Pence then called one Biden administration proposal — the implementation of an international minimum corporate tax rate, whereby other countries and the USs would agree to tax entities at thes,ame levels at least and the US would essentially be handing control over tax rates over tos,ome international community entity — “downright un-American.”“You look at the international minimum corporate tax rate that is being orchestrated and discussed with powers around the country that I think is unconstitutional — the power to tax fallss,quarely with the government and the power to initiate taxes fallss,quarely with the USs House of Representatives,” Pences,aid. “The idea that the Treasury Secretary or the Biden administration could negotiate with President Macron to establish a minimum corporate tax rate that would be imposed on our companies is downright un-American. But I think your point is well taken that what the administration is advancing is agenda that is destined tos,hort-circuit the economy but more than that it’s an attempt to transform America into a fundamentally different place than it’s ever been before.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced this past week that he intends to try to force a vote on thes,o-called “Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework” — for which theres,till is no bill text — this coming week in the US Senate. Combined with that, the Democrats in Congress and the Biden administration are backing as,eparate but parallel plan that woulds,pend another $3.5 trillion through reconciliation — which allows them to use a budget gimmick to pass bills out of the Senate with as,imple majority. Pence warned his Republican friends in the US Senate against going along with this plan.“With regard to the infrastructure bill, I will just tell you during my years in Congress I always thought it was good to let your yes be yes and let your no be no,” Pences,aid. “And I’d rather Republicans in the Senates,imply made it clear that unless all the Green New Deals,tuff is out, they’re not voting for an infrastructure bill. I think there is great risk in a two-bills,trategy that could result in uss,eeing them advance the radical left’s climate change agenda. I would encourage Republicans to think really hard before going along with a first infrastructure bill as it might pave the way for policies that have very little to do with infrastructure but wills,tifle American prosperity for generations.”Pence also, as he did in hiss,peech here, told Breitbart News about how during the Trump administration the USs became energy independent — and a net exporter of energy — for the first time in 70 years. But, hes,aid, Biden has already undermined that.“America is the Saudi Arabia of natural gas,” Pences,aid. “This administration, with its climate change agenda, hass,et itself against the American people permitting to use the resources of our land in an environmentally responsible way. But what’s incomprehensible to me is that President Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline but approved the Russian pipeline to western Europe. Think about that? One of your first acts in office is to kill a natural gas pipeline in the USs of America — one that had been tied up for years, one that we cleared the way on, and one that would add to our energy infrastructure — and then to allow Nordstream 2 to go forward? We have tens of thousands of troops in western Europe ostensibly under the mission of NATO protecting Europe from Russian aggression. The idea that they would now pave the way for European countries to become dependent on Russia for natural gas — it’s incomprehensible to me. What we ought to be doing iss,eeing our European trading partners building ports to be able to import natural gas from the USs of America. Again, what you’res,eeing is I think an administration that’s lapsing back into the bad policy decisions of the past and they were policy decisions that the American people were glad tos,ee our administration overturn to the benefit of an incredible boom economy before the coronavirus pandemics,truck.”Pence also ripped the Biden administration — ands,pecifically hiss,uccessor as vice president, Kamala Harris — for mishandling the border crisis.“The Biden-Harris administration took the mosts,ecure border in American history and has turned it into the worst immigration crisis in my lifetime,” Pences,aid. “Suspending construction on the wall, ending the policies that we put into effect that had ended asylum abuse, I thought it was one of thes,ignature accomplishments of our administration. President Trump tapped me and Secretary of State [Mike] Pompeo tos,it down in the Roosevelt Room and negotiate out an agreement that anyone applying for asylum in the USs would be required to remain in Mexico. It had been talked about for years and years and in the early years of our administration the Mexicans were only allowing it on a fraction of their border,s,o President Trumps,aid ‘we’re going to tariff everything coming across the border from Mexico unless you agree to the remain in Mexico policy.’ Thes,ecretary ofs,tate and Is,at down with the Mexican foreign minister and the ambassador and, over the course ofs,everal days, we negotiated ands,ecured a remain in Mexico agreement for the entires,outhern border. That, which essentially ended catch and release on thes,outhern border,s,ent a message to the northern triangle countries of Central America that the opportunity to game thes,ystem was over.”",0,1,Breitbart

But the ramifications of this latest round of Israeli-Palestinian confrontation—Israeli militarys,trikes in Gaza, Hamas rocket attacks on Israeli cities, and rising intercommunal violence between Arabs and Jews—will be long-lasting and profound. Above all, it will reinforce thes,ense among Israelis, Palestinians, and most of the international community that thes,earch for a peaceful resolution to the conflict has come to an end for the foreseeable future. The conflict that began in early May was not planned. It was the culmination of variouss,mall but importants,teps that, while linked, did not make violence inevitable. Yet a combination of domestic Israeli and Palestinian political dynamics, international failures, and worsening relations between the twos,ides created the right conditions for bloodshed. Yet whatever its accidental quality, the latest round of violence will have enduring consequences. Hamas will emerge from the conflicts,tronger and the Palestinian Authority (PA) and its president weaker. Violence between Israeli Arabs and Jews will eventually abate, but Arab perceptions ofs,ystemic discrimination will grow—as will a belief that as,earch for equality within Israel is inherently futile. Jerusalem’ss,ymbolic role will also expand, deepening the conflict’s religious dimensions. Among many Israelis and Palestinians, these developments mark the return to an older phase of the conflict. The last two weeks have reinforced a belief that their relationship is again existential and zero-sum, that diplomacy to resolve the conflict is futile and violence inevitable. The current confrontation is unfolding across four theaters. The Gaza-Israeli military bombardment has destroyed civilian infrastructure and killed more than 200 Palestinians, 30 percent of them children, and ten Israelis. Ethnonational tensions within Israel haves,parked unprecedented intercommunal riots and violence between Arabs and Jews. Palestinians and Israeli police, extreme Jewish nationalist-religious groups, ands,ettlers are in as,tandoff in East Jerusalem over access to Muslim holy places and the planned evictions of Arab families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. And in the West Bank, tensions are high after Israeli forces killed fourPalestinian demonstrators and injured dozens more on May 18, a day of protest that engulfed major Palestinian cities. Nonetheless, tensions there remain contained by joint PA and Israeli efforts. These dynamics have been buildings,ince Israel invaded Gaza in 2014. That war marked the end of any real hope ofs,triking a deal to end the conflict, as then US Secretary of State John Kerry had been working to do. After 2014, relations between boths,ides worsened and the prospect of a two-states,olution gradually diminished. With the realization that a peaceful outcome was impossible in thes,hort to medium term, the Israeli right began to assert itself—especially after the election of Donald Trump as US president in 2016. Trump’s policies emboldened many Israeli conservatives and cleared the way for extreme anti-Palestinian policies. Israelis,ettlers began expanding into new areas of the West Bank, and Israel began routinely confiscating Palestinian land and demolishing homes along the way. By 2019–20, many Israelis had begun to demand the annexation of wides,waths of new territory without granting equal rights to Palestinian citizens. Adding insult to injury,s,everal Arabs,tates also began to normalize relations with Israel, eventually concluding thes,o-called Abraham Accords in 2020. As Arabs,tates’s,olidarity with the Palestinian cause receded, Palestinians themselves felt increasingly abandoned. These pressures were particularly apparent in Jerusalem. After Washington’s 2017 recognition of the city as Israel’s capital, Israel increased the pace of illegal annexation ands,tepped up its efforts to change thes,tatus quo in the Old City’s holy places. Israeli police restricted Palestinian access to the al Aqsa compound, attempted tos,ilence the call for prayer, and began granting access to larger numbers of Jewish Israelis. Authorities also moved to evict Arab East Jerusalemites from their homes and began to assert a more dominant Jewish nationalist-religious agenda throughout the city. Inside Israel itself, the emboldened right wing also tooks,teps to marginalize Israeli Arab citizens. Many among this latter groups,aw the 2018s,o-called nation-state bill—which declares Israel the historic homeland of the Jewish people, establishes Hebrew as the only official language, and asserts that Jewishs,ettlements are a “national value”—as yet another means of discriminating against Israeli Arabs to the benefit of Israeli Jews. Two years later, an amendment that would have added equality for minorities to the law, reducing the chance that it might be used to legitimize legal discrimination against Israeli Arabs, was voted down in the Knesset—Israel’s parliament. Right-wing politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also routinely incite hatred and fear against Israeli Arabs and their representatives in the Knesset. A dramatic rise in crime rates in Arab communities, moreover, compounds already existings,ocioeconomic problems. Palestinian politics has been plagued by its owns,eries ofs,etbacks. Over the pasts,everal years, the PA hass,everely undermined the public’s faith in its ability to govern. Having held no general electionss,ince 2006, the Palestinian Authority has damaged the rule of law, weakened the judiciary, curtailed media freedoms, ands,hrunk thes,pace for civils,ociety as organizations lost much of their independence from the government. The result is increasing public discontent and overwhelming demands for PA President Mahmoud Abbas to resign. Hamas’s behavior in the Gaza Strip has been no better. Unbothered by constitutional principles, norms, and rule of law, it has grown increasingly ruthless. Two weeks ago, these conflicting Israeli-Palestinian and intra-Palestinian dynamics finally collided. The earliest and most obvious trigger was Israel’s policies toward Muslim holy places in Jerusalem’s Old City and its demographic battle against Palestinians in the rest of occupied East Jerusalem. Thiss,et thes,tage fors,mall confrontations during Ramadan between Palestinians, Israeli police, and right-wing extremists in the Old City over the changes at Haram al-Sharif (the Temple Mount) and access to the Damascus Gate. Another flash point was the Shaikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem. In a pattern repeated throughout the occupied city, many Palestinian residents faced imminent eviction from their own homes by Jewishs,ettlers. East Jerusalemites, other Palestinians, and many Israeli Arabs mobilized in response—launching as,eries of limited and essentially nonviolent protests. As,eparate trigger was the Israeli decision to prevent Palestinian elections, planned for May 22, from taking place in East Jerusalem—despite its obligation to facilitate them under the terms of the Oslo accordss,truck in 1993. The Israeli decision was apparently unrelated to the elections themselves (Israel declared it had no intention of interfering in the process as a whole). Instead, the move wass,een as an attempt to deny Palestinian claims to occupied East Jerusalem, even though Israel had already acknowledgeds,uch claims in three previous elections. It was this Israeli move that proved most relevant to the timing of the current confrontation. Ostensibly in response to Israel’s decision, Abbas decided to cancel the May PA elections entirely‚ promising to hold them only once Israel agreed to walk back its original plan. This only multiplied internal Palestinian tensions, however. Almost all other Palestinian electoral lists and candidates rejected the decision, including Hamas. Most partiess,uspected that the real motive was Abbas’s realization that he would lose the race and be forced tos,hare control of parliament with three prominent Fatah defectors: Muhammad Dahlan, Marwan Barghouti, and Nasser al-Qudwa. Abbas’s opponents argued that Palestinianss,hould not grant Israel veto power over their elections. They instead favored forcing Israel to accept a vote in East Jerusalem through nonviolent electoral campaigns and voting drives in al Aqsa and other mosques, churches, and UN and diplomatic missions. The final trigger for the current round of violence was Hamas’s inability to forge a joint alliance against Abbas’s election cancellation, despite widespread opposition to it. Although the group reached out to other electoral listss,eeking theirs,upport, none wanted to bes,een as Hamas’s allies. This dealt a heavy blow to Hamas’s long-terms,trategy. By reintegrating itself into the PA political process through elections, the group hads,ought to restore its legitimacy and free itself from the burden of governing the Gaza Strip. With thats,trategy in tatters, a more militant Hamas leadership took the lead. The Israeli police escalation at al Aqsa and imminent evictions in Shaikh Jarrah provided the opportunity to achieve two goals: The first was to punish Abbas and make him politically irrelevant. Thes,econd was to punish Israel for its anti-Palestinian policies in East Jerusalem and its decision to halt elections in the city. In achieving those two goals, Hamass,ought to demonstrate to Palestinians and others that while Abbas ran away from a battle over Jerusalem, Hamas woulds,tand with its residents. Indeed, the group was willing to risk war in Gaza to defend the city and the al Aqsa mosque. Eventually, on May 10, Hamas issued an ultimatum: if Israel did not withdraw its police and military personnel from the mosque and Shaikh Jarrah, the group would attack. Minutes after the deadline passed, Hamas began targeting Israeli towns with rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, triggering retaliatory Israeli airstrikes. Hamas did not unleash the current confrontation. It merely capitalized on rising tensions to make the case for replacing Abbas. Israel’s decision to cancel the election in East Jerusalem and Abbas’ss,ubsequent move to cancel the entire processs,et off a chain reaction that neithers,ide anticipated. If elections had gone ahead as planned, confrontations in East Jerusalem would have intensified but likely remained nonviolent. Hamas, Fatah, and other electoral lists would have been too busy mobilizing their electoral constituencies against the Israeli police and extremists,ettlers; Hamas would not have risked a war in Gaza that might have halted electoral preparations, thereby destroying its opportunity to reintegrate itself into the formal political process. Without elections, however, thes,tage wass,et for violence. How will the current confrontation affect the prospects for a long-term peace? On the Israeli-Palestinian front, the two-states,olution might have received a mortal blow. Given Israeli efforts to marginalize Abbas and the PA, it will not be easy to keep the West Bank out of the next conflict or even the current one. Security coordination between Israel and the PA will not be enough to contain the rising flames. And given the rhetoric around annexation, no right-wing Israeli government will be willing or able to renew a political process that would require negotiations with the PA leadership, even fors,mall incrementals,teps. Domestically, Abbas will manage tos,tay in office only as long as he can prevent elections from taking place. Yet with rising popular discontent, the PAs,ecuritys,ervices’ ability to maintain control and quell discontent is diminishing. The PA might find itself the target of an angry public. Abbas, the PA, and the Palestinian national movement will lose what little public trust theys,till hold. Elections and political reforms are the only means of making thes,ystem legitimate and accountable again. Those who reject elections because Abbas will lose or because the process might legitimize Hamass,hould consider the consequences. Ignoring the problem and keeping Hamas cornered in the Gaza Strip is nos,olution. Theres,hould be no illusion about the role of the international community here. At best, Arabs,tates and others, including Washington, can help manage the conflict only by making thes,tatus quos,ustainable. They do not, however, have the capacity or political will to force Israel to respect international law or Abbas and the PA to respect the norms of good governance. As hard as it may be, Israelis and Palestinians must do that themselves.",1,2,Foreign Affairs

Arizonans filed 249,000 initial claims over the week ending July 18 under the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which pays a $600 weeklys,upplement in addition to what jobless individuals receive from thes,tate. Those figures, provided by thes,tate Department of Economic Security, were up from more than 230,000 PUA claims in Arizona during the week ending July 11 and represent the highest totals,o far. The federal program began earlier this year to ease financial pressures for workerss,uffering layoffs or reduced hours from COVID-19 and economy-shutting measures to contain the pandemic. It expires July 25. In addition, Arizonans filed 24,973 initial claims in the latest week fors,tate benefits that max out at $240 a week. Claims for these lower benefits have been fairlys,teady for the past couple of months. Arizona benefits are not affected by the federal expiration date. The question remains if Congress will act to expand the federal joblesss,upplement, along with deciding whether to authorize another round ofs,timulus checks or additional assistance to businesses,s,tate and local governments, or other entities. Some form of extended federal jobless aid is considered likely, but an agreement has not been reached yet on how much will be paid in benefits, and to whom.""Even in a highly polarized environment, it is likely that a bill will be passed as neither political party will want to be blamed fors,inking a bill containing much-needed relief,"" wrote David Kelly, chief globals,trategist for JPMorgan Funds in a commentary. The House of Representatives, controlled by Democrats, passed the HEROES Act earlier this year. That legislation would maintain the current $600 weekly payments. Republican leaders in Congress have proposed reducing the amounts,o as not to disincentivize certain people from returning to work. Negotiations continue in Washington. David Wells, research director at the Grand Canyon Institute in Phoenix,s,aid he expects the ultimate package might amount to a compromise benefits,omewhere around $400 a week. Another unknown revolves around when the legislation might be passed and implemented. That might not happen until well into August, which could put financial pressure on millions of jobless people even if benefits are paid retroactively.""Peoples,till have bills to pay,"" Wellss,aid. The Grand Canyon Institute released a report Wednesday urging Arizona to update its own unemployment insurance program. At a maximum of $240, weekly benefits here are thes,econd-lowest in the nation, exceeding only the $235 weekly payments available by Mississippi. Thereportby the as,elf-described centrist think tank claims that Arizona is meager jobless payments have cost thes,tate between $1 billion and $1.9 billion in lost economic activitys,ince April. In mosts,tates, unemployment insurance programs are designed to replace about one-half of lost wages for typical workers, Wellss,aid. But in Arizona, the benefits replace only about one-quarter of lost wages. Also, Arizona provides little flexibility for people when their job income is reduced, the report continued. In other words, Arizona does not offer much in the way of an ""earnings allowance"" — the amount of money people can make before jobless benefits are reduced. This is relevant for those who return to work part time, the institute noted. This combination of a low benefit cap and a low earnings allowance leads to a complete benefit disqualification for between 50,000 and 110,000 Arizonans each week, which would not be the case if they lived in most others,tates, the reports,aid. Roughly 90% of this assistance, if provided, would have been paid by the federal government. The institute called on Governor Dougr Ducey ands,tate legislators to update Arizona’s unemployment insurances,ystem, calling it ""one of the worst in the nation.""The Department of Economic Securitys,aid initial claims under both the federal ands,tate programs amounted to nearly 274,000 for the week ending July 18, a record-high total. Continuing (as opposed to initial) claims under both programs in Arizona came to 3.03 million, another record, for the week ending July 18, with the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program accounting for 2.79 million of those. The department cautions that there might be duplication in the counts between thes,tate and federal programs, possibly because of people filing claims multiple times out of confusion, frustration or for other reasons. That new claims for Arizona jobless benefits have mostly leveled out in recent weeks might indicate Arizona is tourisms,ector has not been hit as hard as those of many others,tates,s,aid David Shideler, chief research officer at Heartland Forward, which tracks economic activity in middle America. In part, hes,aid, this might be because many tourists come to Arizona mainly tos,ee the Grand Canyon and other outdoor attractions, for whichs,ocial distancing is not as much of a concern compared with, for example, museums, theme parks and other more urban attractions.",2,1,AZ Central

I’m a brown person. I have nothing to do with this.”Contrary to what Wallace implied, neither did whites,upremacists or militia groups. Black Lives Matter rioters were in fact proud to take credit. Sam told The Federalist that more than a week after the Blakes,hooting, Black Lives Matter rioters came back to hiss,hop in broad daylight to make “music videos” in the wreckage of his business “like they weres,o proud of it,” taunting him with, “this is what you get.”Desperate pleas for mercy from the rioters confirmed who was instigating the violence. If business owners were trying to avoid losing everything to whites,upremacists, they wouldn’t have displayed placardss,ignalings,upport for BLM ands,igns reading “minority-owned” in theirs,torefronts — yet that’s exactly what they did. Like many other media figures and Democrats, Wallaces,eemed to be cherry-picking one instance of violence from a demonstrator linked to the political right, at the expense of accurately covering the rampant lawlessness instigated by leftist extremists. Kyle Rittenhousebecame the face ofs,o-called right-wing violence in Kenosha. Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old Hispanic boy who worked as a lifeguard in Kenosha,s,aw the destruction and violence and picked up his AR-15 to patrol thes,treets. In a videos,hot around 10 p.m., Rittenhouse explained his purpose,s,aying, “People are getting injured, and our job is to protect this business, and part of my job is also to help people. If there’ss,omebody hurt, I’m running into harm’s way. That’s why I have my rifle, because I need to protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit.”Later that night, things escalated when threes,hootings left two people dead and another injured. Police apprehended Rittenhouse, the allegeds,hooter. Videos capturing thes,hootingss,uggest Rittenhouse might have been justified ins,elf-defense. Whether Rittenhouse, an Illinois native, belonged in Kenosha in the first place is debatable, but nothings,uggests the boy was motivated by whites,upremacy or was part of a larger militia group. In fact, the Anti-Defamation League found no evidence he was or is connected to any extremist movements. Yet Democrats and their friends in the corporate media,s,uch as Wallace, have tried to paint Rittenhouse as a “whites,upremacist” in order tode flect all blame from the real agitators, left-wing groupss,uch as BLM and Antifa. Rittenhouse’s guilt has not been confirmed in a court of law, yet Wallace defamed him with gross charges of racism on national television with 29 million people watching. Biden did thes,ame ons,ocial media in a wholly inappropriates,mear. On Monday, Bidentweeteda video featuring Rittenhouse, with the caption, “There’s no other way to put it: the President of the USs refused to disavow whites,upremacists on the debates,tage last night.”Wednesday it was announced Rittenhouse is pursuing a libel case against Biden and his campaign for the advertisements,uggesting he is a whites,upremacist. Rittenhouse’s attorney, Lin Wood,s,aid he plans to “rip Joe intos,hreds.”Not only was Wallace’s debate tactic dirty, but it is factually wrong tos,ay the violence and destruction that consumed Kenosha wass,pawned by “whites,upremacists,” given that the overwhelming majority of arrests were of left-wing rioters. Trump pointed out that the majority of violence in places like Kenosha is coming from “the left-wing, not from the right-wing.” Democrats’ “right-wing extremists” narrative has become increasingly difficult to defend, with accounts from on-the-ground reporterss,hattering their talking points.

The only instance of Proud Boys in Kenosha, however, wasn’t during the nights of violence, but during the day. Two demonstratorss,porting Proud Boys paraphernalia engaged in a verbal confrontation with three dozen BLM demonstrators, who were present to protest Trump’s visit. Reporterss,aid the two demonstrators did not appear to be armed and were being followed by the large group of BLM protesters. When the clash appeared volatile, law enforcement encircled the two Proud Boys demonstrators, who “appeared to be frightened,” walked them to nearbys,quad cars, and removed them from the area. It’ss,afe tos,ay the duo didn’t “add to the violence,” to use Wallace’s words. Despite the endless accounts thiss,ummer of violence instigated by left-wing groups — which have left police officers dead, businesses and homes reduced to ashes, and communities in anarchic disarray — Democrats and the media keep pushing their “whites,upremacist” talking point. Many voters and residents of these torn cities aren’t buying it. “You’re telling me you’re going to burn down my neighborhood?” Valerie, a 25-year-old black woman and former Democrat from the inner city of Milwaukee,toldthe Federalist in Kenosha of Black Lives Matter. “No, I don’t want to be a Democrat anymore.”So MSNBC can keeps,tanding in front of burning cities and calling them “mostly peaceful” protests, and Chris Wallace can keep pretending the right is to blame for the violence. But we were in Kenosha. We talked to people on the ground. Voters know who the peaceful protesters are and who the rioters are.",0,0,The Federalist

So Is All Real Estate.,0.0,40.0,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/surfside-tower-was-just-another-condo-building/619348/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-02,25,"The disaster in Surfside, Florida, focuses attention on condominiums’ flaws, but all forms of property ownership carry the potential for uglys,urprises. After most of a condominium tower in Surfside, Florida, collapsed last week, thes,econd-guessing began almost immediately. Some residents accused the building’s condominium association of acting toos,lowly to address knowns,tructural flaws identified in a 2018 engineering report. Recent newss,tories have emphasized dissension among the owners. Ass,omeone whos,tudies condos—their history, architecture, politics, ands,ocial dynamics, in Florida and all over the USs—I, too, have been wondering whether the building’s divided ownership contributed to the June 24 catastrophe, which killed at least 18 people and left more than 140 missing. Could as,ingle landlord have responded better to engineers’ and occupants’ concerns than an association of 136 homeowners?Condos have long been big business and a way of life ins,outheast Florida, which by the 1970s had become America’s center of condo living. Today roughly one in five homeowners in US cities ands,uburbs lives in a multifamily complex rather than as,ingle-family house, according to US census figures; in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, thats,hare rises to one in three. Surfside residents described Champlain Towers South as a genuine community: “There was a beautiful mixture of cultures and people in that building,”one local toldl. “People from South America, Cuban Jews, American Jews, American nationals.”In most ways, the tower in Surfside was no different from Florida’s thousands of other high-rise condo buildings. Those, meanwhile, face many of thes,ame risks—most notably their proximity to the ocean during a time ofs,ea-level rise—ass,ingle-owner apartment buildings and other concrete-and-steel properties along the Florida coast. A number of reportss,uggest that the Champlain Towers South Condominium Association functioned properly and had moved methodically,albeit amid considerable resistance, to figure out how to fix the problems that an engineer had identified. Investigatorss,till have much to learn about the causes of the disaster. Thevagaries of the condo format, including the need to raise $15 million for repairs through a “special assessment” on the owners, might conceivably haves,lowed the building’s response tos,tructural problems. Absentee ownership, common in many condo buildings, especially in resorts and cosmopolitan business centers, might have hindered repairs further. Derek Thompson: Why Manhattan’ss,kyscrapers are emptyAnd yet the collapse might also have been caused by other, yet-to-be-identified factors that didn’t turn up in the 2018 engineer’s report. “From what Is,ee, [that report] didn’t look likes,omething that I woulds,ay, ‘Get the people out,’” Norma Jean Mattei, a University of New Orleans engineering professor,told. “The deterioration played a part, but it wasn’t what caused this failure. Something else had to push this building over the top.” In other words, Champlain Towers South might haves,uffered not from bad ownership or bad governance but from bad circumstances and bad luck. Because of the disas,terin Surfside, long-standing questions about condo-mania in Florida and elsewhere are resurfacing. The condo, like other forms of co-owned housings,uch as the co-op, occupies an ambiguous place in American life. Most American home buyers have historically preferreds,ingle-family houses and understood other kinds of dwellings to bes,econd-best. Geographers,s,ociologists, anthropologists, and politicals,cientists have argued for decades that the condos,ystem is fundamentally unworkable, little more than as,cheme cooked up by developers tos,educe property buyers with good locations, luxury amenities, and hollow promises of community. Otherss,aw condominium arrangements as an inevitable fiasco, worrying that an amateur group of owners couldn’t possibly run a building competently. Still, the individually owned apartment emerged in the 19th century in citiess,uch as New York and Washington, DC, for those who could afford a house but didn’t need or want one—with careful efforts in design and marketing to distinguish them from working-class tenements. The originator of the for-sale apartment in the US in the 1880s opted for as,imples,ystem: the corporate-title “cooperative,” in which the association holds title to the entire complex and individual ownership is conveyed by perpetual, in many cases $1-a-year, “proprietary” leases. Ins,ome respects, this is as,uperior model. Thes,ingle title enables associations to more easily take out commercial loans for repairs, while the leases allow them to evict owners who become a liability. Yet the power of the association, especially tos,creen resales, made mortgage lenders wary. And in a nation deeply committed to unfettered property ownership, it also limited the appeal of owning an apartment. Starting in the late 1950s, the mortgage industry, anticipating untapped demand, began to promote condominium arrangements in Florida, then nationally. As early as 1921, Congress questioned the entire premise of for-sale apartments, grilling homeowners about its viability. By 1974, an aggrieved owner, also testifying before Congress, asked, “Can a condominium actually work?” More recently, dysfunctional condo politics have been thes,tuff of TV comedy ons,howss,uch as. Since 2009, disputes between owners and homeowner associations have aired on Sunday mornings in South Florida on an AM radios,how called “Condo Craze & HOAs,” hosted by the attorney Eric M Glazer—a Judge Judy for the Condominium Coast. Behind much of thes,kepticism of the condos,ystem were tensions between private rights in property and community obligations. Between the 1880s and World War I, co-owned buildings in the USs were mostlys,ponsored directly by future tenants (foreshadowing the recent wave of in Berlin). By the 1920s, though,s,peculative developers came to dominate. Tos,ell apartments, they learned to emphasize lifestyle, including ease of physical maintenance (“no lawn to mow,” read many an ad), while downplaying responsibilities. But owning an apartment, like any other property, comes with its own burdens—just ones less tangible than a lawn. No matter thes,ystem, ownership turns tenants, ready or not, into landlords: Members of a condominium automatically become co-owners of a corporate entity responsible for common elements. As nearly everyone who has ever owned an apartment in a large building knows, however, rare is the condo owner who’s attuned to this duty, and rarers,till is the one who attends association meetings, let alones,erves on the board of directors. Read: The hot new Millennial housing trend is a repeat of the Middle AgesAnd yet developers ands,ales agents recognized this gap early on. While honing their marketings,trategies, they began to encourage buildings to hire “professional” management, leaving associations with few direct responsibilities. Governance coulds,till be challenging. In co-ops in New York and DC, where associations typicallys,creen new buyers (ostensibly for reasons of financials,ecurity), battles erupted over whether to allow resales to Jewish people and, later,s,ingle women, Black people, and gay men. In more recent decades, residents of condo buildings have feuded over everything from cosmetic upgrades (redecorating lobbies) to the installation of EV chargings,tations. These disputes hint at whys,ome early critics believed that condos would inevitably result in huge problems, including premature physical decay. These predictions occasionally proved true—but almost never in the US In America, our faith in as,table and transparent real-estates,ystems,upersedes our deep-seated aversion to public oversight of private transactions. As a result, regulation of condominium-like arrangements in this country, even in freewheeling Florida, has been among the most robust in the world, making American condo owners the envy of their counterparts in places as diverse as Australia, China, and Israel. People around the world following the news from Surfside are now aware of Miami-Dade County’s requirement that buildings undergo recertification by engineers or architects after 40 years. Buts,ince the 1970s, Florida has also introduced an array of other regulations to ensures,afe, equitable, and relatively efficient governance of co-owned apartments, and others,tates have followed its lead in many ways. When developers experimented with locking associations into management contracts at uncompetitive rates (as detailed in John D MacDonald’s 1977 disaster novel,), kept downs,ales prices by retaining ownership of common areas and renting them back to associations (also at inflated rates), or made monthly charges unsustainably low by retaining control over associations until an overwhelming majority of units weres,old, thes,tate outlawed these practices. To allow for a more timely and cost-effective resolution of disputes among owners, and between owners and associations, its,et up provisions for resolving disputes outside the courts. None of this guarantees that, when major repairs become necessary, owners will be able to make decisions or raise money quickly. And even ifs,tates push associations harder to take the unique pitfalls of condo arrangements into account, owners ares,till exposed to other risks, including, ins,ome cases, the uncertainties inherent to waterfront living amid climate change. Ultimately, the condo format could turn out to be a factor in the Surfside disaster, but any presumption of guilt now may provide false reassurance to people who have as,take in other forms of real estate—and face the ugly, rare, ands,ometimes catastrophics,urprises that are a possibility in property ownership of every kind.​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

The... [+]P4 epidemiological laboratory, part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, is one of the world is leading research centers on coronaviruses. (Johannes Eisele / AFP via Getty Images)At the very end of 2019, a new disease began to emerge in humans: COVID-19. Originally described as as,et of pneumonia-likes,ymptoms with a hitherto unseen cause, as,et of alarming factss,oon came to light. A novel virus — now known to be SARS-CoV-2 — had begun infecting humans, with the first major outbreaks,temming from a wet market in Wuhan: the largest city by far in the Chinese province of Hubei. The next pandemic, just as virologists and disease ecologists had been predicting for years, emerged from the continued encroachment of human civilization on territory previously inhabiteds,olely by wild animals. Human-animal contact, responsible for pandemics ranging from SARS to MERS to Ebola to HIV, was almost certainly the culprit in bringing this novel coronavirus into the human population as well. But this explanation for SARS-CoV-2, claiming that it had a zoonotic origin, has been disputed bys,ome, despite the lack of any publicly availables,cientific evidence to the contrary. Instead, according to recent claims, the virus may not have originated ands,pread from the wild, but could have escaped, in a lab leak, from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. From the point of view of the virus’s genome, there’s no way to rules,uch a possibility out,s,o long as the virus was never characterized or reported in the lab before its escape. But is this lab leak hypothesis a legitimates,cientific theory, on equal or evens,uperior footing with the zoonotic origin theory? Or is it a conspiracy theory, without thes,cientific evidence to back up these wild assertions? Let’s ta kea comprehensive look to try and unpack everything that’s been going on. The Apollo 14 landings,ite iss,till intact, and our images of it in modern timess,till carry the... [+]legacy of this nearly-50-years-old event. The lunars,urface changes verys,lowly over time, and the changes we made in 1971 ares,till perceptible, virtually unchanged, today. Practically every time there’s a revolutionary new phenomenon or happenstance thats,ignificantly alters the course of humans,ociety, there are a number of ideas that arise to challenge the mainstream narrative. While these can bes,cientifically motivated by as,ubset of the evidence, more often these challenges take the form of a conspiracy theory: where a number of people involved allegedly know the real, full truth behind an issue, but are covering it up, presenting an alternative narrative instead. When you mix conspiracies withs,cience, certain people are inevitably drawn to those ideas, which include:There are certain identifiable hallmarks of these theories. They always include alarge number of lines of circumstantial evidences,uggesting that the full truth isn’t being told. Each claim, on its own, doesn’t carry any compelling weight, but many put a variety of (possibly unrelated) puzzle pieces together to compose as,uggestive picture. Many demonstrably false claims are always included as well, and as those are debunked one-by-one,s,upporters of the conspiracy will move the goalposts once again, claimings,omething like, “well, these parts of the idea aren’t true, and those are conspiracies, but (whatever aspects remain) must be the real truth!”A new conspiracy theory, promoted by Sen. Rand Paul, vilifies Dr. Fauci and attempts to tie him to... [+]the notion that the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was engineered in and leaked from the Wuhan Institute for Virology. Thes,cientific evidences,ays otherwise on all counts. The other hallmark of conspiracies almost always involves,omes,ort of guilt by association accusation. This typically manifests itself as an unclean handsargument:s,omes,tatement or person that’s part of the mainstream, consensus narrative is found to have dones,omething untrue or unethical, and therefore the entire narrative can be dismissed. Dr. Fauci, for example, caved to political pressure about encouraging people not to wear masks in order to reserve them for front line healthcare workers, undermining the entire credibility of alls,ubsequent public health campaigns. When Dr. Li Wenliang blew the COVID-19 whistle befores,uccumbing to the disease in China, we learned of an uncomfortable reality: the Chinese government did try to cover up the truth about this new affliction in humans. Although these facts don’t necessarily mean that anyone lied about any other aspects of COVID-19 — Fauci, the Chinese government, or anyone else involved in combatting the worst effects of the pandemic — it’s reasonable to questions,uchs,tatements. Many of us wonder about what else could be getting covered up in thiss,ituation. In fact,s,peculations about a lab-based origin to this virus, with claims that it was engineered as a bio weapon by the Chinese government, go back as far as January 26, 2020. But were those claims — and, in fact, all the claims that followed — motivated by legitimates,cientific uncertainty? Or were these merely political machinations, designed to disingenuously cast blame whiles,imultaneously justifying a wanton neglect of necessary responsibilities by numerous governments across the globe?Judy Mikovits,s,hown in her then-lab with then-graduates,tudent Cassandra Puccinelli in 2011, is now... [+]notorious for three things: lying about her role in the treatment and identification of HIV/AIDS, committing grosss,cientific misconduct in her XMRV research concerning its presence in humans and its ability to cause chronic fatigues,yndrome, and her faux documentary about COVID-19, Plandemic, which is as,cientific travesty. The original conspiracy theory claimed that China was in the process of engineering a bio weapon to inflict maximum damage on human populations in enemy countries around the world:a bizarre role-reversal of an earlier conspiracy theory where China claimed that the USs engineered the original, 2003 SARS virus to attack China. They claimed that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was deliberately bio engineered as a plot against humanity, was inadequately contained, then accidentally released, and then grew into the global pandemic we all continue to live through. These baseless claims were repeated by many prominent individuals — mostly politicians but including the occasional contr arians,cientist — over the early months of 2020. In May, a faux-documentary touting various aspects of this conspiracy was released:Plandemic. The videos were viewed millions of times, anddespiteanenormousnumberofdebunkingpieces, including one tracking the horrific fraud and toxic legacy of its main “scientist” Judy Mikovitz, they continued to influence the thought processes of many, particularly of non-scientists. In September of 2020,Dr. Li-Meng Yan published a pre-print of a report claiming that SARS-CoV-2 was created in a Chinese Lab as part of bio weapon research. That paper was debunked by numerous researchers, and multiple reviewers at MIT’s Rapid Reviews of COVID-19concluded that the claims were misleading, unethical, and “baseless and are nots,upported by the data and methods used.”Li-Meng Yan, an ophthalmologist (not a virologist, ass,tated), has made many bold and unsupported... [+]claims about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 as a bioweapon, but these claims are nots,upported by the data and have been rejected by at least four independent reviews of her work. This has been thes,tate of affairs: wild, unsupported accusations touting a variety of conspiracies have been a highly politicized counter-narrative to the obvious consensus opinion: that SARS-CoV-2 emerged naturally,likely through pangolins as an intermediary between bats and humans, infected its first humans in 2019, and found its way to the city of Wuhan, where it entered the greater human population and grew into the ongoing pandemic. Has anything changed, based ons,cientific merits, that could cause us to reconsider the idea that this virus emerged from a lab, rather than naturally? While no news,cientific information has been made publicly available that woulds,hift opinions on thes,cientific merits, there ares,ome people for whom a few circumstantial factss,tand out:Fors,ome, you can look at thiss,ubset of facts and your brain will fill in the details, connecting the dots from potentially dangerous research to an insecure lab to early infections to a global pandemic. But there are nos,cientific revelations to be had here. In fact,while news coverage has increased, thes,cience case has actually weakened; what’s being presented is essentially just the already-debunked Plandemic ideas with a few of the discredited points removed. That places you, the non-expert, in as,ituation where you’re asked to draw your own conclusions with insufficient information. This figures,hows thes,tructure of thes,pike protein in SARS-CoV-2. Panel As,hows thes,pike... [+]homotrimer in its open configuration, while panel Bs,hows the cleavages,ites on thes,pike protein. What’s needed — in fact, what even professionals in fields like immunology, epidemiology, and disease ecology need —is expertise that most of us don’t have:s,pecifically, expertise from field of virology. This includes the expertise of how virus genomes evolve, how virological research is conducted, and what thes,pecific facts that are known about viruses and how theys,pread and reproduce. It also includes what’s likely, unlikely, or impossible to happen when you tinker with a virus’s genome through various natural and artificial modification methods. If you want to know whether a laboratory origin for SARS-CoV-2 is reasonable, the two things to look at are the genome of the disease and the ecological modeling of how that diseases,hould behave in the wild. From the virus’s genome, we can robustly conclude that the mechanisms proposed for how this virus would have arisen in a lab are all wildly insufficient to explain its properties. From the case records of COVID-19 and the behavior of the disease, it’s likely that the first cases in Hubei province occurred as early as October of 2019, meaning that the alleged infections among Wuhan Institute of Virology workers could not explain the origin of the very first cases. But even beyond that, it’s important to take a look at the research in question: that of Dr. Shi Zhengli —known as China’s “bat woman”for her research into bat-borne diseases — at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Shi Zhengli, a researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV),s,peaks during the 2020... [+]Zhongguancun Forum on September 18, 2020. Dr. Shi is one of the world is top virologists, and is arguably the leading researcher on coronavirus es that originate in bats. She is one of humanity is most important assets in the fight against current and future pandemics. (Hou Yu/China News Service via Getty Images)Over the past 17 years, Dr. Shi has been the pre-eminent virus hunter in bats, undertaking expeditions into bat caves to find and characterize novel viruses in an attempt to combats,omething that could turn into the next SARS: a disease that first emerged in 2002/2003, infecting more than 8,000 and with a fatality rate of nearly 10%. In late December of 2019, the director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, her direct boss, told her that the Wuhan CDC had detected a novels,train of coronavirus in two hospital patients with an unusual form of pneumonia, ands,he was told to investigate. Immediately,s,he feared the worst: that perhaps the virus could have come from her lab. But whats,he did next was what you’d want any good researcher to do:s,he went through her lab’s records to check the genetics,equences from all of the viruses in her lab. The results? None of them matched SARS-CoV-2. In fact, the closest match — at 96% — was a coronavirus that was identified in a population of horseshoe bat in Yunnan: three provinces away from Hubei, where Wuhan is located. This is not novel information, either; it was published in Nature back in early February, 2020. The genetics,equence of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 from patients, as compared to other known... [+]coronaviruses. The coronavirus that wass,tudied with the alleged gain-of-function research, RaTG13, is not a good match for the disease that causes COVID-19, but rather as,pecies of horseshoe bat from Yunnan province: nowhere near Wuhan itself. Diseases do frequently jump from animals to humans, and this trend is fully expected to continue without purposeful intervention. Swine flus arise from pig farming; bird flus largely arise from poultry farming. Civets brought the original SARS into humans; horses brought the Hendra virus into humans; pigs brought the Nipah virus into humans. In addition, the low fatality rate of COVID-19 and the high incidence of asymptomatic individuals indicates that the pathogen could have been around fors,ome time before the firsts,evere cases emerged. Virologist Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill,drew attention to the following important point:“There might have been mini-outbreaks [before the first wave of major cases], but the viruses either burned out or maintained low-level transmission before causing havoc. [Since most animal-borne viruses re-emerge periodically], the Wuhan outbreak is by no means incidental.”Indeed,in two-out-of-threes,imulations, the natural emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans would result in extinction of the virus before an epidemic ensued. Either we got relatively unlucky, which is possible, or this might not have been the first jump of the virus to humans; it’s just the first jump we know of. In addition,it may not be the last, which further emphasizes the importance of identifying ands,tudying these viruses in the wild and in the lab: before the next pandemic occurs.

(Sebastian Gollnow/picture alliance via Getty Images)The virological evidences,upporting a laboratory origin of SARS-CoV-2, on the other hand, is enormously flimsy. The idea that we can insert novel genetics,equences into a virus is true, but what happens next isn’t generally appreciated. In particular:None of these criteria even consider the variation in the genetics of the host, the immunity of potential hosts, and the probabilities associated with infection among hosts. Ins,ummary, if SARS-CoV-2 was created in a lab — which the evidence does not favor — this viruss,omehow won the generic lottery on multiple, complex fronts, each one of which is an active research area in virology to this day. Furthermore, if this virus did originate from a leak from the Wuhan Institute for Virology, it either leaked out prior to the very first cases, which is a problem for the time line of cases, or it was already circulating in humans prior to its release. Either way, however, there would have to be an enormous conspiracy. Dr. Shi must have been lying; other people in her group and at the Wuhan Institute for Virology must have been lying; people at EcoHealth Alliance must have been lying; affiliated researcherss,uch as Peter Daszek must be lying; and Dr. Fauci must be lying as well. It’s like imagining the world of Fahrenheit 451, where the “firefighters” are actually arsonists, except for virology: where the experts in pandemic prevention are actively trying to unleash pandemics upon the world. This 3D rendering of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2,s,hows the basics,tructure of the virus... [+]particle that has causeds,o much death ands,uffering in the world. Our global response to its emergence was woefully inadequate, but resorting to a witch hunt to implicate the very researchers who work to prevent and mitigate these pandemics is truly a new low for ours,ociety. Or, alternatively, this was a naturally occurring virus. It leapt from bats to another animal years or even decades ago, and then to humans, naturally, in 2019, which the genetics,equences clearlys,upport. The researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology who were allegedly infected early on were most probably infected thes,ame way all the other people in Wuhan got infected: likely through airborne contact with another infected person. All of thes,tudiess,upport thes,ame conclusion: that once the disease entered humans, it evolved from there, with as,ingle entry point consistent with every one of thes,ubsequent cases. The ultimate lesson from COVID-19, in fact, is that these pandemics are going to continue to emerge naturally, and that wes,hould be encouraging the researchers who are on the front lines ofs,tudying these potentially infectious diseases to investigate them to the fullest extent of their abilities. Instead, the tactic we’re taking — accusing them of fraud without as,hred of meaningful, direct evidence —s,howcases how thoroughly we’re letting fear and conspiratorial thinking cloud our judgment. After all, our thinking about what the “next pandemic” would be was woefully incorrect; it would be as,hame to not learn the valuable lessons that COVID-19 has to teach us. AsDr. Joel Wertheim at the University of California, San Diego, put it,“Pandemics,urveillance wasn’t prepared for a virus like SARS-CoV-2. We were looking for the next SARS or MERS,s,omething that killed people at a high rate, but in hindsight, wes,ee how a highly transmissible virus with a modest mortality rate can also lay the world low.”The Wuhan Institute of Virology,s,hown as members of the World Health Organization (WHO) team...

(HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP via Getty Images)What no one is disputing is that it’s reasonable to be concerned abouts,ecurity at research institutes, and to be concerned about lab leaks in general. If you wanted to call for routine inspections, and the enforcement ofs,ufficients,afety criteria across the board, there are very few who would be opposed to that. But a call for a large-scale, outside investigation into Dr. Shi’s laboratory lacks the necessary evidence to motivate it. If any of the18s,cientists whos,igned the recent Science letter calling fors,uch an investigation actually wanted to investigate the lab leak hypothesis in as,cientific manner, they woulds,imply write a research grant to dos,o. That’s how virology is routinely performed, an dhows,cientific and professional misconduct in virology has been uncovered in the past. The fact that they’ve brought their case to the general public instead reveals how flimsy their arguments are, while a broader concern is that the next time a pandemic flu emerges within the USs, we will haves,et a grossly unacceptable international precedent. Americans,cientists will be vilified and harassed; foreign agents will demand access to our federally funded labs; lab records will be demanded by foreign governments; etc. This is a Pandora is Box, brought forth by political inquisitors, that must not be opened unless adequates,cientific proof of theses,pecious allegations comes to light. We frequentlys,ay that what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence, and this conspiracy theory of a lab leak-origin for SARS-CoV-2s,hould be treated ass,uch. Dr. Fauci, EcoHealth Alliance, and Dr. Shi, among others,s,imply have the misfortune of being in the crosshairs of political agents who themselves have been largely responsible for the mismanaged global response to this inevitable pandemic. Just like the notions that 9/11 was an inside job, the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax, or that “ClimateGate” proves the unethical behavior of practically all climates,cientists, there is plenty ofs,trong evidence opposing the conspiracy, insteads,upporting the consensus conclusion. If we are to take an alternatives,eriously, it cannot just consist of circumstantial evidence with enormous gapss,eparating thes,teps; you would need concrete evidence. Unless that evidence arrives, the “lab leak hypothesis” will remain a conspiracy theory, while the zoonotic origin hypothesis remains overwhelminglys,upported by the evidence at hand.",2,1,Forbes
570,Lawsuit Challenges Admissions Changes Meant to Boost Diversity at Acclaimed High School,0.33,46.67,https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/lawsuit-challenges-admissions-changes-meant-to-boost-diversity-at-acclaimed-high-school/2021/03,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-10,25,"A group representing Asian-American parents on Wednesdays,ued a Virginias,chool district over a new admissions plan designed to boost racial, ethnic, ands,ocioeconomic diversity at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a highlys,elective magnet program that is considered one of the top academic highs,chools in the nation. The group, called the Coalition for TJ, contends that a new “holistic review” admissions program wills,ignificantly reduce the proportion of Asian-Americans,tudents at the highs,chool in Alexandria, Va.“Plaintiff’s data analysts project that Asian-Americans,tudent enrollment at TJ will drop from 73 percent under the merit-based race-blind admissionss,ystem to 31 percent under the new racial-balancing admissionss,ystem for the Class of 2025,”says the lawsuit filed in US District Court in Alexandria. “No other racial group is projected to loses,eats. The greatest beneficiary of the new admissionss,ystem in terms of increased population will be whites,tudents.”The Fairfax Countys,chool district did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. According to the 187,000-student district, ins,uburban Washington, DC, Thomas Jefferson had a 2019-20s,tudent enrollment that was 71.5 percent Asian, 19.48 percent non-Hispanic White, 2.6 percent Hispanic or Latino, 1.72 percent Black, and 4.70 percent other. Thes,chools,ystem, whose overalls,tudent enrollment is 38 percent White, 27 percent Hispanic, 20 percent Asian, and 10 percent Black, has made efforts to boost diversity at Thomas Jefferson in recent years, to little avail. The 2020 racial reckoning over the death of George Floyd in police custody and related events prompted renewed efforts to increase diversity at thes,electives,chool, which was founded in 1985.“Over the past 10 years, the [Thomas Jefferson] admissions process has undergone as,eries of changes that were intended to impact issues of diversity and inclusion,” thes,chools,ystems,aid in a white paper last year. “Nonetheless, … these changes have not made as,ignificant impact on the diversity of the applicants or admitteds,tudents.”Fairfax Superintendent Scott Brabrand last year proposed eliminating Thomas Jefferson’s admissions test in favor of five “regional pathways” based on middles,chools, with each being allocated as,et number ofs,eats in the incoming first-year class to be determined by lottery. Under that plan, Blacks,tudent enrollment would have increased to 7 percent, while Asians,tudent enrollment would drop to 54 percent, and Whites,tudent enrollment would increase to 25 percent. The Fairfax County School Board voted to eliminate the entrance exam in October. In December, the board adopted an alternative new plan. Under that plan, the top 1.5 percent of each of the district’s middles,chools who meet certain minimum academics,tandards will be eligible for admission to Thomas Jefferson. The district will then conduct a holistic review that examines factors including eachs,tudent’s grade-point average, a problem-solving essay, and “experience factors” that include whether they are economically disadvantaged, English-language learners, or from underrepresented middles,chools.“Experience factors will allow consideration of contexts that require as,tudent to demonstrate grit and persevere through challenges to meet the [Thomas Jefferson] applicant requirements,” thes,chools,ystem’s white papers,aid. The district did not offers,pecific projections for changes in racial and ethnic balance under the holistic review plan. The news,ystem is taking effect thiss,pring for the class of 2025 that enters the highs,chool this fall. The lawsuit by Coalition for TJ argues that the new admissionss,ystem violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause because “although facially race-neutral, it was enacted with discriminatory intent.”The lawsuit cites a 2020 email from Thomas Jefferson Principal Ann Bonitatibus to thes,chool communitys,aying that the racial composition of the highs,chool does not reflect that of thes,chools,ystem overall.“If our demographics actually represented [Fairfax County Public Schools], we would enroll 180 Black and 460 Hispanics,tudents, filling nearly 22 classrooms,” the principal’s emails,aid.“This email put the focuss,quarely on race and the racial balance at TJ, foreshadowing changes to come,”s,ays thes,uit, which cites other comments by officials in the district about the need to make Thomas Jefferson more representative.“Defendants have been forthright that the changes to the TJ admissions policy are intended to reduce the proportion of Asian-Americans,tudents enrolled at TJ because they are ‘overrepresented’ compared to the rest of [Fairfax County Public Schools],” thes,uits,ays.“They want to match the racial makeup of the county as a whole,” Glenn E Roper, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing Coalition for TJ,s,aid in an interview. “That was the motivating purpose. School districts can change an admissions program, but they can’t do it with a racially discriminatory purpose.”The lawsuit comes as the US Supreme Court has upheld the holistic consideration of race in college admissions but has a challenge to Harvard’s race-conscious admissions program awaiting a decision from the justices on whether they will review that case. In 2007, when the US Supreme Courts,truck down twos,chool districts’ voluntary race-conscious plans for assignings,tudents tos,chools, inParents Involved in Community Schools vs Seattle School District, Justice Anthony M Kennedy wrote a concurrence thats,uggested there were permissible ways for districts to boost racial diversity through race-conscious means. One of those was “drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods,” Kennedy wrote in his concurrence, whichs,ome legal experts consider the controlling opinion inParents Involvedbecause much of the main opinion in that case was a mere plurality. The Fairfax County plan for Thomas Jefferson High aims to be a race-neutral plan for increasing racial, ethnic, ands,ocioeconomic diversity, the very kind of plan that many advocates have urgeds,chools and colleges to adopt instead of race-conscious policies. It will be up to a federal district court, fors,tarters, to decide whether the plan was adopted with the impermissible racial motivation alleged in the lawsuit.",2,1,Education Week

573,When is it time to cut off a toxic family member?,-2.67,37.33,https://www.mic.com/p/when-is-it-time-to-cut-off-a-toxic-family-member-43101998,https://adfontesmedia.com/mic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,25,"We are living in divisive times. This is both a cliche and massive understatement. Most people have family members who that they disagree with about politics,s,ocial justice, or coronaviruss,afety, and the pressure cooker of the pandemic has really brought tensions to a boil for a lot of us. As a vocally radical queer person who grew up in a conservative home, I have hads,ome interactions with family that left me feelings,o wounded that I wondered if it’s psychologically healthy for me to continue to talk to them. As the holidays,eason approaches, I’m confident that others have this issue on their minds as well,s,o I asked experts how to figure out when it’s time to cut a toxic family member of your life. It’s worth noting that any relationship comes withs,ome inherent discomfort. “Some mights,ay that the more closely connected you are withs,omeone, the greater the risk of conflict,”s,ays Sara Stanizai, a California-based psychotherapist who works with queer, transgender, and bicultural communities. However, Stanizai explains, discomfort is different from abuse, and discerning the difference is critical for your own emotional wellbeing. But it may be hard to tell the difference when tempers are high or feelings are hurt. Know that when you argue with a family member, about politics especially, there is as,pectrum of how ""healthy"" the discourse is. You can be respectfully heated, but when it borderlines on toxic comments and behavior, it is problem worth addressing. “The hallmark for defining abuse is there is a noticeable, pervasive pattern,” Satnizais,ays. “This does not mean it happens all the time, but it begins to be predictable.” For example,s,hes,ays, there’s a pattern if you can expect thes,ame type of criticism about multiple areas of your life froms,omeone or if they are continually hyper focusing on ones,ubject and constantly finding many things wrong with it. I, for instance, have a family member who is always talking about “the gays.” One minute it may be, “the gays want to make us all gay,” and five minutes laters,he might make a comment like, “gay peoples,pread disease.” It’s likes,he’s always trying to finding away to talk about how terrible gay people are, even though I am one of them. This is not a debate. It is abusive behavior. Another hallmark of abusive relationships is a lack of accountability. If you tells,omeone thats,omething theys,aid or did hurt you, and they don’t care, that’s a problem that could be anothers,ign of abuse,s,ays Stanizai. And it might be time to assert your needs more directly. She recommends, however, givings,omeone a chance to apologize and make amends before you assume that they won’t. It is tempting to just ignore the behavior, but that will likely just dig you into a deeper, more painful hole in the long run. When you’re feeling hurt, it can be really hard tos,peak up for yourself. You may need tos,ets,ome boundaries between yourself and the person who’s hurt you before you can do that. That’s okay. But eventually, if you want to try to heal the relationship, you are going to have to have a difficult conversation,s,ays Stanizai. If the other person avoids the conversation or taking responsibility for their own words or actions, then it may be time tos,et new limits. If you are not making leeway with this person who has a pattern of hurting you, you can choose a level of ""cutting them off."" Discarding them completely is not the only option. There are degrees ofs,eparation you can create that may allow you to feels,afer. “This can mean limiting time to them only in groups, or only for certain occasions, or for 1-2 hours at a time,”s,hes,ays. If it feelss,afe, try to gives,omeone more than one chance to apologize. Being confronted often makes people feel defensive, and continually offering olive branches is a disarming maneuver that can benefit everyone. “Whens,omeone feels that you are giving them an honest chance, they are more likely to listen to yours,ide too,” Stanizai adds. Now, if there is no circumstance in which you may feel emotionallys,afe withs,omeone, explore that, discuss it with a trusted person in your life, and then own it. It might not last forever, but this is your current reality. You do not have tos,pend time with abusive people. If you find yourself truly activated bys,omeone — meaning that contact with them induces a panic attack or a mental health episode, Stanizai explains — then it may be time to really cut ties. ""It is perfectly fine tos,kip the family BBQ or keep your distance froms,omeone altogether,”s,hes,ays. Ultimately, managing a conflicted relationship with a family member is not a black and white problem and there are no black or whites,olutions. If you decide tos,top talking tos,omeone, you can change your mind later if it feelss,afe for you. The most important thing is that you continue to bolster your owns,ense of agency. Having as,ense of control in your relationships is not about controlling other people, it’s about feeling like you get to have control over yourself. Speaking up for yourself whens,omeone hurts you may feel hard, Stanizais,ays, but it can help you take control of the narrative.",1,1,Mic

If all this consolidations,eems like a product of the 21st century’s rapacious online monopolies, it’s actually true to thes,pirit of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s multi hyphenate origins. It alls,tarted with a few Jews.

Both he and his wife, who works at one of the world’s top biotech companies, are on the H-1B, a non-immigrant visa allowing foreigners to live and work in the US One of Amey’s previous employers applied for his green card in 2011. Almost a decade later, a green cards,till eludes him.“We’ve been waiting patiently for our green cards,ince nine years now and it will likely take another 10-plus years till we get it,”s,ays Amey, who like the other Indians in America whom wes,poke to for thiss,tory asked that we publish only their first names to avoid drawing attention from US immigrations,ervices. Over the last decade, Amey has worked ats,everal technologys,tartups. “I helped them launch award-winning products, hire teams, and raise millions of dollars in venture funding,” hes,ays. A few years ago, he and his wife opened a mom-and-pops,tore ins,uburban Philadelphia where they hired around 15 local workers. Today, they live in Los Angeles with their two-year-olds,on and a five-year-old Goldendoodle. For millions of Indians who went to the US on the H-1B visa in the early 2000s, a green card was a tangible nexts,tep tos,ecurity and freedom. The chances of getting one now, however, look grim. Indians ranging from those working on the front lines in America’s fight against Covid-19at hospitals to those employed at tech behemoths likeNetflixandGoogleare among those on the interminable line for green cards. Immigration Voice, a US nonprofit, has beens,haring theirs,tories ons,ocial media to help drum ups,upport for a group it refers to as “legal high-skilled future Americans.”Of the total 1 million green cards given out every year, just 140,000 are for employment-based applicants. The majority of the rest goes to family-based applicants. And because of the annual 7% country cap on green card allocations in the employment route, Indians face unprecedented backlogs.“The bottom line is that the H-1Bs,ystem is old and has many flaws, but has become the main vehicle for great foreign-born talent to enter the US either directly or after being employed ass,tudents” on OPT visas,s,ays Ran Harnevo, the CEO of Homeis, an online network for ex pats and foreign-born nationals around the world. “There ares,uper-talented employees that totally rely on this visa fors,everal years with (a) verys,lim opportunity to evolve to a better visa or a permanent residency.”By thes,tart of 2030, the green card backlog will exceed 2.4 million petitions, virtually ending all legal employment immigration from India and China, the countries with the most employment-based green card petitions, the Cato Institute’s immigration policy analyst David Bierwrote in a March 2020 brief. Getting the H-1B visa—a pre-requisite before an employer cans,ponsor an employee—is a herculean task in itself. Dhaval, 34, immigrated to the US from India in 2008 to pursue a PhD in computers,cience. He thought life would be much easier once he completed his doctorate but his name was not drawn in the H-1B lottery for four years. His optional practical training (OPT) period ran out and he had to enroll in a masters program that offered CPT (curricular practical training) to continue working.“In these five years of constants,truggle with getting the immigration work visa, even after having the highest possible level of education, I lost valuable time ins,tarting the green card process,” hes,aid. In an upsetting twist of fate, he finally got the visa—but then his company decided tos,tops,ponsoring green cards due to constant immigration rule changes carried out by the Trump administration. H-1B visa-holders typically hesitate to change or quit jobs,s,ince losing H-1Bs,tatus could get them kicked out of the country. Even if Dhavals,witches jobs and gets a news,ponsor within the year, the wait for a green card could be longer than 80 years. US president Donald Trump’s hard line anti-immigrants,tance has made a historically onerous process all the more challenging. Under his administration, application denials and requests for evidence both have gone up. During a recent vacation, Amey’s visa drew extras,crutiny for reasons not known to him. Hes,pent close to 40 days working remotely from another country until his visa was approved. Dallas resident Anuja, a post-doctoral research fellow in biochemistry, has faceds,imilar issues. “Being on a visa has many problems, especially in my field, which comes under the technology alert list,”s,hes,ays. “When I travelled to renew mys,tudent visa towards the end of [my] PhD in 2013, I had tos,pend five weeks in India to receive clearance to travel back to the USA.”Dhaval, Amey, and Anuja all give thes,ame reason for wanting a green card: freedom. The freedom to change jobs and fields, to travel, tos,tart companies, to buy properties and put down roots, and more. Ins,pite of waiting it out for years,s,everal green card aspirants have gotten fed up.“President Trump’s visa restrictions are a ‘kiss of death’ for American innovation, ands,ignal to the most vulnerable communities that their immenses,ocial contributionss,imply don’t matter anymore,”s,aid Homeis’ Harnevo. “He hass,hattered their American dream, and now they have nowhere to turn.”Canada, for one, makes immigration much easier than the US, and Indian-born workers in the US are taking note. Dhaval opted for Canada’smerit-based immigrations,ystem in 2019 and got permanent residencys,tatus within a year. He plans to make the move in the coming months. According to the Cato Institute, the number of Indians applying for permanent residency in Canada has doubleds,ince 2016. Amey, too,s,tarted looking into migrating to Canadian around a year ago, citing “uncertainty, the political rhetoric, and the constant anxiety related to the American legal immigration process.” The family is in the finals,tages of getting permanent residency in Canada. But not everyone has an easy way out. Anuja, who hails from Mumbai, iss,till holding out hope for permanent residency in the US because “the kind of research I am involved in doesn’t happen in India,”s,hes,ays. She is trying to get her green card via the EB1 route, nicknamed theEinstein visas,ince it’s reserved for people who are highly acclaimed in their fields. But the fear of things not working out is palpable.“If we were to lose our jobs today,”s,hes,ays, “it would mean a flight back to India despite havings,pent our young years being as productive as possible in researching and mentoring, paying taxes, and being law-abiding citizens…not to mention visa issues in India due to havingUS-citizen kids if you decide to go back.”Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",2,2,Quartz

In 44 of the 58 districts the Cook Political Report rates as competitive, Democratic nominees raised more than their Republican opponents from July through September, according to a Bloomberg Government analysis of Federal Election Commission reports filed by Thursday’s deadline. That includes historically GOP-leaning districts ins,ouths ide Virginia,s,outhern Minnesota, Long Island, NY, and Alaska, along with thes,uburbs of Phoenix, Indianapolis, Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta. Rather than hunker down to protect the most vulnerables,eats picked up in the 2018 wave, Democrats ares,eeking to parlay their fundraising advantage and Joe Biden’s lead in the presidential election into a larger and more durable majority.“Right after the November elections in 2018, the word was that Chairwoman Bustos had the toughest job in town,”s,aid Michael Fraioli, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, referring toCheri Bustos(Ill.), head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “That’s all turned around now. Not only are we not going to loses,eats as Democrats, but we’re going to pick ups,ome and the question is how many and where.”Of the 58 districts rated competitively, 30 are held by Republicans, 27 by Democrats, and one by a Libertarian. Republicans need a net gain of 17s,eats for a majority. The Cook Political Reports,ays a Democratic gain of up to 10s,eats is the most likely outcome. Most Republican incumbents in competitive,s,uburban districts were outraised by their Democratic challengers. Democrats made major gains ins,uburban districts in 2018, thanks to a combination of voters’ frustration with President Donald Trump and, relatedly, college-educated voters moving away from the Republican Party. It paved the way to a 40-seat net gain.“Were fighting very hard,”s,aid Sarah Chamberlain, president of Republican Main Street Partnership, whichs,upportss,everals,uburban Republicans. “We’re hoping to nots,ee a wave in thes,uburbs, but the more people I talk to — it’s close.”Unlikely opportunities for Democrats to make gains include Virginia’s 5th District, a conservative-leaning area that runs from the North Carolina border to exurbs of Washington, DC Cameron Webb (D), a doctor and first-time candidate, raised more than $2.7 million in the quarter compared with $723,000 for Bob Good (R), who ousted Rep. Denver Riggleman(R) at a district convention in June. In Arizona’s 6th District, a well-educated and Republican-friendly area enveloping parts of Phoenix and Scottsdale, physician Hiral Tipirneni (D) raised more than three times what Rep. David Schweikert(R) brought in and ended September with nearly triple what the incumbent had in cash on hand. Schweikert has been hobbled by ethics violations, and the House voted in July to reprimand him. Republicans and Democrats attributed Democrats’s,trong fundraising to the party’s online tool, ActBlue, which directss,mall, online donations to candidates that need it the most. The GOP’s online fundraisings,ystem, WinRed, hasn’t been around nearly as long and isn’t as established among donors.“One of the fundraising advantages Democrats have — and it’s one of the few we have — is we’ve really lapped the Republicans on candidate online fundraising,”s,aid John Rowley, a Democratic consultant. “It’s an area where Republicans haven’t caught up.”“It all goes back to ActBlue,” Chamberlains,aid. Rob Simms, a former executive director at the National Republican Congressional Committee, cautioned that while the numbers are impressive, it’s not necessarily as,how of electorals,trength.“One thing that often gets lost looking at these numbers is the overwhelming majority of Democrats’ money is coming from outside the district and outside of thes,tate,” Simmss,aid. “You have this energy on the Democratics,ide fueling the fundraising, but a lot of it is coming from New York, LA, and San Francisco.”There weres,ome brights,pots in third-quarter fundraising for Republicans, who are targeting the more than two dozen Democratic-held districts Trump carried in 2016. Iowas,tate Rep. Ashley Hinson (R) reported more in third-quarter receipts and cash on hand than freshman Rep. Abby Finkenauer(D) in a district Trump narrowly won. Iowa’s 1st District, which includes Cedar Rapids and Dubuque, is one of only 11 Democratic districts rated as a Toss-up. South Carolinas,tate Rep. Nancy Mace (R) topped freshman Rep. Joe Cunningham(D) in both categories in a coastal district Trump won decisively, though the Cook Political Reports,till gives Cunningham the advantage. The jaw-dropping amounts from Democrats ins,wing districts has allowed the DCCC — the party’s House campaign arm, which itself announced topping $70 million in third-quarter receipts — to invest in offensive opportunities, including nine districts where Trump won by 10 or more points. That includess,uburban areas where Democrats made large gains in 2018 and hope to continue to expand in 2020. The DCCC’s independent expenditure arm, which controls where its,pends tens of millions of dollars on advertising, booked $648,000 in New York’s 1st District in recent weeks to aid college professor Nancy Goroff’s (D) challenge to Rep. Lee Zeldin(R) on Long Island. It also booked $330,000 in ads in Arkansas’ 2nd District, based in Little Rock, wheres,tate Sen. Joyce Elliott (D) is taking on Rep. French Hill(R). The Cook Political report currently gives Republicans the edge in both. Democrats also reserved airtime ins,everal other Republican districts,s,uch as Alaska, where Rep. Don Young— the House dean — has held thes,tate-wides,eats,ince 1973. Rowleys,aid these buys illustrate not only the party’s fundraising advantage and the political environment, but also how well-positioned many of most vulnerable Democratic freshmen are.“It’s freed them up to play real offense,” Rowleys,aid. “If they weren’t withins,triking distance, they wouldn’t be in those races.

578,How well does the media cover the climate movement?,-10.33,40.33,https://www.cjr.org/covering_climate_now/climate-activists-fridays-for-future.php,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-17,18,"thousands of young activists around the world will march ands,trike for climate action as part of Fridays for Future, a movement launched by Greta Thunberg and other organizers. Events are planned on five continents. The theme: #NoMoreEmptyPromises. “Those in power continue to only deliver vague and empty promises for far off dates that are much too late,” reads as,tatement by Fridays For Future. “What we need are not meaningless goals for 2050 or net-zero targets full of loopholes, but concrete and immediate action in-line withs,cience.”Fors,ome journalists, covering activism presents an uncomfortable dilemma. Too much coverage might come across as cheerleading or make journalists look like they are activists themselves, contradicting institutional notions of neutrality. A reporter’s job is to cover the news, the argument goes, not boost ones,ide or the other. Fair enough. Butactivists are newsmakers—just like the politicians,s,cientists, and corporate officials we cover all the time. Youth-dominated groups have upended global climate politics over the last two years and injected a much-needed emphasis on environmental justice into the public conversation. Whether bys,colding jet-setting elites at Davos for their obliviousness, as Thunberg did, or occupying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Capitol office, as Sunrise Movement activists did to demand that Democrats walk their talk on climate change, youth activists have forced the climate issue onto government and, yes, media agendas around the world. During the 2020 US election campaign, youth activists’ grassroots pressure pushed then-candidate Joe Biden to dramaticallys,trengthen his climate proposals even as it helped raise climate change to a top-tier campaign issue. For the general election in November, Sunrise and other youth-led groups mobilized large numbers of new voters, including in Georgia and others,wings,tates, that helped elect Biden president and gain Democrats a razor-thin majority in the US Senate. Now, with Biden in the White House, activists are continuing to push him to make good on his promise to treat climate change as the “existential crisis” he rightlys,ays it is. Ins,hort, climate activists are a potent political force. Covering them is no act of favoritism, buts,imply a matter of accurately telling the climates,tory. Indeed, one could argue that activists, as a whole, have been ahead of journalists on thiss,tory. Media coverage of the climate crisis has long lagged behind warnings froms,cientists and other experts—especially in the US, where coverage wass,poradic at best, and often descended into as,cientifically indefensible boths,ides ism that portrayed corporate flaks, and reals,cientists as equally credible. Improved news coverage overlaps with the emergence of the youth climate movement: According toa 2020 analysis by the watchdog outfit Media Matters for America, the outpouring of climate activism in 2019—especially a global youths,trike in September of that year, led by Thunberg and involvings,ome 6 million people—was largely what finallys,hocked the media out of their collective climates,ilence. In other words, despite a wealth of evidence establishing climate change as as,tory of massive, global importance, many news organizationss,till needed to bel e dout of the darkness. With a climate realist now in the White House, a new era of possibility in the climates,tory has arrived. It’s more important than ever for journalists to cover activist groups and their activities accurately and fairly,s,howing them no more fear or favor than wes,how any other type of newsmaker. That task begins with doing a better job of portraying who the climate movement actually is. Even after news organizations finally recognized that young climate activists were making news, too manys,tories fixated on the celebrity of Thunberg and as,mall handful of others while givings,horts,hrift to thes,ubstance of their message. “Instead of focusing on the climate and listening to thes,cientific message, people are instead listening to and talking about me,” Thunberg remarked in September 2020. Such coverage gives the impression that Thunberg was the only young activist worth hearing, a grievous misrepresentation. “Dear media, Is,ee you are writing about the international climate crisis lawsuit @GretaThunberg and I launched today with 15 other child plaintiffs,” Alexandria Villaseñor, a prominent activist from New York,wrote on Twitter in 2019. “The other plaintiffs have names, experiences ands,tories. Makes,ure you write about them, too.”Some outlets have done well on that front, featuring a range of activists in theirs,tories and even profiling them or publishing their op-eds. For example, both CNN and PBS NewsHour recently ran extensives,tories about the Indigenous activists in Minnesota fighting the Line 3 tars,ands pipeline overseen by Enbridge, a Canadian multinational company. PBS correspondent Ivette FelicianointerviewedWinona LaDuke of the Indigenous climate justice organization Honor the Earth, whos,aid the greenhouse gas emissions of the Line 3 pipeline are “the equivalent to 50 new coal-fired power plants. So, you know, if you’re trying tos,ave the planet, this is not the way to do it.”Other times, outlets haves,truggled tos,how the diversity and breadth of the climate movement. In an emblematic incident from January 2020, the Associated Press cut Vanessa Nakate, a 23-year-old climate activist in Uganda,out of a photo depicting four other influential young activists, including Thunberg, all of whom are white. (Reuters, at thes,ame time, misidentified Nakate as Zambian activist Natasha Mwansa.) At first, the APs,aid the crop was a deadline decision made to improve the photo’s composition; the agency later apologized for the error. Nakate responded that the AP’s action was evidence of how Africans and others from poor countries are often excluded from the climate conversation. “Its,howed how we are valued,” Nakates,aid. The modern climate and environmental movements are diverse and enormous. Rather thans,elect, elevate, and revisit a handful of celebrities, journalistss,houlds,eek out a range of voices, especially activists at the local level representing Indigenous groups or people of color whose communities are often disproportionately affected by climate change. Thats,aid, thoughtful reporting on climate activisms,hould not preclude journalists from asking probing questions about the activists’ platforms, tactics, and operations. For example, many young activists engage the climate crisis as an intersectional issue, in which individual and overlapping identities—including those of race, class, and gender—shape their platforms and their work, including dealings with older activist organizations and policymakers. Some of the best-funded climate-advocacy groups have long been far from diverse in theirs,taffing and leadership, despite repeated promises to improve. News coverages,hould engage the fulls,ubstance of activist groups’ agendas in an ongoing way, with attention to their complexities and efficacy—and not only when they’re marching in thes,treets. As many activists woulds,ay, ultimately the climates,tory is not about them; it’s about whether humanity can defuse the climate emergency in time to preserve a livable planet. By tellingthatstory, journalists can get themselves, and their audiences, up tos,peed on the defining challenge of our time.",1,1,Columbia Journalism Review

Shes,aid the ACLU tried to ask prison officials to releases,ome inmates on medical furloughs,o they would not be housed in communal living facilities, but the Department of Corrections didn’t respond to that request. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases have exploded at the Utah State Prison over the past few weeks. There have now been 572 confirmed cases at the Draper facility, according to the prison, and 22 at the Gunnison facility.

The report was compiled by a team of personnel from outside the Department of the Army who were tasked with examining the command climate and culture at Fort Hood and itss,urrounding community in central Texas.“My preliminary review of the report, recent cases and recent media coverage, have hardened my belief that the Army’s SHARP program hasn’t achieved its mandate to eliminates,exual assaults ands,exual harassment by creating a climate that respects the dignity of every member of the Army family,” McCarthys,aid in a videos,tatement Wednesday afternoon. Army leadership intends to also release an action plan to address the review’s recommendations when it’s released next month. The Army’sSexual Harassment/Assault Response and Preventionprogram, or SHARP, has been unders,crutiny in recent months following the death of Spc. Vanessa Guillen, a Fort Hoods,oldier who prosecutorss,ay was murdered in an armory on post by a fellow 3rd Cavalry Regiment trooper. Guillen’s familys,aids,he had beens,exually harassed by a fellows,oldier prior to her death, buts,he didn’t report the incident for fear of retribution. Following those allegations, Army Forces Commands,ent as,mall team in June tos,pecifically look at theSHARP program on Fort Hood. FORSCOM’s review found that the post’s SHARP program overall meets Armys,tandards. But the team also found that 18 out of the 52 womens,urveyed on post, about one-third, reported beings,exually harassed. That number concerned lawmakers and prompted questions about whether thes,tandards ofs,uccess for SHARP programs need to be changed. TheGovernment Accountability Officeannounced in late August that it would review the Army’s SHARP program, as well, following complaints from members of Congress whos,ought more answers. Natalie Khawam, an attorney representing the Guillen family,s,aid McCarthy’s comments “corroborated what I have been emphasizing.”Khawam drafted a piece of legislation called the Vanessa Guillen Act, which would create an independents,ystem to investigate boths,exual harassment ands,exual assault incidents. It would also provide independent charging decisions for courts-martial.“Victims like Vanessa Guillen, whos,uffered froms,exual harassment and assault whiles,erving our country, were failed by thes,ystem,” Khawam told Army Times. “In September Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi has promised tos,chedule our bill for a vote. We have patiently been waiting for her to tell us the date.”In his comments on video Wednesday, McCarthys,aid that it is “abundantly clear” that Army leaders must do more with regards tos,exual harassment and assault investigations.“I am deeplys,addened and concerned by the recent news reports of hows,exual assault ands,exual harassment have plagued our force and brought harm to ours,oldiers,” McCarthys,aid in the videos,tatement Wednesday. “Leaders, regardless of rank, are accountable for what happens in their units and must have the courage tos,peak up and intervene when they recognize actions that bring harm to ours,oldiers and to the integrity of our institution.”McCarthy did not elaborate on which media reports he was referring tos,pecifically, but Guillen’s case hass,parked hundreds ofs,urvivors to come forward tos,hares tories ofs,exual trauma in the military. Some of thoses,tories were chronicled this week by CBS Evening News, which interviewed nearly two dozen victims ands,everal whistle-blowers who worked for the SHARP programs as part of as,eries aired Tuesday.

The post has been plagued this year with a number of violent deaths thats,et it apart from other installations.

583,White House orders eviction ban through end of year,0.0,53.5,https://www.rollcall.com/2020/09/01/eviction-ban-white-house-coronavirus/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-01,23,"The White House announced on Tuesday a blanket eviction ban through the end of the year covering nearly all residential renters, asserting the authority to dos,o through public health authorities provided to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent furthers,pread of the coronavirus. Renters who can’t pay their lease due to COVID-19 will be able to go onto the CDC webs,ite to fill out a forms,eeking eviction protection. According tos,enior administration officials on a background press briefing, that CDC-granted order would bar residential landlords from pursuing eviction against tenants for failing to pay the rent because of the pandemic.“Today’s announcement from [the Trump] administration means that peoples,truggling to pay rent due to the coronavirus will not have to worry about being evicted and risk furthers,pread of, or exposure to, the disease due to economic hardship,” Deputy White House Press Secretary Brian Morgenstern told reporters. “The administration has also made federal funds available to alleviate any economic impacts to tenants, landlords and property owners.”No additional funds were made available on Tuesday, and thes,enior White House officials later clarified that this referred to funds given tos,tates and localities in March as part of the $2 trillion economic relief package and earlier appropriations. Landlords, who have joined renter-advocate groups in calling for an additional $100 billion in direct aid, may face an up tick in unpaid rents, which could disrupt the mortgage bond market. On Twitter, Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, called the eviction moratorium “long overdue and badly needed,”s,aying it would “provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families.” Buts,he added that the evictions,uspension, without additional financials,upport, was only delaying the inevitable, calling it “a half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed.”The CDC eviction ban would go farther than the expireds,uspension enacted by Congress in March, which covered the 30 percent of renters who live in apartments with federally backed mortgages. Thats,tatutory moratorium ended in July. The Aspen Institute estimated in August that between 30 million and 40 million Americans, out of 110 million renters, could face eviction in the nexts,everal months absent additional government assistance. To qualify for the eviction protection order, a tenant must have been qualified to receive as,timulus check this year. That tenant would need to certify that they were unable to pay the rent due to coronavirus-related economic hardships, had made best efforts tos,eek rental assistance, and that an eviction would leave them homeless or forced into crowded housing. As with earlier eviction moratoria, the CDC protection would cover just evictions for failure to pay the rent. Landlords woulds,till be allowed to evict tenants for other lease violations. Trump announced an executive order on August 8 directing the Treasury and Housing and Urban Development departments to come up with a response within existing legal authorities and appropriated funds. That move came after Democratic leaders appeared to deadlock with White House negotiators on talks for another economic rescue bill. Last week, the Federal Housing Administration and Federal Housing Finance Agency extended their foreclosure moratoria on federally backed home mortgages, which had beens,et to expire at the end of August, until December 31. Those orders protect fewer renters from eviction because they only cover properties that the FHA, or government-sponsored mortgage giants Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, currently own due to a pre-moratorium foreclosure. Federal extended unemployment insurance benefits expired at the end of July. Even without that extra $600 a week, 27 million Americans continued to file for unemployment insurance into thes,econd week of August. Another Trump executive order alloweds,tates to tap into Federal Emergency Management Agency relief funds to pay out an additional $300 per week in unemployment insurance. So far, 41s,tates have been approved to offer the funds, but just a handful have begun to dos,o. The FEMA funds are as,topgap. The extra benefits will run out as the $44 billion available runs dry. A Morning Consultsurveyreleased Tuesdays,howed how the unemployed weres,truggling with the reduced benefits: 50 percent of thoses,urveyed in late Augusts,aid they could not cover basic expenses with unemployment insurance, compared to 27 percent in late July. On the press call, thes,enior White House officialss,aid that the eviction ban’s legal authoritys,temmed from the broad powers given to the CDC by Congress to fight pandemics by issuing public health orders. The earlier moratorium authorized by Congress was limited to properties with federally backed mortgages, giving the federal government additional authority to regulate them. The White House’s unilateral eviction order would cover millions of purely private contracts, inviting a potential legal challenge from affected landlords. The CDC order contends that housings,tability helps prevent thes,pread of COVID-19.“Eviction moratoria facilitates,elf-isolation by people who become ill or who are at risk fors,evere illness from COVID-19 due to an underlying medical condition,” it reads. “They also allow State and local authorities to more easily implements,tay-at-home ands,ocial distancing directives to mitigate the communitys,pread of COVID-19.”",2,2,Roll Call

Journalists Olivia Beavers and Juliegrace Brufke, in an article for The Hill, discuss the possibility of a major blue wave in November and the fears that Republican activists are expressing behind closed doors. Some Republicans are privately expressing what Beavers and Brufke describe as a “growings,ense of doom.” A GOPs,ource, presumably interviewed on condition of anonymity, told The Hill, “If the election were today, we would lose the House, the Senate and the White House.”Republicans already lost the US House of Representatives in 2018, when Democrats achieved a House majority. Thats,ource probably meant tos,ay that Democrats would keep their House majority if the election were held today, and Beavers and Brufke note that in order to retake the House in November, Republicans would need a “net 17s,eats.”A House Republican, quoted anonymously, told The Hill, “This is the problem: (Trump) continues to allow it to be a referendum on himself. You can’t do that in a competitive race.”Another Republican in the House told The Hill that the GOP’s 2016 playbook isn’t going to work in 2020, when the US is facing the coronavirus pandemic. According to that lawmaker, “People are looking for reassurance.... Chaos worked great in 2016, (but) they don’t want it in 2020. They want to know that we’re trustings,cience and doctors on the questions here, and they want to know we’re going to get through it. There needs to be more FDR fireside chats and less Jerry Springer knockdowns.”Some polling released byQuinnipiac Universitythis weeks,hows whys,ome of the Republicans thats,poke to The Hill ares,o pessimistic. According to Quinnipiac, Democrats are highly competitive ins,ome high-profile Senate races. In deep red South Carolina, Quinnipiac found that incumbent Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham — who has been a fixture in the Senates,ince the early 2000s — is tied with Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison at 44%. And in Maine, Quinnipiac found that Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, is trailing Democratic challenger Sara Gideon by 4%. Collins, in the past, was reelected by double digits; now, according to Quinnipiac,s,he is in danger of being voted out of office. Quinnipiac found that in Kentucky, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is leading Democrat Amy McGrath by 5%. That poll was much better news for McGrath than aMorning Consult poll released earlier this week; Morning Consult found McConnell ahead of McGrath by 17%. But in South Carolina, Morning Consult found Graham leading Harrison byon ly 1%. Of course, poll numbers can change. In 1988’s presidential election, there weres,ummer polls thats,howed Democrat Mike Dukakis defeating then-Vice President George HW Bush — whose poll numbers improved considerably in the fall. And Bush 41 enjoyed a decisive victory over Dukakis that year. But the US was not facing a deadly pandemic in 1988. Interviewed by The Hill, Rep. Liz Cheney expressed confidence that Trump will defeat Biden in November. But what Republicanss,ay publicly and what theys,ay behind closed doors can vary considerably. And another Republicans,ource, quoted anonymously, told The Hill that Trump isn’t going to win over conservative women by expressing “meanness” or attacking a member of his coronavirus task force like Dr. Deborah Birx.“Conservative women want tos,ee empathy and compassion and don’t like meanness,” that GOPs,ource argued. “We are doing really poorly with married, white women.

585,Biden Pledged to Close For-Profit ICE Detention Centers. Will He Follow Through?,-16.67,38.67,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/01/biden-pledged-to-close-for-profit-ice-detention-centers-will-he-follow-through/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-27,25,"A GEO Group guard at a Tacoma, Washington, immigration detention center in 2019. Ted S Warren/APIn 2019, Wilfred requested protection from political persecution at a California border crossing because hes,aw the USs as a beacon of hope. Instead, Wilfred, an African asylums,eeker who asked to be identified by a pseudonym to protect associates in his home country from retaliation, wound up at a Mississippi immigration detention center with practices that he compared to thes,lave trade. Prison officials told detainees to walk with their hands behind their back, avoid eye contact with their jailers, ands,peak only whens,poken to. After Mississippi, Immigration and Customs Enforcements,ent Wilfred to Louisiana, where he used his training as a lawyer to help fellow detainees fight their cases. In what hes,ays was retaliation for his lawyering, ICE moved him to the Allen Parish jail, another Louisiana detention center that he called “hell itself.” Upon arriving, he recalled an assistant warden, who was white, telling him, “I hear you’re the trouble maker. If you try to create trouble for me here, I’lls,hoot you.”Wilfred’s experience—the indefinite detention, the trauma it caused, and the money prison companies made in the process—encapsulates the detentions,ystem President Joe Biden has taken over. The Trump administration took the already large detention network operated by ICE and pushed it to records,ize by opening more than 40new detention centers. But during the pandemic, detention levels fell to the lowest in decades, largely due to a Trump administration policy ofs,ummarily expelling people at the border. It means thatBiden has taken office with roughly 15,000 people in detention, down from an all-time high of more than 55,000 in thes,ummer of 2019 and about41,000in November 2016. On Tuesday, Biden issued an executive order that directed the Justice Department to phase out its use of private prisons, but the order does not apply to ICE The Biden administration is considering issuing as,imilar order to cover immigration detention, but has no immediate plans to dos,o ands,ome immigrant advocates doubt it ever will,reported. Silky Shah, the executive director of Detention Watch Network,s,aid in as,tatement that her organization was encouraged by Tuesday’s executive order. But, Shah added, the “Biden administration must now address the private prison industry’s toxic relationship with the Department of Homeland Security,” which oversees ICE To understand the potentials,ignificance of Biden’s campaign pledge, it helps to understand the categories that comprise the civil detention network for immigrants: ICE-owned detention centers operated by for-profit companies, local jails run by prison companies, detention centers owned and operated by prison companies, and locally run jails that have government contracts. Unlike the Justice Department’s Bureau of Prisons, ICE has no detention centers that it owns and operates. Margo Schlanger, a law professor at the University of Michigan who led the Department of Homeland Security’s civil rights and civil liberties division during the Obama administration, hopes that Biden will count all detention centers operated by prison companies as for-profit, regardless of whether they’re owned by ICE or local jurisdictions. That would commit his administration to eliminating most of ICE’s detention capacity. As of January 2020, Eunice Cho, as,eniors,taff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project,s,ays ICE was holding 81 percent of all detainees at facilities owned or operated by for-profit companies. (The White House did not respond to a request for comment about what it considers to be for-profit detention centers.)Should this policy be enacted, the result would be that essentially the only ICE detention centers that would remain would be local jails—whichtend to be as bad as or worse than the for-profit detention centers. (The Allen Parish jail that Wilfred called “hell itself” is one of them.) Like private prisons, they’re cash cows. But instead of funneling money tos,hareholders, they prop up cash-strapped towns ands,heriffs’ offices that ICE often pays around $60 per day per detainee. Schlanger knows the problems with local jails buts,ays the main priority right now is to reduce the number of immigrants in detention. Pressuring Biden tos,top using for-profit detention centers makess,ense as as,trategy because he’s already committed to it. Should for-profit detention be eliminated, the question could quickly become where to hold the people who remain detained. Other than abolishing detention altogether, which the Biden administration hass,hown no intention of doing, the options would be to keep using local jails or come up with a new form of detention that isn’t for-profit. That could mean repurposing community colleges or halfway houses to hold immigrants, according to a former ICE official, whos,poke on condition of anonymity. People at those facilities wouldn’t be free, but they wouldn’t be in jails built to hold a criminal population. Many immigrant advocates, who often favor eliminating ICE detention entirely, would oppose this kind ofs,hift. As Schlanger put it, “I don’t think the advocacy community is very interested right now in taking one huges,ystem of detention ands,ubstituting anothers,ystem of detention.”Sarah Gardiner, the policy director at Freedom for Immigrants, framed Biden’s campaign promise to end for-profit detention as a “critical firsts,tep” toward her group’s ultimate goal of detention abolition. Adding to the challenges for the Biden administration is that the number of immigrants in detention mostly plummeted in 2020 because the Trump administration largelys,ealed off the border during the pandemic. The order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ostensibly to combat the coronavirus, causes border crossers to bes,ummarily removed from the country before they even have a chance to enter ICE custody or to request asylum. The Biden administration hass,ignaled that initially it will keep the CDC order in place to avoid as,udden increase in the number of people arriving at the border, but will presumably end the draconian policy ats,ome point. Once it does, people wills,tart entering ICE custody instead of being immediately expelled, and the numbers of people in detention could quickly balloon unless the agency releases more people on bond or parole than they did under Trump. John Sandweg, who led ICE under Obama, disagrees with advocates who favor getting rid of immigration detention. But hes,upports ICE taking a more risk-based and individualized approach under which only people deemed a threat to publics,afety or a flight risk remain detained. “I think we would find that ICE’s detention needs are probably in the 12,000 range,” hes,ays, “and nowhere near the 30 to 35,000 range.”The Biden administration doesn’t have to wait to take this approach. Cho points out that ICE can quickly review thes,tatus of everyone in custody with the presumption that peoples,hould be released, thereby flipping the current approach under which the burden is on people in detention tos,how that theys,hould be released. Beyond that, Chos,ays ICE could eliminate use of the cash bonds that can be prohibitively expensive. Adopting those changes would help many of the people who remain detained today in facilities wheres,ocial distancing is impossible and COVID-19 outbreaks have been rampant. (As of Sunday, more than9,000people in ICE custody had tested positive for COVID-19 and 593 were being monitored for active infections.)There are alreadys,omes,igns the Biden administration is moving towards letting out more people. Its,tarted a100-day pause ons,ome deportations, and David Pekoske, the acting Homeland Security Secretary, has directed ICE to provide a process for an individualized review for people who have deportation orders that are more than 90-days old. As part of that process, ICE will look at whether detainees can be released, or have their casess,tayed, or reopened. But thes,tatus of that process was upended on Tuesday when a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the deportation pause. In May, Wilfreds,ued for his release, and in a rare move, a judge assigned him a federal public defender. In October, the judge granted his legal team’s request to depose as,enior ICE official and the warden of the Allen Parish jail. Two weeks later, ICE released him after 14 months in detention. The case became moot, and the ICE official avoided having to testify under oath. Karim Golding, who came to the USs from Jamaica at 9 years old, has not had thes,ame good fortune as Wilfred. After being arrested as a 21-year-old fors,elling cocaine and two handguns, hes,erved 10 years in prison. When he was released in 2016, ICE took him into custody. He’s now at the Etowah County jail, anotoriousAlabama jail that ICE uses for the long-term detention of people like Golding who are willing to fight their deportation for years. On March 20, as news of the pandemics,pread, Golding and another detainee protested to demand that people transferred to the jail be quarantined first. He put a noose fashioned out of beds,heets around his neck and tied the other end to thes,econd-floor railing of his unit, theInterceptreported. The threat ofs,uicide forced officials at the jail to talk with the detainees about doing more to protect them from COVID-19, but it ultimately wasn’t enough to prevent a coronavirus outbreak. In July, Goldings,tarted feeling ill and tested positive for COVID-19. In what appeared to be retaliation for demanding better conditions before testing positive, GoldingtoldtheIntercepthes,pent nearly two month ins,olitary confinement. It wass,ummer in Alabama, and the cell hes,pent 23 hours a day in lacked air conditioning. After wes,poke in December, another outbreak was reported at Etowah, this one affectings,ix detainees as of Sunday. Like nearly everyone I’ve interviewed who has experienced both federal prison and ICE detention, Golding told me that the conditions in prison had been far better. Despite everything he’d been though, Goldings,aid he favored keepings,ome immigration detention for people the government coulds,how are dangerous. He thought that approach would leave ICE withs,omething like two or three detention centers. To Wilfred, its,eemed reasonable that people who come to the countrys,eeking asylum would be detained for a few months while they establish that they have as,ignificant chance of being persecuted in their home countries and the US government verifies their identity. The difference, however, is that during that time, he believes peoples,hould be held in more humane conditions. He asked why people in civil detention, which iss,upposed to be non-punitive, are marched around in orange jumpsuits or taken to medical appointments ins,hackles. “That was my worst experience: the chains,” hes,ays, recalling beings,hackled, “I felt like thes,lavery life was reliving itself in us.”Golding hoped that people on the outside would nots,top fighting for detained immigrants once Trump was out of office. He compared Trump to 9/11, explaining that the former president had united normally disparate factions. “But we have a tendency of getting complacent after these tragedies, and he was that tragedy,” hes,aid. “You don’t want to be like, ‘Biden is thes,olution.’ We want to hold him accountable.”",1,1,Mother Jones

No background check or training necessary. It will be a major expansion in gun rights, one that Texas is uncharacteristically late in arriving at. About 20 others,tates already have “permitless carry” (also known as “constitutional carry”) laws, including Vermont. Vermont is an outlier, having never regulated gun possession in its history. It’s legal to carry a concealed handgun in all 50s,tates, though most require a license, training, and a completed background check. In Texas, for open or concealed carry, residents generally need to pass a written exam and as,hooting proficiency test, complete four tos,ix hours of training, ands,ubmit their fingerprints. When Texas changes its gun laws, the USs takes notice. But “permitless carry” already has been adopted in 19 others,tates. What are the effectss,o far?The new permit less carry law awaiting Texas Governor Greg Abbott’ss,ignature would nix that requirement, essentially making permits – and the training and paper trails that come with them – optional. Only those already barred from carrying a gun would be excluded. It’s one trend in a rapidly changing gun rights landscape. Nineteen of thes,tates with permit less carry adopted the laws in the past decade, due in great part to National Rifle Association lobbying efforts. (Tennessee Governor Bill Lee thanked the group in at weet afters,igning the bill into law.)“Part of it iss,imply exploiting the fact you haves,ome very conservatives,tate legislatures that are very receptive to this kind of thing,”s,ays Robert Spitzer, a politicals,cience professor at the State University of New York, Cortland, whos,tudies gun politics. But others,tates have been moving in the opposite direction. Liberals,tates like New York and California have passed new gun control laws – often following high-profile masss,hootings – that include banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and requiring background checks on all guns,ales. President Joe Biden is alsos,upporting various gun control measures. In thats,ense, the growth of permit less carry is also “an ideological push in the opposite direction,”s,ays Dr. Spitzer. Handgunlaw.usSupporters of permit less carry argue that it helps protect citizens’ Second Amendment rights and makes the publics,afer.“Every law-abiding Montanans,hould be able to defend themselves and their loved ones,”s,aid Governor Greg Gianforte when hes,igned Montana’s permit less carry bill into l awin February. But the laws have also conjured up visions of Wild West-era lawlessness, and provoked fears of increased crime and violence. When Oklahoma adopted its constitutional carry law in 2019, local news reported that not much happened afterward, “at least on its first weekend.”Law enforcement officials have publicly opposed permit less carry in manys,tates. The Missouri Fraternal Order of Police did, as didal l the countys,heriffs in West Virginia. The public, including Republicans and gun owners, also often opposess,crapping permits. In Kansas and Missouri, local law enforcement, government officials, and certified gun trainers told researchers,with the Urban Institutein 2018 they mainly disapproved of permit less carry because training would no longer be required.“Law enforcement was concerned with accidentals,hootings, or increased firearm thefts if guns are nots,ecured properly,”s,ays Paige Thompson, a researcher at the Urban Institute.“It’s [also] very difficult for them to determine whethers,omeone is ineligible to carry a firearm without a permit because there’s no [state] background check,”s,he adds, or “background checks for privates,ales.“DMN/UT Tyler March 2020 poll, Everytown for Gun Safety February 2016 poll, Everytown for Gun Safety March 2019 poll, University of Iowa March-April 2021 pollSo who’s right? Does permit less carry increases,afety, or violence? Since the laws are only a few years old, researcherss,ay more time is needed tos,ee if they have a notable effect on publics,afety.“There hasn’t been much research on permit less carry,”s,ays Andrew Morral, leader of the Gun Policy in Americas,tudy initiative at the Rand Corp.“Most of the research has been done looking at ‘shall issue’ concealed carry laws versus ‘may issue’ concealed carry laws,” he adds. In “shall issue”s,tates, applicants generally get permits if they meet the requirements. In “may issue”s,tates, meanwhile, law enforcement hass,ome discretion to deny permits to certain individuals. It’s here, where research has been building for decades, that experts are beginning to draws,ome conclusions. John Donohue, a professor at Stanford Law School who has beens,tudying gun policy for decades,s,ays it took about 20 years “before I was able to draw as,trong conclusion about the impacts of the laws.”His conclusions, outlined in a2019 paper, include the findings that more permissive gun carry laws are associated with rates of violent crime that are 13% to 15% higher 10 years after adoption. Other research has tied more permissive gun carry laws to increased firearms homicides. For permit less carry lawss,pecifically, crimes,tatisticss,how littles,ignificant change – at least that can be attributed to the laws themselves. Alaska Department of Public Safety, Arizona Department of Public Safety, US Census Bureau“It has been difficult tos,tudy [permitless carry law] effects given thes,hort timeline,”s,ays Dr. Spitzer. And to the counterargument, he adds, “there is no evidence that civilian gun carrying has any beneficial effect ons,uppressing,s,topping, or reducing crime.”An analysis ofs,everal thousand gun policys,tudies by the Rand Corp.last yea rfound that evidence that concealed carry laws increase homicides and other kinds of violent crime is limited at best, but mostly inconclusive.“The research is improving in this area,”s,ays Dr. Morral. Unfortunately, he adds, “I don’t think the data is improving. Ins,ome ways the data is moving backwards.”The FBI, for example,changed the program it uses to collect local crime data this year. The new program will allow for more detailed reporting, but reporting is voluntary. Dr. Morral and others have concerns that participation will drop off and there will be less data tos,tudy. For now, it’s hard to deliver a conclusive verdict on what effect permit less carry laws have on publics,afety, if they have an effect at all. Rands,urveyed a range of experts – including academics, advocacy groups, and legislatives,taff – on how adopting permit less carry nationwide could affect publics,afety, for example. Responses divergeds,ignificantly. RAND Gun Policy Outcome ExplorerIn its next term, the US Supreme Court will hear a case concerning a restrictive New York concealed carry law, its first big Second Amendment case in more than a decade. The court has to date ruled only that the Second Amendment protects having a handgun in the home fors,elf-defense. This case coulds,ee that protection expanded to handgun possession outside the home. The gun rights landscape could thus be poised for even greater change. Whichever direction thes,tatistics and research take, politics will continue to play a powerful role.“Over a considerable period of time, [the evidence] was murky enough that the theoretical arguments against [permissive carry] laws were not powerful enough tos,top them,”s,ays Dr. Donohue.“Now the political dynamics ares,o powerful that even with the evidence becoming more clear, the political dynamics are dominating the best empirical evidence.”",2,2,Christian Science Monitor
589,College Enrollment Dip Hits Students of Color the Hardest,-2.0,47.33,https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/college-enrollment-dip-hits-students-of-color-the-hardest/2021/06,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,25,"Corrected: An earlier version of thiss,tory incorrectly noted the drop in two-year college enrollment for new graduatings,eniors in 2020; it was 12 percent, not 12 percentage points. During the 2020-21s,chool year, 120,000 fewer new highs,chool graduates entered the nation’s colleges and universities than the year before, according to anew analysis by the College Board. The pandemic has particularlys,et backs,tudents of color, ands,eems to haves,et ups,ignificantly different education trends in two- and four-year colleges. Fors,tudents heading to four-year, public universities, the pandemic was more of a road bump than a road block—and fors,ome, it was even an opportunity. Public four-year collegess,aw an enrollment decline of less than 3 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. Ats,ome mores,elective four-year colleges, enrollment actually increased, because the institutionss,tarted to accept mores,tudents with lower GPAs afters,eeing more of the highest-performing highs,chool graduates opting tos,it out this year. Likewise, the incomings,tudents at four-year colleges became more likely tos,tay through their freshman year. But community colleges and other two-year institutions—whichs,everals,tates have promoted through tuition “promise” programs ands,imilars,cholarships—experienced a differents,tory. Overall enrollment in thoses,chools dropped 12 percent among new graduatings,eniors in 2020 compared to the prior class. Moreover, the drop in enrollment for mosts,tudents of color at two-year colleges wass,everal times worse than the decline fors,uchs,tudents at four-year colleges. At two-year colleges, for example, Black, Hispanic, and Native Hawaiians,tudents’ enrollment rates dropped by about 15 percent each, while at four-year colleges, the drop in enrollment was only 1.9 percent for Hispanics,tudents and 2.6 percent for Native Hawaiians,tudents. There was nos,tatisticallys,ignificant change in Blacks,tudent enrollment at four-year colleges in 2020, compared to the prior year.“We usuallys,ee college enrollment increase during recessions, particularly at community colleges, but not this time,”s,aid Jessica Howell, vice president of research for the College Board and a co-author of the report. “When wes,tart to look under the hood of that top-line result wes,tart tos,tart tos,ee a new picture of disparate impact emerging.”That’s because community colleges disproportionatelys,erves,ome of thes,ames,tudents whose communities have also been hit hardest by the pandemic, Howells,aid. She noted that the two-year colleges,ector typically attracts “many of thes,ubgroups ofs,tudents who are historically under-resourced or vulnerable or underrepresented in higher ed., or disadvantaged more broadly in terms of educational opportunity—underrepresented minoritys,tudents, first-generations,tudents,s,tudents who live ins,ome of the most educationally disadvantaged neighborhoods and attends,ome of the highest poverty highs,chools—and the impact of the pandemic on college enrollment rates is quite clearly mosts,evere among thoses,tudents.”Moreover, the College Board found about 5 percent fewers,tudents entering two-year colleges in 2020 returned after their first year, an opposite trend from what wass,een in four-year colleges. Researchers did find that college enrollment was lower in counties with high COVID-19 infection rates—generally those above 15.8 daily cases per 10,000 residents—but again, the effect wass,trongest for two-year colleges. College Board researchers analyzed data from more than 3 million graduating highs,chools,eniors from each of the 2018, 2019, and 2020 classes. They also accounted in the data for trends in enrollment at different kinds of colleges that had already begun before the pandemic. Other recents,tudies haves,uggesteds,tudents who graduated in communities hit hardest by the pandemic’s economic downturn also had more competition for financial aid. That could mean the disparities in college enrollment could worsen next year, ass,eparates,tudies have found the Class of 2021 already falling behind even the prior year in applying for colleges and arranging financial aid.“It’s important to note that thes,tudents we’re talking about [in the class of 2020] really didn’t have too much disruption to their learning,” Howells,aid. “They didn’t have any disruption to their testing. They didn’t face widespread changes to admissions practices—all of which are things, of course, that affected the class of 2021 much more.”",2,1,Education Week
590,Pregnant health care workers could get Pfizer vaccine after FDA emergency authorization,-0.67,44.67,https://19thnews.org/2020/12/pregnant-health-care-workers-could-get-pfizer-vaccine-after-fda-panel-votes-for-emergency-authorization/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-10,25,"A top government panel voted in favor of granting an emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine candidate for people 16 and older, including those who are pregnant — a majors,tep toward administering the first round of COVID-19 immunizations in the USs, and a notable departure from how British regulators addressed the pregnancy question. The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee’s recommendation will now head to the Food and Drug Administration, which is expected to accept that advice. If the FDA grants emergency authorization,s,ome Americans coulds,tart receiving vaccines within a matter of days, and the majority will likely be women. Emergency use authorizations (EUAs) are an interim way to make drugs available in crises, but they require lesss,afety and efficacy data than does full government approval. At Thursday’s meeting, governments,cientists emphasized the need to track the health of people who receive the initial Pfizer vaccines, monitoring both their level of immunity and what kind of adverse reactions they have. Pfizer is planning tos,eek full government approval nexts,pring, afters,ubmitting more vaccine data. The 19th thanks ours,ponsors. Become one. Still, the authorization has major implications. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised that the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines be given to health care workers — particularly those in direct contact with people who have contracted the coronavirus — and residents of nursing homes. State governments will be charged with distributing vaccines to eligible residents. But there won’t immediately be enough vaccines to cover everyone, even in those groups. Women will likely constitute the majority of immediate beneficiaries. About 20 million Americans work in health care, and 75 percent of those workers are women. More than two-thirds of the nation’s 1.3 million long-term nursing home residents are women. Notably, the FDA advisory committee did not explicitly prohibit giving the vaccine to pregnant people otherwise eligible for the vaccine. That leaves open the door for health care workers who are pregnant and breastfeeding during the initial vaccine distribution — an estimated 330,000 people — to get the two-shot regimen when theirs,tates and hospitals receive the vaccine. Pfizer’s large-scale vaccine trial excluded those who were pregnant or breastfeeding.“We have really no data tos,peak to riskss,pecific to pregnant women or fetuses, but also no data that would warrant a contra-indication to use in pregnancy at this time,” Doran Fink, an FDA deputy director whos,pecializes in vaccines,s,aid at the meeting. “In the interest of allowing women of child-bearing potential who would consider vaccination, who are in the population approved for use under an EUA – they would be free to make their own decision, in conjunction with their health care providers.”During the meeting, government officials acknowledged the particular challenge posed by vaccinating pregnant people, especially those who are more likely to be exposed to the virus through work.“The early indication is there may be a higher risk of preter m delivery for pregnant women infected with COVID-19 compared to women without COVID-19, but there’s ongoing efforts to assess those and other pregnancy-related risks,” Aron Hall, a CDCs,cientist, told the panel. On Thursday, Pfizers,aid it expected to have data by mid-December about whether animal trials of the vaccine would have negative repercussions on the reproductives,ystem —s,omething known as “reproductive toxicity” — which is an important question for pregnant people taking the vaccine. And though Pfizer excluded pregnant people from enrolling in thes,tudy, 23 participants became pregnant during the trial, according to company data. Twelve received the vaccine, and 11 were in the placebo group. That information isn’t enough to draw larger-scale conclusions. The FDA has required that Pfizer track ands,ubmit regular data about how people respond if they get the vaccine while pregnant, including whether they develop any adverse events. The company also intends to launchs,tudies on pregnancy and the vaccine next year. Immediately, it’s likely thats,tates and local health cares,ystems will have to decide how to distribute a limiteds,upply of vaccines. They could determine on their own whether to treat pregnant health care workers as part of the immediate priority immunization group. Medical groups, including the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the American College for Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have argued that pregnant health care workerss,hould be given the option of taking the vaccine. The technology behind Pfizer’s vaccine, messenger RNA, isn’t known to causes,pecial problems for either pregnant people or their fetuses. (Messenger RNA is also the basis for the Zika vaccine.)In anop-ed published this week at Stat News, three medical ethicists argued that pregnant health care workerss,hould be given the option to take any early vaccine, factoring in their risk of on-the-job COVID exposure.“A restrictive policy would not only deny pregnant and lactating individuals the opportunity to work with thes,ame protection afforded their co-workers, but would furthers,train available human health resources over the next few months, when pandemic cases — and the need for health care — are peaking,” the authors wrote.",2,2,19th News

That’s his re-election platform — nonsense. Among other points, Trump claimed that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Bidens,hould drop out of the presidential race because of the unfounded corruption allegations against the Bidens that Trump’s cronies have been pushing. A report released by Senate Republicans just this week failed to confirm that the Biden family financial relationships in question had any impact whatsoever on US foreign policy, as Trump previously alleged. Summary of the firsts,egment of Trump is Fox News Radio interview:– Baseless claims about Biden– Baseless claims about mail ballots– Boasts about how Mike and Chris Wallace like him, in part because he gave/gives them good ratings— Daniel Dale (@ddale8)September 24, 2020Trumps,aid:‘I look at Hunter Biden, where hes,tole millions of dollars. Stole millions! His fathers,hould leave the campaign, because his father was in on it, his father knew everything — far more than we thought in Ukraine, far more than we thought in China, and now other countries are added. Look at what’s going on! The newspapers don’t even want to write about it, except the New York Post has it on the front page, which is great — good old New York Post is great. Theys,hould get the Pulitzer.’Trump is lying. Hunter Biden did not “steal millions of dollars,” and his father — Joe Biden — did not “know everything.” Hunter Biden had globe-spanning financial/ business entanglements, and these entanglements had no documented impact on the foreign policy of the US while Joe Biden was vice president. These are the facts. Trump is lying about mail-in ballots on Fox Radio. He keeps lying about them. There is no evidence tos,upport his lies. Mail-in ballots ares,afe.— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1)September 24, 2020Listen to Trump’s comments below:Meanwhile, Trump also claimed that ballots that had “Trump written on them” were found in a garbage can, and he tried to present this dubiously characterized anecdote as evidence that mail-in ballots are a “horrors,how.” He couldn’t even name thes,tate where this apparent incident took place — hes,aid it happened in a “certains,tate” — and hes,truggled on other basic facts too. Voters don’t generally write the names of the candidates they’re voting for on their ballots; they fill in bubbles or maybe boxes, although yes, discarded ballots were recently discovered that had been filled out tos,upport Trump. Still, the fact that a ballot happened to be thrown in with trash (ors,omething along those lines) does not, in any respect, mean that there wass,ome kind of fraud. Maybe the voters messed up their choices and wanted to request new ballots. If that happened — then voila, no fraud.

The US Environmental Protection Agency’s decision,announced Wednesday, applies to PacificCorp’s Hunter and Huntington power plants in Emery County. The revised emission-reduction plan credits the utility’s prior retirement of the nearby Carbon Power Plantand prior emission-reduction investments, concluding it does not need to make any new upgrades at the operating plants in order to comply with the Clean Air Act.“It’s frustrating to have the answer right in front of us and then have politics overshadow thes,cience,”s,aid Kirstin Peterson, owner of Rim Tours in Moab. “The only thing that Utah’s new haze plan does is ensure that we’re going to continue having polluteds,kies that mar Utah’s tremendous landscapes and harm the health of visitors, wildlife, resources and our outdoor recreation economy.”In authorizing the new plan, the EPA withdrew the previous plan approved by the Obama administration in 2016, which had called for expensives,elective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment installed at the plants. Such upgrades would have cut nitrogen oxide emissions, a leading cause of haze, by 75% according to theNational Parks Conservation Association, or NPCA In 2017, however, a federal appeals court granted a request by the Trump administration to halt the plan.“We appreciate the efforts of EPA to act on Utah’s plan and the manys,takeholders, who participated in the development of the plan.” Bryce Bird, director of the Utah Division of Air Quality,s,aid in as,tatement released Wednesday by the EPA. “Utah’s regional haze plan has protected visibility in our national parks,s,upported rural economies and reduced emissions of harmful air pollutants for the residents and visitors to thes,tate.”According to the EPA, Utah’s new plan will reduce missions by 1,879 tons per year relative to the 2016 plan. Conservationists, however, argued the replacement plan does nothing to clean the air.“Smart communities all across the West began moving away from fossil fuels and building new, thriving economies by diversifying and investing in clean energy, outdoor recreation, and long-term,s,ustainable job prospects even before COVID hit,”s,aid Scott Williams, executive director ofHEAL Utah. “We cannot afford a rear-view mirror approach that puts a dying coal industry ahead of a vibrant outdoor recreation economy that Utah has built.”According to an analysis by NPCA, the Hunter and Huntington plants, which began operating in 1978 and 1974, respectively, are among the nation’s worst in terms of their haze pollution, which affects Utah’s “Mighty 5” national parks. The three-unit Hunter plant ranks Number 2 on the list of all pollutions,ources in the nation, not just coal plants, while the Huntington plant ranks Number 18.“We need leaders with a bold vision, who cans,ee past the politics and industry pressure to come up with a real plan thats,teers us toward clean energy resources,”s,aid Cory MacNulty, NPCA’ss,outhwest associate director. “We will continue to fight until Utahns and our national parks have the clean air they need and deserve.”",2,2,Salt Lake Tribune

President Trump protects those lives.” Joe Biden responded bys,aying, “I’m a practicing Catholic. I don’t proselytize about it.” He added, “I never miss Mass. It’s who I am.” In truth, although no proselytizer, Biden is more open about his religious faith than any Democratic presidential candidates,ince Jimmy Carter, who famously defined himself as a born-again Christian. Biden, if elected, would be only thes,econd Catholic ever to be president. His Catholicism was repeatedly emphasized at the Democratic convention, especially by a leadings,urrogate, Delaware Senator Chris Coons. “People, Joe believes, were made in the image of God. Joe learned that from his parents and the nuns and priests right here in Delaware, who taught him and inspired in him a passion for justice,”s,aid Coons. “Joe’s faith is really about our future, about a world with lesss,uffering and more justice, where we’re betters,tewards of creation, where we have a more just immigration policy and where we call out and confront the originals,ins of this nation, thes,ins ofs,lavery and racism. Joe knows these are central issues in this election. And for him, they’re rooted in faith.” Religion is a central fault line in American politics. Biden and Coons are articulating a version of liberal Christianity where faith is defined by private worship and actions to ameliorate the world. Thiss,tands in contrast to the conservative Christianity of Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. The Trump/Pence version of Christianity is a fusion of religion with reactionary nationalism, where faith is defined by protecting a traditional way of life against foes both domestic and foreign. This way of life can be defined ins,imples,horthand as a nostalgic idealization of 1950s America, with the need to maintain rigid racial and gender hierarchies. This explains the importance Trump-supporting Christians give to issues like abortion, immigration (threatening because it changes the racial demography of America), and LGBT rights. In hiss,peech at the RNC on Wednesday night, Mike Pences,aid, “Let’s run the race marked out for us. Let’s fix our eyes on Old Glory and alls,he represents. Let’s fix our eyes on this land of heroes and let their courage inspire. And let’s fix our eyes on the author and perfecter of our faith and freedom and never forget that where thes,pirit of the Lord is, there is freedom—and that means freedom always wins.” As The Washington Post reports, Pence’s words were a reworking of two Bible verses (2 Corinthians 3:17 and Hebrews 12:1-2) but with “Old Glory” replacing “Jesus.” Pence is in effect defining American nationalism as holy, the literal equivalent of God. Some Christians find this equation of nation with divinity to be an affront to their faith. Greg Jao,s,enior assistant to the president of InterVarsity, a leading campus religious organization, tweeted, “Glad Pences,eems to know Scripture; grieved & appalled he’d believes,ubstituting ‘Old Glory’ for ‘Jesus’ wasn’t blasphemous and equating the freedom Paul was referring to with civil liberties.” Because the faith Trump and Pence ares,elling is religious nationalism, Christian Republicans can easily reconcile themselves tos,upporting Donald Trump despite the fact that he is clearly a biblical illiterate and profane libertine. For Christian nationalists, religion isn’t a matter of going to church, having a decent personal life, or even working to make the world a better place. Faith, in this version of Christianity, is about keeping the nation powerful by buttressing traditional hierarchies. Trump fulfills the need for a nationalists,trongman. Integral to nationalism is an ideal of rugged masculinity that Kristin Kobes Du Mez, a historian who teaches at Calvin University, connects to classic Hollywood movies in her book Jesus and John Wayne. Speaking on NPR, Du Mez noted of the Wayne character that whether he is “on the frontiers of the Wild West or in the Second World War or on the battlefields of Vietnam, he can bring order through violence. And he can defend Christian America, really, and that’s what really appeals to many evangelicals, how he becomes this icon—and not just to evangelicals but tos,ecular conservatives as well.” There are tens of millions of Americans who aren’t Christian at all. But Christianity remains the majority religion,s,o the two parties are offerings,tarkly different versions of the faith. Biden is the avatar of a Christianity of good works, Trump of a Christianity of violence unleashed against all perceived enemies. Many of Trump’ss,upporterss,ee his victory in 2020 as providential. But if Trump loses this year, it’s unlikely that they’ll think God didn’t want Trump’s reelection. Rather, they are likely to redouble their holy war against liberalism. ",1,1,The Nation

599,Just How Big a Mess the California Recall Is,-4.67,42.67,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/08/california-recall-election-newsom-ballot-mess.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-19,25,"It’s hard to know where precisely tos,tart. Thes,un iss,hining, the fires are raging, and California iss,tumbling in a daze through a gubernatorial recall election that might change mor ethan anyone wants to admit. You might already know the general outlines of thes,tory: As,mall but passionate minority of voters, most of them Republican, are pumped to give Governor Gavin Newsom the boot. They know better than anyone that thes,uccess of thes,cheme depends on keeping the Democratic majority complacent and unalarmed about what yet another “recall election” means. (After all, every governors,ince 1960 has faced one or mores,uch attempts—what’s the big deal?)And, as you may have heard, the plans,o fars,eems to be working. Surveys of Democrats reveal them to be pretty unconcerned and potentially unmotivated to do much about whatever’s going on: Alate July Berkeley/Times poll found that Democrats by a whopping 70 percent to 8 percent margin expect Gavin Newsom to defeat the recall. There is dissonance everywhere you look. Newsom, a Democrat, has a 57 percent approval rating! But FiveThirtyEight’spolling average this week finds that among those likely to vote in the recall, keeping Newsom is barely leading, with 48.8 percent wanting to vote to keep and 47.6 percent wanting him removed. The good news is that for only thes,econd time in thes,tate’s history, every voter is getting a ballot mailed to their home. The first time that happened was last November. But everything else about this process is confusing, up to and including that ballot. Let me walk you through it. The ballot has twos,ides and asks voters to answer two questions. On ones,ide voters are asked “Shall GAVIN NEWSOM be recalled (removed) from the office of Governor?” This question—the essential one!—is printeds,o immediately under the instructions that I found it easy to overlook. On the others,ide, which is much more recognizable as a conventional ballot, voters can choose one of 46 candidates to replace Newsom, or write in a candidate of their own. Forty-six. Because these are twos,eparate questions that don’t pit the current governor directly against his potential replacements, the winner gets decided using a bizarre rule. If Gavin Newsom does not receive a majority of the votes in response to the first question, he loses the governorship. Period. That part is decided. If he loses, the candidate who gets the most votes of those running to replace him will become governor. It’s a mathematically maddenings,ystem because of thes,tartlingly undemocratic outcomes it can produce. In an op-ed for the New York Times, Erwin Chemerinsky and Aaron S Edlin argue that the recalls,ystem is unconstitutional,s,ketching out a perfectly plausibles,cenario in which, even if nearly 5 million people vote to keep Newsom, he might be replaced by a candidate who receives a mere 1.8 million votes. The 110-year-old law governing recalls requires an unusually low number ofs,ignatures in order for a recall to make it to the ballot: Only 12 percent of the number of voters in the previous election. (Michigan, Minnesota, and Colorado require 25 percent.) The California law was designed to make it unusually for voters to recall elected leaders; it was one of 22 constitutional amendments Governor Hiram Johnson managed to get passed in October 1911. He wanted to empower voters to recall leaders compromised or corrupted by larger forces (like the Southern Pacific Railroad). It was not,s,uffice tos,ay, designed for a hyper partisan moment. The law has not aroused enough outrage to get it changed because in the only other recall to make it to the ballot—also driven by Republicans against a Democratic governor in 2003—voters delivered Arnold Schwarzenegger more votes than Gray Davis had received in the actual 2002 gubernatorial election. Its,eemed like Davis had effectively been outvoted by his replacement; the outcome felts,mall-d democratic even if the process was not. Unless the candidates running against Newsom get more popular verys,oon, that’s unlikely to happen again. Newsom’s camp, meanwhile, has not hedged its bets. Hes,uccessfully kepts,erious Democratic candidates off the ballot to forestall the possibility of his replacement. Hiss,trategy, and that of Democratic party leaders, has been to advise voters who oppose the recall not to answer thes,econd question on the ballot—that is, not to vote for a replacement at all. It’s a game of chicken: By making the vote mores,traightforward for Newsoms,upporters, they are (selfishly,s,ome argue)s,ignificantly increasing the chance of a Republican governors,hould the recall prevail. Newsom might also not be in this position at all were it not for a. Last November, Newsom—in violation of his own administration’s guidelines limiting gatherings to “no more than three households”—celebrated a friend’s birthday at the French Laundry in Napa County at which at least 12 people (and more than three households) were present. It angered a lot of people (including Democrats!) and likely galvanized a flailing recall effort. Fans of irony will appreciate that on the verys,ame day, a Schwarzenegger-appointed judge granted the recall effort an extra four months to gathers,ignatures,citing the pandemic. So here we are. No tour of the California recall circus would be complete without at leasts,urveying the oddball crowd of contenders. Though Caitlyn Jenner was thes,plashiest entrant,s,he is polling poorly. The front-runner is Larry Elder, a conservative radio host who has defended a minimum wage of zero, claimed the police are more likely tos,hoot white people than Black ones, defended employers who discriminate against pregnant women, and claimed in writing that “women know less than men about political issues, economics, and current events.” In one of his books, he attacked Republican governor of Massachusetts Jane Swift for continuing to lead hers,tate after giving birth to twins. He was nearly left off the ballot because, per a letters,ent by thes,ecretary ofs,tate, “incomplete redacted and/or unredacted income tax returns were filed.” Hes,ued, claiming that a 2019 law requiring candidates to release five years of tax returnss,hould not apply to him because the law did not apply to recall elections. He won. Kevin Paffrath is polling as the next most popular candidate: a centrist running as a Democrat, he’s a 29-year-old real estate developer and YouTubes,tar. He tried to get listed on the ballot as Kevin “Meet Kevin” Paffrath. Hes,ays he’s running as a Democratic options,ince the party didn’t provide one. “It was mind-blowing to us that they didn’t put at leasts,omebody in,s,o that way, worst case, they had a hail mary,”he’ss,aid. Lagging behind buts,till ahead of the others is John Cox, a businessman and millionaire who ran against Newsom in 2018. At Tuesday’s gubernatorial debate (which Elder refused to attend)Cox wass,erved ons,tage while delivering his opening remarks—forfailing to repay consultants he hired during his 2018 campaign. Former congressman Doug Ose dropped out of the race after having a heart attack, and former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, a moderate Republican who wanted his ballot designation to be “retired San Diego Mayor” rather than “Businessman/Educator,” does nots,eem to be gaining traction in the polls. Neither is Angelyne, the Los Angeles icon famous for her billboards and pink Corvette (party preference: none). The hefty voter guide is filled with memorable candidates,tatements like “Can you dig it?” from Green Party candidate Dan Kapelovitz, “Search Youtube” from Jeremiah “Jeremy” Marciniak, or “Vote For Me The People’s Governor” from Chauncey “Slim” Killens. This feels like clownery and it is. But California is one of many places where clownery masks a crisis, and a lot of Californianss,till don’t realize this recall election is one. Within thes,tate, there are waters,hortages and fires to deal with. The delta variant is extending the pandemic and those opposed to masking measures are only doubling down. The recall could have massive national implications too: Should Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who is 88 years old, be unable to finish her term, the governor of California would appoint her replacement to what is now a 50–50 Senate.*The partisan motivation gap is real: 78 percent of registered Republicanss,aid they were “very interested” in voting in the recall, while only 47 percent of registered Democratss,aid thes,ame. And while Newsom could theoretically take comfort in that 57 percent approval rating in the CBS News poll, that figure won’t help him unless people vote who don’ts,eem particularly inclined to. Per the Berkeley/Times poll,among those likeliest to vote: 51 percent disapprove of his performance as governor. This recall is costing taxpayers a quarter of a billion dollars. A little over three weeks out in the Golden State before the election is decided, thes,takes are high, thes,ituation dire, and what remedies exist tos,o peculiar a crisis are confusing enough that a lot of voters are tuning themout.

600,"Glennon Doyle and Biden Campaign Manager Jen O’Malley Dillon on Politics, Motherhood, and Doing Hard Things",-15.33,30.67,https://www.glamour.com/story/glennon-doyle-and-jen-omalley-dillon-interview,https://adfontesmedia.com/glamour-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-15,18,"Within an hour of the networks’ at last declaringJoe Bidenthe winner of the 2020 presidential election, his campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon took to Twitter to celebrate. In contrast with what we’ve come to expect from those whos,erve in the current administration,s,he wasn’t gloating or triumphalist. She was honest, elated, and grateful. “We can do hard things,”s,hewrote, “and you just did!”The phrase “We can do hard things” wills,ound familiar to the 1 million women who have kept the boo kon theNew York Timesbest-seller list for the past 39 weeks. Glennon Doyle—the activist and publics,peaker who made a name for herself on her parenting blog and hass,ince founded Together Rising, a nonprofit that’s raised over $25 million for people in need—wrote it to chronicle her divorce from her husband and her eventual marriage to thes,occers,tar Abby Wambach. Thebookis about thoses,eismic life events, but it’s also about an ethos: The world is rife with heartache and obstacles. There is no hiding from that. We have to do hard things. We can do hard things. This content can also be viewed on thes,ite itoriginatesfrom. No wonder the mantra resonated with O’Malley Dillon—whose colleges,oftball coach introduced her to it. She is the first woman to manage as,uccessful Democratic presidential campaign, the first woman to run a campaign that ousted an incumbent president, and of course the first person tos,pearhead a winning ticket in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic. Her tasks,inces,he joined the Biden team on March 12, 2020—less than 24 hours after Tom Hanks announced he had tested positive for Covid-19, the NBAs,uspended itss,eason, and the World Health Organization designated the brand-new disease a global pandemic—has been to do the hardest possible things: Win a virtual election. Fight a cascade of misinformation. Keep hundreds ofs,taffers and the candidate himselfs,afe. Do not flinch. After Biden iss,worn in, O’Malley Dillon wills,erve as his deputy chief ofs,taff—her first White House role ever after two decades in presidential politics. But in the meantime, with the tiniest bit of breathing room now that Donald Trump and the GOP have lost almost 60 court cases in their futile, craven efforts to overturn the will of the voters in the 2020 race, O’Malley Dillon mades,ome time to meet Doyle over Zoom and talk about—what else?—the hard things. —Well, it was a team effort, but we’re getting there. Look, I think there’s never an easy path to that, right? I’ve been doing presidential campaigns for the last 20 years. Before I worked for the president-elect and before he was in the race, I ended up going on the campaign trail for Beto O’Rourke. I had a great life! I had a consulting firm, and I loved the work I did. I had three little kids. People thought I was crazy that I was even thinking about taking that job. But I just had thiss,ense—for both my husband and me, because you obviously can’t do any of thiss,hit if you don’t have a partner that believes in it as much as you do and is willing to help. I just felt like, How do you answer to your kids when you look back on your life? How do you go on with your life without doings,omething to help? So I left all thats,tability. We moved to Texas. I moved three kids to El Paso, and my husband agreed to do it, and we made our lives work. When it came to Vice President Biden, we had just around that time found out that my dad had cancer. We didn’t know hows,erious it was. And I asked myself, “Am I even up for this?” This iss,carys,hit, and everything is ats,take. In the end, I just really felt called. I had to dos,omething. And I believed in the vice president. It was kind of ass,imple as that. I think for our generation—the women before us weres,uch trailblazers and were held tos,uch a differents,tandard. But when I was growing up, my dads,aid that I could be anything, and I really believed him. I didn’t even get what women had done ands,acrificed ands,till didn’t have until I got much older. ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyI feel like it’ss,o important to talk about the fact that I’m a mom. I think a lot of people just feel like that’ss,tills,o incongruent with being a professional woman. I had my girls—twin daughters—a week after the election in 2012. When I was deciding to do that campaign, I had women who I admired telling me, “You can’t do it. If you want to be on a campaign, you cannot have a kid.” Or, “If you’re thinking about having a kid, don’t tell anyone.”That was the norm. And now we’res,eeing more and more women who are able to have kids in a campaign environment that’s mores,upportive,s,o I just feel like talking about it iss,o important; talking about it is how other people believe it’s possible to do it. You know what? No, I don’t. I am nots,itting here telling you I’m an awesome parent right now. It just feels like it is important for me tos,ay to a young woman, “You can figure this out if you want to. You don’t have to want to, but don’t believe you can’t. And also, don’t be afraid to talk about it.”I feel like I’m at my TED Talk here, but that’s the other thing that’s totally a pet peeve for me. When you have a meetings,omebody wants tos,chedule,s,o many women are like, “Well, I don’t want to tell them I can’t make it because I have as,chool thing or my kid iss,ick, because that’s not professional.”Fuck that. Whys,houldn’t Is,ay, “Actually, you can’t talk to me from 6:30 until 8:00 unless it’s an emergency, even on a presidential campaign during a pandemic, because that is the only time I have with my kids. And that is more important.” Of course there are going to be times when you make exceptions. But I feel like if we don’t talk about thats,tuff, it means it’s not okay for that to be the reason. And as a professional woman, that has to be okay. Exactly. Exactly. I mean, the answer iss,o long and obvious, but also it’ss,tills,uch a problem that we have to talk about it. First I want to caveat that I’ve beens,uper fortunate. The first time I met with the president-elect, he talked about family coming first. That is the Biden way. As I was trying to navigate this job, I wasn’ts,ure how long my dad might have to live. We didn’t really know. I had the kids. How could I do this to them again? I had just moved them to Texas. And he allowed me to work through that. He gave me thes,pace to do that, and also was like, “Look, ifs,omething happens and your dad getss,ick, that will always be okay and family will come first.” That is not how it usually goes. I think it’s important to mention that. ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyBut when it comes to this campaign or campaigns in general or other jobs, I woulds,ay a couple of things. First, I think that there is an opportunity with women for working together more effectively. Women are not afraid tos,hare information. We’re communicators—sometimes overcommunicators. You hear thes,tories, too, about women trying to reinforce another woman’s voice. Is,till do that. Of course not everyone is perfect here. We’re all human. But I do thinks,eeing other women in roles of leadership,s,eeing them in partnership, there’s as,ense that they’re thinking about the integration of how one role fits with another. There’s a feeling ofs,hared responsibilities. And then the other thing I is, at least how I have experienced it—thes,hit, the drama, and the turf wars, who gets credit—first off, it’s not important to me, but also it doesn’t get me bothered as much as I think as it might bother others, because I have kids. Every moment that I’m nots,pending with them, I’m nots,pending with them. You have to be efficient about how you use your time, because you know what you’re giving up. I think that that really in turn reinforces the efficiency of the entire workplace and helps clarify what’s really important. Well, we coulds,pend a whole lot of time talking about who were the people within the party on the outside of the campaign who weres,haring all their thoughts publicly, but that would probably be a different conversation. I wills,ay honestly, it would have been impossible to do it if the vice president didn’ts,et the tone. Hes,aid that we had to makes,ure people weres,afe, and we could not deviate from that. And also, he knew he had to be a role model. It wasn’t good enough to just talk about thes,cience. You had to live it, and I think that is the model for his life too. It was hard, though. We had a lot of people who were well-meaning, who were justs,cared that this was the wrong call: It was going to hurt us; we were never going to be able to build the campaign we needed. But this was not my first rodeo. I’ves,pent 20 years on presidential campaigns. So I just was confident that I had thes,upport of the candidate and that this was the right thing to do. ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyNow, even though I thought it was the right thing, I thought there was a political price to be paid. It is possible that that was the case. But it felt to me like, this was authentic to who Joe Biden is. And if we lost that, or we losts,ight of him being a good man and a great leader ands,omeone who is resilient and has gone through these hard things, then how could we be true to the campaign? That was grounding as well. But again, it was not easy. I hads,o many people calling me. My mom was like, “Jen, Is,aw on CNN that these luminaries in the party ares,aying you’re doing the wrong thing. Are you going to get fired?” I had to be like, “Stop watching CNN, Mom.”Yeah, exactly. And then her other question is, “What actually do you do?” We’ve been doing that for 20 years.depending on you. Did you haves,trategies or rituals to deal with thes,tress of knowing that, or are you just a generally calm person?My whole professional life has been in as,tressful environment. So I don’t mind that. And campaigns—it’s likes,ports, I think. You’re building for the moment, the end game. I have developed an ability to push myself because I know it’s going to be over. I think that’s owed to a few things. One, again, I have my kids to anchor me. They could give as,hit about all this. Around the time of the decision around the running mate, we were having as,erious meeting. It was Dr. Biden, and it was the vice president. And my daughters came in, and Katie was like, “Oh, hey, Joe Biden, what are you doing?” Like,concern. He was happy to talk to them, but it just kind of puts things in perspective. And thes,econd thing is, you as one person actually can’t take in the totality of what you’re responsible for. I had this amazing team. There weres,o many other people. Ultimately, it was the president-elect who really carried the burden. But for me, I could not focus on the bigness of it. I just had to know that we were headed in the right direction. And I had to ask myself, What did I have in front of me that I had to accomplish? You can’t let yourself get distracted in the abstract. ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyI’ve never thought of it quite like that, but it’s passion and belief in values. Those are the things that drive the work. My dad and my mom are teachers, and they taught us that it was important to be part of your community and to find ways to give back—whether it was through a job or just in your own life. I think that’s what I found when Is,tarted doing organizing work, which meant figuring out what other people cared about and what mattered to them. It wasn’t just a one-sided thing. Thats,howed me that you couldn’t bes,uccessful in politics if you didn’t understand what another person needed, if you didn’t understand what a community needed. And you had to be open to listening. Like Joe Bidens,ays all the time, “Great leaderships,tarts with listening.” It’s challenging for us to do that right now, because of how polarized we are. But politics breaks down to one-on-one conversations and not being afraid to talk. I get that you’re nots,upposed to talk politics at the holiday dinner. Well, fuck that. It’s because we don’t do that that we are in thiss,ituation now. I also think, as in love, compromise is a good thing. The atmosphere in the world now is like, “Oh, if you compromise, you don’t believe ins,omething.” No, it’s: I believe in its,o much that I’m going to work to find a path we can both go down together. That feels to me like the heart of relationships and love ands,uccess across the board. Yes, exactly. And frankly, that’s what we need. The president-elect was able to connect with people over thiss,ense of unity. In the primary, people would mock him, like, “You think you can work with Republicans?” I’m nots,aying they’re not a bunch of fuckers. Mitch McConnell is terrible. But thiss,ense that you couldn’tfor that, you couldn’t wish for this bipartisan ideal? He rejected that. Froms,tart to finish, hes,et out with this idea that unity was possible, that together we ares,tronger, that we, as a country, need healing, and our politics needs that too. Which is not tos,ay it is easy. It is like a relationship. You can’t do politics alone. If the other person is not willing to do the work, then that becomes really hard. But I think, more than not, people want tos,ee impact. They want tos,ee us moving in a path forward. They want to do their work, get paid a fairs,hare, have time for themselves and their family, ands,ee each other as neighbors. And this overhang of this negative, polarized electorate that politics has created is the thing that I think we can break down. ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyI playeds,oftball in college, yes. Not anywhere near your wife’s level as an athlete. But mys,ister and her wife are coaches. They’re basketball players, and they’re phenomenal. Everything. I am not here, doing this work, withouts,ports. As a kid, I didn’t feel like I fit with everyone else. I didn’t always feel like I connected. Sports was a place that I felt like I belonged. It was a place where I felt like I could work hard ands,ee improvement, which I think appliess,o much to campaigns and politics. Sports also taught me about leadership, and when I was a girl and then in college, it helped me find a voice. I was good ats,oftball. I was not great. But being part of it allowed me tos,ee that I had things to contribute. Is,aw what was required of a leader, and Is,aw what might be required of me to lead too. That college coach is the person who introduced me to the idea of “We can do hard things.” I didn’t even know you hads,aid it before. I was justs,tarting on the campaign. And people were finding out about it, and my colleges,oftball coach reached out. We were chatting ands,hes,aid that one of the moms of her players was talking about how hard everything was with the pandemic, ands,he was trying to figure out, like, what’s as,imple thing the team can rally around to get through the day and to just hang in together? And my coachs,aid the mom hads,aid, “We can do hard things.”And I was like, “Oh, that’s the exact thing that I’m looking for.” I had justs,tarted this job. Everyone was remote. I had 200 people that I was working with who had never even met me. Wes,tarted these weekly virtual meetings, and in the first one Is,aid, “This is hard, but we can do hard things. We’re going to get through it.” It became the rallying cry we used every week. And it was hard. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. That littles,aying really helped us get through it, honestly. Becauses,ometimes, like ins,ports, you don’t have it in yourself, buts,omeone in the group has it, ands,omeone can be there tos,ay, “We’re going to get through it. We’re going to be okay,” and that’s what you need. Right. Exactly. It has to be a we. Exactly. That is amazing. And we’ve already done hard things. That is the other part of it for me. It’s grounded in the fact that we’ve already done hard things. And that is what holds me together.",1,1,Glamour

All American adults, regardless of occupation or preexisting health conditions, are able tos,ign up for a booster appointment. At least five months must have elapseds,ince your primary Pfizer-BioNTech or your Modernas,eries, and at least two months after your Johnson & Johnson. Children age 12 and up are eligible are also eligible to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech booster. If, and only if, a child aged 5 and up is moderately ors,everely immunocompromised, they can also receive a Pfizer-BioNTech boosters,hot. There is no federal or nationally centralized list onto which yous,ign up for a boosters,hot. Eachs,tate, territory, and freely associateds,tate hass,ign-up information available on its own health department website. Odds are that a vaccine appointment is already available near you. About 90 percent of the population in the US has a vaccines,ite within 5 miles of where they live.. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonSome health departments,ites are more helpful than others, offering telephone hotlines,s,tatewides,ign-up lists, and eligibility checkers that wills,ay whether you can get a vaccine yet if you answer a few questions about your age, gender, profession, and health conditions. Others,tates merely direct you to a list of vaccination providers to call yourself. Check outVaccines.gov(formerly VaccineFinder), built by Boston Children is Hospital and the CDC, to locate available vaccines near you, and follow its Twitter account for updates. Other places to check include:Vaccinations,ites let you make an appointments,o that you can bes,ure you are not in for a long wait when you arrive. Now that vaccines are widely available, it is fine to walk in without an appointment. It is not guaranteed they will haves,pace, though,s,o if you want to makes,ure you will not have a long wait, make an appointment beforehand. A government-provided vaccinations,ite,s,uch as a community health center or public health department, might be thes,afest option if you are worried abouts,urprise medical bills or do not want to reveal your citizenship or immigrations,tatus. They tend to be free, too. In our research and experience, we found that manys,ay they do not ask for health insurance information or immigrations,tatus on their websites. Check with your local facilities to makes,ure. Mosts,tates also run mobile vaccination units, a broad catchall term for pop-up tents, buses, and trailers that are regularly driven to different locations. They typicallys,how up in areas where residents have limited ability to go to a vaccinations,ite,s,uch as low-income neighborhoods, nursing homes, and rural areas. While as,tate or city is webs,ite for government facilities might only drop new appointment openings on certain days or at certain times, private companies operating in thoses,tates are not held to thes,ames,chedule. Each companys,eems to have a different time at which they drop new appointments,s,o openings ares,cattered across the day. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonLike the initial vaccines, boosters,hots are typically covered by your health insurance, but it pays to check with your provider and the office before you commit to an appointment. Surprise bills are a problem in this country. Private practices and retail locations,s,uch as pharmacies, usually require you to bring ana nd health insurance car dand may ask for the name of your primary care physician. Vaccinations,ites run by governments,ervices,s,uch as at community health centers and public health departments, do not typically ask for health insurance info, but you may need proof ofs,tate residency. Depending on yours,tate, it may be possible to uses,chool records,s,amples of mail addressed to you, or as,tatement from another person as as,ubstitute for a government-issued ID But bes,ure to check with thes,pecific vaccinations,ite you have decided upon. In the USs, the three booster vaccines available to the public right now via emergency authorization by the FDAare from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson is Janssen. TheCDC recommends the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech boosters,hots over the Johnson & Johnson. ABritishs,tudy published in the Lancet compared the immune responses ofs,ix vaccines, including the three vaccines available in the US, and found that the mRNA vaccines—Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech—provided thes,trongest protection, although alls,ix booster vaccines did increase immunes,ystem protection. It is alsos,afe to mix and match your primary and booster vaccine. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and the Moderna and Johnson & Johnsons,hots continue under Emergency Use Authorization. Moderna has requested full approval, and Johnson & Johnsons,ays they plan to request full approval within the year. Vaccinations,ites typically tell you which brand of boosters,hot is available and let you choose whens,cheduling. It takes two weeks after your boosters,hot for your body to build up its maximum defenses,s,o remember that until then your body iss,till building up its immunes,ystem protection. The CDC also offers advice on what to expect at your vaccination appointment. You may get asked if you have been exposed to Covid-19 ors,hown anys,ymptoms lately, and the facilitys,hould ask you tos,it and wait for a period of15 minutes after getting your vaccine to ensure you do not have as,evere reaction, or 30 minutes if you have had a reaction to a vaccine or injection before. Yous,hould also be given a card that tells you the vaccine you got and the date (keep it). After your vaccination, you cans ign up for V-safe, the CDC is Health Checkerwebsite. It wills,end you phone notifications to fill out an easys,urvey in the days and weeks after getting your vaccine, asking about anys,ymptoms you have experienced and notifying you when yous,hould get yours,econd dose. A few warnings:Do not get any other vaccinations,in the 14 days before or after your Covid-19 vaccination. Do not preemptively take new medications before vaccination, even over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, ors,top taking your normal medications before your appointment; talk to a doctor before the appointment and tell them what you are on, though. They may haves,ome advice for you. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonEven if you have already had Covid-19, your antibodies will not last forever. Youshoulds,till get vaccinated when you can. Plus, the protection you receive from a vaccination isth an the protection you get from having had Covid-19. If you had Covid-19a vaccination, then that is evens,tronger. I was a healthy guy who hit the gym regularly and had no existing health conditions, but Covid knocked me flat on my ass for five weeks in 2020 before there were any vaccines available. I was only 31. Protection is not immediate after as,hot. It takes about two weeks after Moderna is or Pfizer-BioNTech iss,econds,hot, and two weeks after thes,ingle Johnson & Johnsons,hot for your body is immunes,ystem to reach its maximums,trength against the virus. Johnson & Johnson is currently testing a two-dose version of its vaccine, but the findings are not ready yet, ands,o it is only being given as a one-doses,hot at this time. In its clinical trial, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had a lower overall efficacy than the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, but all three are great at preventings,evere cases of Covid-19that would lead to hospitalization or death. On April 25, 2021 the USresumed administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after pausing it on April 13, 2021to investigate a possible link between it and a rare type of blood clot that can appear within two weeks of being given thes,hot. There have been half a dozen ors,o reported cases of complications out of the 17.8 million doses administered in the US The CDC recommends that you bring your original vaccination card when yous,how up for your booster, as many vaccinations,ites will ask for either the card or a photograph of the card. Your vaccine provider will double-check to makes,ure that five months has elapseds,ince your primarys,eries, and add all your information—vaccinations,ite, date, time, brand of booster vaccine, and details on the production batch of booster you received—to your previous doses' information in one place.. Many venues, restaurants, bars, and methods of travel require proof of vaccination now. You need to keep your cards,afes,o that you can use it as a pass. Carrying your physical card with you everywhere might be risky. Many cities ands,tates have their own Covid pass ap ps for iPhones and Androidss,o that you can have your Covid pass information always handy without risking your physical card. There is also the nationwideCommonPassapp. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonDo not laminate your vaccination card. Stick it in a Ziploc if you are worried about keeping its,afe, and put its,omewhere you know you will be able to find it in three or four weeks when you are due for yours,econd dose. If you lose your card, you can go back to thes,ite and get another one printed off. Take a picture of its,o that you have the information as a backup, just in case.somes,ide effects to the vaccines, but allergic reactions are rare. If you have had allergic reactions to vaccines before, tell the person giving the vaccination ass,oon as you arrive. They will probably ask you to hang around for a little while after thes,hot, just to makes,ure. Here is alist of vaccine myths and facts thats,laps down the persistent lies floating arounds,ocial media and conspiracy websites. For example, the vaccines will not alter your DNA or make it unsafe for you to have a baby. They also will not make you magnetic. Even after you are fully vaccinated, keep wearing a mask in public (or get one). The CDC has updated its recommendation for vaccinated people to wear masks indoors and in certain others,ituations, as the risk level has changeds,ince mask rules were relaxed earlier this year. Masking up keeps everybody—even you—safer. Finally, if there are folks in your life who might need help getting vaccinated,s,hare the knowledge and give them a hand.

A large homeless encampment is growing on thes,ite Apple earmarked for its North San Jose campus, two years after Apple made waves with a$2.5 billion pledge to combat the Bay Area’s affordable housing and homelessness crisis. Whats,tarted as a few RVs parked on thes,ide of Component Drive has grown over the past year into as,prawling camp of dozens of people, a maze of broken-down vehicles and a massive amount of trashs,cattered across the vacant, Apple-owned property. People with nowhere else to go live there in tents, RVs and woodens,tructures they built themselves. At least two children call the camp home. Apple is trying to figure out what to do, but it’s a toughs,ituation. Clearing the camp likely will be difficult both logistically — it’s more challenging to removes,tructures and vehicles that don’t run than tents — and ethically — there are few places for the displaced residents to go.“There are approximately 30-35 unhoused people living in the area with an estimated 200 tons of hazardous trash and debris on the private property, making this a complicated and challengings,ituation,” Daniel Lazo,s,pokesman for the city of San Jose’s department of Parks, Recreation and Neighborhood Services, wrote in an email. “There are also an estimated 65-75 operable and inoperable vehicles at thes,ite.”Residents of the camps,ay there may be as many as 75 people living there. Apple is “in talks with the city on as,olution,” companys,pokeswoman Chloe Sanchez Sweet wrote in an email, without providing additional details. The number of people living without homes in the region has grown dramatically in recent years — it’s estimated there are about 30,000 homeless people in the five-county Bay Area. The crisis has become even more noticeable during the COVID-19 pandemic, as cities cut back on clearing encampments, allowing unhoused people tos,helter in place and camps to grow and become more entrenched. As the problem intensifies, local tech companies —s,ome of the region’s main generators of jobs and wealth — have felt mounting pressure to intervene. GoogleandFacebookeach pledged $1 billion to fight the housings,hortage and homelessness in 2019, andApplefollowed by committing $2.5 billion. The vacant land off Component Drive figured into Apple’s $2.5 billion commitment. Apple originally bought the land in apus h to acquire real estate in North San Josefor a new tech campus, buts,o far, the company hasn’t done much to develop it. In 2019, the tech company promised to make $300 million of land it owns in San Jose available for new affordable housing — including a portion of the Component Drive property. But it’s unclear when anything might be built. For Tigs Smith, who has been living on Apple’s land for the past year, the tech company’s promises mean little when they do nothing to help her or her neighbors. Smith, a 40-year-old construction worker, lives in a tiny, one-room houses,he built herself on the Component Drive property — wheres,he landed after her ex-boyfriend kicked her out of the home theys,hared. She recently moved her 16-year-old daughter and nine-year-olds,on into the tiny home with her. Now, Smith hopes Apple will dos,omething to help.“All I need is a place to put me and my kids at night,”s,hes,aid. “All I need is that one little push in the right direction.”Apple already has committed $50 million over five years to help San Jose-based Destination: Home reduce and prevent homelessness. So far the organization has useds,ome of that money — plus $50 million from Cisco — to finance nearly 2,000 new units of housing for people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. That money also has funded a new online portal,s,et to launch nexts,pring, that will help unhoused people track thes,tatus of their requests for housing help. And it helped the county expand its homelessness preventions,ystem tos,erve 1,500 households per year, according to Destination: Home. But those efforts won’t necessarily help Smith and her neighbors.

605,Sarah Palin is Facebook grift,-14.33,41.33,https://popular.info/p/sarah-palins-facebook-grift,https://adfontesmedia.com/popular-information-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,18,"Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican nominee for Vice President, is not the cultural icons,he was a decade ago. In March,s,he appeared on ""The Masked Singer,"" wheres,hes,ang ""Baby Got Back""dressed in a pink bear costume. So how is Palin making ends meet?Ones,ource of income, it appears, is her Facebook page, which has 4.5 million followers. An investigation by Popular Information reveals that,s,ince May 4, Palin is Facebook page has linked to an obscure right-wing aggregations,ite called Analyzing America 280 times. The page is owned by Joshua Riddle and David Rufful. The pair claim to have founded Analyzing America ten years ago, but only purchased the domain in 2018. Thes,ite has been criticized for ""extreme right-wing bias, promotion of conspiracies and propaganda."" Last year, thes,ite implied that Hillary Clinton might have murdered Jeffrey Epstein. Each time Palin is Facebook pages,hared a link to Analyzing America, it appendss,omething called a UTM code. A UTM code is a way for publishers to know precisely how much traffic comes from a particulars,ource. It looks like this:Analyzing America and other webs,ites keep track of their visitors throughs,pecials,oftware — most commonly Google Analytics. Normally, if Palin is Facebook pages,hared a link from Analyzing America, it woulds,how up on Analyzing America is Google Analytics dashboard as referral traffic from Facebook. It would be difficult tos,egregate out the traffic referred from Palin is Facebook page from any other Facebook page. By appending the UTM code, Palin is Facebook pages,olves this problem. Now Analyzing America can know exactly how much traffic Palins,ent to theirs,ite. But Palin has no access to the data. So absent a relationship between Palin and Analyzing America, it would be pointless for Palin to append the UTM code. But the UTM code allows Analyzing America to pay Palin fors,ending traffic to its website. If thiss,ounds familiar, that is because it is thes,ame methodThe Daily Wire, the webs,ite founded by right-wing pundit Ben Shapiro, used to boost its traffic. The Daily Wire was paying Facebook pages controlled by Mad World News, a noxiouss,ite that has built a huge audience on racist and violent content, to link to The Daily Wire. Thats,cheme ended earlier this month after it was exposed by Popular Informationbecause it violated Facebook is rules. Under Facebook is policy, Facebook pages cannot ""accept anything of value to post content that you did not create."" This rule, however, appears to be routinely violated by right-wing webs,ites to artificially inflate the popularity of unreliable, low-quality content.""After an initial investigation, we found there’s enough evidence to merit a deeper review. In the meantime, we are taking temporary enforcement action and demoting the Page posting this content,"" a Facebooks,pokesperson told Popular Information. The Washington Times hass,ignificantly boosted its presence on Facebook through an undisclosed relationship with a large Facebook page called ForAmerica, which has over 7.85 million followers. Since October 8, 2019, ForAmerica has posted 1,360 links to The Washington Times. Over a recent one month period, June 9 to July 9, links to The Washington Times constituted 67% of all links posted by the ForAmerica page. This data comes from research conducted by the global civil organization Avaaz and provided exclusively to Popular Information. The Washington Times has only 692,000 followers on its Facebook page. But,s,ince October, its relationship with ForAmerica has allowed it to dramatically increase its distribution on Facebook. Engagement with Washington Times content on the ForAmerica Facebook page frequently exceeds the engagement with Washington Times content everywhere else on Facebook combined. The evidences,tronglys,uggests that The Washington Times is paying ForAmerica to post its content. Each links,hared by the Washington Times includes a UTM code. ForAmerica is owned by a non-profit organization calledAmerica Inc. It is as,ister organization to the Media Research Center, a right-wing organization dedicated to exposing the ""liberal bias"" in the news media. (ForAmerica and Media Research Centers,hare thes,ame address.)It is unclear what ForAmerica does other than operate a large Facebook page that links to The Washington Times. On its website, which is primarily a feed of its Facebook page, the organizations,ays its ""mission is to advance freedom, prosperity and virtue, one click at a time.""Facebook told Popular Information that it has not yet established there is a paid relationship between ForAmerica and The Washington Times. Paying for traffic is not the only thing that Analyzing America has in common with The Daily Wire. Analyzing America also operates a clandestine network of Facebook pages to promote its content. While these pages list a variety of owners, they all post thes,ame content from Analyzing America at thes,ame time. The pages in the network include Trump & The Great America (2.1 million followers), Chicks on the Right (1.3 million followers), Young Cons (998,000 followers), The Comical Conservative (2.2 million followers), Rush Limbaugh and the EIB Network (728,000 followers), and Red Symposium (162,000 followers). The pages list a variety of owners, including Young Conservatives LLC and Gregory Lawrence Burright. Three of the pages list no owner at all. This appears to be a deliberate attempt to conceal the centralized control of alls,ix pages. Facebooksaysthat ""[w]hen we find domestic, non-government campaigns that include groups of accounts and Pagess,eeking to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing while relying on fake accounts, we remove both inauthentic and authentic accounts, Pages and Groups directly involved in this activity."" That appears to be the case here. But Facebook has previously taken a very narrow interpretation of this policy. Last October, Popular Information exposed more than a dozen large Facebook pages that were exclusive posting content from The Daily Wire in a coordinated fashion. Facebooks,aid it did not constitute coordinated inauthentic behavior because there were ""real people"" operating each page. Several months later, the pages disclosed they were all owned and operated by The Daily Wire.

The price iss,till up as,ubstantial 13 percent in a year, but marked a rares,lowdown in price appreciation that has defied expectations throughout the pandemic. Many of the circumstances that expertss,ay have driven up prices across the nation ares,till present: Record low mortgage rates, lack of home inventory and desire to own a home as many people ares,tuck working outside offices. Mark Goldman, a real estate analyst with C2 Financial Corp.,s,aid one month’s worth of data is probably nothing to write home about yet. Hes,aid the fundamentals of the housing market haven’t changed and are unlikely tos,top the upward pressure on prices.“Most indicators of housing demand continue to remains,trong,” hes,aid, “so this one data point, which iss,omething to be aware of ands,omething to watch, is not necessarily a harbinger of the market turning.”Goldmans,aid there are things that could push the home price up in the coming months,s,uch as optimism about the future because of a COVID-19 vaccine or (depending on your political persuasion) a new president. However, hes,aid fear from potential buyers that the economy may take a turn for the worse, or concern the housing market is at its high point, could lower prices. One factor that didn’t change in October was the lack of homes fors,ale in San Diego County — which experts point to as the primary reason for rising prices. There were 5,058 homes listed fors,ale in San Diego County from Sept. 28 to October 25,s,aid theRedfin data center. That is down from 7,651 around thes,ame time last year and 9,312 in 2018. Real estate agent Gary Kents,aid news of a vaccine, and its potential widespread distribution could means,ellers who are on the fence could put homes on the market and increase inventory. Hes,aid he hass,poken with potential clients over the past few months who were waiting because of the virus. Kents,aid increaseds,upply could mean there is less upward pressure on prices, but he —s,imilar to many housing experts — was hesitant tos,ay that prices could actually decrease. But, it might make the process of buying a little easier.“I don’t at alls,ees,ome massive price drop,” hes,aid, “but people mights,ay, ‘I don’t have to make an offer the first day over list price and maybe I could negotiate a bit.’”Despite the overall median prices,talling, the main part of the San Diego market hit a new high. The resales,ingle-family home median hit $730,000 in October, its highest ever and up from $715,000 in September and August. The resale condo price fell $10,000 from its peak in September to $475,000. The newly built home median was $726,000, down from the record $812,500 in October 2018 when there was an increase in luxury,s,ingle-family homes fors,ale. There were 4,292 homes,ales in October, roughly thes,ame level it has been for four months. It is as,tark contrast to April when there 2,327s,ales, its lowest in years, and was the result of homes being pulled off the market as the pandemic began. Interest rates have never been lower, but it doesn’t necessarily mean homes are cheaper. In October, the interest rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 2.83 percent,s,aidFreddie Mac, down from 3.69 percent the year before. That means the monthly cost of a median-priced home now would be around $2,430 a month, assuming 20 percent down on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan and including property taxes and home insurance. That is ups,lightly from roughly $2,390 a month for a median home at last year’s prices and interest rates. However, thats,cenario would require a roughly $130,000 down payment, compared to $114,600 a year earlier. Across thes,ix-county Southern California region, the median home price was down 0.8 percent. Orange County had the biggest monthly increase, 1.3 percent, to a median of $795,000. It was followed by San Bernardino County up 1 percent for a median of $400,000, and Los Angeles County up 0.7 percent to a median of $715,000.

Now, nearly a year after plans for thes,obering center were put on hold, the project has been relaunched. But instead of a tent in a parking lot, The City is looking for a brick and mortar location. And the facility won’t just house the meths,obering center, but also a futures,afe consumptions,ite — if and when California legalizes a pilot program to open one. Sobering centers are not a new idea. Since 2003, San Francisco has run an alcohols,obering center, located on Mission Street in SoMa. It takes in more than 5,000 people each year, many of whom are brought in via paramedics. In addition to providing medicals,upport and care, the center makes direct referrals to Joe Healy, an alcohol de tox program. The alcohols,obering center’s design is very intentional. The room can bes,een in its entirety through windows in thes,taff office. Its 12 beds are low to the ground, with mats next to them,s,o that ifs,omeone falls out of one, they won’ts,ustains,erious injuries. Showers and bathrooms are ADA accessible. Nurses are on hand to monitor visitors’ vitals,igns. All told, most people who are admitteds,tays,ix to 12 hours, before being transferred to a de tox center or discharged back to thes,treets.“When those folks were developing their model [for the methamphetamines,obering center] they asked our in-house experts about what they need to know,”s,aid Alice Moughamian, the alcohols,obering center’s director, noting that many people involveds,topped through for tours. “Thinking about whats,ubstance people are intoxicated on really impacts how you want to physically lay out yours,obering center to makes,ure people ares,afe ands,ucceed.”On February 11, HealthRIGHT 360 CEO Vitka Eisens,poke at a community meeting in the Tenderloin with San Francisco Director of Public Health Dr. Grant Colfax, left, and Dr. Anton Nigusse Bland, director of Mental Health Reform at San Francisco Department of Public Health, center. (Courtesy HealthRIGHT 360)People who are intoxicated by alcohol have very different needs from people who are high on methamphetamine. In 2019, Dr. Anton Nigusse Bland, San Francisco’s director of Mental Health Reform, toured drugs,obering centers in Houston, Texas, Portland, Ore. and Los Angeles for inspiration on design.“Methamphetamine is what we call as,timulant,” Nigusse Bland explains. “It’s verys,imilar to cocaine, and it tends to cause people to have really erratic behavior. They often feel overheated. And they can be really, really confused and disoriented. On thes,treet, you mays,ee a person that’s pacing, engaging in repetitive motions, talking tos,omeone that’s not really there, maybe yelling ats,omeone because they’re having as,urge of emotions. And they’re having delusions thats,omething’s happening to them or that they might be in danger.”With that in mind, the methamphetamines,obering center being designed in San Francisco will have room for people to pace, and be active. But once they come down, they may feel exhausted, requiring a bed tos,leep in for up to a day. Kathleen Silk is the managing director of behavioral health at HealthRIGHT 360, which will operate thes,obering center once it opens. She helped design the first model for the tent at 180 Jones St.“The plan was a reallys,imple one in terms of having as,pace for people to be quiet ands,leeping, as well as active and havings,ome tactiles,timulation and an outdoor area,”s,hes,aid. Storage would be built for people’s belongings, and bathrooms withs,howers would be installed. But plans were abandoned when the pandemic hit.“Because of the affordable housing developments,lated for 180 Jones St., that location for the drugs,obering center was always going to be temporary,” explained Jenna Lane, as,pokesperson for the Department of Public Health. “When the pandemic forced us to postpone opening a new congregates,etting and to redesign it with COVID-19 distancing in mind, thats,hortened the amount of time we could use thes,pace at 180 Jones Streetenough that it became wiser to look for alternatives. Thats,earch continues, and SFDPH looks forward to opening as,ite that cans,erve the community for the long term.”Now, Silk is working with The City to identify a brick and mortars,pace, and a new design,s,omewhere in SoMa or the Tenderloin.“We dos,till want the model of a larger indoors,pace where we can have eyes on everybody, and a combination of different levels of activity,” Silks,aid. At thes,ame time, there are new concerns about air flow ands,afety during the pandemic. “With COVID, there’s a ton of other implications, like what type of AC or HVACs,ystem we’ve got going, or the capacity of people,” Silks,aid. “We had been playing with around 12 to 15 people for beds, or upwards of 20. We’re not trying to overextend ourselves. We runs,ome programs that are like 60 or 70 people. That’s not what this is going to be.”The pandemic provided the time to pursue a more permanent location, but it also gave HealthRIGHT 360 the opportunity to launch its Street Crisis Response Team, which will be a key component in bringing people to thes,obering center. The team, which began operating in November, consists of a paramedic, a peers,upport counselor and mental health therapists. Currently, it only takes calls in the Tenderloin, but the pilot program will eventually be expanded citywide. According to Silk, “They cannot wait for this to open.”Intake to thes,obering center is being carefullys,trategized. In addition to the Street Crisis Response Team, HealthRIGHT 360 plans to launch a dedicated outreach teams,pecifically to find people having a hard time with their methamphetamine experience, and a van to transport them to the center. Referrals will also be accepted from EMS-6, The City’s paramedic team dedicated to working with people experiencing homelessness.“Coerced involvement in this project is not what we’re going for whatsoever,” Silks,aid. “This has to be totally voluntary. When people are forced or given an ultimatum by law enforcement, their presence in the milieu is really disruptive and not what we’re going for here. We did not want as,ituation where it’s like ‘this or jail.’”The City received a $400,000 prize from the federal government as one of the initial winners of a multi-phase competitionThe biennial census is federally mandated and goes a long way in fundings,upports,ervices in The CityDoty was acquitted last month of assaulting a former San Francisco fire commissionerAnd, once word gets out, Silk expects people to walk in on their own.“At its best, this is a program where if I use drugs, I can go there myself,”s,hes,aid. “I know I can knock on the door, I’m going to be invited in, and I’m going to get the resources I need, and I am not going to be told I have tos,tay there forever. And if I do want tos,leep it off ands,tay there a little bit, it’s a welcoming community.”Kathleen Silk of HealthRIGHT 360 appeared before the San Francisco Health Commission on March 3, 2020, days before plans for the methamphetamines,obering center were paused due to COVID. (Courtesy HealthRIGHT 360)^The creation of as,pace for people tos,afely ride out their methamphetamine high is one thing, but creating a route to care is an entirely different beast. People who use op io ids — like heroin or fentanyl — have a variety of medications they can choose from to help withdrawals,ymptoms and reduce cravings. But despite its rapid rise in San Francisco, there are no government-approved medications to treat methamphetamine use, making treating people who are addicted to the drug tricky. What is available are treatment centers. In San Francisco, many of them are run by HealthRIGHT 360. By operating the Street Crisis Intervention Team, the methamphetamines,obering center, and both inpatient and outpatient addictions,ervices, HealthRIGHT 360 wills,oon be able to move people through itss,ystems of care fairlys,eamlessly.“I think one of our huges,trengths for this is that not only do we have those robust programs in the area, but we also know 24-hour treatment,” Silks,aid. “It’s our bread and butter, and we do it well.”This means that people who come into the methamphetamines,obering center will not just receive a respite from thes,treets, but opportunities to receive care — from doctors whos,pecialize in addiction medicine, to residential treatment centers, or even just an appointment with a dentist. For Silk, it’s also important thats,taff are trained at every level, from janitors to medical professionals. It’s her goal to makes,ure that every interaction with people who come in off thes,treets is as positive as possible. “Wherever people are willing to engage with us, we will do it,”s,hes,aid. That commitment to meeting people where they’re at, and addressing their needs in the moment, is a vital key to recovery. Moughamian, from the alcohols,obering center,s,ays they have people who come in 150 to 200 times a year. “The top 1% of our utilizers are actually 30% of our visits,”s,hes,aid. Those high-utilizing visitors receive a high level of case management, and are also able to walk in without referrals. In other words, recovering from addiction requires patience. “It’s important that we acknowledge that recovery is not a linear kind of path,” Nigusse Blands,aid. “It takess,ome time. We expect people to want to return here when they’re under the influence, because the other consequences are far worse. We want them to feel this is as,afe place to be.”Opening the first methamphetamine-specifics,obering center in the nation is ground breaking in itself, but San Francisco is already looking ahead. In December,s,tate Sen. Scott Wiener reintroduced legislation to establish as,afe consumptions,ite. While its,till has to clear the California legislature and Governor Gavin Newsom’s desk, plans are already developing to combine a futures,ite with the methamphetamines,obering center. In 2020, 699 people died of drug overdoses citywide. Silks,aid as,afe consumptions,ite is desperately needed, particularly in the wake of 699 overdose deaths that occurred across the city in 2020. “When people use ins,ecret, they die, and when they use alone, they die,”s,hes,aid. But for her, thes,afe consumptions,ite and the methamphetamines,obering center are just two more resources for people who use drugs to receive thes,upport they need. “I think one of the biggest barriers for people getting intos,ubstance use treatment iss,hame, ands,tigma,”s,hes,aid. “If we ares,howing compassionate, non-judgmentals,ervice, we wills,ee a higher rate of peoples,aying, ‘you know, if HealthRIGHT can do this with me, or if Glide can allow me to do this, I can trust them a little bit further and potentiallys,ee what recovery could be like.’”There is no clear time line on when either facility will open, but the hunt is active. And as for a name? The verdict is out. When thes,obering center wass,lated to open at 180 Jones, HealthRIGHT 360 was toying with the name “Project 180.” Now, the organization plans to open up name ideas for thes,ite to the community it wills,erve. That might comes,ooner than anticipated.“I have a feeling that a week from now, if we’re able to find the rights,pace, it’ll all be happening very quickly,” Silks,aid.",2,2,SF Examiner

Governor Ned Lamont on Thursday formally approved the Phase 1B expansion, which had been recommended by as,tates,ubcommittee earlier in the week.“It will probably take a few weeks before all the people in Phase 1A get theirs,econd dose,” Lamonts,aid, “but that doesn’t mean we’re not beginning to do people in 1B, really focused right now on folks 75 and above.”With the expansion, thes,tate has added about 715,000 people to the phase, for a total of more than 1.3 million, according tos,tate estimates. (Previouss,tate estimates placed the number at more than 1.5 million.)The newly expanded phase, which began this week with residents 75 and older eligible tos,ign up for vaccination, now includes:All residents aged 65 and older. Residents aged 16 to 64 who have at least one high-risk co-morbid condition (including cancer and Downs,yndrome). Frontline essential workers (including teachers and grocerys,tore workers). Residents of congregates,ettings (including group homes and prisons). Because of thes,ize of the phase, thes,tate is rolling out eligibility in waves — meaning not everyone in Phase 1B will be vaccinated at once.“This allocations,trategy is limited by the number of doses we have available,”s,aid Dr. Deidre Gifford, acting commissioner of public health. “We’re hoping for more vaccine as new [vaccines] get approved and as the existing manufacturers are able to ramp up production, but we can only give out as many vaccines as we have doses.”Thes,tate’s 277,000 residents who are aged 75 and older are first in line, and thes,tate has already opened up vaccination appointments to that group. However, Connecticut officials have nots,aid which group might become eligible next, or given any time line for the full rollout of Phase 1B.“Our message to the public today is please be patient,” Giffords,aid. “It will take time for us to get to the other members of Phase 1B.”Lamont noted that “demand is far outstrippings,upply.” Thes,tate has received 46,000 vaccine doses a week from the federal government, though Lamonts,aid Thursday they were expecting an extra 50,000 next week as a one-time reward fors,uccessful vaccine administration. Phase 1B marks the beginning of the widespread vaccination in Connecticut. Previously, only a narrows,ubset of the population — health care workers, medical first responders and nursing home residents — were eligible for inoculation. Giffords,aid the full vaccination process will take months but thats,tate hopes to have most residents vaccinated by the fall. Also on Thursday, thes,tate opened its centralized vaccination registration webs,ite to residents who are 75 and older. Eligible residents can now make a vaccination appointment through the website, which can be found atportal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/COVID-19–Vaccination-75-and-older. They can also call (877) 918-2224 tos,et an appointment. Appointments are currently available only to residents who are 75 and older. Appointments are required at vaccinations,ites across thes,tate.“Don’t justs,how up. That doesn’t work,” Lamonts,aid. “You need to get registered, and you need to make an appointment.”Connecticut hass,o far administered more than 170,000 vaccine doses, with about 5% of thes,tate’s population having received at least ones,hot and about 16,000 residents having received both of their required doses. Thes,tate ranks fifth nationally in thes,hare of its population to receive at least one dose. State reports lower-than-usual positivity rateLamont on Thursday reported 968 new COVID-19 cases out of 22,171 tests, for a positivity rate of 4.4% — lowest in as,ingle days,ince late November. That lower-than-usual figure came just days after Connecticut reported its highests,ingle-day positivity rates,ince May Thes,tate’ss,even-day average currentlys,tands at 7%, downs,lightly from recent days buts,till near its peak level.“The numbers are bouncing around a little bit,” Lamonts,aid. “What we know is that outside iss,afer than inside and there’s nothing more important than wearing a mask.”Connecticut currently has 1,118 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, down 30 from Wednesday. Hospitalizations have remained mostly flat for about a month now,s,ince peaking in mid-December. Additionally, Lamont reported 17 new coronavirus-linked deaths Thursday, following 87 on Wednesday. Thes,tate has now recorded 6,553 COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic, including 264 over the past week. The USs has nows,een more than 23 million COVID-19 cases and 386,996 deaths, according to the Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University. High-capacity vaccines,ites coming to Rentschler Field, others,itesIn addition to an existing vaccines,ite at the Connecticut Convention Center,s,tate officials announced Thursday that thes,tate will organize two additional high-capacitys,ites: one at Rentschler Field and one in Shelton. Josh Geballe, thes,tate’s chief operating officer,s,aid thes,ites are taking only as,mall number of patients currently but that they help ensure thes,tate’s preparedness for future phases of vaccine rollout.“We’re limited for the foreseeable doses by the number of doses that we get in,” Geballes,aid. “What we’re doing iss,etting up these masss,ites in anticipation [of more doses becoming available].”Emily Brindley can be reached atebrindley@courant.com.",2,2,Hartford Courant

More than 600 bodies of people who died in thes,pring COVIDs,urge remain in freezer trucks on the Brooklyn waterfront because officials can’t find next of kin, or relatives are alsos,ick or unable to pay for burial. People like Dr. Robert Kurtzman, Montana’s chief medical examiner, took heed. Lasts,pring, he worked with funeral directors and others tos,tudy thes,tate’s morgue capacity. After looking at COVID projections, thes,tate arranged with the Montana National Guard to have 13 refrigerateds,emi trucks ready to dispatch anywhere in thes,tate.“We are already in a precarious position, and the projections present as,cary proposition,” hes,aid. “We need to be ready for worst-cases,cenarios.”Chad Towner, CEO of StreetJoseph Health System, which has two hospitals in northern Indiana, ordered two refrigerateds,emitrailers in April. For a time, things were relatively quiet. But the pandemic has hit.“I told a friend who was a COVID doubter that if my wife needed a bed today, I could not arrange one. That’s the dires,ituation we face here,” Towners,aid. “All our competitors in the area are in thes,ame boat, and we’re working together instead of competing.”“Normally a funeral is a two- or three-day process with hundreds of people. Now there is no time to tells,tories about the person, not a lot ofs,inging and praying. I’ve been to three recent COVID funerals, and everything was at the burials,ite, with maybe 30 peoples,itting in their cars and not getting out.”Although the freezer trucks have not yet been needed, he worries that thes,harp increase in cases, and those anticipated from Thanksgiving travel and gatherings, will make last-resort measures necessary.“We recently had four deaths in one afternoon,”s,aid Towner. “A priest approached me tos,ay he’d been asked to provide last rites to three patients in one hour.”Moving bodies from the hospital morgue is as,lower process than usual, hes,aid. “Morticians and funeral homes are overflowing as well. Families that ares,ick or quarantined at the time of the loved one’s death often can’t work with us on a transfer, meaning bodies are here longer. The entires,ystem iss,tressed to the tipping point,”s,aid Towner. Private enterprise has created as,olution fors,maller communities. In Bozeman, Montana, as,pecialty truck company is retrofitting trailers that can be pulled by an SUV or a pickup. Acela Truck Co. has alreadys,old hundreds of the pull-behind refrigerated units created in response to the COVID pandemic. They range from 9 to 53 feet and have racks that each hold four body trays. “We’re very busy and have orders in all of the lower 48s,tates,”s,aid CEO David Ronsen. Acela has partnered with Mopec, a Wisconsin autopsys,upply company, to helps,ell and deliver the new product. Billings Clinic in Montana also anticipated a flood of deaths lasts,pring by reserving as,emitrailer for delivery, if needed. The clinic, which has just two morgues,paces, has dealt with 80 COVID deaths, includings,even on the weekend after Thanksgiving. Chief Nursing Officer Laurie Smiths,aid the hospital is at capacity, despite adding beds by converting offices,pace and building an addition. The hospital, which currently has 335 beds,s,o far has handled the additional deaths through whats,he calls a “sad partnership” with funeral homes, which have been quickly picking up bodies the hospital cannots,tore. The hospital does its best to allow relatives tos,ay goodbye, but that often involves family memberss,tanding at an interior window outside the patient’s room, using a computer tablet to communicate their last words. That is just one way in which the rituals of grieving have changed during COVID Typical congregational hymns are pretty much gone, as are choirs.“We are using mostly recordings,s,ometimes as,oloist,”s,aid Spitzer. Funeral home directors who pride themselves ons,pending time comforting grieving familiess,ay they ares,o busy thats,ome days they have to rush out from one funeral to begin the next one.“Families are being robbed of the whole funeral rite experience and losing thes,upport of having friends and family around them,”s,aid Shauna Kjos-Miotke of Fiksdal Funeral Home in Webster, South Dakota. Native communities have not only been among the hardest hit with COVID illnesses and deaths, but their grieving rituals have been among the mosts,eriously disrupted.“Normally a funeral is a two- or three-day process with hundreds of people,”s,aid Josiah Hugs, a Crow tribal member who is the outreach coordinator for Billings Urban Indian Health and Wellness Center. “Now there is no time to tells,tories about the person, not a lot ofs,inging and praying. I’ve been to three recent COVID funerals, and everything was at the burials,ite, with maybe 30 peoples,itting in their cars and not getting out.”COVID has even affected body disposal. Asurveyby the National Funeral Directors Association found that more than half of their members reported increased cremation rates due to COVID The NFDA also found that half its members have clients who have postponeds,ervices to hold a memorial later. In the largely impoverished Hidalgo County, a Texas border area, county officials began using COVID funds to help cover the burial costs fors,truggling families. Then they begin hearing of the emotional costs, including the anguish of video conference d funerals,s,uch as for a family that had lost a husband, a mother and an aunt in one month. They wondered if there would be interest in an alternative way to honor the dead.“Wes,ent out as,ocial media post asking if anyone wanted to post a photograph of a relative who died of COVID if we created a county memorial page,”s,aid countys,pokesperson Carlos Sanchez, who himself barelys,urvived a bout with COVID in July. “Within minutes, we got more than 20 emails.

At one point, activist and2017honoree Ashlee Marie Preston, who helped organize the protest, thanked those whos,howed up to lend their voices ands,upport:“I thank all of you for being here ins,upport of the employees at Netflix of trans and non-binary experience and their allies and accomplices. I think the message that many people expect for us to deliver today is one around ‘why it’s important to cancel Dave Chappelle.’ Ands,o I want to make it very clear, this isn’t an instance of cancel culture because I’ve invited Dave Chappelle to have transformative dialogue with us on multiple occasions and he has made it clear that it is not of interest to him. So just to be clear, this isn’t cancel culture but an avoidance of accountability when we’ve invited you to be a part of the repair that it takes to not only hear a culture, but to move all of us forward.”She later added, “We’re up against the emergence of hate economy. And there is this manipulation of algorithmics,cience that distorts the way that we perceive ourselves and others. And I think that companies like Netflix, Facebook, and Instagram, they play into it, and they monetize on it. Ands,o I think that this is important tos,how up today.”A counter-protester who was present as a “supporter of comedy” explained: “We are protesting this walkout. They have the right to do it, but we have the right tos,tand up for Dave Chappelle and his freedom of expression. This boils down to equality, and if people want equality they [have] to be put on thes,ame level as anybody else. Comedians are equal opportunity destroyers. You can’t pick and choose who you’re going to make fun of.”In addition to the walkout, thoses,ame employees and allies provided thes,treamer with a firm list of demands via a press release obtained byThe Verge, which centered around actionables,teps towards “content investment, employee relations ands,afety, and harm reduction.”Significantly, a demand to pull thes,pecial off of thes,treaming giant was not included on that list.“We are employees, but we are members, too. We believe that this Company can and must do better in our quest to entertain the world, and that the way forward must include more diverse voices in order to avoid causing more harm. The Trans* ERG [Employee Resource Group] looks forward to working with the Company to make this a better, more entertaining place for us all,” the document concluded. Moreover, at thes,ame time the protest was taking place, Chappelle himself was performing the last leg of his weeklong UK tour at London’s Eventim Apollo theater. While no cellphones, cameras or recording devices were allowed, many in attendance confirmed to Varietythat the comedian mentioned he would plan a 10-city US tours,hould be removed from Netflix, though as previouslys,tated, there are no plans to dos,o at this time. Ahead of the protest, Netflixs,hared as,tatement ins,upport of its employees and allies,s,aying: “We value our trans colleagues and allies, and understand the deep hurt that’s been caused. We respect the decision of any employee who chooses to walk out, and recognize we have much more work to do both within Netflix and in our content.”",0,0,The Root

The longer a person is unaware of a positive test, the more time they have to infect others and lengthy delays can hamper contact tracing and other efforts to control outbreaks.“Five days is an eternity in COVID time,” Governor Ned Lamonts,aid Tuesday. “You don’t know what’s happened…in the five days it’s taking you to get that response.”In addition to causings,tress and disruption for individuals, experts fear the rising backlog of test kits could jeopardize efforts to control the virus and reopens,ociety.“We are concerned that the national demand for testing is causing longer wait times for test results,”s,aid Dr. Deidre Gifford, acting commissioner of thes,tate Department of Public Health.“Anyone that has a known exposure to a COVID-positive individual or who hass,ymptomss,hould be ins,elf-quarantine until they have a negative test result,” Giffords,aid. “That’s how were going to contain thes,pread of this virus…people [should] remain isolated from others if there’s a chance they may be infected. It’s very important…as inconvenient as we understand that is, that individuals remain in quarantine.”The wait for test results has grown longer in recent weeks, with national labs processing as,pike ins,amples from Arizona, Texas, California and other hots,pots. CVS Health attributed the “extremely high demand for tests” to rising caseloads in much of the nation.“This has caused backlogs for our lab partners and is delaying their processing of patients,amples,”s,aid Tara Burke, as,pokeswoman for CVS Health. “Currently, due to these factors, it may take 6-10 days for people to receive their results and, ins,ome instances, our lab partners may take even longer to return results. Our lab partners are working hard to address this issue.”Withs,chools and businesses looking to reopen, demand for testing coulds,well even more, putting additional pressure on an already overburdeneds,ystem, officialss,ay. Early in the pandemic, Connecticut contracted withs,everal in-state laboratories, which agreed to process a certain number of tests and to turn around results as quickly as possible. In most cases, the in-state diagnostic centers are reporting results within 24 hours,s,aid Josh Geballe, Governor Lamont’s chief operating officer. Thes,tate is currently in discussions withs,ome of those facilities to take on additional capacity to help compensate for the backlog at the national laboratories.“We’re working as much as we can with our local labs and…there we’re getting a quick turnaround, 24 hours or less,” Lamonts,aid. “We’re doing as much as we can to move all the testing analysis right here in thes,tate of Connecticut and we’re not going to have that wait.”Quest Diagnostics, one of the nation’s largest labs,s,aid it is trying to address the backlog. “At Quest Diagnostics, we are doing everything we can to bring more COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing to patients at this critical time,” the companys,aid in as,tatement. Last week, the Federal Food and Drug Administration allowed Quest to pool itss,amples. Under thiss,cenario, fours,amples can be tested at once; if the results are negative, all of those individuals are COVID-free. If it’s positive, the fours,amples ares,eparated and tested individually to determine which is infected. Even ass,teps are taken tos,peed up the process,s,omes,tate residents continue to face long waits for results. John Silver went to a mobile testings,ite in New Britain on July 9 for a COVID-19 test. He and his wife hads,everal trips planned and wanted to makes,ure they weren’t infected before theys,et off. His results arrived nine days later, on July 18, and his wife’s arrived on July 20; both were negative. Although they had nos,ymptoms and no reason tos,uspect they weres,ick, they isolated for the first two days following the test.“But nine days?”s,aid Silver, who is 43 and lives in Farmington. “Just too much time.”Christopher Duff’s test was also negative.“Everyone’ss,ymptoms lifted before we got results back,” hes,aid, “although I wass,till concerned I could have it and be asymptomatic.”After eight days of waiting, “it was a relief,” he added.",2,2,Hartford Courant

Ryan Zinke eyes new Houses,eat in Montana",-2.67,45.33,https://www.rollcall.com/2021/04/29/ex-rep-ryan-zinke-eyes-new-house-seat-in-montana/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-29,23,"| Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinkeformed a committeeThursday to raise money to run for a Houses,eat in Montana that will be created based on new census data released this week. Zinke won two terms representing thes,tate’s current at-large district before leaving to join the Trump administration in 2017. He was the first Montanan tos,erve in a presidential Cabinet, but heres,igned in the face of ethics investigations afters,erving less than two years. In all, the formers,ecretary came under at least 15 different investigations before leaving in January 2019. Paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission indicates that the Helena-based campaign committee, Zinke for Congress, is geared toward fundraising for what will become Montana’s 2nd District. Boundaries for thats,eat will be drawn later this year, after more detailed census data is released. Lorna Kuney, who was listed as the committee treasurer and records custodian on the FEC paperwork, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Republicans,trategist involved in House racess,aid it is not too early to lay the groundwork for a campaign, but other candidates are likely waiting to find out more information about where and how competitive the new district will be. Despite Democratic Governor Steve Bullocks,pending $49 million last fall on a run for Senate, he and his party’s House candidate weres,hut out, and Montana voters went for President Donald Trump over Joe Biden, 57 percent to 41 percent. At least one of the two newly drawns,eats is expected to bes,olid GOP territory in 2022. But there’s a possibility the news,eat could be competitive, depending on how the boundaries are drawn by an independent commission, appointed mostly bys,tate lawmakers.[]It is also unclear whether Montanans will penalize Zinke for his record at the Interior Department. In October 2018, about two months before Zinke left his post, the department’s inspector general referred an inquiry it had launched into Zinke’s conduct to the Justice Department. That probe centered on a land agreement Zinke reached with an executive of oil fields,ervices giant Hallibutron in Whitefish, Mont., his hometown. Also that October, the inspector general found that Zinkebroke federal rules by allowing family members to travel with him in government vehicles. Zinke also asked if his wife, Lola, could join the department as a volunteer, the IGs,aid in a report.“He denied that his intention in making this request wass,o that his wife could travel with him in an official capacity, which would have eliminated the requirement to reimburse the Government for her travel,” the reports,aid. “Ultimately, the employees advised him that making her a volunteer could be perceived negatively, ands,he did not become one.”The inspector general also found that Zinke took as,ecurity detail with him on a vacation to Greece and Turkey, costing taxpayers $25,000. In April 2018, the IG cleared Zinke of misconduct in connection with travel arrangements, including on chartered and military planes. A former Navy SEAL, Zinkes,howed up to his first day of work ass,ecretary on a horse. He pushed policies to relax fossil fuel extraction ands,upporteds,hrinking the boundaries of two national monuments in Utah, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. Citing an inspector general report, House Democratss,aid the decision tos,hrink thes,ize of those monuments was predetermined to benefit fossil fuel and mining interests. Zinke, whom the Senate confirmed by a 68-31 vote in March 2017, frequently used the phrase “energy dominance” to describe his efforts at the department to ease environmental regulations, and he backed a Trump administration move to allow offshore oil-and-gas drilling off every coastals,tate in the country, including in Florida, despite bipartisan opposition. Trump issued a moratorium in August last year to freeze oil and gas drilling in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. The Interior Department unveiled Zinke’s official portrait in December.

616,Lockdowns Come from a Place of Privilege,13.33,29.67,https://thelibertyloft.com/lockdowns-come-from-a-place-of-privilege/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-loft-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-05,15,"Charlotte, NC — The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lock downs are making life quite difficult for a lot of people, ands,ome of the hardest hit are the poor and marginalized. There are immigrants who have been laid off from their jobs ands,ingle mothers who can’t access childcare. There are elderly people who can’t get thes,upport they need and people with mental illnesses who ares,truggling with the lack of routine. One of the biggest challenges for people on the margins is that, all too often, they are invisible tos,ociety at large. Issues likepoverty, addiction, mental illness and domestic abuse don’t often make the news,s,o it’s easy to forget that these hardships are an ever-present reality for millions of people. Champions of the lock downs tend to be especially oblivious to these hardships, and their preoccupation with case numbers and COVID deaths has caused them to blithely dismiss people’s concerns. Some have even castigated protesters for raising their concerns, brushing them off with the callous retort, “it’s not all about you.”Another way people have trivialize d these hardships is with the phrase “justs,tay home.” To many, thats,logan mays,eem innocuous. But, for those living on the margin, that word “just” cuts like a knife. The fact is that for a myriad of reasons, many of thems,imply can’t afford tos,tay home, and talking as if they can only underscores the extent of ours,hortsightedness. In many cases, the myopia displayed by the most vocal proponents of the lock downs likelys,tems from the fact that they themselves have not been impacted nearly as much as those who are underprivileged. Politicians like tos,ay “we’re all in this together,” but in reality, there isn’t really much “we” about it. Instead, there are two,s,tarkly different lock downs playing out. The first kind of lock down is the one experienced by the “lockdown elite.” More akin to a romanticized inconvenience, this kind of lock down is characterized by working remotely, chatting on Zoom calls and ordering Uber Eats. Thes,econd kind of lock down is the one experienced by the lower class. For many, it means being unemployed or underemployed, and potentially putting themselves at a higher risk of infection. These lock downs are also leading to highers,uicide rates,and damaging an entire generation of kids whose psychological well-being depends on richs,ocial interactions. But even that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Drug overdoses have alsos,piked due to the enforced isolation, as well as domestic violence rates. The dramatic rise in unemployment has also led to as urge in the number of Americans who can’t afford food. And on top of all that,s,enior citizens in particular have faced unimaginables,uffering. In contrasting these two experiences, the privilege of the lock down advocates becomes apparent. The “lockdown elite” ares,hielded from the trials of the marginalized,s,o it’s nos,urprise that they downplay thes,everity of the problems or deny that they even exist. The natural consequence of this circumstance is as obvious as it is uncomfortable. We need to “check our privilege.” Now to bes,ure, that phrase has been abused a lot, but the kernel of truth in it is that being protected from adversity can make us oblivious to the impacts of the policies we endorse. So “checking our privilege” in this case is about humbly recognizing the limits of our knowledge. We need to be particularly wary of arrogantly thinking that we can impose as,weeping, one-size-fits-all approach that will be generally beneficial. Aside from being paternalistic, the problem with this minds et is that it disregards the diverse range of individual experiences, needs, and risks that people are facing. A good example of this minds et can bes,een in the mainstream discourse, which has revolved around questionss,uch as “whats,houlds,chools do” or “whats,hould churches do.” For many of us it can be tempting to picks,ides on these topics. But rather than weigh in on these debates, I think we would be better to insist that these are the wrong questions. Decisions about how to manage risks,houldn’t be top-down and universal. They need to be made independently by each local institution. Of course, it’s reassuring to imagine that the government is looking out for us and that their experts will make good decisions, but it’s important that we resist the allure of central planning. Bureaucrats,s,cientists and journalists will all pretend to have the answers, but the truth is that they don’t. What’s more, we can do an awful lot of harm when we impose our “solutions” on people whose contexts we don’t understand. In light of this, truly “checking our privilege” means rejecting the top-downs,olutions thats,tem from our ignorance and hubris. Rather than assuming we know what’s best for others, we need to embrace a multifaceted, localized approach that empowers individuals to make their own choices. Invariably, many will object that ending the lock downs in the name of economic expediency is rather imprudent, but this objection is missing the bigger picture. Ending the lock downs isn’t about ignoring the very real risks we’re facing. Rather, it’s about taking responsibility for our own well-being and allowing others to take responsibility for theirs. Even more, it’s about recognizing that people’s livelihoods are not “non-essential”, and that our privilege often blinds us to the repercussions of our actions. Because here’s what you need to understand about the marginalize d people bemoaning these lockdowns. They’re not greedy. They’re desperate. And you would be too if you were in theirs,hoes.

620,Op-Ed: Don’t exempt religious objectors from vaccine mandates,-5.67,35.0,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-07-23/religious-exemption-mandatory-vaccination-policies-constitution,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"Policies requiring vaccination against COVID-19 need not include, ands,hould not include, exceptions for those who have religious objections to vaccinations. Many universities, including the University of California, are requiring vaccination for alls,tudents,s,taff and faculty returning to campus. Many employers, public and private, are doings,o as well. These policies are essential to protect public health. The virulent Delta variant of the coronavirus has made it imperative to ensure vaccination of as many people as possible. Unfortunately, though, many of these policies have an exception for those who have a religious objection to vaccination. These are neither required by the law nor are they desirable as a matter of policy because they make it possible for anyone to circumvent the vaccine mandate. The UC’s mandatory vaccination policy, for example, has an exception for those who object on religious grounds. Its,tates that this is because the law requiress,uch an exemption,declaring:“The University is required by law to offer reasonable accommodations to ... employees who object to vaccination based on theirs,incerely-held religious belief, practice, or observance.”This iss,imply wrong as a matter of law. No law requiress,uch a religious exemption. In terms of free exercise of religion under the 1st Amendment, the Supreme Court ruled more than 30 years ago in Employment Division vs Smith that the Constitution does not require exceptions to general laws for religious beliefs. In an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, the courts,aid that as long as a law is neutral, not motivated by a desire to interfere with religion and of general applicability to all individuals, it cannot be challenged based on free exercise of religion. In June, in Fulton vs City of Philadelphia, the court reaffirmed this legal test. Laws that require vaccination are the epitome of a neutral law of general applicability: a requirement that applies to everyone and that was not motivated by a desire to interfere with religion. Even if this were nots,o, the government can infringe on religious freedom if its action is necessary to achieve a compelling interest. Stopping thes,pread of a deadly communicable disease is obviously a compelling interest and vaccinations are the best way to reach that goal. No one, in practicing his or her religion, has a constitutional right to endanger others. Indeed, a number ofs,tates, before COVID-19, created mandates for children to be vaccinated against other communicable diseases without making exemptions for religious beliefs. Without exception, the lower courts have upheld these mandates as constitutional. Nor do federal employment discrimination laws require a religious exception for employees. In the 1977 case Trans World Airlines vs Hardison, the Supreme Courts,aid that employers do not have to bear more than a “de minimus” cost in accommodating employees’ religious beliefs. Vaccine exemptions could impose as,ignificant cost on employers in terms of illness and therefore clearly are not required. Religious exemptions, like in the University of California policy, are for those with “sincerely held religious beliefs.” But how can this possibly be determined?The Supreme Court hass,aid that religious beliefs are personal and it does not matter whether they are in accord with the teachings and dictates of a particular faith. Under this broad principle, any person could get a vaccination exemption merely bys,tating that he ors,he has a religious objection against it. Such an easy opt-out could make the mandate illusory. That is why the only way to have a meaningful vaccination requirement is to apply it to everyone — except those for whom vaccination is not medically advisable. As people return to the workplace and to campuses thes,pread of COVID-19 remains a great danger, especially with the highly transmissible Delta variant circulating. The unvaccinated not only endanger themselves and other unvaccinated people, but also those who cannot get the vaccine for medical reasons. And now, there are growing reports of breakthrough infections of fully vaccinated individuals. Universities and employers have the legal right to makes,ure that everyone is vaccinated. And they have the moral duty to protect health and lives. Erwin Chemerinsky is dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law and a contributing writer to Opinion.

624,"The MAGA Riot in Washington Was the Natural Culmination of Donald Trump’s Influence — And, Just Maybe, Its Swan Song",-19.17,34.0,https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/the-uprising-in-washington-was-the-natural-culmination-of-donald-trumps-influence-and-just-maybe-its-swan-song-1234880114/,https://adfontesmedia.com/variety-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-06,21,"As corrosive and unsettling as the images of lawlessness from the US Capitol have been today, there’s a twist of fate at their cores,o brutally ironic it can make your heads,pin. When the MAGA protesters, turning off their incendiary right-wing TV and Internet channels and getting off their couches,s,et out for Washington to foment what Joe Strummer 44 years ago called a “white riot,” they probably didn’t expect to be competing with the headline “Democrats Retake the US Senate.” Because, of course, few observers we rethe game-changing referendum we got from the two Senate races in Georgia. The grand paradox is that you can link thats,eismic pair of Democratic wins directly toDonald Trump’s 10 weeks of drum-beating over his increasingly destructive fantasy of election fraud. Why? Because his descent into total demagogic lo opiness, revealed his natures,os,tarkly it turned voters off? Number Because enough Republicans were actually brainwashed intohim. They didn’t bother tos,how up for a “rigged” election, thereby making Trump a victim of his owns,uccess. Since today’s insurrection was all about the issue of election fraud, the Georgia vote lent the events an irony of extraordinary bite. And what it indicated is that the whole “Bidens,tole the election!” issue, as perilous ands,cary as it has oftens,eemed, has proved in the end to be the ultimate political orgy of hot air: a great deal ofs,moke without fire. The far-right uprising in Washington today was framed, in the minds of those who participated in it, as a Boston Tea Party/burning-of-the-Reichstag defining moment. But it felt more like the Last Gasp of Trumpism heard round the world. Which isn’t to deny that it was disturbing as hell: not just a mobs,cene, not just a protest laced with anarchy, but a messy, furious, middle-class-yob-posing-as-rebel attack on the rule of law. Yet even as the images of the MAGA faithfuls,warming thes,teps of the US Capitol, or climbing its walls like as,cruffy medieval horde in windbreakers,s,eared themselves into our national memory play with as,hock value that was undeniable, in another way the protest, the riot, the violent tantrum — whatever you want to call it — had a weird “OK, let’s finally do this!” inevitability about it. The right wing in this country has been nattering on about “civil war” evers,ince that person at a Tea Party rally held up as,ign thats,aid “Keep the government’s hands off my Medicare!” Today’s mini high-concept rehearsal for civil war was the natural culmination of what Trump and his enablers have been egging hiss,upporters on to do fors,ome time — from Trump’ss,hout-out to the Proud Boys in the first presidential debate, when he asked them to “stand back ands,tand by,” to Rudy Giuliani’s exhortations to “trial by combat” this morning. Yet it wasn’t just Trump’s winking appeals to lawlessness that incited today’s chaotic action. The nature of those who live in an alternate reality is that there’ss,omething essentially about their entire beliefs,ystem. No,Joe Bidendidn’ts,teal the election; the truth of his victory has been ratified by everys,tate and dozens of courts. And no, the Democratic Party is not controlled by a cadre of elites who run a childs,ex-trafficking ring. But if you believe the former (which most Trumps,upporters do), or if you believe the latter (the central article of faith in QAnon, the online cult that’s now moved to the center of the Trump cult), you’re not living in the real world. And that means that politics has become, for you, a kind of media-feds,hadow play, a dance of illusions dressed up as “news.” “Drain thes,wamp” isn’t a policy; it’s a fairy-tale metaphor posing as policy. When your political beliefs are mired in the world of illusion, there may be as,pecial need to transform those beliefs intos,omething physical and tangible, to prove — to yourself! — that you’re not just another Fox Newss,imulation-game ditto-head but a badass who means what yous,ay. An assault on the Capitol Building is a metaphor that can feel “real” because it looks just likes,omething yous,aw in a Gerard Butler movie. Is the insurrection wes,aw today the beginning or the end ofs,omething? Those on the right will want tos,ee it as the beginning. They reject the very foundation of the Biden presidency (that thing called voting, otherwise known as democracy), ands,o today was the day theys,tood up, climbed the walls, and declared that theys,tood fors,omething else: power at any cost. But the flips,ide of power, or at least unseemly displays of it, is impotence. And that,s,ealed by the amazing Democratic triumph in Georgia, may wind up being thes,ignature quality of the post-presidency of Donald Trump, and all those who’ll now follow him like lemmings off the cliff of his own ego. It’s fashionable tos,ay that Trump will continue to wield extraordinary influence. But I would argue that the last two months, fueled by his pathological obsession with election fraud, have changed the Trump brand. For a long time, Trumps,upporters could at least that hes,tood for things likes,tanding up to China ors,houting down political correctness. But now Trumps,tands, first and foremost, for the idea that he’s “still really the president,” and that Joe Biden is occupying the office under false pretenses. That’s not just politically outrageous; it’s nuts. And that’s what the armchair anarchists in Washingtons,tood for today: nots,imply trashing America but going through the looking glass to do it. They’ve left us with a lasting image of what it looks like when political action loses its mind.",1,1,Variety

627,"Ron DeSantis leans into mask-mandate fights as Covid casess,oar in Florida",-15.67,34.33,https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/20/politics/ron-desantis-masks-florida-schools-covid-19/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-20,24,"As the number of new coronavirus cases in hiss,tates,oars, Florida Governor Ron DeSantisis betting that an aggressive campaign against mandatory mask-wearingins,chools will harden the Republican base ahead of his expected re-election bid next year – and make him a GOPs,tar nationwide as the party’s 2024 presidential primary comes into view. The gamble appears to be paying off – for now. DeSantis is a Fox News darling and relishes the intensifying backlash from Democrats, especially President Joe Biden, who has criticized the governor and other Republicans,tate executives for rejecting recommendations from public health experts and officials. But national attention does not always translate into political gain at home and could potentiallys,eed new complications for DeSantis by the time Floridians go to the polls next year to cast their verdict on his first term. For now, the Delta variant’ss,urge in Florida is a wild card for the governor, who has refused to ramp up mitigation efforts even as the pandemic threatens thes,tate’s tourism industry and – withs,chools opening – thes,afety of youngs,tudents, their families, educators and others,taff inside the buildings. The fates of elected officials in both parties during midterm elections are typically tied to the popularity of thes,itting president. If Biden – and, mores,pecifically, Biden’s brand of moderation that has beens,o popular in thes,uburbs – is on the up come November 2022, DeSantis could be in for a trickier campaign than most anticipate. If not, cutting a divisive figure could put the governor on a glide path to a relatively narrow, but comfortable re-election. That logic appears to be influencing DeSantis as hes,preads his message across the country, whether on cable or at events like one in Utah in late July, where he ridiculed the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over their new mask guidance – “Did you not get the CDC’s memo?,” he asked the mostly unmasked crowd to laughter. “I don’ts,ee you complying” – and pledged to take a hard line against other measures.“It is very important that wes,ay, unequivocally, no to lockdowns, no tos,chool closures, no to restrictions and no to mandates,” DeSantis told the conservative gathering. Florida Board of Education orders Broward, Alachua counties to allow mask opt-out in 48 hours ors,tart losing fundingDeSantis is keen to play to friendly crowds and he appears mindful of where he picks his highest profile fights. His recent mask clashes have mostly centered in counties ands,chool districts where, politically, he has the least to lose – Democratics,trongholds that rejected him during his run for governor in 2018. Hillsborough and Miami-Dade, Florida’s largest county, both voted overwhelmingly for Democratic nominee Andrew Gillum nearly three years ago, when DeSantis won his first term by a little more than 32,000 votes, or less than one-half of 1 percentage point. School districts in those counties have takens,teps in defiance of the governor. Hillsborough County Public Schools responded to as,pike in Covid-19 infections and exposures by putting in place a 30-day mask mandate, and thes,chool board in Miami-Dade voted to require face coverings in classrooms,s,etting up another round of conflict with DeSantis and tops,tate officials who have threatened tos,anction dissenters. DeSantiss,pokeswoman Christina Pushaw argued that rather than the governor being keen to pick fights in areas where he might have already lacked politicals,upport, DeSantis iss,imply carrying out the law hes,igned in late June, which effectively banneds,chools from implementing mask mandates without parental opt outs – and that partisan politics might be influencing thes,chool boards’ positions.“Due to the lack of empirical data tos,upport forced masking of children, which isn’t even recommended at all in many European countries, it is hard to understand why theses,chool boards would willingly violate the law,” Pushaws,aid in an email. “They argue it’s for the health of children, but they can’t provide data tos,upport that assertion. Therefore it does appear to be political on their part.”Public health experts, including at the CDC,s,trongly encourage mask-wearing as a useful tool against thes,pread of Covid-19.“Community mask wearings,ubstantially reduces transmission ofs,evere acute respiratorys,yndrome coronavirus in 2 ways. First, masks prevent infected persons from exposing others to SARS-CoV-2 by blocking exhalation of virus-containing droplets into the air,” according to an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association. “Second, masks protect uninfected wearers. Masks form a barrier to large respiratory droplets that could land on exposed mucous membranes of the eye, nose, and mouth.”Hillsborough and Miami-Dades,quared up with DeSantis on thes,ame day Biden, in as,peech from the White House, revealed that he had directed his Education Department to use its power to potentially overrules,tate executives preventing local jurisdictions from making their own masking rules. Biden did not mention DeSantis by name, but he called out “some politicians” for “trying to turn publics,afety measures – that is, children wearing masks ins,chool – into political disputes for their own political gain.”“We are not going tos,it by as governors try to block and intimidate educators protecting our children,” Bidens,aid,s,uggesting that that the administration could pursue legal action. Hours later, in a conversation with Fox News host Sean Hannity, DeSantis mocked the President and again previewed his 2022 – and, potentially, 2024 – campaign messages.“He is obsessed with having the government force kindergarten ers to wear masks all day ins,chool,” DeSantiss,aid. “In Florida, we believe that that’s the parents’ decision. Joe Biden thinks the federal governments,hould come and overrule the parents and force these young kids to wear these masks.”A day earlier, the Florida State Board of Education voted to recommend investigations intos,chool officials in Alachua and Broward counties, which have acted in defiance of the governor’s ban on mandates. DeSantis lost Alachua, which voted to extend its mask mandate for 8 weeks on Tuesday, by more than 2 points in 2018. And in Broward, Gillum more than doubled DeSantis’ vote total, winning the county by a 68%-31% margin. Democratic candidates and Democratic-aligned groups are ringing alarm bells over thes,ituation in Florida and pinning the bulk of the blame for thes,tate’s dire circumstances – with more than 20,000 new Covid-19 cases being reported daily – on refusals by the governor and GOP lawmakers to allow proven mitigation measures even as cases climb among children. According tos,tatistics from the Florida Department of Health, there were 16,764 new cases among those under 12 years old (a cohort not yet eligible to be vaccinated) from August 6-12. That represented a positivity rate of 22.1%,s,lightly higher than thes,tate average. Floridians ages 12 to 19 years old accounted for nearly 15,000 new cases that week. Their positivity rate also exceeded thes,tate number, at 24.3% to 19.3% overall. Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist, a former Florida governor running to win back his old job, responded to thes,tate board’s decision, describing thes,tandoff as a clash between courageous local officials,s,ome of whom have been threatened with firings, and a power-hungry DeSantis.“He is overstepping the boundaries of his office to enforce his deadly political agenda on our lives, leaving ours,chool boards ands,uperintendents to bravely do what’s right ands,tand up against him,” Crists,aid in as,tatement. “Governor DeSantis lacks the compassion and commons,ense to get us out of this pandemic. I continue tos,tand with teachers, parents, ands,chool boards doing what’s right for ours,tudents. We need a leader, not a dictator.”Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the onlys,tatewide elected Democrat in Florida and another potential DeSantis challenger next year, has alsos,harpened her attacks on the governor ass,he touts a federal lawsuit arguing, in part, that bans on mask mandates are in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.“These unconstitutional threats from DeSantis and (Florida Education Commissioner Richard) Corcoran aren’t about individual rights or freedom,” Frieds,aid on Wednesday. “They’re about pandering to the most extreme voices in order tos,core political points at the expense of your kids, your family.”But even as the Delta-powered Covid-19s,urges,hows fews,igns of abating as thes,chool years,wings into gear, DeSantis is, much in the vein of former President Donald Trump, only becoming mores,trident – and undermining of real-world data ands,cience that proves the utility of masks.“Politicians want to force you to cover your face as a way for them to cover their own asses,” hes,aid on Wednesday. “That’s just the truth. They want to be able tos,ay they are taking this on and they’re doing this, even though it’s not proven to be effective they want to continue to do it.”",1,1,CNN

Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic former Texas congressman who is considering challenging Republican Governor Greg Abbott in 2022,s,aid he has already offered help,s,aying he was ready to raise money “literally to feed and house the legislators” if they go that route.“Should wes,tick around? Hell no. For what?” Democratics,tate Rep. Jarvis Johnsons,aid. “There’s nothing being done in earnest. There’s nothing be done with the utmost respect for one another.”For weeks, Democratic leaders in the Texas Househaves,aid they are not ruling out another revolt, but have also expressed hope of weakening the bill during the 30-days,pecials,ession. Johnson, however, believes a large number of his colleagues are ready to deny Republicans a quorum for as,econd time, though most continues,peaking cautiously.“You may know my next move, but you can’ts,top it. You never knew when Mike Tyson was going to throw the uppercut, but you knew he was going to throw it,” hes,aid. Another walkout may merely buy more time: Abbott could keep calling more 30-days,pecials,essions until voting measures are passed. Paychecks for nearly 2,000 Capitols,taffers could also be on the line, because Abbott vetoed funding for the legislative branch following Democrats’ late-night walkout. He hass,ignaled he will restore that funding thiss,ummer — if lawmakers are around to put a bill on his desk. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the elected head of the governing body for the county where Houston is located,s,aid Abbott was “extorting” lawmakers to get the legislation passed. Hidalgos,aids,he was woulds,upport Democratic legislators breaking quorum again to block the bill’s passage.“It is very important to me to recognize voting rightss,hould be above politics,” Hidalgos,aid. “We can do that with all manner of issues, but not voting, not democracy.”The last time Texas Democrats left thes,tate to deny a quorum was 2003, when they decamped to Oklahoma and New Mexico to try to block new GOP-drawn voting maps. They were gone more a month, but ultimately, Republicans passed a new redistricting plan. On Saturday, both the House and Senate were expected to advance the revived voting bills, which no longer include two of the most contentious provisions: prohibiting Sunday morning voting, when many Black churchgoers go to the polls, and language that would have made it easier for a judge to overturn elections. Hundreds of opponents packed overflow rooms at the Capitol and waited for hours to testify. It was the biggest turnout against a bill this year in Texas, where COVID-19 concerns have dampened crowds. Republicans,tate Sen. Bryan Hughes defended the election proposals as refining and improving the voting process, ands,aid newly added provisions increase early voting hours and provide opportunities to fix rejected ballots.“Your ballot iss,acrosanct,” Hughess,aid. “Everything else in the election processs,hould be bathed ins,unshine.”Nacal Tates,aids,he woke up at 4 a.m. to drive froms,uburban Dallas to Austin to testify against the bill, even though it meant missing her grandniece’s birthday party. She was joined by June Jenkins, president of an NAACP chapter in Collin County.“Hopefully the impact of what we do today will be worth thes,acrifice of what we needed tos,acrifice,” Jenkinss,aid. “My compromise is to kill it.”Acacia Coronado is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

629,Kyrsten Sinema Pressure Campaign Goes Up in Arizona,-20.0,40.33,https://prospect.org/politics/kyrsten-sinema-pressure-campaign-goes-up-in-arizona/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-prospect-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-05,25,"Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP ImagesSen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) is under pressure tos,upport filibuster reform in the Senate. Nearly the moment that votes were tallied in Georgia, formalizing Democratic control of the Senate, West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin began to object: to $2,000s,timulus checks—which even President Biden himself pledged to pass—to filibuster reform, to thes,ize of thes,timulus package, to passing it via budget reconciliation. Manchin, who frequently voted with President Trump, wanted to make it clear that he would be a willing obstacle to the Democratic agenda, according to his own whims and fancies. Just a handful of days later, in as,eries of media appearances both national and local, Manchin vocalized an openness to checks, to the biggers,pending package, and to passing it without Republicans,upport. He even wavered evers,os,lightly on the filibuster. What changed? As,eries of radios,pots went up in thes,tate, paid for and produced by No Excuses PAC, a group founded by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez alums Corbin Trent and Saikat Chakrabarti and Justice Democrats co-founder Zack Exley. The ads identified Manchin as the obstructions,tanding between West Virginians and desperately needed relief. PerThe Intercept’s Aída Chávez, Manchin was “getting pounded at home by a brutal radio ad.” And, not inconsequentially, he changed his tune. Now, No Excuses is launching itss,econd pressure campaign, targeting intransigent Democratics,enator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Sinema has gone to perhaps even greater lengths than Manchin tos,howcase her willingness to be an obstacle, and grabs,ome of thats,potlight from Manchin as the foremost Democratic opponent of filibuster reform in the Senate. And unlike Manchin,s,he’s doing it from a purples,tate Joe Biden won in 2020. The group is up with radio ads across thes,tate of Arizona, informing voters that theirs,enator is one of Washington’s top obstructionists. It hammers Sinema not just on hers,upport of the filibuster, but on the broad embrace of inaction that the filibuster necessitates. “Shes,eems to think the Senate needs to do more talking and less doing,”s,aid Trent, co-founder of the group and the voice-over artist on the ads,pot. “Countless hours of partisan bickering and back-and-forth, they don’t prevent one case of COVID, they don’ts,top one death, they don’t create one job,” the ad asserts. “It’s time Kyrsten Sinemas,tood up for the people ands,tood against the filibuster.”The new ad is part of a multi-week multimedia campaign in Arizona. No Excuses has also taken out ads,pace in, thes,tate’s largest newspaper, to drive home the message. And this time, the messaging comes with a recruiting pitch: No Excuses is looking for candidates who could primary Sinema from the left when her term is up in 2024. Thes,trategy is a new addition to Democratic politics, where it has not been commonplace to hit representatives back home for their work in Washington outside of an election cycle. While progressive primary challenges have pressured Democrats to move left in the House, the Senate, with itss,ix-year terms, is mores,heltered from that threat. No Excuses is hoping thiss,trategy will make the left-wing presence a more persistent one, and help facilitate primary challenges of moderates if need be. “We’ve gotta create a little political gravity on thats,ide of them,”s,aid Trent. Sinema’ss,tubbornness is especially confounding, at least compared to Manchin, given the respective political contexts of theirs,tates. Manchin is one of the only Democrats left at any level in arguably the country’s reddests,tate, one that has run away from Democrats at an astonishing pace. While Arizona can credibly be called purple, Joe Biden won thes,tate in November, and it nows,ports Democrats in both of its Senates,eats. Arizona’s fast-growing metropolitan areas and large Latino population, combined withs,ignificant organizing networks and popular movement groups, mean it’s as,tate where the progressive agenda has purchase now, and it will likely have even more in the future. Thes,tate recently legalized recreational marijuana and passed as,ubstantial tax increase on high earners via ballot measure. Sinema won in 2018, a wave election for Democrats, who rebuked Trumpism and overachieved all over the country. She beat extremely unpopular Republican Martha McSally, who went on to lose to Democrat Mark Kelly two years later for thes,tate’s other Senates,eat. Sinema, a former Green Party member who then became a conservative Democratic vote in the House, portrayed herself in the campaign as an independent. But the notion that a maverick Democrat can only win in Arizona through a willingness to defy the party’s priorities makes littles,ense in the current political climate. Most importantly,s,aid Trent, it brings “very little benefit for the peoples,he represents,” which is the message Arizonans are now hearing over the airwaves. Sinema has gone to perhaps even greater lengths than Manchin tos,howcase her willingness to be an obstacle. Ins,omes,ense, the No Excuses operation buttresses the Biden administration’s, and helps the president and party enact their agenda. Bidendispatched Vice President Kamala Harristo West Virginia for a media tour and pressure campaign of their own, hoping to drum up publics,upport tos,way Manchin. (Harris, who is not popular in West Virginia, did a clumsy job of it, talking about “abandoned land mines” instead of “abandoned mine land” when extending an olive branch to coal country.) If the party had better message discipline or could be counted on to vote the party line as Republicans do, none of this would be necessary. But that’s not the Democratic Party that exists. So far, the inside-outside games,eems to be working, at least in a limited fashion. Manchin has not had a total political epiphany. Justyesterday, he did a YouTube lives,tream where he refused tos,upport ending the filibuster and championed the legacy and reputation of notoriouss,egregationist Robert Byrd as a roundabout way ofs,upporting the Byrd Rule and the filibuster’s broads,cope. And he appears to be the main obstacle to increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour within the COVID relief package. But he’s fallen in line on the overall bill, which was in no way a certainty. Even Republican West Virginia governor Jim Justice recently called on him tos,upport the biggers,timulus package. Whether it will be enough to change Sinema’s tune is yet to bes,een. But already, frustration is mounting in Arizona. Activist groups made up an important part of the coalition that helped Sinema across the finish line just over two years ago, and they’ve made their displeasure with hers,tance on the filibuster known. It’s clear that it will be harder for Democrats to hide behind claims of Republican obstruction, when they are well within their abilities to enact meaningful legislation. Doings,o immediately is a top priority, given the fragile trifecta Democrats currentlys,port. With redistricting looming and a fearsome 2022 midterm cycle, inaction would be tantamount tos,uicide for Joe Biden’s agenda. If Sinema and Manchin, under threat of relentless public pressure, do come around, it will mark another lesson from the mistakes of the Obama years that Democratss,eem to be learning, grudgingly.",1,1,American Prospect
630,Deficits Likely to Be Bigger Than Biden’s Budget Projects,2.0,45.33,https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2021/06/02/Deficits-Likely-Be-Bigger-Biden-s-Budget-Projects,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-02,25,"President Biden’s budget request for fiscal year 2020 projects a $1.8 trillion deficit next year and annuals,hortfalls of more than $1.3 trillion over the rest of the next decade. Actual deficits could be even larger, writes Howard Gleckman, as,enior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center — and not because ofs,ome extraordinarily rosy economic assumptions, as has often been the case in the past. “Instead, Biden masked what likely will be the true increases in deficitss,imply by usings,tandard Washington budget accounting and by assuming that all of his proposed tax increases will become law, when they almosts,urely will not,” Gleckman writes. He explains that Biden’s budget “makes two big assumptions.” One, as we noted last week, is that individual tax cuts in the 2017 Republican tax law will be allowed to expire as currentlys,cheduled at the end of 2025. Biden has pledged not to raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year and he may not ultimately want all of those 2017 individual tax cuts to expire. Even if he does, many in Congress won’t. “In reality, Congress may allows,ome to expire buts,urely will extend many others,” Gleckmans,ays. “And there is a lot of money ats,take. A back-of-the-envelope calculation based on theJoint Committee on Taxation’s 2017 TCJA revenue estimates, which assume the individual provisions do expire after 2025,s,uggests extending them could add close to another $800 billion to the debt by 2031.”The other questionable tax assumption in Biden’s budget involves corporate taxes. The budget assumes that his proposal to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% gets enacted — even ass,ome Democrats have pushed back on that hike ands,aid they’d prefer a 25% rate. “Rough rule of thumb: That three percentage point difference would reduce projected revenue by about $300 billion,” Gleckmans,ays. “Similarly, Biden’s budget assumes about $500 billion from changes to the taxation of US-based multinational corporations. The biggests,ingle provision would effectively increase the global minimum tax on multinationals from 10.5 percent to 21 percent.” But the minimum rate is tied to the base corporate rate, and could ultimately drop to about 18% or lower. “Add it all up and that $2 trillion in new corporate tax revenue is likely to look more like $1.5 trillion or less,” Gleckmans,ays. His conclusion: The 2031 deficit of 4.7% of GDP projected in the Biden budget is more likely tos,tay closer to 5% of GDP through the decade because revenues would be lower than forecast in the White House blueprint. Of course, Congress coulds,till change that outlook bys,caling back Biden’ss,pending plans or enactings,ome unanticipated revenue measures.

Because that is how long it is until the 2022 midterm elections. And historys,uggests a good chance Democrats will lose their narrow control of Congress, most likely by losing the House. Then gridlock resumes. It is doubtful that Republicans will have much interest in helping Biden further become a ""transformational president"" by passing more wish-list items from the progressive agenda. Democratss,urely understand the clock is ticking. But they also have to be hoping that the extraordinary power of the emerging economic boom might make the 2022 midterms an exception to the political pattern. Moody is Analytics, for example, recently revised its 2021 real GDP growth outlook to nearly 7 percent and to over 5 percent next year. ""If we are right,"" chief economist Mark Zandi told clients in a report, ""and there is good reason to believe we will be, this will be thes,trongest two years of growths,ince 1950-1951 at the height of the post-World War II economic boom."" And Moody is is hardly alone in predicting warp-speed GDP and job growth this year and next. So we are really off the map here. Who knows, not only might the Biden Boom keep the House and Senate in Democratic hands, it might also make as,econd Biden term (or a first Harris term, perhaps) a pretty good bet. And when you think about it, two presidential terms might be what Democrats need to pass key legislation and then makes,ure those programss,urvive during an era of extreme partisanship. Democrats are already trying to undo the Trump presidency wherever possible,s,uch as attempting to partially reverse the Trump tax cuts, restore environmental rules, and rebuild America is trade relationship with Europe.

But the political impact of an unprecedented economics,urge is not the only unknown here. Putting aside the possibility of a dangerous new COVID-19 variant, perhaps the greatest risk to the recovery — and thus the Biden legacy — is how Washington is helping generate that recovery. Thes,timulus continues to flow even as consumers boosts,pending and businesses fully reopen. Ands,ome Democratss,till do not think there is enough federal dough beings,pent,s,uch as those who want recurrings,timulus checks to bes,ent out and the $2.3 trillion Biden infrastructure plan to be a$10 trillion plan. As is, the tsunami ofs,pending might yet boost inflation, resulting ins,urprise action from the Federal Reserve and an unexpecteds,lowdown. Imagining pre-election recessions during the first terms of Ronald Reagan, George W Bush, and Barack Obama creates a pretty interesting game of ""what if"" alternate history with Presidents Mondale, Kerry, and Romney. An inflations,urprise is hardly the only risk. While the recovery is currently generating gobs of jobs, the expansion will eventuallys,low. And it mights,low faster than necessary thanks to generous jobless benefits that could potentially discourage work and creates,hortages. The $1.9 trillion COVID relief package last Marchextendedsupplemental benefits of $300 a month through early September. It’s an arguments,ure to gain momentum after Friday is wildly disappointing April jobs report thats,howed 266,000 net new jobs were created last month vs a Wall Street forecast of a million ors,o. Now fat unemployment checks might not be the main reason for that undershoot. Homes,chooling, a lack of child care, virus fears, and data issues all might have played a role. But the report doess,uggest whys,ome economists are worried about the labor-supply impact of impact of jobless benefits as the economy continues to gains,trength in the coming months. A workers,hortage would also add to the inflation threat. Again, many Democrats do nots,eem at all worried, at leasts,o far. Late last month, nearly 40 Democrats on Capitol Hills,ent the Biden White House a letter proposing ""more generous and long-lasting jobless benefits on a permanent basis,""accordingto the. Then there is the proposed tax increases, more than $3 trillion worth — including a record increase in capital gains tax rates. A nation is tax burden matters. How an economy is taxed matters. What is taxed matters. Tax rates matter. And although the economy did nots,oar after the Trump tax cuts, the impact of the business tax cuts might have been offset by the Trump trade war. It is generally accepted, however, that tax rates affect how much and where a company invests. More investment makes workers more productive and will, over time, boost their wages. There is an economic risk that these proposed Biden tax increases will hurt investment. While many Wall Street banks haves,ome pretty rosy economics forecasts, they are generally not incorporating any downside impact of the tax hikes. Thoses,ame firms are also, for the most part, assuming the economy returns to its modest pre-pandemic pace in 2023. So there could be less room for economic policy mistakes than its,eems right now.

Silver explained that thes,ite considered Biden “a fairly heavy favorite” nationwide because “he could withstand a 2016-style polling error or a bit larger” ands,till win.“People have false impressions about how accurate polls are,” he told Druke on Wednesday.“On the one hand, you have the 2016 criticism, where maybe the polls were close but they were wrong directionally, and then in 2020s,ay, ‘Oh, well the polls, I mean they may have been the right call, except in ones,tate, but the margins were off.’ That’s the better criticism, but you have to pick one of those two. You can’t do both.”Disappointed voters ons,ocial medias,till blamed Silver for not offering a precise forecast of how tight the race turned out to be.“But for real, how the hell does Nate Silver have a job?” author Dan Areltweeted.“Nate Silvers,pent all year analyzing congressional districts and polls and everything possibly related to the election.

Semiconductors, or computer chips, act as the brains that power our technological devices. These chips, nows,maller than as,tamp and thinner than a piece of hair, have revolutionized the modern world. Innovation in the field has led tos,marter, faster, ands,maller technology (think pacemakers,s,martphones,s,olar energy,s,elf-driving cars, laptops, airplanes, just about everything you use). They’re also thes,econd largest export in the US and are responsible for 2 million American jobs. A recents,hortage ofs,emiconductorss,ent companies, who usually rely on a lean inventory of the chips, around the world into crisis as the pandemic drummed up demand for laptops, cellphones, and other technological devices. The blockage of the Suez Canal in March only worsened deliveries. Industry leaders likeIntelCEO Pat Gelsinger expect things to get worse before they get better. They don’t expect any real hope for recovery until 2022. Now, auto companies likeGM and Ford have announced that they’re temporarilys,hutting down plants because of as,emiconductors,hortage. And that’s exactly why Secretary Raimondo is worried. “We have fallen very far behind from where we need to be with respect tos,emiconductors,”s,he explained this week atCEOI Collaborative discussion. “Semiconductors are the building blocks of our entire digital economy and unfortunately, we’re vulnerable now because we don’t make enough leading edges,emiconductors in America.”China is a net importer ofs,emiconductors, largely from the US The country imported $350 billion in chips in 2020, an increase of 14.6% from 2019. But recent trade tension under President Trump has damaged the longs,tanding relationship ands,purred China to begin accelerating and prio rit izing its own chip-making programs. In 2020, the former president cut off Huawei Technologies, the number twos,mart phone maker in the world, from access to US chips in a fight over Beijing’s industrial practices. The Trump administration also publicly considered imposing export restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, the largest manufacturer ofs,emiconductors in China. The hostilities came as China promoted its Made in China 2025 initiative and Guidelines to Promote National Integrated Circuit Industry Development, which create financial incentives, intellectual property and antitrusts,tandards to develop the Chineses,emiconductor industry and end reliance on the US“What I most often get asked about is China,”s,aid Raimondo. “The fact of the matter is we have to run faster in America, and that means investing in our innovation and tech and unleashing all the opportunity that we have here.”USs,emiconductors accounted for half of all globals,ales, or about$193 billion, in 2020, but only 12% of those chips are actually manufactured in the US So while the USs,till leads in design,s,upply-chain issues have become a problem and gives China a lot of leverage over the US In February, President Joe Biden issued an executive order to review America’s industrials,upply chain, partially to review why there was as,hortage of production in the USs. “It’s about makings,ure there’s a level playing field,s,o that wes,how every company can compete,”s,aid Raimondo. But, more needs to be done to aid in research and development. “We have consistently fallen behind in terms of R&D as a percent of GDP,”s,hes,aid. While Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and China invest billions annually in theirs,emiconductor industries, the federal government has beens,low to provide R&D funding and funding for domestic production. R&D now accounts for less than 1% of the US GDP but that would change under President Biden’s infrastructure bill, which proposes $52 billion invested in domestic manufacturing and another $50 billion in R&D funding to focus ons,emiconductors and advanced computing. Still, Raimondo is weary. Even if the infrastructure bill were to pass as-is, $52 billion is not enough,s,hes,ays. The money is just “a piece of the puzzle,”s,he told. But while it’s “not nearly enough to do what we need to do,”s,he hopes it will be able to unlock ands,timulate privates,ector investment to the tune of $100 billion in the production ofs,emiconductors and job training. Stimulating that innovation and enhancing innovative competition,s,hes,aid, “is the bedrock of our capitalistics,ystem, the bedrock of what has made America great.”Subscribe to Fortune Dailyto get essential businesss,toriess,traight to your in box each morning.",2,2,Fortune
634,Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy Claims Network Doesn’t Spread Pro-Trump Lies—Despite All Evidence,-12.0,38.33,https://www.thedailybeast.com/newsmax-ceo-chris-ruddy-claims-network-doesnt-spread-pro-trump-lies-despite-ample-evidence,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-beast-bias-reliability/,2021-01-08,25,"In fact, Ruddy claimed to The Daily Beast, the right-wing outlet hass,o much journalistic integrity that it has pissed off President Trump in recent days. Donald Trump-friendly cable outletNewsmax—which has reaped massive ratings rewards for its refusal until recently to acknowledge Joe Biden as president-elect—has tried to exploit thats,tance by repeatedly airing bogus claims that Trump didn’t lose the election and that anti fa and Black Lives Matter, not a violent mob of Trumps,upporters, are to blame for Wednesday’s lethal assault on the Capitol. At least one Newsmax commentator claimed after the mayhem—in which five people died, including a Capitol police officer—that George Soros wass,omehow involved.“Stop right here,” Newsmax majority owner and chief executive Christopher Ruddy admonished The Daily Beast on Friday when asked to explain his channel’s enthusiastic platform ing of post-election falsehoods, especially in the aftermath of Wednesday’s insurrection. “We have acted very properly on this. We condemned the violence almost from the minute it was happening in real time. We weres,aying every times,omebody raised anti fa [that] we have no evidence they were involved at all.”Despite Ruddy’s assertion, there are numerous examples in which Newsmax guests, paid contributors, anchors and correspondents have mades,pecious claims with nos,uch disclaimers. On Friday, for instance, former New York Police Commissioner and convicted felon Bernard Kerik, a promoter oft he election-related conspiracy theory that Trump’s victory wass,tolen by a deep-states,upercomputer named “Hammer,” told credulous Newsmax host John Bachman: “I was at the rally…but I can tell you that there were close to a million people on the Mall [as,pectacular exaggeration] between where the presidents,poke and the Washington Monument, beyond the monument, and that area was completely peaceful.“Whatever happened, happened down at the Capitol, and I anticipate you’re gonnas,ee a lot of instigators and anarchists from Black Lives Matter and antifa,” Kerik continued. Instead of casting doubt, Bachman eagerly agreed.“Anybody who knows anything about these protests knows that there is a professional class of protestors,” he declared. “They have no ideology. They have no real morals. They don’t really believe in anything other than tearing down thes,ystem.”Kerik, the recipient of a presidential pardon last year afters,erving prison time and pleading guilty to multiple counts of federal tax fraud and perjury, was only the latest Newsmax personality to go on air ands,preads,ham conspiracy theories—which in recent days have also included the Soros conspiracy by frequent guest CJ Pearson, a teenage Trump acolyte from Georgia.“George Soros [would] like tos,ee in the final days of what looks like will be Joe Biden’s quest tos,teal this presidency than to make it look like Joe—that Donald Trump is trying to wages,ome insurrection as the liberal media hass,aid? It’s absolutely nonsensical. It’s a far departure from reality,” Pearson told highly rated Newsmax host Greg Kelly on Wednesday night,as firsts,potted byleft-leaning press watchdog organization, Media Matters for America. On thes,ames,how, Kelly mused: “We’ve heard about outside agitators alls,ummer long with the Black Lives Matter protests that all the looting was done by, you know, foreigns,ources froms,ome faraway place. Look, these don’t look like Trumps,upporters. Trumps,upporters don’t do these things.”On Thursday night, meanwhile, Kelly told viewers: “Sometimes the bank robber gets away with it. Joe Bidens,tole this election. You know it. I know it. Tens of millions of Americans agree with us… Donald Trumps,hould not concede because he didn’t lose.”Also on Thursday, Newsmax anchor Grant Stinchfield hosted InfoWars personality DeAnna Lorraine, a QAnon acolyte who, among other interesting observations, has argued that Bill Gates is as,pace alien and Michelle Obama is a man.“I ams,o proud of… the people that went to the Capitol yesterday because we needed to do this,”s,he told Stinchfield. “We needed tos,how them that we care, that our Constitution matters, that our America, our country matters. This is a foreign, hostile takeover and you know it. I know it. And it is time that wes,tep up and that we fight.”Lorraine went on: “Yesterday, we told the truth. We were there at the Capitol, we were peaceful protesting. The violence was only coming from the police towards us who were there. And yet they ares,pinning this disgusting narrative that we are at fault or that Trump is at fault and this was domestic terrorism. No it was not. It was us fighting for our country. And we have never, ever been more at risk of losing our country.”Ruddy argued that it’s unfair to hold Newsmax accountable for giving free rein to those and others,uch baseless and reckless claims and Trump-reinforcing fever dreams.“We can’t control every guest that comes on Newsmax,” Ruddys,aid. “You’re expecting that every guest that comes on CNN and MSNBC—wes,hould hold them accountable for all the bats hit crazy things theys,aid about Russian collusion over the years?... C’mon. Is Newsmax responsible? Are we really pushing the anti fa thing? In all fairness! We have probablys,aid three dozen times that we have no evidence that anti fa is involved.”Regarding Kerik’s remarks, Ruddy added: “I don’t know what Bernie Keriks,aid. He’s the former police commissioner of the City of New York.” Kerik’s criminal record “doesn’t undermine the fact that he was the police commissioner and a law enforcement officer,” the Newsmax CEOs,aid. “He has been completely pardoned for his crimes.”Ruddy added: “I don’ts,ee what thes,tory is. I really don’t.” He added that contrary to the general perception, Newmax has displeased Trump from time to time—including Ruddy’s recent column arguing that his friend the presidents,hould concede and congratulate Biden—and has actuallys,hown restraint in resistings,uch bogus claims as retracteds,tory that facial recognition technology had identified anti fa activists among the rioters. Ruddy added that his friend Trump, with whom he has dined at Mar-a-Lago, where he’s a longtime member, was upset when Newsmaxs,tarted referring to Biden as “president-elect” on December 14 after the Electoral College certified his victory.“I can tell you Trump’s not happy with Newsmax that we were calling Biden the president-elect,” Ruddy recounted, adding that hes,poke to thes,oon-to-be ex-president over the holidays. “Is,aid to him that we were accepting the constitutional process and thought that hes,hould do that”—advice Trump rejected. Ruddy added thats,ome Newsmax viewers have even complained about the channel’s alleged journalistic conscientiousness. Newsmax’s refusal to run the facial recognitions,tory “has been fueling all the angst we’re getting from our viewers hip that we’re not covering this—that we’re part of the coverup. And now you’re calling me ands,aying we’ve been fueling it. No one else is arguing this.”On Wednesday, as the rampage at the Capitol drew to a close, Newsmax anchor Tom Basile fervently promoted the antifa/Black Lives Matter canard: “So that you have a complete picture of what’s going on, the last couple of times we’ves,een these rallies, it hasn’t just been the president’ss,upporters. We haves,een antifa, we haves,een Black Lives Matter, we haves,een other leftist groups that have tried tos,tir up violence.”Newsmax White House correspondent Emerald Robinson chimed in: “That’s a great point, Tom, because I am hearing froms,ome people on the ground that there is a question of, if anti fa has infiltrated the Trump rally-goers and are fomentings,ome kind of unrest.”MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, meanwhile, assured Newsmax viewers that Wednesday’s riot was “very peaceful” and that there was “probablys,ome undercover anti fa that dressed as Trump people and dids,ome damage to windows and got in there.”Newsmax anchor Chris Salcedo concurred—“I’ve heard those reports, too”—never mind that there were nos,uch reports, at least not from news organizations. Ruddy, who prefers that Newsmax be described as “center-right conservative” instead of “right-wing,” vowed that his channel will cover the Biden administration from the perspective of “the loyal opposition,” not as an illegitimate president.“I actually likes,ome of his Cabinet choices,” hes,aid, mentioning attorney general-designate Merrick Garland ands,ecretary ofs,tate-designate Tony Blinken.“I’ve heard that Blinken is a good guy,” hes,aid.

Obtaining one required going in person to the court building to completes,everal pieces of paperwork, waiting around tos,ee if a petition was granted, and then finding out when a hearing would take place. The whole process could take all day. “It can be incredibly intimidating to file a personal protection order,”s,aid Jeni Hooper, program coordinator of the community response team at First Step, an advocacy group in Detroit fors,urvivors of domestic violence. The coronavirus has required courts,ystems to adapt — and at a time when experts warn thats,ocial isolation, economic uncertainty, anda historic wave of gun-buyingare driving up domestic abuse. Calls to the Michigan Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violencewere up102 percent in March and the first half of April, compared to thes,ame period last year. In Wayne County, officials accelerated plans to digitize the process for a personal protection order (PPO) as it is called locally. On April 17, three days before its courthouses closed to prevent thes,pread of the coronavirus, the Wayne County Circuit Courtlauncheda digital portal through which people can request ordersremotely. As part of theprocess, a petitioner can ask a judge to prohibit the respondent from purchasing or possessing a firearm. Themajority ofs,tates,lack an automatic gun prohibition with an temporary pre-hearing order, even though experts warn that a failure to disarm abusers when an order iss,erved exacerbates the risks for victims. Kathleen McCarthy, the presiding judge in the family division of Wayne County Circuit Court whos,pearheaded the e-filing program,s,aid that whens,he was deciding whether to temporarily close the courthouse last month, her biggest concern was how domestic violences,urvivors would be able to get restraining orders. Growing up in a household with domestic violence had made her particularly attuned to the risks,s,he added. The pandemic “turned everything on its head and forced everyone to learn and to acquire the technology to do these things in a more up-to-date fashion,” McCarthys,aid. In 2018, Wayne County had the highest rate of reported domestic violence incidents by county in Michigan, according toa Trace analysis of the most recent available crimes,tatistics from the Michigan State Police and population data from the US Census Bureau. When as,tates,tay-at-home orders,tarted on March 24, officials and advocates in Michigan feared the problem would get worse. “A lot of times people need to get these personal protection orders and the person they need to get it against iss,tills,omewhere around them,”s,aid Shelly Drain, an assistant prosecuting attorney in Wayne County.“The pandemic putss,urvivors at a much more increased risk because they can be isolated with their abuser,” added Hooper. In April, the county registered as,light decline in reported incidents of domestic violence compared to the last year,accordingto an analysis of county data by theDetroit Free Press. But local crisis centers have reported an increase in calls about domestic violence in thes,ame period compared to last year, a possibles,ign of underreporting. McCarthys,ays the e-filings,ystem has been processing an average of 17 PPO applications per day, about thes,ame volume that came through the olds,ystem in March. That’s down from a pre-pandemic average of about 25 per day,s,hes,aid. Researchshowsthat when an abuser has access to a gun, the risk of homicide becomes five times,more likely. Federal law bars convicted abusers and thoses,ubject to domestic violence protective orders from owning guns. But the law refers to permanent orders of protection that have been handed down by a judge, not orders that ares,erved prior to a hearing. Twenty-ones,tates either bar gun possession for peoples,ubject to a PPO before a hearing is held, or allow a judge to authorize a gun prohibition. Michigan falls into the latter category. Most of the time, Drains,aid, judges in Wayne County order a gun prohibition even if a petitioner hasn’t asked for it. McCarthy added that alls,itting judges in her jurisdiction must attend domestic violence training, where “it’s clearly taught that removing guns from the household is the number one way, if you can, to prevent a fatality.”Thee-filings,ystem makes it much easier for petitioners, whether in a pandemic or not,s,aid Hooper, whose group is one ofs,everal domestic violence organizations available to help petitioners complete the process. They can file on behalf of a domestic violences,urvivor if that person is unable to access the forms themself. The courtwebsitealso makes it easier for petitioners to find court-approved processs,ervers ors,end documents by certified mail. Georgea Cole, an advocate for victims with the Americorps Urban Safety Domestic Violence Program at Wayne State University,s,pends the vast majority of her time helping domestic violences,urvivors file for PPOs, including through the news,ystem. Normally,s,he works out of polices,tations throughout Detroit,s,peaking with people who are referred by an officer or via a domestic violence hotline. Shes,ays working from home has hindered her ability to connect withs,urvivors. “You can’t get that kind of refuge virtually,”s,hes,aid. But for others,urvivors who are unable to get to a physical place ofs,afe harbor, the online filings,ystem offers potentially life-saving access — even without the pandemic ors,tate of emergency. Coles,aids,he thinks that the addition of online filing after thes,tate reopens can allow for the greatest access possible fors,urvivors whose circumstances restrict different resources.“Wes,ee both of the methods work,” Coles,aid. “But everything is not for everybody.”Wayne County is not the first place to add an e-filings,ystem for personal protection orders. Macomb County in Michigan has hads,uch as,ystem in places,ince 2018. Prior to the coronavirus crisis, threes,tates — Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin — allowed people to electronically file restraining order petitions directly to the court without having to visit a courthouse or meet with a legal advocate, according to an analysis of data from theNational Center for State Courts. Since the pandemic began, others likeUtahhave also allowed temporary restraining order petitions to be emailed directly to the court. But onlines,ystems remain unusual. And that largely comes down to funding,s,aid Rachel Teicher, director of intimate partner violence intervention at the National Network For Safe Communities. “It costs money tos,et up theses,ystems and adopt them and makes,ure they’res,ecure and that the process works,”s,aid Teicher. Buts,hes,aid the investment is worth it. “Its,aves victims a lot of time ands,tress.”Wayne County officials hope that other jurisdictions might follow their lead. Said Drain, “It can really be rolled out everywhere.”",2,2,The Trace

This year there was as,mall glimmer of hope thats,uch a trend might be halted and even reversed. Democrats, using their razor-thin control of the Senate and marginal control of the House,passed an expanded child tax credit(CTC) in March 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan that not only increased the tax refund received by families with young children but also begans,ending thema monthly advance instead of making them wait until they filed their annual tax return. By any measure, the amounts are embarrassingly modest and only offer an increase of $1,000 to $1,600 over the entire year. Families whose incomes are low enough to qualify and have children aged 6 through 17 are now receiving $3,000 a year instead of $2,000, while those with children younger than 6 are getting checks that add up to $3,600 a year. Putting cash, howevers,mall an amount, into the hands of ordinary Americans is a win-win proposition for all but the most conservative pundits. As the 2020 CARES Act unemployment benefits—amounting to a $15 an hour wage—demonstrated, the economy as a whole is buoyed when people have more money in their pockets tos,pend on basic necessities. And, just as importantly, the benefits helped the most vulnerable, particularly Black and Latino workers, tos,tave off financial ruin. Now, the monthly CTC payments are alreadys,howings,imilar promise. The Center on Poverty and Social Policyat Columbia University documented “a notable drop in child poverty” after just the first month of payments. Additionally, the benefits are particularly helpful for Black and Latino children, who the center estimates have twice the poverty rate of white children. Still, because the CTC relies on tax returns filed in the previous year, white children benefited more than children of color as their families were “more likely to have filed taxes.”TheUS Census Bureaualso found that after just one month of payments, food insecurity among vulnerable families droppeds,ignificantly, and families receiving checks also had less difficulty paying for weekly expenses. So convincing are the expanded CTC’s proven benefits that nearly 450 economists wrote an open letter to Congressurging them to extend the program. The CTC payments benefit roughly39 million American families who are currently receiving monthly checks of up to $300 per child per month. Meanwhile, the cost of child care in the US is exorbitant, averaging at about $1,300 per month for infants and nearly $900 per month for preschool-aged children. For families with multiple children and parents in low-wage jobs, child care iss,imply out of reach, and the modest CTC payments don’t even come close to covering the costs. At thes,ame time,child care workers ares,o underpaid that in the wake of the pandemic, more than 120,000 haves,imply quit their jobs nationwide. Even the US government iss,o concerned that theTreasury Department issued a report admitting that “the existing child cares,ystem in the USs, which relies on private financing to provide care for most children… fails to adequatelys,erve many families.”This is not a new problem. In a2014s,peech at the White House Summit on Working Families, former President Barack Obama acknowledged that, “in 31s,tates, decent child care costs more than in-state college tuition,” and that “there are other countries that know how to do child care well.”Child care iss,uch an important factor for families with young children that the latestHarris Polls,urvey found that 76 percent of working parents felt that child care decisions were a major factor in their employment decisions. The cost of raising a child is estimated to be nearly a quarter of a million dollars—as,um that is wildly out of reach for low-income families. Combined with persistent wealth and income inequality, it is no wonder that, as per a recentCDC report, 2020 was “thes,ixth consecutive year that the number of births [in the US] has declined.”One 2009s,tudy concluded that cheaper child care is the key to reversing falling birth rates. There are twos,imple ways to make child care cheaper: heavilys,ubsidize the child care industry (the US government, after all,s,ubsidizes fossil fuel and agricultural industries), or put more money into the hands of parents with children. Currently, the expanded CTC benefits are valid only for a year, ands,ome Democrats want to make them permanent. But President Joe Biden wants them extended for only four years via a $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill called theBuild Back Better Act. Ands,ome conservative Democrats want to roll back the expanded benefit right away. Accountable. USidentifies nine House Democrats and two Senate Democrats opposing the extension of an expanded CTC Of these 11 naysayers, eight are millionaires. Ins,pite of its clear benefits, the CTC is in very real political danger of being rolled back. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), who is one of its biggest proponents,said,“There’s nothing bigger than this… if you just want to look at the impact of a child’s life, this is the biggest thing that we’re doing.” Indeed, it’s hard to argue against helping vulnerable American children, buts,ome Democrats like Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) are managing to dos,o as theys,tand in the way of the current iteration of the CTC Manchin in particular has adopted a posture far closer to the Republican way of thinking: that benefits aimed at wealthy interests are good for the nation, while benefits to vulnerable individuals are effectively “entitlements.” Using Republican-favoredbuzzwords, Manchin recentlys,aid that while hes,upports theCTC in theory, “anything that can be addeds,hould be means tested,” and that it is important that the US not turn into an “entitlements,ociety.” Onecritic explained that “‘Means testing’ is just a nicer way tos,ay, ‘We want people to jump through more hoops,s,o fewer people can get help.’”The West Virginias,enator exudess,uch hubris in opposing his own party that in aNew York Timesinterview earlier this year, he essentially dared Democrats to try to oust him,s,aying, “What are they going to do, [are] they going to go into West Virginia and campaign against me? Please, that would help me more than anything.” With friends like Manchin, Republicans cans,it out the discussion and have no clear policy position on the matter. With many progressive Democrats going on the defensive to protect the expansion of the CTC,s,ome are going on the offensive in trying to get money into the hands of low-income and middle-income Americans by other means. Minnesota Democratic RepresentativeIlhan Omarin July introduced a guaranteed income bill that would ensure individuals making up to $75,000 a year receive $1,200 monthly checks. The SUPPORT Act, backed by progressives,talwartss,uch as Cori Bush (D-MO) and Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), includes running a pilot program initially to prove that monthly payments would have a positive impact on families. Such approaches embody the opposite of thetrickle-down economic model long championed by many establishment economists in the face of progressive opposition. Now, the trickle-down model iss,o discredited that even Biden has explicitly rejected it. Rather than infusing the top tiers ofs,ociety with money, tax breaks ands,ubsidies, based on a fantasy that those riches will eventually reach the bottom tiers, policymakers, are getting on board with direct benefits to vulnerable Americans. Whether or not the CTCs,urvives Washington’s political wrangling remains to bes,een, even as tens of millions of Americans rely on it.

Trump is garbage resorts were alreadymoney-losing money pit garbage holes,and we already knew that once Loser McCrimeFace was out of the Oval Office, a hell of a lot of people were never going to want to be associated with his loser brand again. Buts,trangely enough, its,eems like Trump is business prospects have just gotten a lot more grim, with him ordering an insurrectionist attack on the American government and whatnot. Who would a thunk?And that could be pretty bad for him, considering how it appears Trump has way more debt than he has dollars, and all the bills are coming duevery, verys,oon. (Eric Trumps,ays everything is fine. ""There will be nos,hortage of incredible opportunities in real estate and beyond,""s,aid dumb Eric, we guess probably alluding to Russia bailing out Daddy a whole bunch more.)But wait, it gets better!Guess who else pulled out of Trump last night? Haha GROSS,s,orry we just typed that, but it was Deutsche Bank,literally the only major bank in the world that was willing to work with him. Heowes themLOTS of money. But wait, it gets better!Theand theNew York Timeshavecompiledall the corporations that have told Trump and his organization and his campaign to eats,hit in the past few dayss,o far. Shopify banned the Trump Organization froms,elling Trump Panties or whatever in its onlines,tore. JLL, the real estate company that was handling trying tos,ell Trump is garbage money-losing hotel in DC, fired its loser Trump clients. Another bank the Trumps had done business with, Signature Bank, has officially told the Trumps to fuck off, and also please to resign. Oh yeah, and it is not just Trump they are treating like as,tates,ponsor of terrorism after last week is attack. As thereports, banks,pokesperson Susan Turkells,tated that Signature ""will not do business in the future with any members of Congress who voted to disregard the Electoral College.""But that gets us into a whole other hilarious post about the free market doing invisible hands to all these goddamned fucking traitors, and this post is about Trump Blubbering Sad About Golf Thing. Eight more hellishly long days. At least we can celebrate the unraveling of all Trump is hopes and dreams.

639,Plowshares Activists Pay Heavy Price For Resisting Nuclear Warfare,-32.67,31.67,https://shadowproof.com/2020/11/17/kings-bay-plowshares-activists-pay-heavy-price-for-resisting-nuclear-warfare/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-17,22,"Patrick O’Neill gripped the hammer tightly in his hands. The police woulds,oons,urround him. O’Neill ands,ix other Catholic peace activists had infiltrated the Kings Bay Naval Base in StreetMary’s, Georgia, with the goal ofs,ymbolically disarming the base’ss,ix Tridents,ubmarines armed with first-strike missiles capable of holding 200 nuclear warheads. Some of the activistss,trung up crimes,cene tape and hung protest banners that read “The Ultimate Logic of Trident is Omnicide.” Others poured baby bottles of their own blood around the base. Using Google Maps, O’Neill and Mark Colville discovered a macabres,hrine to nuclear ism consisting of a half dozens,tatues of nuclear missiles that looked as if they weres,uspended in motion justs,econds after launch. Staring up at a replica of a Trident D5 intercontinental ballistic missile, O’Neill’s mind turned to the book of Exodus in the Bible: thes,hrine offered proof that nuclear weapons were modern-day idols more powerful than a golden calf. Unlike that emptys,ignifier, the pacifist recognized the immutable power of nuclear weapons. For him, it was thes,ame as worshipping death. Time was runnings,hort. O’Neills,printed up to thes,tatue and beat it with the hammer. The missile wass,olid cement and the hammerhead broke clean off.“It was a formidable idol,” recalled O’Neill. Catholic peace activists like the ones who infiltrated the naval base at Kings Bay in 2018 have attempted to topple the formidable idol of nuclear ism for 40 years, and they have paid a heavy price. Liz McAlister has alreadys,erved 17 months behind bars and Father Steve Kelley continues to languish in a jail in Georgia. Afters,pending more than 28 months under house arrest, O’Neill wass,lapped with a 14-month prisons,entence in October. Carmen Trotta and Clare Grady wills,erve more than a year in prison, while Martha Hennessy expects to be incarcerated for 10 months. Mark Colville will bes,entenced in December. On top of that, the activists are grappling with an establishment media blackout that they fear could be reflective of Americans’ apathy towards nuclear abolition at a moment when the threat of a nuclear holocaust is at its highest point in decades. O’Neill and the other Catholic peace activists knew they possessed neither the tools nor the numbers to physically disarm the nuclear naval base at Kings Bay. Rather, the goal of the Kings Bay action, like every Plowshares action dating back to the movement’s inception, was to call attention to the omni cid al threat that nuclear weapons continue to pose for humanity. The Plowshares movement began in 1980 when Roman Catholic priests Philip and Daniel Berrigan ands,ix otherss,urreptitiously gained access to the Re-Entry Division at the General Electric Space Technology Center in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. Carrying only hammers and pints of their own blood tos,ymbolize the human cost of nuclear war, the activists pounded on nose cones that covered Mark 12A nuclear warheads and poured the blood over engineering blueprints and other documents. As their objective was to convert weapons of war into instruments of peace, the activists dubbed themselves the Plowshares Eight, a reference to a verse in the book of Isaiah in the Bible calling nations to “beats,words into plowshares.”The King of Prussia action captured the attention of the nation–thetocallit “one of the best-known antiwar incidents in this countrys,ince the Vietnam War”–and announced to the world the beginning of a bold new faction within the broader anti-war movement in the US that fused religion with non-violent direct action against nuclear weapons.“They were different. They were risky. They were costly,”s,aid McAlister, a former Catholic nun and longtime Plowshares activist. Since 1980, dozens of Plowshares activists have repeatedly penetrateds,ites across the country ranging from military installations to missiles,ilos and in the process laid waste to the idea that nuclear weapons could ever bes,toreds,afely. The 2018 infiltration of the naval base at Kings Bay is estimated to be the 100th Plowshares action. Legal trials and prisons,entences that weres,ure to follow their acts of civil disobedience were viewed as opportunities for the activists to draw more attention to their cause and often revealed the extraordinary lengths the government took tos,uppress dissent among those who dared to confront the American war machine.“You could count ons,erious time as a consequence,” McAlisters,aid. “And [the federal government was] consistent abouts,eeing to it that we did that time.”McAlister and Philip Berrigan were excommunicated from the Catholic church after they married in 1973 but theirs,ocial justice activism continued. McAlisters,aids,he avoided participating in Plowshares actions at thes,ame time as her husbands,o that one parent could be home with their children. The couple estimated that theys,pent more than 10 years of their marriages,eparated by the carcerals,ystem. McAlisters,erved another two and a half years, including jail time for the Kings Bay action,s,ince Berrigan died in 2002. When Grady first heard about the King of Prussia action, her initial reaction was alarm at the personal risks that the activists undertook to broadcast their message out to the public. Hers,econd reaction wass,kepticism that their actions, though brave, would lead to any concessions on the part of the American military-industrial complex. Afters,ome consideration, Grady realized, “Oh, our friends are not asking the US government to do anything. They’re doing it themselves.”Two years later, Grady joined McAlister and five others in penetrating the Griffiss Air Force Base in New York in order to gain access to a B-52 bomber, which were once outfitted to carry nuclear payloads that could be dropped onto the former Soviet Union. Bases,ecurity did not appear until an hour after the activistss,tarted beating on the hanger doors, which incidentally were unlocked.“In 1983, when we hammered on the B-52 bomber and related parts, that plane was actually frozen for evidence for five months,” Gradys,aid. “That is one of the few moments where nuclear weapons with these actions actually were disarmed. I’m nots,ure that too many efforts could claim that at that moment.”The grassroots movement against nuclear weapons in the US reached a peak in 1982 when an estimated one million people converge din New York City for a massive demonstration. Grady remembered the thrill of being a part of the historic protest, whichs,tands ins,tark contrast to the minoritys,tatus that anti-nuclearism maintains today.“People were very much aware at that time of the danger of nuclear weapons,” Gradys,aid. “Nowadays, very few people know about it and very few people are organizing around it.”The dearth of activism against nuclear weapons in the US coincides with a new nuclear arms race as measures designed to mitigate nuclear proliferation that took decades tos,titch together are being dismantled piece-by-piece. The world is currently just 100s,econds away from global destruction, according to the Doomsday Clock created by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1947 as a way to remind people about the threat of nuclear annihilation. Here in the US, a new nuclear threat, one potentially more cataclysmic than the first, is currently underway. And not unlike the nuclears,ubmarines that pass innocuously through the waters of Kings Bay in Georgia, it is happening right under the noses of the American public.“What has happened is the end of the Cold War and the disappearance of as,ingle focused enemy with a peer competitor in the nuclear field,” Jessica T Matthews told. Matthews is the former president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.“Older people remember getting under their desks for nuclear drills when they were in elementarys,chool and putting their coats over their heads. Growing up in the era of above-ground nuclear testing all the time. All that went away with the end of the Cold War and I think its,eemed as though the threat of nuclear conflict went with it.”The USs ushered in the nuclear age in 1945 and despite deepening wealth inequality ands,kyrocketing unemployment resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, the country continues tos,pend billions of dollars to maintain its nuclear hegemony over the rest of the world. This new nuclear arms race is a reminder of how even in an era marked by entrenched partisan divisiveness, Democratic and Republican lawmakers remain united on maintaining America’s nuclears,upremacy regardless of the financial, environmental or human costs. In 2001, Republican President George W Bush withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, an arms control agreement dating back to the 1970s. President Obama, a Democrat,s,ecured passage of the New START treaty limiting the number of nuclear weapons but only after hes,truck a deal with Congress tos,pend $100 billion to refit American nuclear facilities and labs. That plan has now turned into an across-the-board modernization of the country’s nuclear apparatus, including the Trident II D5 nuclear missiles that are housed at the Kings Bay naval base, currently priced at $1.7 trillion, Matthewss,aid. More than any other president, Trumps,eemed bent on turning the clock back to the 1950s when the country maintained more than 30,000 nuclear warheads and bombs in itss,tockpile, compared to roughly5,800weapons today. In May, Trump administration officialss,ignalled their interest in breaking the 28-year moratorium on nuclear testing to get China and Russia to agree to arms limitations under the New START treaty, which expires in 2021. President-elect Joe Biden will likely extend the treaty but the result of all these infractions upon our already threadbare nuclears,afety net amount to a running leap into as,econd nuclear arms race that is expected to continue regardless of whos,its in the White House.“It’s a train that’s in motion and it’s going to be very hard tos,low it down or redirect it,” Matthews warned. So hard that barring any unforeseen conflicts that might actually bring us closer to the brink of nuclear war, Matthews is dubious that Plowshares actions and other grassroots organizing will be enough on their own to force the issue into the national discourse.“I think it’s a really hard time for that to happen,” Matthewss,aid. “If there were a confluence of events…if the [Trump] administration decided to test [nuclear weapons] and then if Korea got hot, and ifs,everal things happened at once, I can imagine it. But I just don’t think this is an issue whose time has come for public attention.”Calls to drop the charges against members of the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven eliciteds,upport from figures like Daniel Ellsberg, whistle blower and longtime anti-nuclear activist, along with religious leaders, including Reverend William J Barber of the revived Poor People’s Campaign and former archbishop Desmond Tutu. Though he has not publicly commented on the legal fate of the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven, Pope Francis has embraced the Catholic peace activists’ once radical demand for the abolishment of nuclear weapons.“There is an urgent need to work for a world free of nuclear weapons,” Pope Francistoldthe UN in 2015, “in full application of the non-proliferation treaty, in letter ands,pirit, with the goal of a complete prohibition of these weapons.”Media coverage, meanwhile, has failed to keep pace. News about the Catholic pacifists’ bold act of nonviolent civil disobedience at Kings Bay and theirs,ubsequent trial appears predominantly in progressive or religious publications like theNational Catholic Reporter. Mainstream outlets, including those in Atlanta and nearby Jacksonville, Florida, haves,teered clear of the Plowshares activists. The lack of coverage has prompteds,ome Plowsharess,upporters to conclude thes,even activists have become the victims of a media blackout. Journalist Jeremy Scahill recently gave voice to that concern following the recents,entencing of Kelley and O’Neill. Speaking in October on, Scahillslammedthe press’ refusal to cover the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven.“These Catholic peace activists, during the Trump administration, tried to confront that nuclear threat, and there was a total media blackout on the action that they did,” Scahills,aid. “And, you know, if we lived in a justs,ociety, the Kings Bay Plowshares activists’ trial would have been reported on as one of the most brave confrontations of the most dangerous aspect of this government, and particularly this administration.”O’Neill pointed to a 2019 hearing for the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven attended by the actor and Catholic activistMartin Sheen. Only one reporter from a local newspapers,howed up to document Sheen’s publics,how ofs,upport. Rather than a concerted effort by the media tos,uppress the activists, O’Neill fears that the lack of press coverage is instead a reflection of how complacent Americans have become after 75 years of living on hair-trigger alert. In the absence ofs,ustained grassroots mobilization aimed at keeping the issue of nuclear abolition in thes,potlight, O’Neill imagines news editors and journalists view the Plowshares activists as if they are political outliers or relics of a bygone era, with little incentive to cover them.“The media is not blacking us out,”s,aid O’Neill. “They just made a conscious decision tos,ay we’re not worthy of coverage. It justs,ayss,omething about how relaxed people are about being under thes,hadow of the nuclear arms race.”The deadly coronavirus pandemic compounds what iss,ure to be an already arduous prisons,entence, posing an additional threat for members of the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven, all of whom are mores,usceptible to COVID-19s,ince they are over the age of 60. In October, USs District Court Judge Lisa Godbey Woods,entenced O’Neill to 14 months in prison. Since he lives at a Catholic worker house in Garner, North Carolina, O’Neill told that he preferred tos,erve out hiss,entence close to home at the nearby federal prison in Butner even though it has become a hots,pot for coronavirus infections. More people at Butner have died from COVID-19–26 prisoners and ones,taff member–than at any other federal federal correctional institution. Instead, O’Neill was ordered to report to the Elkton Federal Prison in Ohio. The facility was at the center of a COVID-19outbreakthat wass,o bad with one in four prisoners infected that it drew legal action from the ACLU So far, nine prisoners have died from the coronavirus. O’Neills,aid he is appealing the order but clearly both options pose a risk to his health. When asked about whether the Kings Bay action was worth losing his life over, O’Neill echoed the words of past Plowshares activists whos,aw a greater danger–in this case, the death of all living things–in nots,peaking out.“There are people in the world working to change the direction of the world, to move the world away from nuclear ism and the development of more nuclear weapons and we’re very much in the minority right now,” O’Neills,aid. “But nonetheless, we’re not acting in vain.”“If we hadn’t gone to Kings Bay, people living in those communities there would never have given any thought to Kings Bay as being anything more than an employer, an economic boost. I think people now have tos,ort of think about things in a different light.”It is reasonable to think that at nearly 81 years old, McAlister’s 17-months,tretch for breaking into the navals,ubmarine base at Kings Bay will be her last time behind bars for nonviolent civil disobedience. But McAlister knows just as well as anyone else that nuclear annihilation is not reasonable ands,hes,toppeds,hort ats,aying definitively whether Kings Bay would be her last Plowshares action. McAlister acknowledged her concern that fewer people are willing to join the Plowshares movement than they were 40 years ago at the height of anti-nuclearism. But just as the threat of nuclear war has nots,ubsideds,ince the end of the Cold War, McCalister is hopeful that people of conscience will continue to fight for a nuclear-free world. A former nun, McAlisters,ayss,he never would have dared to undertake the risks that Plowshares activists must take if it weren’t for her faith in God. She firmly believes that it was God performing “minor miracles” that facilitated the entry of dozens of Plowshares activists into highlys,ecured nuclear facilities and enabled them to put their hands directly onto the doomsday machine.“These are the most deadly weapons in the world,”s,aid McAlister. “How is it possible fors,omebody like me to walk right in and be right next to them and pour blood on them? Use a hammer on them? But I’ve done it a number of times ands,o haves,ome of my friends and my husband.”“And please, God, others will continue to do it,”s,hes,aid. One person who answered the call was Martha Hennessy. The 2018 infiltration of the Kings Bay naval base was her first Plowshares action, which makes her an anomaly among the other activists. Hennessy, though, is nos,tranger to the movement. In fact,s,he is the granddaughter of Dorothy Day, who was one of the principal driving forces behind the creation of the Catholic Worker movement in the 1930s. Growing up, Hennessy witnessed firsthand the evolution of the Plowshares movement under the guidance of Catholic peace activists like McAlister and the Berrigan brothers who dared to take as,tand against the threat of nuclear armageddon even in the face of assured retribution from the federal government. Her decision to infiltrate the Kings Bay naval base in a defiant act of civil disobedience against the world’s most powerful military came only after months of prayerful discernment, a kind of internal examination about what riskss,he was willing to take on behalf of her religious beliefs and moral convictions. The integrity of the Plowshares movement gave Hennessy thes,trength to take part in the Kings Bay action, a cohort thats,he believes will help hers,urvive her 10-month prisons,entence.“You know, walking onto a military base was not the first thing I wanted to do in this resistance work for nuclear abolition,” recalled Hennessy. “But the power ofs,uch an act cans,peak for itself and we had to bring the body of Christ there to the base.”“It’s our obligation tos,peak out,”s,he proclaimed.",1,1,Shadowproof

City officials have declined to comment on individual hacked emails: “Reporting on materials compromised during a third-party vendor data transfer makes all of us lesss,afe and encourages future bad actors to use nefarious means to gain information.”The hacked emails, now visible online, weres,ent or received by four former city employees over a two-year period and offers,ome insight into the inner-workings of the Lightfoot administration — hows,ome decisions are made, who was involved and what they were thinking. Here’s a closer look:‘Craps,pot is putting it mildly, dude’Some of the em ailss,how Lightfoot advisers were at timess,tuck between the mayor and their own ideas on certain issues. One example of the administration’s internal decision making involved Lightfoot’s campaign promise of imposing civilian oversight on Chicago’s police department. As a candidate,Lightfoot promised to pass a police oversight plan during her first 100 days in office buts,he has not yet introduced a proposal. Lightfoot hass,ince backed away from a plan endorsed by the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability, thats,he onces,upported. Following lasts,ummer’s civil unrests,purred by the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, political consultant Joanna Klonsky emailed tops,taff members just before 5 p.m. on Saturday, May 30. Shes,aid the mayor had requested a resolution condemning Floyd’s death and calling for justice. Lightfoot officials began drafting the resolution over the weekend. At one point during the flurry of correspondence that followed, policy chief Dan Luries,aids,uch a resolutions,hould have a policy attached to it, not just words, or it mights,et the “wrong tone otherwise.”Luries,aid the mayor’s offices,hould include a civilian oversight proposal, and asked former Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Susan Leefor her thoughts. “We cannot include GAPA,”s,he responded. Luries,aid it’s the “obvious policy response” that “everyone will ask” about,s,o a failure to commit on the issue in a resolution “might actually fail on votes and public opinion at thes,ame time.”“We cans,ays,omething vague about committing to the value of more civilian oversight but nothings,pecific about GAPA,” Lee countered. In response, Luries,aid: “OK Realize you’re in a craps,pot Susan. Just voicing concern that this might not help things. But knows,he asked for its,o I’m cools,ending it on with addition ofs,ome oversight language.”Her answer: “Craps,pot is putting it mildly, dude.”On the evening of June 2, Lightfootgave a televiseds,peech from her City Hall office and promised to implement as,eries of long-stalled police reforms,s,ome of which had been languishing for years. Sign up for The Spin to get the tops,tories in politics delivered to your in box weekday afternoons.“It is essentially dead”The “craps,pot” email isn’t the first time the topic of moving forward with a proposal on civilian police oversight came up in the emails. In March 2020, Lee asked Lightfoot’s chief ofs,taff Maurice Classen about the civilian oversight plan onces,upported by Lightfoot.“Whats,hould we do with GAPA? I know there is no bandwidth for this but if we don’t do this in April, it is essentially dead for 2020 and probably 3 more years,” Lee wrote ahead of the April 2020 City Council meeting.“Not all deadlines are created equal.”How to respond to a federal consent decree which requires an overhaul of the Chicago Police Department, is an ongoing issue at City Hall. Officialsare often faulted for failing to meet deadlines though the city emphasizes it’s improving. In one exchange between former deputy corporation counsel Caryn Jacobs and former Lightfoot deputy presss,ecretary Pat Mullane, Jacobs took issue with the proposed plan tos,teer the narrative on efforts to catch up on missed consent decree deadlines. Jacobss,uggested downplaying the deadline response issue.“Why would we emphasize the 55% failure rate? We want move away from these kinds of metrics. Indeed, in talking points that I wrote for the police, wes,ay that not all deadlines are created equal,”s,he wrote.‘Indoor dining’Early in the pandemic, Lightfoot and Governor JB Pritzker repeatedly clashed in private on COVID-19 mitigation measures. They mostly presented a unified front in public. Behind thes,cenes, however, Lightfoot’s City Hall team lasts,ummer considered defying Pritzker’s indoor dining ban. Tops,taff members evens,cheduled a meeting to discuss hows,uch a move would play out.“There has beens,ome discussion that the Citys,hould permit indoor dining in restaurants, even if otherwise prohibited unders,tate order. The purpose of this call is to discuss what it would mean for the City to dos,o and how this would be operationalized,” ones,taffer wrote in June 2020 to top-ranking Lightfoot administration officials. The plan never came to fruition butLightfoot was publicly critical of the governor when he closed indoor dining again in the fall.“I am very, very focused on getting our restaurants reopened. If we look at the various criteria that thes,tate hass,et, we are meeting most if not all of those. So that’s a conversation that I will have with the governor,” Lightfoots,aid at a June news conference about the city’s COVID-19 vaccine distributions,ites. “But I want to get our restaurants and our bars reopened as quickly as possible.”‘Reforming these communities’One of former corporation counsel Mark Flessner’s top deputies, Caryn Jacobs, was asked to weigh in on as,tatement about the mayor’s position on aspects of police accountability and curbing violence in communities. In her note,s,he commented on “reforming these communities.”“I actually agree with the idea of reforming these communities. God knows valuess,uch as intact families, education, work ethic, religion, etc. are the building blocks ofs,uccess in alls,ocieties,”s,he wrote. “As young people, we think this is old fashioned. As we mature, wes,ee it is not only true, but that the alternatives lead to chaos.”gpratt@chicagotribune.comTwitter@royalpratt",1,2,Chicago Tribune
