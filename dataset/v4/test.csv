Burger King UKtweetedthe message around 9 a.m. local time on March 8. The company followed up with two additional tweets that unveiled a new scholarship program aimed at helping women pursue professional culinary careers. But critics argued the first tweet came across assexistandencouragedthose with chauvenisticideas about women. Some slammed Burger King for resorting to “clickbait” to grab attention.

Twitter/@BurgerKingUKBurger King UK caused an uproar by tweeting, “Women belong in the kitchen.”Twitter/@BurgerKingUKBurger King UK caused an uproar by tweeting, “Women belong in the kitchen.”Context is key and the original Burger King UK tweet triggered a swiftbacklashonline. It started with the tweet, “Women belong in the kitchen.” Burger King immediately followed that with a second tweet that read, “If they want to, of course. Yet only 20% of chefs are women. We are on a mission to change the gender ratio in the restaurant industry by empowering female employees with the opportunity to pursue a culinary career.” The account included the hasht ag “IWD” for International Women is Day. It took nearly another two hours before Burger King UK specifically mentioned the scholarship in a third tweet:“We are proud to be launching a new scholarship programme which will help female Burger King employees pursue their culinary dreams!”This tweet has 22,000 retweets. Your reply tweet has 1,000 retweets. This is why using sexist remarks as bait is a dumb, dumb idea. The majority of people are not seeing your positive reply. They are just seeing a sexist comment made by a brand account.— Ryan Brown 🎮 (@Toadsanime)March 8, 2021As of this writing, the original tweet had been retweeted more than 300,000 times and generated more than 52,000 replies and nearly 600,000 “likes.” The secondary tweets received far less attention. Your marketing team need to have a long hard look at the mselves. On a day that we should be empowering women, you have manage to create more engagement posting such a derogatory tweet. I get the whole sentiment behind the bigger thread… but this post should not stand alone.— **Rachel** (@Rachelerella)March 8, 2021A Burger King spokeswoman, Adrianna Lauricella, explained to the Washington Postin an emailed statement that the company realized in hindsight that the company may have distracted from its intended message by choosing to release the information in separate tweets:We are committed to helping women break through a male-dominated culinary culture in the world is fine dining restaurants — and sometimes that requires drawing attention to the problem we are trying to help fix. Our tweet in the UK today was designed to draw attention to the fact that only a small percentage of chefs and head chefs are women. It was our mistake to not include the full explanation in our initial tweet and have adjusted our activity moving forward because we are sure that when people read the entirety of our commitment, they will share our belief in this important opportunity. GettyBurger King. GettyBurger King. The scholarship program the Burger King UK Twitter account was promoting is actually taking place in the USs. It is called the Helping Equalize Restaurants scholarship or HE R. program. According to the Burger King Foundation website, at least two women will receive scholarships of $25,000 each that can be used for accredited culinary programs. Burger King employees who have worked at the restaurant for at least six months are eligible to apply and need to have plans to enroll in a culinary institute or program for the 2022-2023 school year. Applicants also need to have earned a high school diploma or GED to be eligible. Burger King also bought advertising space in the print edition of the New York Times to promote the scholarship. According to AdWeek,the Times advertisement included the “women belong in the kitchen” headline but added the following language: “Fine dining kitchens, food truck kitchens, award-winning kitchens, casual dining kitchens, ghost kitchens, Burger King kitchens. If the re is a professional kitchen, women belong there.”Why would we delete a tweet that is drawing attention to a huge lack of female representation in our industry, we thought you’d be on board with this as well? We have launched a scholarship to help give more of our female employees the chance to pursue a culinary career.— Burger King (@BurgerKingUK)March 8, 2021In the Twitter thread, Burger King wrote that only 20% of chefs are women. According toData USA,which compiles statistics based on government data such as census information, about 77% of chefs and head cooks in the USs were men as of 2019. It also found that women earned, on average, about $10,000 less than their male counterparts. NPR reported in 2018 that among restaurants in the USs, only about 7% of those businesses had lead chefs who were female. It is a similar situation across the pond. The Guardianreported in 2016 that women accounted for about 18.5% of professional chefs in the United Kingdom. These statistics may account for why Burger King decided to keep the “women belong in the kitchen” tweet on its thread despite the criticism. KFC Gaming commented on the original tweet with a mem e that read, “The best time to delete this post was immediately after posting it. The second best time is now.”Burger King responded, “Why would we delete a tweet that is drawing attention to a huge lack of female representation in our industry, we thought you’d be on board with this as well?

3,Out of the Shadows: New York Legalizes Adult-Use Marijuana,-6.67,46.33,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/03/31/out-of-the-shadows-albany-legalizes-marijuana-in-new-york/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-31,17,"Albany was all about cannabis on Tuesday, with New York lawmakers debating the issue across three committee meetings, a few more hours in the senate, and a marathon, almost seven-hour session in the assembly. This morning, Governor Andrew Cuomo tweeted that he had signed the three-way deal, theMarijuana Regulation and Taxation Act. For hours on Tuesday, State Senator Liz Krueger passionately defended the seven years of effort she’d devoted to New York is legalization plan leading up to its 40-23 victory in the Senate. In the Assembly, Majority Leader Crystal D Peoples-Stokes oversaw the day-long defense of the effort. Late in the day doubters in the senate formed what seemed like a firing line to pepper Krueger with the same questions she’d heard for the better part of a decade of working on the issue.#BREAKING: I just signed legislation legalizing adult-use cannabis. The bill creates automatic expungement of previous marijuana convictions that would now be legal. This is a historic day. I thank the Leader and Speaker and the tireless advocacy of so many.— Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo)March 31, 2021The Governor would applaud the efforts of Albany is cannabis champions in an evening statement prior to singing. “Tonight, the New York State Legislature took the first step in a major leap forward for the Empire State by passing legislation to legalize adult-use cannabis,” Cuomo said. “I thank Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, and the many legislators who worked tirelessly on this issue for securing passage of this historic legislation.”Cuomo went on to offer a final reminder of New York is troubled past with cannabis enforcement on the eve of putting his signature on the bill. “For too long the prohibition of cannabis disproportionately targeted communities of color with harsh prison sentences and after years of hard work, this landmark legislation provides justice for long-marginalized communities, embraces a new industry that will grow the economy, and establishes substantial safety guards for the public,” he said. But the road to get to those congratulations yesterday was a long one. During the debate in the Senate, State Senator Fred Akshar was Kreuger is first sparring partner. He started by questioning the bill is stated intention to reduce violent crime. How would it accomplish this? Krueger quickly pointed to the reality that much of the drug trade in New York is currently controlled by violent criminals.“When people go to buy their marijuana they do not know who it is they are buying from, the re is no licensing. They do not know if they are organized crime,” Krueger said. “They do not know if that same person is selling other much more dangerous drugs.”While Kreuger did not claim the bill as a fix-all to criminal elements currently involved in the cannabis supply chain, she argued that its provisions will help. “I do think that people will choose within the two options, an illegal dangerous option, and a legal regulated option, to buy marijuana through our legal regulated options,” she said, pointing to the resources that would remain after legalization to target serious threats to society. “We expect to actually save up to $500 million in our criminal justice system simply because we have legalized marijuana. So we will not be using our police to pick up kids.”Akshar went on to question Kreuger on whether she’d been in the room for the final negotiations between the Assembly, Senate, and Governor. She said most of it had been left to staff, but she had been readily available at all hours to provide input to everyone taking part in that negotiating process until the deal got done. The conversation turned to who else was in the room for that final language deal. Akshar wanted to know if mental health professionals, substance use disorder professionals. Parent-Teacher associations, school leaders, or police officers had a seat at the table.“The answer is yes,” Kreuger replied and went on to point out how all the years at the table with those groups informed the final language. ”And it was me sometimes, and it was staff. This bill has been percolating into a bigger and bigger, and changed —and I believe better bill —for over seven years.”Kreuger reminded everyone that when she first introduced the bill in late 2013, everyone thought she was crazy. And she said that may still be the case. “But the fact is we had hearings, we took meetings, endless, endless meetings with anyone who asked us. We met at the local level. I would go out to people is communities if they invited me there totalk about their concerns. So, in truthfulness, I am not sure I have ever met with as diverse a group of people as I did over the seven years that my Chief of Staff and I were working on this stuff.”Kreuger mentioned advertising restrictions and other ways to avoid appealing to children as early and easy concessions to PTA groups. Also important was leaving room for municipalities to locally opt-out of the state is legalization plan, with the option to jump into the mix when they see fit. For much of the time, the debate in both houses centered around the impact on law enforcement. Across New York law enforcement there are only a few hundred drug recognition experts. Part of the argument revolved around law enforcement needing money up front to get more DREs, despite the fact that the current number has already been serving New York is millions of cannabis users, most of whom are now expected to transition to the legal market. Despite the lack of cash upfront, Kreuger argued the re is a significant amount of resources committed to make sure we have more local police and state troopers who are trained in the skills to evaluate drivers intoxicated with marijuana and getting them off the road. More understanding of the financial aspects of that process would arise as the enforcement mechanisms are developed in the next 18 months before the market opens. Kreuger also pointed to the governor is office commitment that police have the resources they need to combat impaired driving. But again, Kreuger kept things realistic saying the DRE topic was important as she addressed these question: “I do not want anyone listening to us to imagine that we are starting today from a place where there is zero marijuana being used by people who drive cars, because it is being used, and they are driving throughout the state of New York.”Eventually, Senator Anthony Palumbo queried Kreuger on a variety of topics that included what happens to parents who use weed compared to alcohol use in child custody situations; the five-pound limit around homegrown pot; and police not being allowed to search a vehicle solely based on the smell of burnt marijuana. Kreuger explained that there was indeed some confusion on the five-pound limit when talking about the gross weight of the plants compared to the usable marijuana. “The five-pound example was not actually a great example,” Kreuger said. “But you might have several ounces of usable marijuana in your home. That is not evidence that you are using it every day. That is not evidence that you are using it at all, actually. So just like, I guess in some people is houses they have cases and cases of wine or beer or other spirits. That is not evidence of anything other than they have a lot of bottles of liquor in their home.”Another part of the bill Kreuger was questioned on came in regards to law enforcement being forbidden to cooperate with federal authorities on now state-legal cannabis crimes. The opposition, like that in 15 states before it, argued this lack of compliance with the federal law was a setup for failure. Kreuger compared it to law enforcement not cooperating with ICE deportation efforts in recent years.“I think it is a fairly parallel situation, and every once in a while, you hear a story coming out, and something gets resolved or not, but I do not think it is been a huge issue,” Kreuger said, “And I do not think it is been a real issue in any of the other 15 states that have legal marijuana, even though they are under the same federal laws we are.”Senator George Borrello began with concerns that the cannabis industry seemingly would not be as strict as the hospitality business in NY Borrello explained he was deeply versed in the licensing structure meant to prevent the shady figures of New York is past from operating liquor establishments, pointing out that a felony was almost a guaranteed rejection. He asked if the bill would really let people with drug dealing felonies operate in the legal market.“Yes, and of course a major portion of this bill is to expunge the records of people who got caught up in the criminal justice system involved with cannabis,” Kreuger said, basically asserting if those convictions do not exist anymore they ca not have an impact on licensing. “So our goal is to expunge the records of people who had cannabis convictions and open them up to be able to be full citizens where they can apply to actually work legally in this business. Where they have no risk of problems with getting an education because they had a cannabis record, or being able to apply for certain kinds of jobs, or being able to live in certain places. So yes, part of the goal of this law is to ensure that people who may have been participating in an activity that was illegal will now be able to become taxpayers, owners, work in stores, etc.”Borrello pressured Kreuger on whether people selling other drugs or with gun charges would qualify, offenses that would not get caught up in a mass expungement sweep. Kreuger said the agency handing out licenses determines whether they believe they can be a trustworthy, reliable business person in this field and if so the n they will be allowed. And it will be through a regulatory process and evaluation. Borrello went on to ask how restaurants would be protected from edibles, adding that he has numerous concerns. “That is because as an operator, I am responsible for you being sober. I am responsible for your intoxication level yet someone can walk in with a handful of very potent gum mi es and consume them on-premise.” He proposed a situation in which people would head to bars to consume edibles, and he asked what would happen if they were to “leave that establishment, get into an accident and kill someone. In that scenario, especially with the restaurant restrictions that we now have where, you know, these people are going to be… it is gonna be difficult to stop these people because of all the freedom that they are going to have to consume and drive.”“Well, the irony is that exists right now,” Kreuger replied, “We do not know when somebody comes in your bar, whether they have used marijuana before they got the re, or popping other illegal drugs or not. They are wandering around the world they are using what they use. And so we faced this risk and reality today.”Although legislators argued until 10 PM, Kreuger finally triumphed when the bill was sent to the Governors desk. Twelve hours later cannabis possession became legal in NY with the Governor is tweet. Various advocates weighed in on this historic day. Empire State NORML Deputy Director Troy Smit said, “We stand on the shoulders of giants. It is taken a great amount of work and perseverance by activists, patients, and consumers to go from being the cannabis arrest capital of the world to lead the world with a legalized market dedicated to equity, diversity, and inclusion.”Smit admitted things were not all positive, but there is plenty to work with. “This might not be the perfect piece of legislation, but to day, cannabis consumers can hold their heads high and smell the flowers,” Smit said. “Senator Krueger and Assemblywoman Peoples-Stokes have laid the groundwork for marijuana justice and a consumer-centric industry. Now, it is time for the Office of Cannabis Management to take up their torch and implement regulations that protect patient and consumer rights. In the words of our late Director, Doug Greene — Cannabis Excelsior!”NORML is national leadership also weighed in on the big victory. “These votes are historic because they signal the beginning of the end of the racially discriminatory policies that have long made the Empire State the marijuana arrest capital of the USs, if not the world,” said Erik Altieri, NORML Executive director. “Once enacted, this measure will end the practice of annually arresting tens-of-thousands of New Yorkers for low-level marijuana offenses, the majority of whom are overwhelmingly young, poor, and people of color.”The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) represents workers in New York is medical cannabis industry. RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum and John Durso, President of Local 338 RWDSU weighed in on the new opportunities for working-class New Yorkers. “Today, in passing the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act, the New York State legislature took enormous strides toward ending the decades-long war on drugs and its discriminatory impact on people of color,” Appelbaum said. “The legislature listened to calls by workers and advocates to create an industry centered on equity. From the creation of a social equity fund to requiring labor peace for cannabis license holders, this places New York on the forefront of social equity nationally. We thank the legislature for prio rit izing the needs of workers and the community and look forward to swift signature into law.”Durso spoke to how important he believes organized labor will be in helping New Yorkers get the most out of the forthcoming pot industry. “Local 338, New York is cannabis union, has organized almost 500 workers in the medical cannabis industry in New York, setting standards across the industry that benefit workers and their families,” Durso stated. “Our contracts in the medical cannabis industry have established full-time careers with family-sustaining wages, affordable and quality health care, workplace health and safety standards, funding for retirement, and more.” He added,“It is our priority that the 30,000-60,000 jobs created in our State is adult-use industry meet the same standard as those in the medical cannabis industry. The MRTA will help to do just that, by ensuring access to opportunity at every level of this brand-new industry, including for the thousands of New Yorkers who will be entering it as workers.” ❖More:cannabisNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

That is not how anything works. This is not a hostile takeover of a corporation or even fantasy football.

Yes, the so-called“Hamilton Electors"" wanted to deny Trump the White House through the Electoral College, but Hillary Clinton, who conceded the morning after Election Day,had nothing to do with this.

States tightened up laws against faithless electors after 2016so instead of charging someone a measly $1,000 after the fact for a failed coup, the states can remove the faithless elector and replace them with someone who will respect the will of the people, no matter how dumb. TheSupreme Court upheld these laws in a unanimous ruling. Trump is unhinged tweets and Miller is elector cosplay ca not change the law or the results of the presidential race. However, they do promote the dangerous fiction that the election is not settled. Trump tweeted after his (second) Supreme Court loss that “We have just begun to fight."" His supporters, who exist in an alternate reality of Trump is own design, are heeding his call, and his incendiary rhetoric, which Republicans ignore and enable, has put a target on the electors' backs.

Martin Luther King Jr. famously laid out a vision for harmony between white and Black people 57 years ago, his son issued a sobering reminder about the persistence of police brutality and racist violence targeting Black Americans.“We must never forget the American nightmare of racist violence exemplified when Emmett Till was murdered on this day in 1955, and the criminal justice system failed to convict his killers,” said Martin Luther King III, speaking to thousands that gathered Friday to commemorate the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.“Sixty-five years later (after Till is murder), we still struggle for justice — demilitarizing the police, dismantling mass incarceration, and declaring as determinately as we can that Black lives matter,” King said. Even in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, many felt compelled to join civil rights advocates in Washington to highlight a scourge of police and vigilante violence that gave way to what many feel is an overdue reckoning on racial injustice. Some stood in sweltering temperatures in lines that stretched for several blocks, as organizers took temperatures as part of coronavirus protocols. Organizers reminded attendees to practice social distancing and wear masks throughout the program, although distancing was hardly maintained as the gathering grew in size. They gathered following another shooting by a white police officer of a Black man — this time, 29-year-old Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last Sunday — sparking demonstrations and violence that left two dead. As peaceful protests turned to arson and the ft, naysayers of the Black Lives Matter movement issued calls for “law and order.”The Rev. Al Sharpton, whose civil rights organization, the National Action Network,plannedFriday is commemoration, had a message for naysayers.“Some say to me, ‘Rev. Al, y’all ought to denounce those that get violent, those that are looting,’” Sharpton said. “All of the families (of victims of police and vigilante violence) have denounced looting. What we have not heard is you denounce shooting.”Sharpton asked, “We will speak against the looting, but when will you speak against wrong police shooting?”Sharpton and King stood with relatives of an ever-expanding roll call of victims: Blake, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, and Eric Garner, among others. Arbery and Martin both were killed by white men who pursued them with guns and whose arrests were delayed until residents protested.“There are two systems of justice in the USs,” said Jacob Blake Sr., the father of the man whose shooting by police in Kenosha left him paralyzed from the waist down. “There is a white system and a black system -- the black system ai not doing so well.”Subscribe to our free DayStarter newsletterWant more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox?“No justice, no peace!” he proclaimed. Philonise Floyd, the brother of George Floyd, stared out at the massive march audience and said he wished his brother was there to see it. Friday is march shaped up to be the largest political gathering in Washington since the pandemic began. Many attendees wore T-shirts of the late Representative John Lewis who, until his death last month, was the last living speaker at the original March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. It went on to become one of the most famous political rallies in US history, and one of the largest gatherings with over 200,000 people in attendance. Organizers said they intended to show the urgency for federal policing reforms, to decry racial violence, and to demand voting rights protections ahead of the November general election. A handful of satellite marches were held in South Carolina, Florida, Nevada, Utah and Colorado. Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, in a video, said the original conveners would be disappointed that Black Americans are still marching for justice and equality under the law.“I have to believe that if they were with us to day, they would share in our anger and frustration as we continue to see Black men and women slain in our streets, and left behind in our economy and justice system that has too often denied Black folks our dignity and rights,” she said. Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted his support for the march. Although President Donald Trump did not comment on the march Friday, the Republican National Committee marked the event is anniversary by highlighting the president is record as a “champion for the Black community.”“While there is more work to be done, Donald Trump is the leader to make it happen,” Paris Dennard, an RNC senior communications advisor, said in a statement. Activist Frank Nitty, who said he walked 750 miles for 24 days from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Washington for Friday is march, spoke to the audience about persistence in the fight for justice.“Are y’all tired? Because I am tired,” Nitty said. “They think this is a negotiation, but I came here to demand change. My grandson ai not gonna march for the same things that my granddaddy marched for.”Navy veteran Alonzo Jones-Goss, 28, who traveled from Boston to participate in the march, said the nation has seen far too many tragic events that claimed the lives of Black Americans and other people of color, and “that needs to come to an end.”Following the rally, participants marched to the Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial in West Potomac Park, next to the National Mall, and the n dispersed. Some participants headed toward Black Lives Matter Plaza, right outside of the White House, which was renamed from Pennsylvania Avenue during protests in June. Chants of “Black lives matter” and “No justice, no peace” echoed through downtown Salt Lake City Friday morning, as about 200 people marched from the state Capitol to Washington Square Park for Utah is March on Washington.“If people still ca not see why we are out here and why we are marching and why people are loud and angry the n they are blind,” said Joshua Chamberlain, a realtor from Holladay, Utah. “There is racism happening every day and -- especially by police brutality -- people are dying from it.”In Colorado, several dozen people rallied at a prominent statue of Martin Luther King Jr. in Denver is City Park. Democratic US Senator Michael Bennet cited the names of George Floyd, Elijah McClain and victims of police brutality.“You know and I know what happened to them would never happen to me,” said Bennet, who is white. Sharpton instructed those in other states to march on their US senators’ offices and demand their support for federal policing reforms and reinvigorated voter protections, in Lewis’ memory. In June, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice In Policing Act, which would ban police use of stranglehold maneuvers and end qualified immunity for officers, among other reforms. A Republican-authored police reform bill, introduced in June by South Carolina Senator Tim Scott, who is Black, failed a procedural vote in the Senate because Democrats felt the measure did not go far enough to address officer accountability. In July, following Lewis’ death, Democratic senators reintroduced legislation that would restore a provision of the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965 gutted by the US Supreme Court in 2013. The law previously required states with a history of voter suppression to seek federal clearance before changing voting regulations. Both measures are awaiting action in the Republican-controlled Senate. Associated Press article by Aaron Morrison, Kat Stafford and Ashraf Khalil",2,2,Tampa Bay Times
6,US and UK Rank Highest in Per Person Plastic Waste Production,-1.0,41.0,https://nowthisnews.com/earth/us-and-uk-rank-highest-in-per-person-plastic-waste-production,https://adfontesmedia.com/nowthis-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-05,16,"Published on 2/4/2021 at 6:45 PMThe US and UK produce more plastic waste per person than any other country in the world, according to a study published in the journal Science Advances. The peer-reviewed study shows the US is the largest producer of plastic waste. The study notes that American citizens may rank as high as third globally when it comes to coastal plastic pollution. Data suggests that more than half of the plastic collected for recycling in the US has been exported to developing countries that are already struggling to manage plastic waste adequately, effectively masking the US is brutal contribution to plastic waste. The analysis found that US plastic waste input into its coastal environment was between 0.51 and 1.45 million metric to ns. Despite comprising only 4% of the global population, the USs is responsible for 17% of its plastic waste. The study estimated that on average, each American generates as much as 287 pounds of plastic waste per person each year, while the Brits slightly trail at 218 pounds.",1,1,NowThis News
7,Census misses create worries of Hispanic undercount,-6.33,45.33,https://www.rollcall.com/2021/04/29/census-misses-create-worries-of-hispanic-undercount/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-29,23,"Joseph Garcia spent months working to ensure that Hispanic residents of Arizona got counted in last year is decennial census. After this week is release of the first set of results, he worries the government still missed thousands of them. Arizona, along with Texas and Florida — other states with large Hispanic populations — fell short of expectations in Monday is reveal of census data, resulting in smaller gains in congressional seats than projected, or none at all. Historically, the census has missed portions of Hispanic communities, shortchanging them on representation and in millions of dollars in federal programs, said Garcia, executive director of the advocacy group Chicanos por la Causa Action Fund.“I just do not want everyone to focus on ‘Oh, we did not get another congressional seat’; the harm is much deeper than that,” Garcia said. “It is compounding because it is going to be year after year after year over the next decade of less funding for all these services, which are really needed by many people.”In addition to apportionment, census results are used to draw legislative maps and help guide more than $1.5 trillion in federal spending every year. However, it is uncertain at this point how many people the census process may have missed. During Monday is reveal of the results, Census Bureau officials cautioned the apportionment totals did not include any demographic information. Additionally, they pointed out the population for states such as Texas and Florida came within 1 percent of the projections it previously made. Multiple experts said it could be months before the public gets a better picture of the accuracy of the 2020 census. Detailed redistricting information that will include race and ethnicity data is slated for release over the summer. Even the Census Bureau itself does not know at the moment — much of the accuracy assessment for the count is based on a post-count survey the agency will complete by next year. In 2010, the Census Bureau is post-enumeration survey indicated the agency may have under counted the Hispanic population by as much as 1.5 percent nationwide. Tom Wolf, senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, said assessing potential under counts is “really a story that is going to be compiled over the next year.”However, he pointed out there are “all sorts of factors that would trend toward decreasing the quality and equity of the count” that could show up in later data releases. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki referred questions about a potential under count of the Hispanic population to the Census Bureau during a news briefing Tuesday. She noted, though, the Biden administration reversed the Trump administration is effort to exclude undocumented immigrants from apportionment data and gave the agency extra time to finish the census results. Redistricting expert Kim Brace said Monday is population results revealed the potential for a significant under count of the Hispanic population nationwide. It will take more data to know for sure, he said, but if there are undercounts, it will make it harder to draw fair congressional and legislative seats in the coming months.“My gut tells me” that Hispanics who “got turned off by the Trump administration is actions and the citizenship issue probably did not participate in the census. That does not bode well for redistricting,” Brace said. Arturo Vargas, CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Education Fund, found it “surprising” that states with large Hispanic communities fell short of projections.“Once more details are released, we will be able to better determine to what extent the Latino population was fairly and accurately counted,” Vargas said in a statement. Still, half of the 10 states with the highest Hispanic populations — California, Illinois, New Mexico, New Jersey and New York — beat the Census Bureau is earlier estimates of their population growth. All five had significant statewide efforts to boost census participation, including a campaign of more than $180 million funded by California, which still lost a congressional seat. Vargas’ statement noted those efforts may have made a difference in beating estimates, however. The other five states with large Hispanic communities — Texas, Nevada, Florida, Arizona and Colorado — all came in under Census Bureau projections. Arizona had the largest miss in the country, with its population count coming in more than 3 percent below the Census Bureau estimate. Vargas had previously criticized the Trump administration for its failed attempt to include a citizenship question on the census and for attempting to exclude undocumented immigrants from the apportionment process. Before the actual head count started, his organization released multiple surveys that found more noncitizen and undocumented immigrant respondents saying they would not respond to the census than the general public. As many as three-quarters of respondents in those surveys expressed concerned about what the Trump administration would do with census responses. Those concerns also surfaced in multiple lawsuits over the Trump administration is actions and amid congressional oversight efforts. Federal law prevents the disclosure of census responses, and Census Bureau advertisements and outreach materials included that fact. However, the pandemic complicated in-person outreach and efforts to convince people to respond on their own by mail or online, Garcia said. He and other advocates had to pivot plans to convince people to respond in person to census door-knockers trying to find residents who failed to respond on their own. That added to the difficulty of convincing people frightened by the Trump administration is attempt to add a citizenship question to the process, Garcia said.“It was a perfect storm, and I think it should be pointed out that Donald Trump artificially seeded the clouds on that perfect storm,” Garcia said.",2,2,Roll Call
8,HEALTH CARE BRIEFING: Why Trump is Cocktail Inaccessible to Most,0.0,49.0,https://about.bgov.com/news/health-care-briefing-why-trumps-cocktail-inaccessible-to-most/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bloomberg-government-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-16,17,"The antibody cocktail President Donald Trump credited for his swift coronavirus recovery will not become widely available because it is impossible to make enough for everyone who might need it, according to the Swiss drugmaker working on scaling up production.“We will never be able to produce enough,” said Bill Anderson, drugs chief at Roche Holding, which is working together with US biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals on the project. “This is clearly part of the answer for the world, not the answer. Hopefully we will have vaccines and other the rapeutics.”The partners will probably be able to make as many as 2 million doses per year by the end of next March if the drug cocktail obtains regulatory approval, Anderson said. That is about the number of new Covid-19 cases identified worldwide in the past week. The necessity for a multipronged approach to treat Covid-19 has come into focus as potential safety issues emerge in late-stage trials of some promising vaccines and treatments. Eli Lilly this week paused a study of its own Covid-19 antibody to investigate such a concern. The US has already secured hundreds of thousands of doses of experimental Covid antibody treatments, federal health officials said earlier this month, before the Lilly trial was paused. At that point they expected to have 1 million doses on hand by the end of the year. Trump touted Regeneron is antibody cocktail as a cure, saying he’d make the drugs he took available for free to Americans. Read more from Naomi Kresge.

9,US Closes Chinese Consulate in Houston Amid Surge in Chinese Espionage Cases,-1.0,45.33,https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/07/22/us-trump-china-escalation-tensions-spying-closes-chinese-consulate-in-houston-chinese-espionage-cases/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,25,"The Trump administration ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston by Friday, a significant diplomatic escalation between the two rival powers. US officials who spoke toForeign Policyindicated that the consulate closure is a response to a surge in Chinese espionage in the USs. The Trump administration ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston by Friday, a significant diplomatic escalation between the two rival powers. US officials who spoke toForeign Policyindicated that the consulate closure is a response to a surge in Chinese espionage in the USs. Washington directed the closure of the consulate “to protect American intellectual property and Americans’ private information,” State Department spokesperson Morgan Ortagus said on Wednesday. Ortagus did not cite a specific incident that prompted the move, but she raised accusations that China violated US sovereignty. The closure was announced after a sweeping indictment was unsealed in federal court in Washington state outlining years of Chinese state-directed hacking and theft of intellectual property affecting victims across the USs and in other countries.“The USs will not tolerate the PRC is violations of our sovereignty and intimidation of our people, just as we have not tolerated the PRC is unfair trade practices, theft of American jobs, and other egregious behavior. President Trump insists on fairness and reciprocity in US-China relations,” Ortagus said, referring to the People is Republic of China. Chinese officials have vowed retaliation, raising the likelihood that a US consulate in China will be forced closed in response. “The US has far more diplomatic missions and staff working in China. So if the US is bent on going down this wrong path, we will resolutely respond,” Wang Wenbin, a foreign ministry spokesman, said to reporters on Wednesday. Reutersreports suggest that the US consulate in Wuhancould be closed in retaliation. How China chooses to retaliate could determine whether the situation spirals, said Larry Pfeiffer, who served as CIA chief of staff under former CIA Director Michael Hayden. “If they want to keep it from escalating the n picking a place like Wuhan would not be a bad one,” said Pfeiffer, noting that US diplomats were already evacuated from the consulate earlier this year during the coronavirus outbreak. “If they closed our Hong Kong or Shanghai consulate, that would be seen as an escalation,” he said. US officials have maintained that China, like other rival powers and the USs itself, uses its embassies and consulates for spying under the guise of routine diplomatic work.“There is always a certain amount of spy versus spy that gets tolerated, but this would suggest to me that the Chinese have stepped outside those norms of normal espionage,” Pfeiffer said. The USs ordering the closure of foreign diplomatic missions is a rarely used diplomatic step. The Trump administration in 2017 ordered Russia to shutter its consulate in San Francisco—alsoaccusedof being a base for espionage—as relations worsened between the two countries. Republican Senator Marco Rubio, acting chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee,tweeted: “#China is Houston consulate is a massive spy center, forcing it to close is long overdue.”“We are under siege from Chinese espionage, and they traditionally use their consulates for propaganda and espionage,” said Daniel Hoffman, a former senior executive Clandestine Services officer with the CIA who served three times as station chief overseas. “Houston is a big city, large manufacturing center, aeronautics, oil field equipment, high-tech, all things that would be of interest to China,” he added. China also apparently used the consulate in Houston as a base to pressure andintimidateUS energy firms that were carrying out projects in the disputed areas of the South China Sea.“In the bigger scheme of things, this is looking awfully like a 21st-century cold war,” Hoffman said. FBI Director Christopher Wray warned earlier this month that Chinese espionage was the “greatest long-term threat” to the USs economic and national security during a speech at the Hudson Institute in Washington, DC He cautioned that China was using a multifaceted approach “to become the world is only superpower by any means necessary,” and he said that the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case roughly every 10 hours.“The People is Republic of China has engaged for years in massive illegal spying and influence operations throughout the USs against US government officials and American citizens,” a State Department spokesperson told. “These activities have increased markedly in scale and scope over the past few years.”China is top spy agency, the Ministry of State Security, maintains an intelligence unit in California, likely run out of its consulate in San Francisco, according to a 2018 investigation from. Chinese hackers indicted this month in Washington worked with the Ministry of State Security. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a speech in February before the National Governors Association, accused China of meddling in US state affairs. “Chinese consulates in New York, in Illinois, in Texas, and two in California, bound by the diplomatic responsibilities and rights of the Vienna Convention, are very politically active at the state level, as is the embassy right here in Washington, DC,” Pompeo said. Pompeo said that in August 2019, former Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant “received a letter from a diplomat in the consul is office in Houston, threatening to cancel a Chinese investment if the governor chose to travel to Taiwan.”“Phil went anyway,” Pompeo said. As the State Department announced the closure on Wednesday, local authorities in Houston responded to reports of fires at the Chinese consulate, with witnesses reporting people in the consulate compound were burning files in trash cans, according to theHouston Chronicle.

You would not say, “Oh, Katie Hill, she is the one who is openly bisexual and was the first woman and the youngest person to hold her congressional seat, right?”You would not say, “I remember Katie Hill! She flipped a deep-red Republican district in California in her first ever race.” Or even, “Katie Hill—she is probably the only person to hold political office who can quote both Susan B Anthony and.”You would say, “Yes, Katie Hill—the one who resigned after her pictures were leaked.”If you know of Hill, you know a handful of the most traumatic and personal facts about her life. You do not know that she identifies with aTamora Pierceprotagonist (Sir Alanna of Trebond, of course) or that she has endometriosis or that in afresh man class which included Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, it was she who was elected to represent the group to leadership. You do not know that she reports feeling terrified to leave her husband, whom she is said was abusive (through lawyers, her ex-husband has denied any abuse), that she was suicidal after her scandal, and that a few months after she resigned, her brother, who had struggled with op io id addiction, died. Hill had a meteoric rise and an even faster fall: She was a former community college student who became the leader of a major nonprofit, the n launched and won a seemingly impossible run for Congress in a deep-red district by the time she was 31. In Congress she shone for exactly one year. Then a right-wing site published the photos, which promptly spread as only nude photos of a 29-year-old congresswoman can. Hill says the photos, some of which were taken without her knowledge, could have only come from her the n husband, who she says threatened to “ruin” her if she left him. Hereportedlysaid that he was hacked. The pictures showed that Hill and her the n husband were involved in a relationship with a younger woman, an employee of Hill is campaign. She resigned, with a resounding last stand of a speech on the floor of the House of Representatives. The fact that Hill is private photos were published is a tremendous act of violation. But the injustice was complicated by the fact that Hill did have a relationship that she knows was outside the bounds of appropriate behavior. It did not break congressional rules, but the relationship tainted Hill is image as a champion of the #MeToo movement. She apologized, but there was no taking it back. She was the boss. The relationship had been with a staffer. There should have been boundaries. There were not. That whole whirlwind—the allegedly abusive partner, the violating pictures, the uneven power dynamic, the perceived sordidness of a non-monogamous relationship—was compressed into one world for the public: scandal. Hill was shamed, blamed, and presumed to be out of politics forever. Not so fast, Hill says. The 31-year-old has a political PAC, called HER Time, that is dedicated to electing women. She has a new book,, that reads like the best possible combination ofSeventeen Magazineand feminist manifesto. She has a new podcast, cheekily namedNaked Politics. And she has a plan to set women free—a legislative project to aid women and girls in demanding a kind of freedom she has never enjoyed. Glamourasked Hill about life after public shame. It was this crucial time in my life, coming out of the trauma that happened with my ex-husband, and with the photos, and with resigning. And the n right after, within two months of when I resigned, my brother passed away. So being able to just sit down and tell my story—it was really the rapeutic. I feel like it is something that I needed to do for myself anyway, even if I had not been able to publish a book. I am glad that writing the book kind of forced me to do that, because I do not know if I would have been able to do that otherwise.[endometriosis, Hill has spoken openly about hersexuality, her gun ownership, dealing with emergency medical expenses, the fact that she once considered abortion but the n had a miscarriage, and her sexual assault and abuse experiences.]Yes! It is almost too strange, there are these experiences that happen to so many people, but they are all rolled into one with me. I do not know why during your life you go through things—and I think the re is got to be a reason behind it, and that is the only way I have been able to cope with it all. But I think part of my job is to tell these stories and hope that some of them have an impact on people. There still are not very many people in high-profile positions who talk about these things, so I kind of feel obliged to. I mean, I have got the scars from my surgery—it is one of those weird things where it is like, “How do I have to prove it to you that this happened?”To me, it feels like you have to be able to own it even more. It is about taking ownership of your own body and your own choices, and that is hard! It is a process for me to figure out—what are self-destructive behaviors that come in the wake of all this trauma, versus what are healthy coping ones? I do not necessarily have a good sense of what a normal sex life for me should look like. I am just trying to take my time with it, but I am 100% in on sex positivity. I do get nervous about any BDSM stuff, because of my own experiences with it as it tied into an abusive relationship—but other people doing that in a healthy and safe way? That is great for them. I tried to put into words our mission as feminists, as warriors, as women, which is to ensure that women are really guaranteed a few basic things—consideration, autonomy, safety, equality, and power. We do need to achieve equal power for any of these things to happen, which means electing women and installing women into positions of power at every level—whether it is in government, in media, in nonprofits, in the corporate world. And there is a real legislative agenda that can move us in the right direction for all of this. What came out of the book was 10 real legislative goals that have either been composed or passed at the House, or passed at certain state and local levels, but have been blocked at the national level by Republicans. I do not even think this should be a partisan issue! But it is. With HER Time, the PAC that I started, the overarching goal is to be able to elect women and the n push forward this agenda. And I am hoping we can get that to become a movement. The biggest thing I learned from it is that when I started to campaign, it truly felt like a movement and these people were my friends. That should not have been the case, because I was paying them. I truly do believe that the #MeToo movement and everything related to the abuse of power is really driven by patriarchy and power over women, so I do not think the case is the same. But I do think we all have to be taking stock of that, and it is not something that I did. I did not think of myself that way, and that was a mistake. You have to set your clear boundaries from the beginning. More than anything it probably just boils down to: Do not shit where you eat. Starting three and a half years ago, when I entered the space of becoming a candidate, I really was skyrocketing. I just kept going and going and going up, and the n I just fell, like, off a cliff. Now the rebuilding part is slower. It is like you are climbing out of a canyon and you are trying to find the most efficient way out, and also knowing that the re is danger in coming out too fast, but also you have got this really strong desire to get out as fast as you can. With the outside parties that were in play, and my ex, I think that I very much came from the mindset of, “I am not just going to sit here and kind of stew in this and be quiet for any lengthy period of time, I have to get back on my feet.” I have been a horseback rider for basically my whole life, and when you fall, the number one thing you are taught, that is just drilled into you, is that you have to get right back on. The reasoning behind that is that you get a fear, really quick, it gets instilled in you, and it kind of becomes unbreakable if you do not immediately get back on. You have to know that you do it. I think that is kind of where I am right now—I got back on the horse. I might not ever be at the level where I was before, but I got back on. Samantha and Felicity. Oh, it is Serena.

11,Meet the Smith College employee whistleblower exposing anti-white racism,14.0,36.0,https://www.thecollegefix.com/meet-the-smith-college-employee-whistleblower-exposing-anti-white-racism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-college-fix-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,23,"An employee at Smith College in Massachusetts has been making videos detailing the creation of a “hostile work environment” for her as a white person.“I am very, very concerned about this issue, not just for the Smith community, but for communities at other colleges and work places too,” Jodi Shaw told in an email. Shaw, an alumnus of the school, currently works as an administrative assistant in the Department of Student Affairs at the elite women is college.“I am white, which really should not be relevant, but my employer has made it clear that, not only is it relevant, but it is possibly one of most important or if not the most important feature of me as a human,” Shaw said in a video posted to herYouTube channel. As of now, Shaw has made a total of four videos detailing her experience at work. The first is titled: “Dear Smith College: I Have a Few Requests.”“I ask that Smith College stop reducing my personhood to a racial category,” she says. Shaw also claims that “a lot” of other staff members feel the same way. Those staffers have not come forward. Shaw goes on to offer a blistering indictment of critical race theory, attacking the idea that white people have built an unconquerable system of racism against which people of color are powerless.“I believe my value lies in the quality of my work, the goodness of my deeds, the essence of my character, and the fullness of my heart, not my skin color,” she says. According to Shaw, there is an “ever-present terror” at Smith “that any unverified student allegation of racism, or any other ‘-ism,’ has the power to crush our reputations, ruin our livelihood, and even endanger the physical safety of ourselves or our family members.”Shaw later went on the podcastto describe what she was referencing. On July 31, 2018, a staffer saw student Oumou Kanoute lounging in a dining hall. Believing she was out of place, the staffer called unarmed campus police to investigate. When the officer arrived on the site, he recognized Kanoute, saw nothing was wrong, and left. Given a platform by the ACLU, Kanoute would claim that she was “racially profiled,”creating a firestorm on campus. An independent investigation, however,foundthat the employee who called the police did not violate any campus policies. After Shaw posted the first video to her channel, an HR representative came to a meeting with her supervisor, she told “We know about your video,” she told Shaw. Shaw was the n assigned a “campus safety partner” — which is another name for a campus police officer — to whom she could turn if she felt “unsafe.”“It felt strange and I do not know if Smith is actually concerned about me or just concerned about fulfilling obligations necessary to maintain their liability policy,” Shaw said, though she also said she assumes it is the latter. Publicly, the college threw Shaw under the bus.“This past week, an employee of the college posted a personal video to express their concerns about the college is programming to promote racial justice,” wrote Smith College President Kathleen McCartney in a statement.“This employee does not speak for the college or any part of the college. Further, we believe the video mis characterizes the college is important, ongoing efforts to build a more equitable and inclusive living, learning and working environment,” she wrote.“The National Labor Relations Act protects employees who engage in concerted activities, including speech, with respect to workplace conditions,” McCartney writes. Shaw is particularly skeptical of this sentence.“I feel like this paragraph is code for: ‘We would fire her, but we ca not, because the re is this law that says we ca not…otherwise she would totally be fired,’” Shaw said in a second video de constructing the statement. One reason for her disbelief is the existence of a college policy protecting the “free exchange of ideas,” as Shaw calls it. According to Shaw, it is suspicious that McCartney cites the National Labor Relations Act rather than any freedom-of-expression policies at Smith. In a third video, Shaw describes an experience she had while organizing a library orientation for students. As a candidate for a full-time library position, she was told to “do something crazy.” She decided to perform a rap to get students acquainted with the library system. While she was preparing for the orientation, the incident with Kanoute occurred. According to Shaw, the campus “went into overdrive” and created a very “racially tense environment.”A supervisor wrote in an email to Shaw, “The use of rap as a medium by a white staff member and student could easily be perceived as insensitive or cultural appropriation by incoming Smith students and could create a perception with students that the library is not racially sensitive.”In an in-person conversation with the supervisor, Shaw asked if she would be able to do the rap if she were a person of color. Without hesitation, the supervisor replied, “Yes.”“I honestly believed that, if I filed a complaint…nobody would ever hire me at Smith College or anywhere,” Shaw said. Because of that event, as well as suspicion that the department would not want to hire a white person, she withdrew her application for the position and took on her current role. After Shaw posted this video,, Smith is student newspaper, wrote a November 2storyon Shaw. While Shaw agreed to an interview withThe Sophian, she is only directly quoted once. Shaw told that, while she did not read the story, colleagues told her that “it did not do a fair job of portraying the issues which is unfortunate as it denies members of the Smith College community access to information in an objective, fair manner.”The fourth and most recent video as of November 11 describes Shaw is experience at a faculty retreat, the first day of which would see her and her colleagues discuss their “identities.”Shaw was told to sit in a group and talk about her race “in the context of your childhood, your adolescence, and your college years.”Uncomfortable talking about such subjects in a work environment, Shaw abstained from the discussion. Hours later, a facilitator told the group, “Any white person who expresses discomfort about or distress or any kind of resistance toward talking about their race when asked to is not actually experiencing discomfort, so do not feel like you should comfort them because it is not discomfort. It is called ‘white fragility,’ and it is a power play.”Shaw saw this as “a public humiliation.”“This was framed as a manipulative maneuver on my part,” said Shaw. “It was an act of aggression, me saying I am uncomfortable.”Shaw told that more videos are forthcoming. They will feature her take on “specific incidents that took place on Smith College campus between [the Kanoute incident] to the present that I believe are all a product of and a contributor to the hostile environment at Smith and excellent examples of the ideological stranglehold Smith seeks to maintain over its community.”contacted the Smith College public relations department, but it did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Shaw is videos have garnered national attention from TV hosts such asTucker Carlson, who had Shaw on as a guest.“I consider myself a liberal,” Shaw told, “and while I wish more liberals would speak out against this, I recognize it is an issue that concerns all of us and is an area that both conservatives and liberals can (and should) join forces on. This is not the time for division.”“I continue to work in a hostile work environment that feels more hostile since releasing the video.”IMAGE: Jodi Shaw Smith College Big Dig/YouTubeLikeon Facebook/Follow us on Twitter",1,1,The College Fix
12,4 key takeaways from Oregon is election,-1.0,46.33,https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/11/4-key-takeaways-from-oregons-election.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-04,25,"A record2.3 million-plusOregon voters had their say in this fall is general election, deciding races from local ballot measures and city councils to the US Senate. Here are some of the takeaways from Oregon voters' decisions. Unlike nationally, few Oregon races are undecided after election night. Oregon is well-oiled vote-by-mail system delivered decisive results in the vast majority of contests Tuesday night. Oregon issix contested seats in Congress, its three races for statewide state office, nearly all legislative races and key money measures: all were decided shortly after the balloting deadline, thanks to swift action by voters and election officials. The few key races still pending -- two key Oregon Senate races that will help decide the balance of power in the Legislature, a tight race for Gresham mayor, a relatively minor ballot measure about Portland Water Bureau billing rights -- are worth watching, but do not remotely approach the national breath-holding over the presidential race. Oregon Democrats' grip on state office is strong. Oregon has tilted blue for some time. But this year is election results reinforced the state is Democratic voters' dominance. The statewide votes for former Vice President Joe Biden to become president and incumbent Senator Jeff Merkley to serve another term were overwhelming, as were the votes to install the three Democratic candidates for statewide office -- incumbents Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum and Treasurer Tobias Read and newcomer Shemia Fagan as secretary of state. Oregonians want people to be free to use drugs. Two ballot measures, one to one to decriminalize possession of most street drugs and the other to allow supervised use of psilocybin, passed overwhelmingly Tuesday. Both are nationally notable, as they mark the first time any state has permitted the non-prosecuted possession or use of substances. To be fair, backers of the measure to decriminalize drugs, many of whom are former addicts with long records of hard-won sobriety, said they want people caught with small amounts of heroin, meth and other drugs to get assessed and treated to end their addiction, not to keep using. But it would not be a crime for them to do so. Multnomah County voters are soft on taxes for causes including parks, libraries, schoolsA global pandemic that has struck Oregon hard in recent this year and torpedoed the US employment market has not stopped Multnomah County voters from endorsing taxes increases or keeping property taxes at current levels to aid kids, library users, parks-goers and the like.

13,We Need a MAGA 2.0,21.33,29.33,https://amgreatness.com/2021/01/15/we-need-a-maga-2-0/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-greatness-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-15,25,"With all sincerity, what was the “Stop the Steal” rally supposed to accomplish? When you think about millions of unhappy Americans traveling to Washington, DC to express their unhappiness with the results of the 2020 elections, one is left to ponder whether that energy needed to be directed elsewhere, or if there should have been a different message for the event? Everyone at that rally had the right to be unhappy and to protest, but just because they were within their rights does not make that action the right choice for the moment. Much like waiting until after he contracted COVID-19 to start conveying a more aggressive message about re-opening the economy, President Trump led a rally that was many days late and many dollars short. As we approach the 300th day of15 days to flatten the curve, it is becoming apparent that taking a backseat to the Fauci-Birx-Redfield triumvirate and allowing the country to fall under the rule of the White House Coronavirus Task Force doomed the president is reelection chances more thanSharpies in Arizona. In short, the time to “stop the steal” wasElection Day. An “open the country” or “take off your mask” rally would have been more productive for the more than 74 million Americans seeking to reclaim their freedom. Because of the ugliness of January 6, it is tempting to be gaslighted into thinking President Trump is administration was an unmitigated disaster. There were foreign policy wins and tax cuts. His outsider status exposed the manyRINOswho populate the Republican Party. His exposure of media bias pushed the mainstream media ever deeper in the tank for the Left, further eroding its public image. His outreach to different racial and ethnic communities produced greater support in those demographics. Yet, because he is a flawed human like us all, his ability to create his movement came with heavy baggage. His boorishness has been documented ad nauseam. More relevant to where we are today is the reality that while he was bestowed the magic “R” by the Republican Party, he is not a principled conservative. Rather, he is a septuagenarian businessman who loves the country and understands marketing. That unleashed the MAGA movement and many red hats, much like President Obama is “Hope and Change.”Unfortunately, MAGA also was revealed as an ambiguous slogan that faltered when we needed it in March 2020. Principled conservatives who are guided by freedom and liberty would not allow the mselves to become the face of putting a multitrillion-dollar economy “on pause.” One who believes that citizens are responsible for their own risk tolerance in life would seek to inform rather than mandate. Nothing guided the messaging on COVID policy beyond declaring preemptive victory over the virus. This emboldened a determination to enact an unprecedented level of government intervention, even in states with trifecta Republican control of the state government. We can have the federalism debate all we want, but regardless, a strong leader owns a crisis response. The president is reactionary style contributed to the communication of a hodgepodge message about the government is COVID strategy. Even as we sit here to day, what the COVID endgame? The public signed on to saving hospital capacity but has been conditioned to believe that we are seeking zero COVID cases, which effectively ends our culture as a free country. Thus, it is now crucial that patriots thank Donald Trump for the awakening, but it is time to move on to MAGA 2.0. MAGA 1.0 was about Donald Trump and effectively ended on January 6. MAGA 2.0 is about infusing the culture with the energy and onus behind the original movement. As the late Andrew Breitbart noted, politics is downstream from culture. The current political climate that has Communist analogies is rooted in the Right ceding the culture battle to the Left. Reclaiming some semblance of liberty involves infusing popular culture with that spirit for freedom. Whether Joe Biden is victory was legitimate or not, more than 74 million Americans cast a vote for the candidate who, to their minds, stood for challenging the uni party political system of cronyism. MAGA 2.0 needs to harness the energy created by Trump is ascendency but refocus that energy away from how one man was wronged and into local communities and culture. More than 80 percent of the counties in the USs voted for Trump. At least a few of them can be governed as far to the Right as California is to the Left. Many of these areas should declare the mselves “constitutional sanctuaries”that reject COVID coercion and promote freedom of expression. MAGA 2.0 should also encourage dollars to flow to businesses that are pro-freedom. Liberty sells. It is tough to refute the notion that long, unkempt facial hair and camouflage clothing are now stylish because a family of God-fearing duck hunters in Louisianahad one of the most popular shows on television a few years ago. Most politicians on the Right are not leaders, they are followers who are constantly ceding ground to the spirit of the age. They do not drive the culture, they follow the trends. Very few are Ron DeSantis, Kristi Noem, Chip Roy, or Thomas Massie. Those like Mike DeWine, Larry Hogan, Eric Holcomb, and Liz Cheney are more common. Yet, if the 75 million Americans who voted for Trump demanded toughness from all elected public servants, you’d eventually see more of the former and less of the latter. The Georgia runoff sent a signal about what people did not want. But that can only go so far. That is why MAGA 2.0 really needs to be less about making America great again and more about making America free again.",1,0,American Greatness

On the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, the city of New Orleans was struck by this storm and left broken yet again. Sixteen years ago, I was starting my senior year of high school () and witnessed the destruction of New Orleans in statewide media, the national coverage, and from the accounts of those who evacuated to my high school. We had a handful of new classmates that year who came to us from the Catholic schools of New Orleans, and they had stories to tell. But we all watched as New Orleans became what felt like a developing world country. The streets were flooded for what seemed like forever. The government proved ineffective to help them. There were people stranded on rooftops for days. The Superdome became a long-term shelter for those displaced. Governor Kathleen Blanco blamed the federal government. The Bush administration blamed Blanco. The city of New Orleans blamed everyone else. It was a catastrophic failure at practically every level, and no one really seemed to get that there were lessons to be learned. Katrina would ultimately prove to be Blanco is downfall. Bobby Jindal came in and, to his credit, it appears he did fight to get the levee systems of New Orleans in working order, and some improvements were made. But the city itself had made very few changes to allow for the residents to be ready to move in the event of another disaster. Even after sixteen years, it appears the only thing that changed was the levee systems. Everything else failed again. But the biggest failure of all seems to be a lack of an evacuation plan. New Orleans is confusing as hell to navigate into and through on the best of days. Twenty years ago, there was a solution to this, and it was implemented by Jeb Bush.

To address these issues, Governor Jeb Bush appointed a Governor is Hurricane Evacuation Task Force— Gabe Hoffman (@GabeHoff)August 28, 2021There are numerous ways to enter and exit New Orleans, but given the geography of the state, evacuating the city is a hassle during a crisis. By having something like the contraflow system in place, the state would make it significantly easier to get people out in times of major weather events like Hurricane Ida. Right now, the city is completely without power. Cell service is sporadic at best in and around New Orleans. Transmission towers fell into the Mississippi River. Many people are stuck where they are with no power and no phones. They are completely in the dark, and it is not because they chose to stay. For the vast majority, many simply could not leave. What is worse is that the city will be relying on not just the state but the federal government for assistance to get through. But three hours to its west is Lake Charles, which still has gotten none of the federal assistance it was promised by the government after Hurricane Laura. It, too, remains in tatters and struggling to recover a year later. The federal government is being run by the Biden administration, who over the last two weeks has proven it is incapable of even formulating a plan, much less following through on it. Everything about the withdrawal from Afghanistan has been a disaster and the leaks from the intelligence and military communities heavily imply every issue has been self-inflicted rather than as a result of the Taliban is sudden rise to power. I have no doubt that New Orleans will recover. It took some time after Katrina, but this time the levees appear to have held up and there is no major flooding in the city. That is an improvement, but the inability of the government at any level — local, state, or federal — to have done anything to mitigate the damage or to speed up the recovery is still proof that we have a long way to go in protecting our citizens from these threats in the future.",1,0,RedState

The rule reduced the number of streams, marshes and other wetlands that fall under federal protection. EPA Administrator Michael Regan said it “is leading to significant environmental degradation.”With the announcement, the Biden administration is wading into a decades-long battle over how far federal officials can go to stop contaminants from entering small streams and other wetlands. ajoint statement with the Army Corps of Engineers, the EPA said it will work on a new policy that increases waterway habitats for wildlife and provides safe drinking water for millions of Americans.“The science says those streams and these wetlands are an important part of our clean-water system in the USs and should be protected,” Tom Kiernan, head of American Rivers, told The Washington Post. But the Trump administration yielded to home developers, oil drillers and growers who considered the regulations associated with the Clean Water Act too onerous. Regan said the Trump-era rule limiting the number of protected waterways gave a green light to 333 projects that would have previously required a Clean Water Act dredge-and-fill permit. The Biden EPA is moving to reverse the Trump admin is sweeping rollback of the Clean Water Act, taking on an issue that has plagued farm country Democrats for more than a decade. that the regulations surrounding clean water have been a constant source of partisan fighting:The issue of which streams and wetlands are subject to federal regulation has been the source of intense debate virtually since the Clean Water Act was passed, and has been a legal and political quagmire for the past decade and a half after the Supreme Court issued a pair of muddled opinions that created enormous confusion on the ground.

17,What Was the Debt-Ceiling Showdown Really All About?,10.67,29.67,https://www.thebulwark.com/what-was-the-debt-ceiling-showdown-really-all-about/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-05,17,"The Western liberal tradition to which we belong has as it foundation two things: proportional representation of the will of the people and capitalism. Both are equally as important. One cannot survive without the other. Yes, the Europeans may be a bit more socialist leaning, but democracy has never survived true socialism or communism. And there are no precedents for capitalism flourishing in systems that reject proportional representation. In essence, any vote against capitalism—that is, capitalism at its core, not its regulatory edges—is anti-democratic. And vice versa. Yet, voting against capitalism is what what the entire Republican Senate minority just did. No thing, and no person, has economic value in a vacuum. All value—like all motion—is relative. Value (and thus price) is the relationship of one thing to another. The entire discipline of what we call “finance” is an exercise in making relative valuations. But to start, finance had to settle on a reference point—a “risk free” thing which could be used as a yardstick for everything else, so that everything else can be priced accordingly. While everyone knows there is no such thing as a “risk free” investment in an absolute sense, the mechanism that finance chose made sense: government bonds. In particular, U. S government bonds. And in even more particular, the 10 year Treasury yield. Every mortgage, every auto loan, every wage—everythingis priced relative to the value of the risk-free rate—the US 10 year Treasury yield. The reason why government bonds are considered risk free is because the y, by definition, are. A bond is an obligation of a country to pay a holder of that obligation at a future date. That obligation is met through something else owned by the country—meaning currency. It is impossible for a country to default on its own bonds, because it could just create more currency to meet the obligations. Which means that there is only one way to default on sovereign debt—willfully. But the debt!Perhaps one of the most disingenuous (but effective) arguments put forward in modern politics was the case for conservative “fiscal responsibility.”You have to manage your own debt, so why should not the government?That line makes sense to people. Building on this parochial bedrock, conservatives flirted many times with the idea of the businessman-president until finally nominating Donald Trump, a bankruptcies vitamin hawker who played the role of businessman on TV Under President Trump the size of government grew to its largest levels since the 1960s. Never mind the fact governments probably should not be run like a business, or a household because it turns out that there is no constituency for fiscal conservatism. Despite what conservatives have said for 40 years, their revealed preference is clearly for bigger government and more spending. And you know what? As a policy matter, that is okay. Can debt grow so large it topples the financial order? Sure. But as of 2021, in sum, the USs has a net worth (assets-liabilities) of $132 trillion. The Biden administration is proposal to take on $3.5 trillion of national debt over 10 years to reduce significantly the greatest risk to our mature civilization—which is wealth inequality—would lower America is national net worth by around 2.25 percent. That is it. We would be spending 2.25 percent in order to cut child poverty in half. Would you as an individual donate 2.25 percent of your personal net worth to cut child poverty in half? I bet you would. I bet you would even donate 2.25 percent of your net worth over a 10 year period to cut child poverty in half for just one family. Prices are relative and this price is not all that high relative to the good we’d be purchasing. Of course, there could be side effects. The plan might not cut child poverty in half. There could be inflation. There may be prudential reasons not to enact it. But to argue that the size is so onerous is wrong-headed. Back to willful default. The Senate Republicans who now fashion the mselves as champions of fiscal responsibility were willing to turn the risk free rate—on whichever y asset is priced—into a non-risk free rate by refusing to raise the debt ceiling. They were voting for America to default. This is not just hypocritical. It is also another attack on democracy. Because if the risk free rate had been made risky, the n the n financial calamity would have been unspeakable. Because again: Functioning democracy is intertwined with functioning capital markets. During the first and second Trump impeachments, a number of Republicans voted to remove Trump, and so we thought,Hey, as long as we have Mitt Romney and the others, the re is hope. But the problem is that these Republicans are not thinking expansively enough about democracy. About what democracy is. About what democracy requires. It is not just rejecting Donald Trump is cult of personality. It is understanding and supporting the policies which make democracy possible. Even when such support runs counter to the party is daily marching orders. All 50 Republicans in the Senate voted not to raise the debt ceiling and the refore willfully default on America is debt. That vote was just as antithetical to a functioning democracy as was the votes to decertify the election results on January 6. For democracy and capitalism to survive, they need each other. And we need a better class of Republicans. Even the “good Republicans.”",1,1,The Bulwark

As that prediction materializes, the president is behavior has triggered several conservatives to issue warnings about his deteriorating mental health. The most comprehensive comes from Peter Wehner, who served under three Republican presidents and is now a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank. Reacting to some of Trump is more inflammatory tweets over the weekend, Wehnerrefers to the president as “a damaged soul with a disordered personality.”It does not take a person with an advanced degree in psychology to see Trump is narcissism and lack of empathy, his vindictiveness and pathological lying, his impulsivity and callousness, his inability to be guided by norms, or his shamelessness and dehumanization of those who do not abide his wishes. His condition is getting worse, not better—and there are now fewer people in the administration able to contain the president and act as a check on his worst impulses…Whether the worst scenarios come to pass or not is right now unknowable. But what we know is that the president is a person who seems to draw energy and purpose from maliciousness and transgressive acts, from creating enmity among people of different races, religions, and backgrounds, and from attacking the weak, the honorable, and even the dead. Donald Trump is not well, and as long as he is president, our nation is not safe. Leading the charge of conservatives commenting on the president is mental health is George Conway. Right now he is best known as the husband of Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump. But he also made a name for himself by representing Paula Jones in her lawsuit against Bill Clinton. Conway has been expressing his concerns about the president recently on Twitter. This was the end of a stream where he reacted to some of Trump is lies. Whether or not impeachment is in order, a serious inquiry needs to be made about this man is condition of mind.— George Conway (@gtconway3d)March 14, 2019Conwaytweetedthe diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder and asked, “Tell us,@realDonaldTrump—which of these diagnostic criteria do you not satisfy?” To explain, het weeted a link to an article in Rolling Stone titled, “Trump is Mental Health: Is Pathological Narcissism the Key to Trump is Behavior?”At one point, Conway teamed up with Bill Kristol to express his concern. Agree with this, but would add that *all* Americans should be thinking seriously *now* about Trump is mental condition and psychological state, including and especially the media, Congress—and the Vice President and Cabinet.— George Conway (@gtconway3d)March 18, 2019Jennifer Rubinjoinedthe bandwagon. Whether meant seriously or not, Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein is alleged consideration of the 25th Amendment seems, in retrospect, not to have been irrational at all. Since President Trump is firing of James B Comey as FBI director and the appointment of a special counsel, Trump is mental and emotional health has seemed to fray. The pace of lies and nonsensical accusations, the resort to conspiracy the ories and refusal to conduct himself like an adult (let alone the president) often pick up in the wake of bad news from the special counsel and widespread criticism of the president is unhinged behavior. So it was this weekend following his refusal to directly condemn white nationalism in the wake of the New Zealand massacre and the defection of 12 Senate Republicans last week on the resolution repealing the emergency declaration. These are not warnings coming from partisans seeking to undermine the opposition. Instead, they are clarion calls from conservatives to Republicans currently in office and those serving in Trump is cabinet to take the situation seriously, before it is too late.",0,1,Washington Monthly

22,Senator Wyden urges government to boost broadband speed targets,0.0,48.0,https://www.engadget.com/senator-ron-wyden-broadband-stimulus-funding-speed-targets-180345407.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/engadget-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-25,15,"Although the government has pledged to help expand high-speed broadband access in communities that need it, officials need to expand the eligibility criteria, according to Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR). President Joe Bidensignedthe American Rescue Plan Act into law in March. It directs the Treasury Department to distribute billions of dollars in stimulus funding to local and state governments. Those funds can be used to improve broadband access, but the bill severely limits the eligibility criteria for such projects. The bill says that only unserved or under served communities can use the federal funding to improve broadband access, asnotes. According to the Federal Communications Commission, communities with internet speeds of under 25 Mbps down and 3 Mbps up are underserved. That definition has remained the same since 2015. Wyden says those speeds are not nearly fast enough for current needs, calling that benchmark ""woefully outdated."" He wants communities where speeds are less than 100 Mbps up and down to be classed as under served and to be eligible for upgraded internet infrastructure under this plan.“The mass adoption of video calling, streaming, and other bandwidth-intensive ap ps by Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that miserly speeds and data caps are holding back telework, remote education and tele health capacity,” Wyden wrote i na letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. “Simply put, it is not possible for a family of four to tele work and engage in remote schooling while sharing 3 Mbps of upload bandwidth.”Wyden went on to argue that a failure to address concerns “will further expand the digital divide and jeopardize our ability as a nation to build back better from the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, as you finalize the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds Final Rule, I urge [Yellen] to clarify that under served locations include anywhere affordable, reliable broadband of at least 100 Mbps symmetric is not available."" Wyden added that ""to be accessible, broadband must also be affordable.""Other lawmakers have been pushing the FCC to upgrade the definition of high-speed broadband to 100 Mbps up and down. Earlier this month, California announced a budget plan that earmarked $9 billion for internet infrastructure, noting that ""service at speeds below 100 Mbps is not enough for households who are juggling the demands of distance learning, telework, and accessing health care online.""",2,2,Engadget
23,Losing Culture Wars: How Conservatives Aid the “Trans” Agenda,27.67,19.33,https://thenewamerican.com/losing-culture-wars-how-conservatives-aid-the-trans-agenda/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,16,"If you want to know why conservatives are batting almost zero in the culture war, consider the recent story about a MUSS (Made-up Sexual Status, or “trans”) activist who suggested rhetorically that all children should be put on puberty blockers. For while attempting to oppose the MUSS agenda, some conservative outlets reporting on the matter did, unwittingly and as usual, enable that agenda. The story was sparked by one Zachary Antolak, a man claiming womanhood who goes by the name “Lauren McNamara” when he is not going by the name “Zinnia Jones” and who tweeted the following:If children ca not consent to puberty blockers which pause any permanent changes even with the relevant professional evaluation, how can they consent to the permanent and irreversible changes that come with their own puberty with no professional evaluation whatsoever?I will not address the tweet is substance here, except to say the activist is making a rhetorical argument that was refuted wonderfully by commentator Drew Belsky. For what is more troubling than Antolak is sophistry is conservatives’ leftism-born terminology. For example, TheBlaze is Phil Shiverwrote, among other things, that the activist “arguedin her [sic!] tweet thread that puberty became ‘optional’” due to technology, related Belsky. That “TheBlaze would use female pronouns to describe this man is disgraceful,” Belsky the n writes. “‘Zinnia Jones’ was not just ‘born male.’ Hemale and always will be,” he explains.“He cannot be anything else,” Belsky continues. “To call a man ‘she’ and ‘her’ is to be comp licit in transgender insanity. It is twice as damaging when conservatives, who purport to hold the moral high ground, join liberal sexual deviants in pushing the linguistic envelope.”Preach it, brother (except that the re is no such thing as “transgender,” either). I have been writing for almost 20 years now about how too many conservatives are “connedservatives” who, while fighting the culture destroyers, cede half the battle before it has even begun by embracing their Newspeak. As to this, Stuart Chase pointed out in his book that the side that defines the vocabulary of a debate wins the debate. Yet decade after decade conservatives have obediently parroted the Lexicon of the Left, which is generally originated by left-wing academics and the n popularized by left-wing media. Thus have I heard conservatives say not “illegal alien” but “undocumented worker” (akin to calling a rapist an undocumented husband). They also may call semi-automatic rifles “assault weapons,” black Americans “African-Americans,” “sex” “gender” (humans are of one sex or the other;have gender) — and now a man by feminine pronouns. Controlling the language is imperative (which is why our Left manipulates it, as evil forces will do — e.g., the Nazis). Just imagine, for example, that French and German cultures were vying for primacy in a certain region. If the Germans could convince the French to speak German, how severely handicapped would the French be in their culture war?What conservatives do is a bit as if European Jews had said during WWII, using a pejorative the Nazis applied to the m, “We[sub-humans] must fight for our human rights.” Or it is as if we’d proclaimed pep-talk style during the same period, using a pejorative the Imperial Japanese applied to Americans, “We hairy white apes will show ’em who really has the brains!”In the MUSS agenda is case, its activists’ central claim is that you can be an opposite-sex member (or another “gender,” as they put it) just by willing it. And referring to a man using feminine pronouns is. We are essentially saying, “We accept your ‘identity,’ but…” But what?You have lost. Thus proceeding is to buttress the MUSS agenda claim that certain people have a biologically induced brain-body sex mismatch requiring a biological remedy, as opposed to a psychological issue requiring a psychological remedy. It is to say, “Your ‘cure’ is real — just do not offer it to kids with the same problem.”Aside from being a bit confused, the issue is also that too many conservatives are scared, afraid to truly transgress against political correctness is tenets. We have to “respect” a person is identity, right? (OK, the n I identify as Oh Great and Superior Master). So they are left arguing against the extremes of political correctness — within the framework of political correctness. They will fight over the Left is corollaries after accepting the Left is propositions. Now perhaps it is obvious why GK Chesterton observed that the “business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected.”When conservatives accept the Left is words when using words to battle the Left, well, it is a bit like using the Left is voting machines when trying to win an election.",0,0,The New American
24,How To Stop Cops From Killing People Suffering From Mental Illness,-7.33,45.33,https://newsone.com/4009086/how-to-stop-cops-from-killing-people-suffering-from-mental-illness/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsone-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-05,15,"When Joe Prude called the police on his brother, he was asking for help:,who suffered from mental health problems, had run almost naked out of his Rochester, New York, house into the snow. When officers arrived, new video footage shows, the March 23 encounter quickly turned violent, and Prude died from asphyxiation under a hood officers had put over his head. Two years prior, in 2018,Shukri Ali Saidof Georgia also wound up dead after leaving her house during a mental health crisis on April 23, 2018. Police, called in to help, found Said standing at an intersection holding a knife. Officers shot her five times in the neck and chest, killing her. That same month, in New York, officers answered a 911 call about a black man waving something that looked like a gun. In fact, it was a pipe. But whenSaheed Vassell, a 34-year-old father with mental illness who was well known in his Brooklyn community, pointed it at police, they shot him dead. Prude, Vassell and Said are among the hundreds of people with intellectual disabilities or mental illnesses in the USskilled by police every year. According toThe Washington Post, 197 of the 999 people shot by police last year had a mental illness. Police are almost always the first responders in cases of mental health crises in the USs, as they are in criminal and medical emergencies. But the police – who are trained to give orders and use force when they feel endangered – are generally ill-equipped to handle people with mental health challenges. As a disability and ethics scholar who focuses on criminal justice, I know this country has long failed to justly and humanely care for people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities. For most of American history, people with mental health disabilities were locked away in hospital-like institutions, many of them state-run. Starting in the 1950s, the physical and sexual abuse common in these facilities, as well as other inhumane practices, spurred a decades-long effort to close them down and return residents to the community. This process, calleddeinstitutionalization, was meant to replace institutions with local mental health centers that would provide community-based mental health treatment and assistance for those recently released from institutions. However, in 1981Ronald Reagancut most funding for these centers. And since other existing community services– like schools, housing and health services – were not adapted to meet the needs of these new community members, many were left jobless, homeless and unable to get a good education. Today, the 15% ofAmericanswiththesedisabilitiesstill have very little support. Some people are fortunate enough to live with their families or in one of the USs’ roughly500 private residential facilities– places that can cost up toUS$60,000 a year. Others end uphomeless, in poorly run facilities or even in jails. But everyone with these disabilities is at high risk of interacting with police. Too often, these interactions go poorly. In hopes of identifying practices that prevent avoidable deaths, I have been interviewing people with intellectual and developmental disabilities about their experiences with the criminal justice system. Under the terms of the academic ethics boards overseeing my research, the names of all my interview subjects are protected. One reason police encounters can go wrong, I have learned, is that people with intellectual disabilities often struggle to comprehend spoken instructions – particularly in a high-stress situation.“People who do not have [an intellectual disability] do not have a hard time understanding what the police are asking them to do,” one man told me. “It is different for me.”Being overwhelmed can cause people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities tos hut down. If this behavior is interpreted asobstinate, it can lead to arrest, detention or police aggression. People with these disabilities are also often disbelieved by the police. A woman I interviewed – who communicated slowly due to her disabilities – said she called 911 on her boyfriend for hitting her. But the police believed the boyfriend is story that she was the violent one and arrested her instead.“When they find out that you are not capable of understanding what is going on, it is a free-for-all,” another interview subject told me. People with intellectual disabilities may struggle in court, too. When one interviewee did not understand a judge is question, he told me, he was sentenced to three months in county jail for disorderly conduct. Judges and lawyers “need to listen to people that is on disability,” said the woman arrested after calling 911 on her abusive partner, urging patience. Recognizing that they struggle to handle people in mental crisis, many US cities are making efforts to improve outcomes. New York Citytrains some officers incr isis intervention and recently mandated that a social worker must accompany officers to such cases. Denver is looking to adopt a mobile crisis intervention program started in Oregon that ensures medics and crisis workers, not police, respond to mental health calls. These and similar efforts nationwide are a step in the right direction. But my research indicates they may not go far enough. Police frequently encounter people with psychiatric disabilities when someone calls 911 about a person acting unusually in public. If police perceive that person as potentially violent, the situation can quickly escalate. That is howAnthony Hill, a black veteran found wandering around his Atlanta apartment complex naked, died in 2015. Hill, who had gone off his medication, ran toward Officer Robert Olsen, who shot him. Olsen was sentenced to12 years in prison on November 1, 2019, for aggravated assault and violating his oath of office. Nor do laws targeting police violence address the factors that lead people with mental health disabilities to need emergency assistance in the first place. Despite growing recognition of the stigma around mental illness, people with mental health disabilities are often stillfeared, pitied and associated with violence in TV and movies. This social stigma can lead to societal rejection and isolation. And the difficulties people with mental health challenges face finding adequate housing, health care and employment all increase their risk of involvement with the criminal justice system. One lesson from the history of American mental health care is that reforming just one problematic aspect of the systemdoes not work. To serve this population is needs, other institutions – from education to housing – must also be made more flexible, responsive and accessible. Just as shuttering institutions 60 years ago solved little, simply targeting police responseswill not suffice now, either.",2,1,NewsOne

California is suffering from drought, and farmers in the state is Central Valley are pumping more groundwater from their well to make up for a shortfall in water from the state is reservoirs. Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide captionWell water is pumped into an irrigation system at a vineyard in Madera, California. California is suffering from drought, and farmers in the state is Central Valley are pumping more groundwater from their well to make up for a shortfall in water from the state is reservoirs. The next time you pick up some California-grown carrots or melons in the grocery store, consider the curious, contested odyssey of the water that fed them. Chances are, farmers pumped that water from underground aquifers on a scale that is become unsustainable, especially as the planet heats up. Facing an ongoing drought that is squeezing surface water supplies, farmers are extracting groundwater at higher rates to continue growing food as usual. California is farmers probably will pump an additional six to seven million acre-feet of water from their wells this year, above what they normally use, according toJosue Medellin-Azuara, a water expert at the University of California, Merced. That quantity would cover 10,000 square miles with a foot of water, and far exceeds the amount that naturally replenishes the aquifer, even during a year with normal rainfall.""It is a huge amount,""says Steve Jackson, a farmer in Visalia who helps to manage 40,000 acres of almonds and other crops. ""I'd say 90 to 95 percent of our crop demands this year are going to be met by groundwater.""This year, however, may mark the beginning of the end of California is great groundwater grab. The state is preparing to phase in new limits on groundwater pumping that will force painful adjustments on the state is farmers. California is a powerhouse of food production, growing some 40 percent of the country is fruit, vegetables, and nuts. Yet the production depends on a supply of water that is increasingly fragile and unreliable as the climate warms.""Drought reveals the lie of a place,"" says Mark Arax, the Fresno-based author of, a history of California is water conflicts. ""The lie is our ambition. We have taken on too much.""In good years, an intricate system of dams, aqueducts, and irrigation canals captures water from rivers and melting snow, much of it in the northern part of the state, and moves that water to fields in the wide Central Valley where most crops are grown. The system also supplies coastal cities, but agriculture remains the largest consumer of water. This year, rivers are running low. The state is biggest reservoirs contain less than half the average amount of water, and farmers have been forced to rely on their wells. ""This year, there is no allotment, because there is no water,"" says Kathy Briano, referring to the amount of water that farmers are assigned for irrigation use. Briano grows almonds near the town of Porterville, and she is relying on her wells instead. Until now, groundwater use in California has been unrestricted. Farmers and cities could pump as much as they wished. And there was a time when that water source seemed inexhaustible. The Central Valley aquifer is like a giant, multi-layered lake beneath the ground. ""A hundred years ago, when you tapped a foot into the earth, in certain parts of the valley, the water would gush out,"" Arax says. At that time, wells typically only needed to be 50 or 80 feet deep. But year after year, towns and farmers --- but mostly farmers --- pumped more water out of the aquifer than nature put back in, and the water table fell. Today, farmers and towns are drilling wells over a thousand feet deep. Extracting so much water even changed the region is geology.""As you draw the water up and out of the earth, the earth itself the n collapses and sinks,"" Arax says. ""We are not sinking by inches. We are sinking by feet.""Jerry Jones (R) and his son Brandon Jones (L) of Jones Construction and Excavation install a 2,500 gallon tank in front of the home of Loren Scott Denney after his well went dry on May 25, 2021 in Madera, California. Denney did not have running water for almost a month as he waited for the tank to be installed. Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide captionBriano says the problems first became obvious during the drought of 2014-2015. ""Everybody was pumping,"" she says. ""You had to pump all that you needed, and you just brought that groundwater down to nothing.""On her ranch, the water table dropped by 60 feet. The well that supplied water to her house went dry. The same thing happened to hundreds of people who relied on shallow wells in the nearby town of East Porterville. ""People were without water, and they had to bring water tanks in. They had no water at all!"" she says. During that drought, there was growing pressure to enact limits on groundwater use. Susana De Anda, executive director of theCommunity Water Center, in the town of Visalia, was among those pushing for change. ""When 90 percent of our valley residents rely on groundwater, we have to be sure that we are sharing that for all beneficial uses,"" she says. ""That means that we should not over-pump.""In 2014, California passed theSustainable Groundwater Management Act(SGMA). It requires big changes, but they will be enforced only gradually, over the next two decades. Under this law, overuse of the aquifer must end by 2040. By that date, use and replenishment of the state is groundwater must be in balance. State and local officials now are coming up with limits on groundwater use to achieve this. In practice, it could mean that farmers in the San Joaquin Valley, which occupies a large area of the Central Valley between Sacramento and Bakersfield, will have to cut their groundwater pumping by 70 or 80 percent by 2040, compared to what they are using this year. In order to enforce these limits, some authorities are requiring meters on wells. Others are monitoring water use through satellites that can detect which crops are being grown. The reaction among farmers has been mixed. Some, like Steve Jackson, agree that limits are necessary, even though groundwater has kept his farm alive in drought years. ""It is a lifeline, but I think that it is a lifeline that we have all taken for granted, and it is not infinite,""he says. ""I think that is what is coming home to all of us.""The limits probably will mean that some land will no longer grow crops, although the re is dispute about how much. One study, backed by the agricultural industry,predictsthat a million acres, or 20 percent of the fields in the San Joaquin Valley, will be taken out of production. Other researchers think it will be half that much. Farmers are likely to adapt by shifting their limited water supplies to their most valuable crops. They also will be able, for the first time, to buy and sell groundwater allotments, shifting the water to the places where it is worth the most. Other farmers, like Kathy Briano, reject the prospect of idling fertile Central Valley land. Briano agrees that it makes sense to protect the aquifer. But to make up for it, she wants the state to deliver more water from dams and reservoirs, to which she says the farms are entitled. ""My solution is, you need to bring us more water,"" she says. ""We ca not keep taking from the valley, because we are taking away [food] production, and where can we grow everything? Right here!""Mark Arax, the writer, says the changing climate is likely to breed more conflicts like this, also in other parts of the country. ""How we deal with this becomes an example for the rest of America, when it comes to their doorstep,"" he says. The California dream was born in the Gold Rush, claiming nature and re-shaping the land. Now, Arax says, it is time to re-invent that dream.",2,2,NPR
27,Trump showerhead rule on more water flow goes down the drain,-3.67,43.0,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/7/16/22580481/trump-showerhead-rule-more-water-flow-goes-down-drain,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"WASHINGTON — So much for Donald Trump is quest for “perfect” hair. The Biden administration is reversing a Trump-era rule approved after the former president complained he was not getting wet enough because of limits on water flow from showerheads. Now, with a new president in office, the Energy Department is going back to a standard adopted in 2013, saying it provides plenty of water for a good soak and a thorough clean. The rule change will have little practical effect, since nearly all commercially made shower heads comply with the 2013 rule — the pet peeve of the former president notwithstanding. The Energy Department said the action clarifies what is been happening in the marketplace. Showers that provide the extra supply of water desired by Trump are not easily found, officials said. Since 1992, federal law has dictated that new shower heads should not pour more than 2.5 gallons of water per minute. As newer shower fixtures came out with multiple nozzles, the Obama administration defined the showerhead restrictions to apply to what comes out in total. So if there are four nozzles, no more than 2.5 gallons total should come out among all four. The Trump-era rule, finalized in December, allows each nozzle to spray as much as 2.5 gallons, not just the overall showerhead. A proposed rule change, set to be published in the Federal Register next week, reverts to the Obama-era standard. The public will have 60 days to comment before a final rule is developed. The change will ensure that consumers continue to save money while reducing water use and paying lower energy bills, the Energy Department said. Officials estimated that the Obama-era rule saved households about $38 a year, and the Energy Department expects similar savings by reverting to the 2013 standard.“As many parts of America experience historic droughts, this commonsense proposal means consumers can purchase shower heads that conserve water and save them money on their utility bills,’’ Kelly Speakes-Backman, acting assistant secretary for the department is Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, said Friday. While publicly talking about the need to keep his hair “perfect,” Trump made increasing water flow and dialing back longstanding appliance conservation standards — including for light bulbs, toilets and dishwashers — a personal issue.“So shower heads — you take a shower, the water does not come out. You want to wash your hands, the water does not come out,’’ Trump said at the White House last year. “So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair — I do not know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect.”But consumer and conservation groups said the 2020 rule change was silly, unnecessary and wasteful, especially as the West bakes through a historic two-decade-long megadrought. With four or five or more nozzles, “you could have 10, 15 gallons per minute powering out of the showerhead, literally probably washing you out of the bathroom,” said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the energy conservation group Appliance Standards Awareness Project. “At a time when a good portion of the country is experiencing serious drought exacerbated by climate change, the re is no place for shower heads that use needless amounts of water.”DeLaski and officials at Consumer Reports said the re is been no public outcry or need for change. The Energy Department is database of 12,499 shower heads showed 74% of them use 2 gallons or less water per minute, which is 20% less than the federal standard. A 2016 test of shower heads by Consumer Reports found that the best-rated showerheads, including a $20 model, provided a pleasing amount of water flow and met federal standards. The Energy Department also is proposing to remove the definition of “body spray” adopted in the 2020 final rule. The rule allows “body sprays” to circumvent congressional intent to promote water conservation simply based on orientation of the water flow — a side spray rather than overhead.",1,2,Chicago Sun-Times

The knowledge of the entire world, along with a direct line to everyone you know and love, lives in your phone or your computer and you carry those around with you. Occasionally you plug them into some magical holes in your wall so they keep running. And of course you need wi fi or cell service, which floats around in the air as long as you are in the right sort of place with the right password. If you can grab it, the n there you are. Plugged in. Connected, networked,networked, webbed to the wide world. The internet is in the air. It is a cloud. We are all connected, somehow, by technology or something. The magic lives in our computers and phones and in the ap ps they run. There is this anecdote in Michael Lewis is: After most of its trading goes online, a hedge fund decides it might as well move from Manhattan to the midwest. Physical location has ceased to matter because business lives in cy ber space now. What a boon! What a time to save on rent. Of course, this turns out to be exactly wrong. As this firm is trying to save money by moving west, the high frequency traders on whom the book is focused are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to get closer to the market, to put their computers as close as possible to the market computers. If you are a hedge fund and you think about the internet like I usually do, you move to Oklahoma where the rent is cheap. If you think about the internet the way it actually is, you pay huge sums of money to put your computers inside New Jersey warehouses directly next to the market servers, and even more money to get them a few feet closer than your competitors’ computers. If you think about the internet the way it actually is, you spend untold millions to lay a few strands of glass, no thicker than human hairs, in the straightest possible line from Chicago to New Jersey. If you think about the internet the way it actually is, you worry about mountains and rivers and oceans, about electricity generation and signal interference. And you might also worry about ownership, control, power, and coordination. The internet, after all, is simply a. Its job is to get information from one physical place to another physical place. It serves the same function as telephones, telegraphs, radios, smoke signals, and semaphore. It happens to operate through a complicated system of physical tubes. When you send a packet of information in the form of a letter, a federal government agency takes your letter and carries it across an intricate nationwide network of federally-, state-, and locally-owned and managed roads. When you send a packet of information in the form of bits, it is usually carried by a privately-owned internet service provider (or “ISP,” usually the local cable monopoly) along an intricate nationwide network of pathways owned by that company and a myriad of other private companies. It is like if you could only send a letter with either UPS or FedEx (depending on where you live), and the letter had to travel on nothing but toll roads owned by a few dozen private corporations to get to anywhere from down the street to across the continent. This presents both a problem and an opportunity. The problem is that as more of our lives move online (whether in the normal course or all at once thanks to a global pandemic), we become ever more at the mercy of the private entities that control the internet. In normal times we have to use roads to get to work and to school, but at least wet he roads and exercise some control over them in the form of local government. We do notownthe internet. There are no city council meetings where we can go to complain about potholes and service interruptions, or about local tax raises and data rates. The way that our public institutions tend to get more people connected to the internet is to give private internet companies grants to build more wires. But those companies still own the wires, and at the end of the day they tend to doon ly what is most profitable. The opportunity is to flip this dynamic. But we must go deeper than the calls for municipal internet service providers that were in heavy rotation around 2017. Municipal ISPs are good, but they are only local. Every city in the country could have its own locally owned and democratically controlled ISP and the internet would still be at the mercy of private profit. Someone still has to connect all those cities to each other. Someone still has to carry the bits from Los Angeles through Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, Denver, and Omaha to the servers in Council Bluffs. Owning local tubes is great, but what we need is public internet infrastructure. To stay with the road analogy, owning local roads only gets you so far—we need democratic ownership and control over the highways and interstates, too. To see why, let is talk a little more about what the internet is and where it came from. The physical internet is a lot more like a road system than you might think. Information superhighway cliches aside, a functional internet requires physical pathways reaching every home and business in the country (and, increasingly, in the world). Like road systems, the physical internet is very expensive to build but confers massive benefits once it is built. Like roads, the physical pathways of the internet are neither very technologically complicated nor likely to change much over time. The ways of packaging and transmitting information are always improving, just like the ways of packaging and transmitting things along roads, but the glass wires that internet information travels through have been in place for decades and will not become overloaded for many more decades. When the telephone system was first being built, its challenges were far less technological than logistical. The technology was relatively simple: every household with a telephone had one pair of continuous copper wires connecting it to a local switching center. The phone itself was two devices—one near the mouth that converted the sound waves of a person is voice to a corresponding electrical signal, and the other near the ear that converted an electrical signal back to a sound wave. Picking up the phone closed that wire is circuit,connected the wires together, creating an unbroken loop back to the switching center, where an operator was on the other end of the line. You told the operator which house you wanted totalk to, and they plugged your two wires into the two wires going from the switching center to that house, creating a continuous loop between you and the person you were calling. The logistics of this are mind-boggling. Every single home with a telephone had its own unique pair of wires. Those wires had to make it safely from the home to the switching center. Hundreds or thousands of wire pairs had to be color-coded, tagged, and bundled in such a way that they could be discerned, organized, and repaired at any point along miles and miles of physical distance, strung from pole to pole or running underground. The organization and maintenance of those wires was a monumental task for the tele com industry. And its most significant innovations came not in the form of new types of phones (though there were those), but in ways to cram together multiple conversations into the same sets of wires and to automate the task of the operators at the switching centers. The internet feels more distant from this past than it actually is. To exist online is to send and receive information. To be sent and received, that information must take some physical form. It could be a patterned flow of electrons, a patterned electromagnetic wave, or a patterned series of flashes from one or multiple lasers. In any case, it has to somewhere. It has to be sent and the n received, and it has to traverse physical distance between where it is sent and where it is received. For the vast majority of information and the vast majority of the distances it travels, it lives as signals in long strands of metal or glass. Unlike the early telephone system, many households and devices can share space on the same strands of metal or glass, but that metal and gl assist he internet. The glass—optical fiber line—is a thing of wonder. Fiber has been in widespread use for decades and we have not come close to reaching its bandwidth potential. The thing about fiber is that it is simply a medium for signalling with light. And, because the signals the mselves are merely light flashes, and because light travels so fast (though somewhat slower in glass than in space), the number of signals that are theoretically possible is very, very large. The only constraint on how much data can travel through fiber right now is how fast we can make a laser flash. As we continue to develop faster sending and receiving equipment, the data capacity of the very same fiber that has been in use for ten plus years will continue to expand. The internet is not a metaphorical world wide web of connection, it is a world wide web of connection. If I want to video chat with Current Affairs editor Eli Massey using a service like Zoom while he is in Cairo, my computer has to send waves to my router, which converts those waves to patterns of electrons in my home coaxial cable, which heads up to the utility pole behind my building and along utility poles or in trenches to the routers at my local Comcast switching center—sometimes the same switching center the old phone company used, but with the windows bricked in and full of servers and routers instead of human operators—and from there likely along fiber-optic strands of glass to a major regional switching center, maybe in downtown Los Angeles or Las Vegas, and onward still until it hits a switching center where Zoom has some co-located servers (maybe down the street, maybe across the country). Then Zoom sends that data on through more switching centers into an undersea cable (yes! my face converted to 0s and 1s encoded into laser flashes whizzing by beneath the sharks and flounders and whales and jellyfish), up under an Egyptian beach and through some Egyptian switching centers until it hits Eli is router and gets beamed to his computer. Meanwhile his face is making the reverse journey. Who is involved in this world wide web of strands of metal and glass carrying bits of ourselves over mountains and under oceans? Your ISP provides connection to your router, so they are the first custodians of everything you do online. But once your signal has passed through your router and into a cable that leaves your home, others are suddenly involved. That cable might be owned by your ISP, or it might be owned by a telephone company, or by your city or state. Your ISP might just be a tenant, leasing out some space (bandwidth) on someone else is physical network. Whoever owns the cable, they probably do not own the poles it is strung along—those are often owned by the local telephone company or the local power company, and the owner of your cable probably has to lease space on the pole for your cable. (If your cable goes underground, the cable owner might be leasing space in an underground pipeline with a lot of cables, or the cable might simply lie in a tiny, permit-required trench in the dirt in city-, county-, or state-owned land.) Your ISP might own the whole switching center your data hits first, or it might rent space for its physical routers in someone else is switching center, or it might rent capacity on someone else is router i nyet anotherparty is switching center. Then onto the next switching center, on yet more cables, with yet different owners and lessees using yet different poles and/or trenches. Even if your ISP owns the physical cable in your area and is in full control of the signal and medium from your house to its switching center and beyond, it will have to hand your signal off to some other company at some point. The largest of the glass and metal strand owners are called Tier 1 networks. Roughly, this means they have enough physical reach to leverage free transfer agreements with the other Tier 1 networks. That is, if signals traveling on AT&T fiber need to pass through some CenturyLink fiber to get where they are going, CenturyLink does not charge AT&T, and vice versa. They both own so much fiber (750,000 miles for CenturyLink, 410,000 for AT&T) that they consider each other “peers” and freely grant access to each others’ networks. Comcast, on the other hand, although the ISP for about 40% of all US internet subscriptions as of 2011, is not a Tier 1 network. It might have free peering agreements with most fiber owners, but there are still places on the internet (remember,) where it ca not send data without paying someone to use their fiber. This setup presents a serious challenge for the idea of municipal internet promoted by many progressives. The desire to focus on local control, local infrastructure, and local accountability makes perfect sense when you think of your ISP as connecting you to a magical and disembodied internet. But the fact of the matter is that your city cannot provide you with the internet. It will need to link up with someone else at some point. When you try to access a web site whose data live on a server in Council Bluffs, your signal needs to get to Iowa and back. Unless you live in Council Bluffs, your city network is not going to get you there. So, without some larger democratic structure in place, municipal networks are somewhat at the mercy of the existing internet giants. Even if your local government manages to install a fiber optic connection in every home in town, it will still have to pay at some point down the line to access others’ networks and switching centers. It may have to pay like Comcast for access to those networks and switching centers, and Comcast will have little incentive to offer access on any reasonable terms to a government entity trying to cut into its profits. This is similar to the classic net neutrality problem, which is as follows: since Comcast is a private company with theoretically no obligations to the public, why ca not Comcast charge people extra to access high-demand web sites like Netflix? What if Comcast decided it does not like Current Affairs, and simply stopped providing access to our web site at all? And since the companies that own the wires have largely acquired the companies that produce the content that travels along the wires (Comcast owns NBC, AT&T owns Time Warner, etc.), what if internet providers started making their own content much easier to access than the content of their competitors? You can see how this net neutrality problem could translate to physical networks: what is to stop Comcast (or CenturyLink or AT&T) from charging entire cities more to send signals on the nation- and world-wide networks of wires, or not providing access at all to cities with the temerity to shoulder in on private ISPs’ market share? Own the wires, own the internet. There are a few different ways we might confront this problem. One would be simply to build hundreds of thousands of miles of cable and fiber, creating a large enough network to replace the current major players, or at least to achieve Tier 1 status and leverage a free data exchange. No public project has attempted this yet, but this has been the go-to move for tech companies seeking complete internet dominance and control. Google Fiber is an ongoing attempt to build a nationwide fiber optic network, to literally string Google-owned fiber alongside CenturyLink-owned fiber across the continent, the reby capturing a large chunk of the physical space internet for Google alongside its increasing control over the cy ber space of the internet. If Google ever succeeds with this project, traffic via Gmail or Youtube could travel from Google is servers to your computer without ever passing out of Google is control. Google is not alone in this ambition. Many of the big tech companies that dominate the cy ber space of the internet have been trying to find ways to take over its physical space as well. Beyond the prospect of domestic control and profit, expanding internet access to offline parts of the world carries the potential for untold profits. Google had a short-lived project called Loon that attempted to float wireless routers on massive balloons in the high atmosphere to enable connection in remote areas without the infrastructure for physical cables. Facebook attempted a similar project using a giant solar-powered plane, essentially a flying cell tower. Eventually these two projects learned the same lessons as Motorola isIridium satellite networkandAT&T is microwave relay tower project: it is very hard to transmit signals quickly, cheaply, and reliably through the air. Long strands of glass are the way to go. That is not to say the air is not still in play. Both Tesla and Amazon are in the process of attempting to build networks of hundreds or thousands of low-orbit satellites to replace the strands of metal and glass on the Earth is surface. The traditional problem with satellite internet is that you have to be able to send and receive signals from a satellite, meaning it has to be somewhere in the sky above you, and not on the other side of the earth. There are only two ways to make sure there is always a satellite above you. First, you could put the satellite in geostationary orbit, meaning it stays above the same spot on the surface of the Earth at all times. The problem with this strategy is that to maintain geostationary orbit, satellites have to be—approximately 22,000 miles above sea level. That is far enough away that, even travelling at the speed of light, there is a noticeable lag for data to reach the satellite and the n get back down to its destination on the ground. The other way to make satellites work is to have a loto f them in lower orbits. In lower orbits the satellites move much faster, so no single satellite will be over the same spot for very long. But if you have enough of the m, you could get a signal to the closest one and have it relay the signal between a few more before beaming it down to its destination. Up until now, the main challenge for creating such a system has been the expense. Launching satellites, until recently, has beenveryexpensive. You have to build a whole rocket for each launch. But with the Tesla/SpaceX creation of reusable rockets, building a network of a few thousand low-orbit satellites has become more feasible. Elon Musk may have cheered the successful rocket reentry for its potential in supplying the space station, but he was probably thinking instead about owning the entire internet. Assuming that Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos will not encase the world in more than 10,000 satellites to own the internet, and, as nearly all the experts seem to think, that ground fiber is still the way to go, what can we do to coordinate democratic municipal ISPs? How can we free them from the grip of giant national fiber owners? Could we accomplish what Google is attempting, but public? Could we lay a democratically controlled and accountable public physical internet alongside the private physical internet currently connecting most homes on the continent?It would be tough, but there are some regional examples worth examining. In Utah, the Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency, or UTOPIA, is a consortium of sixteen cities working to build a fiber optic network that would reach every home and business across a significant swathe of the state. UTOPIA is a public enterprise, funded through government bonds, that is directly competing with the private owners of the physical internet. It makes use of peering agreements with other public and academic networks, the reby expanding its fee-free reach to internet locations around the country. But that reach is still very limited. UTOPIA owns the fiber in its area, but leases fiber to get to the major data centers outside its immediate area, data centers owned by yet more parties. And though UTOPIA peers with other publicly-minded networks, those networks the mselves must pay to reach the privately-controlled bits of the internet. Maybe most interestingly, UTOPIA itself is not an ISP That is, it provides people with the glass strands, but does not code and carry their internet traffic along those strands. It does not run the laser flashes that constitute the signals. Rather, approved private ISPs operate on UTOPIA is physical network. UTOPIA calls itself an “open source” model, meaning that its physical network is available for use by any qualifying ISP, public or private. The idea of UTOPIA is encouraging. That a public agency can viably fundraise and execute construction of a door-to-door fiber optic network, even if only regionally, is a small proof of concept. It could conceivably serve as a model for a national UTOPIA, a publicly-funded national network of fiber connecting local, regional, and state systems across the country. But UTOPIA is history calls for some caution. TheUTOPIA is not an ISP is that public entities in Utah are no tallowed to be ISPs. And the reason they are not allowed to be ISPs is that, after public internet efforts including UTOPIA initially got off the ground in Utah, the internet giants descended with near unlimited resources to fund lawsuits and lobbying efforts. They succeeded in effectively outlawing public internet service providers in Utah with legislation thanks to the American Legislative Exchange Council (yes, ALEC, the conservative legislative advocacy group responsible for a large percentage of the most private-profit-driven, scourge-of-the-left state laws across the country). The mere possibility of a public option for the internet in Utah led to a massive legal and lobbying effort that ended with a law banning public ISPs. The public broadband advocacy organization Community Networks offers an interactive map showing the country is public internet networks, and notes that at least eighteen states have put up barriers to public internet. The millions of dollars spent by the likes of Comcast and AT&T to block net neutrality will be a drop in the bucket compared to the effort they will launch at every level of government to prevent any kind of nationwide network to shift power and leverage to local ISPs. If we ca not build our own public, national, physical internet, is there a way we can force the current owners of the internet to act in the public is interest? Can they be prevented from hamstringing local internet networks? This sort of move would have historical precedent. The railroads were notoriously built with public money for private profit, often involving sweetheart deals with associated or co-owned industries at the expense of everyone else. Much like Comcast carrying its own content for free but charging others, railroads would provide cheap or free transport to their subsidiaries but would charge others exorbitantly. Once the scandals reached a fever pitch in the 1880s, Congress designated the railroads as “common carriers,” meaning that, given their status as essential services, they were legally required to offer their services on a fair and equitable basis, and were to be closely scrutinized by regulators to ensure that was the case. Congress did the same to the tele com industry in 1934. Rather than breaking up AT&T is monopoly, or nationalizing the phone lines, Congress enacted a law to force AT&T to carry telephone transmissions from all customers on a fair and equal basis. Congress enacted a smaller but similar rule in the 1970s at the behest of the cable industry to restrict AT&T is control over telephone poles. AT&T saw cable as a potential competitor both in terms of telecommunications and for its own plans to offer video delivery in the future. It also saw that the cable companies would have to spend a to n of money to run networks of wires if they could not use the existing poles. So the cable companies found the mselves being charged exorbitantly to hang cables on poles. The Pole Attachment Act directed the FCC to determine reasonable rates for pole owners to charge and thus set prices for pole leases. The internet seems a natural choice for “common carrier” status. But, through decades of regulatory capture, lawsuits, and savvy lobbying, internet providers—both ISPs and large networks—have evaded designation as common carriers and maintained an almost wholly deregulated existence. Is now a moment for revisiting this situation? Nearly the entire American economy is wholly dependent on the internet right now. Those of us who are lucky enough to be working are doing so online. Public schools are holding Zoom classes and public officials are suggesting that children locked out of the internet at home (whether due to geography or poverty) go attend class in McDonald is parking lots. The canard that broadband internet access is a luxury rather than a necessity, although long false, is growing more obviously ludicrous every day. These wires are our highways now. They are the paths we travel to get to work and school all day every day. Surely they are common carriers. Of course, the viability of this argument looks no better today than it did during the net neutrality fight in 2017. The White House, Congress, and the FCC are aligned in the strongest possible opposition to any internet regulation. And at the point we have the power to impose common carrier status, we should use that power to do better. It would seem ridiculous to countenance a completely privatized system of roads and highways. Even with common carrier rules in place, imagine having to choose and pay for the use of various paths depending on where you are going, what you are carrying, what your means of transit are, etc. And imagine having to erect an entire bureaucracy to monitor the maintenance and conduct of the private companies in charge of the roads and highways. Maybe there are some libertarian readers salivating at this possibility, but I doubt it will appeal to most. Is there a good reason to treat the internet differently? Sure, we built it in a different way, but that was due more to historical accident than any logical reason. Roads have always been recognized as essential for commerce, and their rights of way set aside for public use. The advent and prominence of cars came while the depredations of the privatized railroad system were still fresh, and federal and state governments were all too willing during the Great Depression and in the glut after World War Two to make massive public investments in direct road building (even while it would only subsidize private ownership of telephone lines). Politicians looking for rural support pushed through the USPS Rural Free Delivery program starting in the 1890s, which spurred the building of public postal roads reaching nearly every home in the country, at great public expense but to immeasurable long term benefit, so that people could get their mail delivered to their doors. One potential rationale for public roads but private tele com is that the tele com system is more susceptible to innovation, and can benefit more from private competition. This has not borne out for a whole host of reasons. AT&T operated as a government-sanctioned “natural monopoly” for decades, and after being forcefully broken up in the 1980s has consolidated nearly all of its former holdings back into itself. And, in fact, there has not been much innovation in tele com or internet hardware in the recent past. Fiber has been in wide use for decades and we have not come close to reaching its potential for bandwidth. There might be innovation to be had in the sending and transmitting equipment, which might be a colorable argument for private ISPs on a public fiber backbone, similar to the UTOPIA model. But even this might concede too much. As Vanessa A Bee has written in Current Affairs and In These Times, there is little evidence that market competition is or has ever been necessary for technological innovation. The internet itself, after all, is a creation of public institutions. What am I suggesting? Nationalize the wires. Rather than attempting to erect a whole new set of fibers to run alongside the existing fibers as a “public option” of sorts, we need to seize our soonest opportunity to take public ownership over the nationwide network of cables that is destined to continue serving as essential public infrastructure for the foreseeable future. And just as the federal government provided grants to improve and expand public infrastructure during the New Deal and post-war period, we need to provide funds for local and regional democratically accountable ISPs. This need not involve dismantling the existing ISPs. But a handful of private companies should not own the physical wires,the means of access to those wires,andthe content that flows along them all at once.(A note on privacy and security: A sane person may balk at the idea of government owning and controlling the internet. “The internet should be atechnology. They can already see too much. Do we really want to hand Stephen Miller and Palantir the skeleton key to every bit that travels the wires?” First, do not kid yourself,the NSA is already in the private switching centers. Second, there is nothing more inherently trustworthy about Bank of America, Facebook, Google, AT&T, and Comcast than the government. But this is a legitimate concern. It is, however, a concern that can be dealt with using the right encryption protocols. Just in the past five years huge swaths of the internet have moved from HTTP to HTTPS, and end-to-end encryption has gone from the stuff of paranoid conspiracy the orists to an expected feature in communication apps. No security is perfect, and government-owned wires could still carry a risk of increased government surveillance, but Peter Thiel and Palantir will end up with your data as things stand now, and they will happily sell it to any government that will pay.)The history of nationalizing resources and industries in the USs is complicated. The official story is often that “we do not do that.” But, of course, we do do that. We nationalized the paper currency industry with the creation of the Federal Reserve. We attempted to nationalize steel to break a strike in 1952. We nationalized passenger railroads in the 1970s. We nationalized most of the mortgage market in 2008 when the Department of Treasury took conservatorship over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We also nationalized General Motors Acceptance Corporation in 2008-09, rebranded it as Ally Financial, and sold it back to private owners in pieces up until 2014. The common thread among these precedents is that we stepped in with public money when things were going very badly in order to subsidize private owners. Then, when things improved, we handed the assets back over so they could continue generating private profits. These past examples are helpful precedents but they have things backwards. We should not have waited for a complete collapse of the banking system to nationalize paper currency. We should not have waited for a collapse in the housing market to take democratic control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. So long as we use public money only to bail out private industry, we will forever be responding to suffering rather than preventing it. How many public school children are we going to send to the McDonald is parking lot before we understand that internet access is a public good? In a better world, universal public internet access would be a political tool even more effective than the Rural Free Delivery Program. Politicians of all stripes and in all levels of government would see the golden opportunity presented by record dissatisfaction with private ISPs like Comcast, and would jump at the chance to institute a popular, useful program that would expand the economy and provide public works jobs. A champion of community internet would emerge, driving federal grants for municipal ISPs alongside federal and state programs to buy, build, or co-opt long distance transmission lines and switching centers. If we have a strong understanding of what it means for something to be a public good, we will see the need to reach beyond defending those we already have—public education, the mail, the roads—and toward the public goods currently in private hands. The wires are a public good, necessary for education and governance and commerce. Whoever controls the physical internet controls a great deal of our lives, and our lives should be up to. Freedom, as the saying goes, is participation in power. As the power of the internet grows, so must our participation grow. Is not that exactly what democracy is for?For further reading on the physical internet and its ownership and control, check out the following books:",1,1,Current Affairs
29,REPORT: Pfizer Vaccine Confirmed To Cause Neurodegenerative Diseases,24.67,9.0,https://nationalfile.com/report-pfizer-vaccine-confirmed-to-cause-neurodegenerative-diseases/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-file-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-22,25,"Last Updated on April 22, 2021“The current RNA based SARSCoV-2 vaccines were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long term safety testing,” the report declares. “In this paper the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in vaccine recipients.” Prion-based diseases are, according to the CDC, a form of neurodegenerative diseases, meaning that the Pfizer vaccine is potentially likely to cause long term damage and negative health effects with regards to the brain. This is especially concerning since the Pfizer vaccine is an mRNA vaccine, an untested type of vaccine which creates new proteins and can actually integrate into the human genome, according to a report from the National Library of Medicine. In other words, degenerative brain conditions may appear at any time in your life after receiving the vaccine.“The RNA sequence of the vaccine as well as the spike protein target interaction were analyzed for the potential to convert intracellular RNA binding proteins TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) into their pathologic prion conformations,” explains the report. TDP-43 is a protein known to cause dementia, ALS and even Alzheimer is, according toAlzpedia. Similarly, the FUS protein is known to cause ALS and Hereditary Essential Tremors, according to theHuman Genome Database. The experiment done for the report was to determine whether or not these two harmful proteins embed the mselves into our DNA, as an mRNA vaccine is expected to do. The report determined that “the vaccine RNA has specific sequences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations,” meaning that both proteins have the potential to embed the mselves into our DNA and cause harmful neurological diseases. The report is abstract summary concludes that “The enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit.” The report itself ends with this warning: “The vaccine could be a bio weapon and even more dangerous than the original infection.”National File actually reached out to the CDC to inquire as to why the Pfizer vaccine is still being distributed despite these credible allegations.

30,New Yorkers are counting on Kathy Hochul to change the tenor in Albany (Editorial Board Opinion),-9.33,40.33,https://www.syracuse.com/opinion/2021/08/new-yorkers-are-counting-on-kathy-hochul-to-change-the-tenor-in-albany-editorial-board-opinion.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/syracuse-post-standard-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-11,25,"See ya, Governor Andrew Cuomo. Hiya, soon-to-be Governor Kathy Hochul. Cuomo did the unexpected Tuesday when he announced he would resign under the weight of sexual harassment allegations. Combative to the end, the governor blamed politics, not himself, for his downfall. But even he could not bend the reality that he had lost the confidence of New Yorkersand his fellow Democrats. Corneredby his accusers and abandoned by his allies, Cuomo did the right thing by quitting. Wenever thoughtwe’d see it. Technically, we still have not. The governor said he would resign in 14 days to ensure a smooth transition to his lieutenant governor, Hochul. The grace period seems unnecessary. Hochul is well-prepared to take over. Hochul,62, a native of Buffalo and a graduate of Syracuse University, has long experience in government. She was a county clerk, a member of Congress and, for the past six and a half years, Cuomo is emissary to every corner of the state. In many respects, Hochul is the anti-Cuomo. While the governor hunkered down in Albany or New York City,Hochul traveled to all 62 counties to cut ribbons, meet people and introduce herself to local officials. Her talent for retail politics made her friends in every part of the state, including New York City. She showed surprising electoral strength Downstate. In the 2014 Democratic primary, HochulbeatColumbia University law professor Tim Wu, a progressive. In 2018, she thwarted Cuomo is effort to dump her from the ticket bydefeatingBrooklyn councilor Jumaane Williams in a primary. No other statewide elected officials come from Upstate. Hochul will be the first woman to become governor of New York. She will be the first Upstater since Republican Nathan L Miller, from Solon, Cortland County, was elected in 1920. Cuomo bragged that he did more for Upstate than any previous governor — and rightly so — but the bar was pretty low. Who is to say someone from Upstate will not do more? New York City remains the center of gravity of New York politics. Hochul should provide a counterweight. Her detractors on the right point to her tendency to flip-flop on key issues, depending on the audience. Her detractors on the left say she is too moderate. Few would argue with Cuomo is description of her as “smart and competent.” Hochul has a little over a year to show what she can do before having to face the voters in 2022. People who know Hochul say it is a mistake to underestimate her tenacity and political savvy — traits she honed as a student activist at Syracuse University. New Yorkers are counting on her to change the tenor in Albany. Hochul is immediate challenge upon taking office is to clean up the toxic atmosphere in the Executive Chamber, as revealed in Attorney General Letitia James’ sexual harassment investigation. Hochul also has decisions to make about retaining or replacing Cuomo allies in powerful appointed positions at Empire State Development, the Metropolitan Transit Authority and state agencies. This is in addition to her main job(s): leading the state out of the Covid-19 pandemic, managing the economic recovery, working with the Legislature to balance a state budget saddled with out-year deficits, and stemming the exodus of New Yorkers to other states. After 10 years of Cuomo is secretiveness, bullying and casual relationship to ethics, we urge Hochul to lead the state with integrity, transparency and a collaborative spirit. Cuomo may leave office, but he must not evade accountability. Cuomo still faces various investigations into the sexual harassment allegations, a promised civil lawsuit for allegedly retaliating against an accuser, and probes into the under counting of Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes and the alleged use of state resources to produce his Covid leadership book.

Senate Bill 5032 would eliminate the mandatory minimum term of confinement for “an assault and battery committed against a judge; magistrate; law-enforcement officer; correctional officer; person directly involved in the care, treatment, or supervision of inmates; firefighter; or volunteer firefighter or any emergency medical services personnel and provides that such crime can no longer be committed as a simple assault and must result in a bodily injury.”The measure to defelonize assaulting an officer was introduced by Virginia Democrats in July, following nationwide calls for police reform in the wake of George Floyd is death.“Our constituents want change,” state Senator Mamie Locke, a Democrat, said when introducing the bill. “We hear that loud and clear from them. They want policy change. They are pretty much done with thoughts and prayers. They are done with ‘one more discussion’ and hearing us say, ‘We will get it done.’ … They want policy change.”Currently, assaulting a police officer in Virginia is a felony punishable by a minimum of six months in jail. The bill will need to be approved by the House in the General Assembly before it goes to Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, also a Democrat, for signature. Attacking police officers is their answer to so-called police brutality? Wake up Virginians, this is the horror show you voted for!This bill is not going to do anything but increase the attacks on police officers by Black Lives Matter/Antifa thugs! It will also create a loophole that can be used to claim that or that assaultis not really bodily injury. And if Virginia is corrupt prosecutors, like the one in Portland, suddenly claim they are not going to prosecute misdemeanors, the n it is OPEN SEASON on cops for every to bit thug on the streets!Those in Virginia who still respect police officers need to pressure the GA not to pass this monstrous bill.

Taliban fightersenteredKabul Sunday demanding unconditional surrender after wresting nearly the entire country from government control in a matter of weeks. Biden had just pledged support for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and other leaders ""as they seek to prevent further bloodshed and pursue a political settlement."" But by Sunday, Ghani had fled the country. It seemed all that was left for the Biden administration at that hour was damage control. ""This is not Saigon,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken argued on CNNSunday morning, rejecting comparisons to the collapse of South Vietnam in 1975 two years after US troops were pulled out. But even as he spoke, helicopters were rushing to e vacuate personnel from the US embassy in Kabul.'Forever war' in Afghanistan resulted in fewer terror attacksAnd behind the broad news of bedlam were voices of thousands reduced to living in abject fear with the Taliban is arrival; many, if not most, of them women who face a crushing and uncertain future of subjugation under a famously mysogynistic regime.""Keep us in your prayers,"" a terrified woman hiding in Kabul text ed her sister, an Afghan-American living in the USs, as terrorists raged through the capital. That was her last message. A brief history of Biden is Afghanistan decision-making since taking office makes one thing abundantly clear – the disaster that unfolded Sunday did not have to happen. After 20 years of war, there was palpable frustration by most Americans with the failure of three successive presidents to achieve anything other than a stalemate in Afghanistan. George Bush is decision to invade Iraq in 2003 drew valuable military resources away from the Afghan fight. One outside chance for peace, however, was apl edge by Taliban leaders last year to open negotiations with the Kabul government. President Donald Trump used this as an excuse to pull all but a few thousand troops out of Afghanistan. This July Fourth, America will leave Afghanistan independence in its death throesBiden could have conditioned any further drawdown on good faith efforts by the Taliban to reach a peaceful settlement with Kabul. But over the objections of military leaders who warned that the Afghan government would collapse without US security assistance, Biden decided in April to e nd military involvement by September. He promised troop withdrawal would not be hasty. But, in fact, most were gone by early July. (The largest US air base was abandoned so suddenly that Afghan troops could not even figure out how to turn the electricity back on.)It was a choice with disastrous consequences. Any incentive for the Taliban to negotiate peace was gone. A security umbrella of US air cover that had staved off battlefield defeats for Afghan troops evaporated. (A small Afghan air force with pilots overworked and targeted for assassination has not been up to the task.) And crucially, the morale disintegrated among front line Afghan troops already poorly fed, denied pay and deprived of bullets and fuel. Hundredssurrenderedwithout firing a shot. Biden needs to learn the lesson of Operation Linebacker""Brother, if no one else fights, why should I fight?"" one Afghan soldier said, according to a Washington Postreport. A Taliban offensive that began with vacuuming up countless district centers manned by small numbers of security personnel in July accelerated inAugustto the capture of all major cities north, south and west until insurgents reached the gates of Kabul. Shortly before those fighters reached the city, Biden had ordered5,000US troops into Kabul to assist evacuating US personnel, and it was unclear Sunday just exactly what was developing on the ground there. But here is where there is no ambiguity:► Since the Taliban offensive, a growing humanitarian crisis has unfolded with250,000people fleeing their homes, all in the midst of a pandemic. And there are troubling reports of Taliban atrocities and score-settling.►The White House said20,000Afghans were seeking special immigrant visas fearing for their lives because of working with Americans. They have tens of thousands of family members. How many got out and how many were left behind?►Others in danger include women activists who also should have been included in any evacuations.►Biden is ""America is back"" foreign-policy pledge to the world after years of Trump is global fecklessness now lies in ruins. The president may have decided in April to militarily abandon Afghanistan to avoid further US troop casualties. But he may wind up with the blood of US friends and freedom activists on his hands, not only because of his decision to so rapidly exit, but because of his ensuing failure to carry out that mission before the Taliban aggression he unwittingly unleashed changed everything.",1,2,USA Today

During an appearance on ""America is Newsroom,"" Napolitano asserted his belief that ""the Democrats have credibly argued that [Trump] committed impeachable offenses"" in the Ukraine scandal.""The easiest one — because this existed in Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton — is obstruction of Congress,"" he said. ""So — by directing his subordinates to refuse to comply with lawfully issued subpoenas, whether it is for testimony or for documents — that is an impeachable offense.""Napolitano continued, ""We know that from history, every time the House of Representatives has looked at that with respect to a president. It has found it to be impeachable. On that, reasonable minds cannot disagree without rejecting history and without rejecting constitutional norms.""At the heart of the impeachment inquiry are allegations that Trump attempted to leverage a White House meeting and millions in military aid, sought by Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, as well as an unsubstantiated theory that the Ukrainian government had conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. On Wednesday, Fox News host Bill Hemmer asked Napolitano, ""If you were in the House, would you vote for impeachment?""""I certainly would. I am never going to be in the House,"" Napolitano said with a laugh, before adding, ""I would on that count.""The judge went on to note that ""reasonable minds"" could disagree on Trump is reasoning for withholding million in military aid for Ukraine which had been approved by Congress.""What was the president is intent when he held up this aid?"" Napolitano asked. ""Was it truly to eradicate corruption in Ukraine? Was he truly concerned that American taxpayer dollars would go into the hands of crooks? Or was he looking to use the instruments of a foreign government to help his political campaign?""Later on in the show, Napolitano weighed in on the House Judiciary Committee is Wednesday hearing in the impeachment inquiry, saying that it likely would not change public opinion. However, he warned that ""letting Trump be Trump is not good enough under the Constitution.""""We do not lower the bar because the president has unorthodox ways,"" the former judge added. ""The bar is intentionally broad and even ambiguous as to what high crimes and misdemeanors are. We learned today that the Democrats apparently intend to include in there things we did not know they were going to include, like bribery, like the obstruction of justice allegations which were made by (former special counsel) Bob Mueller long before the Ukraine case came to the public is attention.""At Wednesday is hearing, the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over drafting articles of impeachment, heard testimony from four constitutional scholars about the legal and historical underpinnings of the process. Three law experts called by Democrats said Trump committed impeachable offenses, while one called by Republicans offered the lone dissent. Also at Wednesday is hearing, the panel is chairman, Representative Jerry Nadler, D-NY, suggested that issues in Mueller is report into Russian interference in the 2016 election could be included in eventual articles of impeachment. Nadler argued that Trump had obstructed justice both during Mueller is investigation and the House is impeachment inquiry. In his opening statement, Nadler said Trump is latest actions showed a ""pattern of conduct"" seen since his first year in the Oval Office.""When his own Department of Justice tried to uncover the extent to which a foreign government had broken our laws, President Trump took extraordinary and unprecedented steps to obstruct the investigation, including ignoring subpoenas, ordering the creation of false records and publicly attacking and intimidating witnesses,"" he said. ""Then, as now, this administration is level of obstruction is without precedent.""",1,1,Salon

During the course of Trump is presidency, more than 41,000 visa requests weredenied(pdf) under the ban, which ripped families apart, prevented people from the proscribed countries from gettinghealthcareandeducationin the US, and deprived the USs of doctors, nurses, and other medical workers during the coronavirus pandemic. There was a great sense of joy and relief at the ban is demise. The NO BAN Act Coalition, a broad alliance of 81 national and local civil rights, faith, and community groups fighting for anti-discrimination legislation that is now included in Biden is US Citizenship Act, issued a statement bidding ""goodbye to the Muslim and African ban.""The statement continued:Almost four years ago, one of President [Donald] Trump is first acts in office was to ban Muslims from the USs. Three years later, he expanded the ban to include several African countries. Today, it is fitting that one of Biden is first acts is to rescind the Muslim and African Ban. This is a momentous occasion for the millions of Americans who were separated by the ban and those who stood up against this injustice at airports nationwide. Thank you, President Biden for staying true to your promise to repeal this bigoted policy immediately. The Muslim and African Ban was never about national security, it was always rooted in bigotry and called into question what values America stands for. However, just ending the ban through an executive order will not stop this from happening again. That is why we applaud the historic inclusion of the NO BAN Act in the US Citizenship Act of 2021. Zahra Billoo, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations-San Francisco Bay Area,toldthat Biden is order would ""correct the course"" of the lives disrupted by Trump.""Tens of thousands of impacted individuals will now have the chance to be with their families during cherished and challenging times,"" said Billoo. ""While we know our work is far from over, today we celebrate the heroic efforts undertaken by so many over the last several years in our effort to repeal the Muslim and African bans.""Some of the most poignant reaction to the end of the ban came from people directly affected by it. Ramez Alghazzouli, a Syrian immigrant who had been separated from his wife for a year due to the policy, told it felt like a boulder had been removed from his chest.

""It will still be part of our life and history. The Muslim ban is the nuke that we survived but we are still suffering from its collateral damage.""There was no shortage of suggestions on what Biden could do help heal the harm caused by travel ban, from ending Trump-era ""extreme vetting"" of Muslims and others entering the US, to increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country, to ending US wars that have killed at least hundreds of thousands of Muslim men, women, and children since 2001.",1,1,Common Dreams
37,House Speaker Michael Madigan says it is not ‘ethically improper’ to find government jobs for people. Here is what he is failing to mention.,7.0,49.33,https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-speaker-madigan-com-ed-patronage-scandal-letter-20201002-6wsggdldbrbfjezdtkob4q7ro4-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-tribune-bias-and-reliability-2/,2020-10-02,25,"For years, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan has defended his aggressive push to land political allies and their friends and family on taxpayer-funded payrolls, but rarely has he waxed as philosophically about it as he did last week in a three-page letter. Facing intense pressure from a federal investigation into ComEd is bribes-for-favors scandal and an invitation from a House corruption committee to tell the public what he knows, Madigan is missive broke two months of near silence. The powerful speaker loudly proclaimed his innocence and tried to reframe his penchant for patronage hiring as a virtue. Not only is “helping people find jobs not a crime,” Madigan wrote, it is not even “ethically improper” for politicians to make job recommendations. “To the contrary, I believe that it is part of my duties as a community and political leader to help good people find work — from potential executives to college interns, and more,” wrote the 78-year-old Illinois Democratic Party chairman, alluding to some of the very jobs that prosecutors brought up in charging ComEd with crimes. “What an employer chooses to do with that recommendation rests solely with their discretion.” What Madigan did not mention when discussing the numerous jobs he is secured for people during more than 50 years in politics is how that practice has benefited him and what it is cost taxpayers and electricity ratepayers. The Tribune has spent the last decade chronicling how it works: Patronage jobs are the lifeblood of Madigan is political organization. And the people Madigan recommends be hired often serve as foot soldiers on the campaigns for the very legislative seats that allow the speaker to stay in power. In turn, that control of the House is key to helping Madigan bring in clients at his law firm, which handles high-dollar property tax appeals on some of Chicago is biggest buildings. Starting in 2010, the Tribune published the “The Madigan Rules,” a first-of-its-kind, yearslong investigation that exposed how the speaker built his political empire and law practice, revealing how those two careers repeatedly intersected. The report found that in some cases Madigan took public actions that benefited his private clients, though the speaker said his “personal code of conduct” ensured he maintained “high ethical standards.” In 2013, the legislature is watchdog investigated Madigan is role in a Metra scandal after the commuter rail agency is the n-executive director contended he was muscled out for not acceding to the speaker is patronage demands. More recently, Madigan even answered questions about patronage under oath in what he said was his first-ever deposition. During testimony as part of a lawsuit, Madigan made clear he knows the finer points of his vaunted patronage army. Beyond that, the current ComEd probe has put under the spotlight another practice that is gone on at the Capitol under Madigan: the cycle of House Democratic staffers and friendly lawmakers who leave and the n land a hefty stable of lobbying clients in part based on their perceived access to the speaker. Those lobbyists often become part of a campaign fundraising network that provides money to help Madigan-backed candidates. Though they are not drawing a government salary, those lobbyists also contribute to the policies enacted in Springfield that affect the pockets of taxpayers. The speaker has not been charged in the ComEd case. He has denied wrongdoing. “As I have said before, I have done nothing wrong,” Madigan wrote in his letter, which explained why he would not appear before the House panel looking at the ComEd scandal. “I believe that (the federal) investigation, once all of the facts are made available to the public, will demonstrate that I have not engaged in any improper conduct.” Speaker is playbook. While the ComEd investigation represents the gravest threat Madigan has faced to his reign, it is not the first time his government and political operation has come under public scrutiny. In its investigative series, the Tribune reported that public records showed Madigan is law firm in 2008 represented 45 of the 150 most valuable downtown buildings ? more than twice what the closest rival represented. Some clients said it is not that simple to separate the expert tax assistance the firm provides from the political reputation of the man whose name is on the door. At that time, Madigan ally Joe Berrios sat in judgment over property tax appeals that Madigan is firm filed. Berrios doubled as a state lobbyist, plying his trade inside a Capitol where Madigan held sway. In 2010, Madigan helped Berrios get elected county assessor, giving him power over how all property is valued for property tax purposes. Madigan is firm did well on appeals when Berrios was assessor. The Tribune also found Madigan took public actions that benefited his private clients. As a public official, he got a private road behind a shopping mall repaved, helped secure state funding for an expanded tollway interchange and intervened for a developer looking for state cash. In each case, Madigan was a private lawyer for businesspeople who stood to benefit. Madigan said there were no conflicts of interest in the Tribune is findings, which he described as “strained attempts to link my legislative actions to clients of the firm who might remotely and incidentally ‘benefit’ from such action.” In 2012, the Tribune reported on how a large operator of assisted living homes signed on with Madigan is law firm and found itself with several Springfield wins. Nursing homes, pharmacies and other assisted living companies in recent years all have hired the property tax law firm where Madigan is the rainmaker-in-chief. As speaker, Madigan made decisions affecting the fortunes of many companies that put money in his pocket, the Tribune found. Madigan said he abides by a written personal code of conduct to avoid conflicts on matters involving clients. In addition, the Tribune in 2014 documented more than 400 current or retired state and local government employees who worked elections for Madigan, donated regularly to his campaign funds, registered voters for him or circulated candidate petitions on his behalf. The investigation also found repeated instances in which Madigan took personal action to get them jobs, promotions or raises. From the ranks of those workers, Madigan built the most potent ground game in Illinois politics, which he has used to influence elections in every corner of the state, especially state House races. One of those political workers, Raymond Nice, had a six-figure job at the Cook County recorder of deeds office and later briefly was appointed to a county employee panel. More recently, prosecutors alleged that Nice was designated a subcontractor and had payments funneled to him through a ComEd lobbyist. Nice did little or no work, prosecutors said. Metra scandal. That look at Madigan is patronage army was spurred by a scandal at Metra over whether the speaker went a step too far in trying to exert his clout as he navigated the intersection of public business and ward-style patronage through his Chicago office and Illinois Capitol suite. Metra CEO Alex Clifford contended his tenure was shortened because he did not bow to Madigan is patronage demands. According to Clifford, the speaker wanted Metra to give a raise to a 13th Ward acolyte who was a labor relations specialist and secure a job for another person who was not identified. Clifford refused. In the end, he walked away with a severance package worth up to $871,000 — a controversy that ended up with public hearings. “I thought it was an ethical and moral character flaw,” Clifford testified about Madigan is actions. A secret 2014 watchdog report obtained by the Tribune concluded that “insufficient evidence” existed to say Madigan violated the state ethics act or other related laws in the Metra scandal. But Thomas Homer, the legislative inspector general at the time, issued a statement noting that “a decision to close an investigation based on insufficient evidence does not constitute a Good Housekeeping seal of approval or a best practices award.” Madigan, who requested the Metra investigation at the height of the scandal, was quoted in the report as speaking highly of one operative the speaker backed for a promotion. “You can understand that there are many people that are involved with me and campaigns and community service. Among these many people, some are better than others. (He) happens to be one of those who is better than others,” the speaker is said to have told Homer. The report also highlighted how Metra is the n-board chair once entered Madigan is Capitol office totalk about government issues and left with a yellow Post-it note bearing the names of two workers the speaker wanted to see promoted — moves the board chair later told the Tribune she did not make. And the report outlined how Clifford recalled a similar meeting in which a the n-Metra lobbyist with strong Madigan ties was spotted carrying two resumes out of Madigan is office. In his report, Homer wrote that the proximity of Madigan is discussions first about government issues and the n shifting to his favored employees “created the impression among Metra officials that the speaker is support for Metra is legislative initiatives may be linked.” “While this may not have been the speaker is intention,” Homer wrote, “the natural inferences to be drawn by Metra officials should have been obvious.” ComEd probe. Long ago, Madigan learned the ways of Chicago-style patronage under his mentor the late Mayor Richard J Daley. Since the n, Madigan has made so many inroads that at least one pocket of government has earned a nickname in his honor. At the city is Streets and Sanitation Department is bureau of electricity, Madigan enjoyed such success in placing people that the agency became known as “Madigan Electric.” That nickname has taken on a different context as the speaker has been linked to the ComEd scandal.  ComEd has admitted in federal court that it sought to influence legislation in Springfield by arranging for jobs and vendor subcontracts for Madigan is political allies, approved lobbyists and ward operatives even in instances where they performed little or no work. For instance, ComEd allegedly agreed in May 2018 to pay $5,000 a month to retiring 23rd Ward Ald. Mike Zalewski, an ally from Madigan is Southwest Side sphere of political influence, as part of a “roster” of Madigan associates. Former Ald. Frank Olivo, who represented Madigan is 13th Ward power base for years, is among those identified as getting a ComEd subcontract. Victor Reyes, the speaker is onetime ally, a former political operative for Mayor Richard M Daley and founder of the now-defunct patronage army the Hispanic Democratic Organization, is in a law firm identified as receiving ComEd legal contracts. The deal was set to shrink, but Reyes talked to a Madigan ally to try to save it from the chopping block, according to federal court records and testimony from a ComEd official. One 2019 meeting involving ComEd officials described matter-of-factly how Madigan had named people for decades to hold lower-ranking power company jobs, such as meter readers ? what one speaker ally called part of an “old-fashioned patronage system,” according to federal authorities. As part of an agreement with prosecutors, ComEd is paying a $200 million fine, the largest ever at Chicago is federal courthouse. In exchange, federal authorities will drop a charge of bribery against ComEd after three years if the power company cooperates. The federal filings on ComEd also include allegations of Madigan clout involving an individual who was well-versed in the speaker is ways. Juan Ochoa, the former head of the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority, told the Tribune for a 2014 story that Madigan called him to request a raise for the daughter of a former state senator who once represented Madigan is Southwest Side neighborhood. Ochoa said the daughter was a hard worker who deserved a raise, and she got it after Madigan is call. “I did not feel like he was putting a gun to me but, the n again, he is the speaker of the House,” Ochoa explained at the time. “This was someone who is important to the speaker of the House, who to a great extent controlled our legislation and funding.” These days, federal prosecutors have alleged that in 2017, Madigan sought to appoint Ochoa to ComEd is board of directors. The request was made by longtime ComEd lobbyist and Madigan confidant Michael McClain to the n-ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore, prosecutors said. Pramaggiore received internal company resistance and asked McClain if Madigan would be satisfied if she secured a $78,000 part-time job for Ochoa rather than the board seat, but McClain said the speaker would appreciate if she’d “keep pressing,” according to court documents. Around September 2018, having been elevated to an executive post with Exelon, Pramaggiore allegedly reassured McClain: “You take good care of me and so does our friend (meaning Madigan), and I will do the best that I can to, to take care of you.”  Ochoa was appointed in April 2019, but he is no longer on ComEd is board. Madigan is ties to the ComEd scandal were on display on two fronts this week. In Chicago, former ComEd executive Fidel Marquez, who oversaw lobbying efforts, pleaded guilty to bribery conspiracy for participating in a long-running jobs scheme designed to influence Madigan is legislative decisions. In Springfield, Democrats and Republicans in the House debated whether the speaker conducted himself in a manner unbecoming of a lawmaker. The proceedings were part of an evenly split Special Investigative Committee, one that the nation is longest-serving legislative leader dismisses as a Republican “stunt” to get free media coverage before the November election. Democrats rejected Republican attempts to subpoena Madigan, Marquez and a lineup of the speaker is associates who allegedly benefited from jobs and contracts. Madigan is letter to the committee loomed large at a hearing, where House Republican leader Jim Durkin maintained Democrats would have to disregard ComEd is admissions to believe the speaker “did not know what was going on around him.” In his letter, though, Madigan maintained that ComEd is agreement with federal prosecutors “does not attribute any misconduct to me. It asserts that certain individuals at ComEd hired individuals I purportedly recommended in an attempt to influence me. But let be me clear: that attempt was never made known to me — if it had been, it would have been profoundly unwelcome.” Under oath. What does Madigan look for when he makes a job recommendation? A Madigan deposition the Tribune first disclosed last year gave a few clues. He acknowledged giving recommendations on behalf of a number of members of his 13th Ward organization for government jobs, ranging from the offices of Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White to Cook County is circuit court clerk. Madigan knew the whereabouts of his troops so well that when he was asked about a policy analyst at City Hall, the speaker recalled that person, a member of his ward organization, had switched over to a job at a different government agency. “I recommended him to the (Chicago Housing Authority),” Madigan testified. And he was hired, an attorney asked? “He was hired.” Madigan also had a recommendation to replace the retiring Zalewski in the neighboring 23rd Ward seat when the alderman left the City Council: state Representative Silvana Tabares. Who did you talk to, the speaker was asked? “Rahm Emanuel,” Madigan said. The the n-mayor appointed Tabares to the seat. At another point, Madigan was pressed on whether it is his standard practice to recommend precinct captains for positions in various levels of government. “You can understand that many people come to me asking for recommendations for employment, and I render recommendations for employment in both the private and the public sector.

38,Fauci Refused to Coauthor Paper With Wuhan Scientist Daszak Claiming COVID Was Not Made in a Lab,15.67,33.0,https://nationalfile.com/fauci-refused-to-coauthor-paper-with-wuhan-scientist-daszak-claiming-covid-was-not-made-in-a-lab/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-file-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-05,25,"Last Updated on June 5, 2021Peter Daszak, the man behind the EcoHealth Alliance, was behind research into coronavirus es at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China, and helped funnel money from Anthony Fauci is National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) towards their research,as National File reported. In fact, Daszak has been very open with the research conducted at said labroratory, which has been suggested as a potential source for the COVID-19 outbreak. National File reported this week on the emergence of a video from Daszak from December 2019, where he boasts about manipulating coronavirus es in the lab. “Coronaviruses are pretty good… you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily,” Daszak said in the interview posted to YouTube. “The spiked proteins drive a lot about what happens. You can get the sequence you can build the protein, we work with Ralph Baric at UNC to do this, insert into the backbone of another virus and do some work in a lab.”Yet despite this open admittance into the manipulation of coronaviruses, Daszak has been one of the loudest voices against the “lab-leak” theory, dismissing it as a “conspiracy theory,” and organising multiple actions trying to shut it down. In February 2020,he was behind a letter from multiple scientists rubbishing the theory, and only one week later,coauthored a paper from the NEJMwhich stated that “scientists tell us that SARS-CoV-2 did not escape from a jar,” contrasting the outbreak to the Greek myth of Pandora is Box. This paper, in fact, shows further ties between Daszak and Fauci. Recently published em ails show that Fauci, in fact, was given access to the paper beforehand, and even asked if he wanted to coauthor the paper.2/ That was the first public effort to use a big scientific journal to steer attention from the lab. A week later, Daszak did so again, with an@NEJMpaper insisting the virus had to be natural. Guess who saw the paper in advance and was asked to coauthor it?Dr. Anthony Fauci.— Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson)June 3, 2021The first part of the email fromGreg Folkers,Fauci is Chief of Staff at the NIAID, is redacted, but likely contains some discussion regarding the upcoming paper. “So the question to you – do you want to be a part of this? ie [sic] be a coauthor,” Folkers asks Fauci. “I would vote no – it wud [sic] look weird to add you as a coauthor now. Plus, plate too full,” he continues. “I agree,” Fauci curtly replied. “I will not be a co-author.”As National File reported,Daszak had praised Fauci for dismissing the lab leak theory, despite further em ails showing that he was initially concerned about such an event having occurred:“As the PI of the R01 grant publicly targeted by Fox News reporters at the Presidential press briefing last night, I just wanted to say a personal thankyou [sic] on behalf of our staff and collaborators, for publicly standing up and stating that the scientific evidence supports a natural origin for COVID-19 from a bat-to-human spillover, not a lab release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” Daszak said. “From my perspective, your comments are brave, and coming from your trusted voice, will help dispel the myths being spun around the virus’ origins,” he continued, expressing his wish to thank Fauci in person. Only a few months after that email, Fauci helped restore funding to Daszak is EcoHealth Alliance, which President Trump is administration had cut off over fears that the organisation had indulged in the potentially deadly “gain of function” experiments that led to the COVID-19 outbreak. Despite the treasure trove of thousands of em ails from Fauci being legally obtained from Freedom of Information Act requests, Big Tech has worked to shut down access to these em ails from the general public. The Informed Consent Action Network was locked out of their Twitter account twice in 24 hours after they publicized that they had acquired 2,957 em ails sent from Anthony Fauci between February and May of last year. Following National File is reporting, their account and two tweets were restored,with Twitter claiming that they had done so “in error.”",1,0,National File

He got a week for contempt of court. It was not a big deal. He is a tough enough guy. But that is not what I want to write about. I want to write about what he told me related to medical care in jail. He was in jail in Arlington County, Virginia, one of the wealthiest counties in America. He said the jail was actually quite nice. It was clean, the cells were spacious, and the deputies who served as guards could not have been any more pleasant and respectful. And although the food was terrible, things could have been worse — except, that is, when it came to medical care. When my friend was first processed, he met with a nurse, who interviewed him about his current medical conditions. My friend suffers from diabetes, and he is on three prescription drugs for it. He is also supposed to eat a low-carb diet to prevent spikes in his blood sugar. He answered all of the nurse is questions and was told that he would receive all of his medications after dinner that evening.toConsortium News’But the meds never arrived. He was awakened at 4:30 a.m. every day to have his blood sugar checked, and it was checked again every afternoon at 3:30 or so. But the medication never arrived. Meanwhile, his blood sugar and blood pressure moved higher and higher. He complained every time a nurse came to check his blood sugar levels that he had not received any medication and he was going through withdrawal. All that did was to cause the nurses to simply stop coming. Nobody checked his blood sugar for his last three days in jail. There is a business reason why the nurses threw my friend under the bus. They took a calculated risk that he would not die of a diabetes-related stroke or heart attack before being released. Imagine doing that for 1,000 patients. Or 1,000,000. If each patient is medication costs $5 a day, that adds up to real money. And that is the business model forCorizon Health, the country is largest provider of for-profit “medical care” in American prisons. The company is contracted with 534 prisons and jails in 27 states, and it treats 15 percent of all the prisoners in the USs. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, Corizon has be ensued 660 time sin the past five years for wrongful death, providing substandard medical care and inadequate staffing. It has been fined untold millions of dollars. But the company sees that as the price of doing business. Again, they can make more money by just not treating people and hoping that they do not die than they can by actually providing medical care and the n paying court-ordered legal settlements. Take as just one example the case ofMarques Davis. The 27-year-old was a prisoner in the Kansas Department of Corrections, where Corizon has an exclusive contract to provide medical care. Davis went to a Corizon nurse saying that he felt weakness in his arms and legs. The nurse determined that Davis was “malingering,” that is, making it all up so he did not have to work. Months later, with the numbness worsening, Davis began to complain that he felt like something was “eating his brain.” In fact, something eating his brain. It was an untreated fungus that caused his vision to blur, his speech to slur and his cognition to become so impaired that he began to drink his own urine. Davis finally had a heart attack and was taken to a local Kansas City hospital. A CT scan revealed “dramatic swelling of the brain.” A day later, he was dead. Davis’ lawyer hopes to prove in court that this was not an isolated incident, but “a clear and consistent pattern of Corizon delaying, postponing, or not providing necessary medical treatment.” AnACLU spokesmansaid, “Corizon is simply writing off the damages they are having to pay as the cost of doing business without doing anything meaningful to improve.”The only way to force change and to try to stop these atrocities from happening is in the courts. So far, Corizon has shown that it simply does not care what the courts say about its behavior or about the depravity of its business model. Arizona, however, has an idea. After scores of lawsuits against the company for failing to provide adequate care to prisoners and for failing to make any improvements in the delivery of healthcare, despite court orders to do so, Arizona simply threw Corizon out of the state. And the n the state legislature passed a (nonbinding) resolution urging private equity firms based in Arizona to divest the mselves of Corizon stock. Corizon leaders huffed and puffed and released statements saying that they had been wronged. They also did nothing to improve healthcare. But if 49 other states did the same thing, at least Corizon medical professionals could not kill any more innocent people.toConsortium News’Post Views:527",1,0,Consortium News

A generation. What is left to be said?Have not we said it all? The names, the images, the stories of tragedy and heroism. The lives lost, the lives changed forever. God willing, the stories will be told for as long as there is someone to tell the m—the individual tales that so encapsulate the things upon which our civilization is founded. The police officer, the firefighter, the chaplain, the office colleague who went back just one more time, the one who ran up the stairwell after the second impact, just to make sure that another innocent life, the life of a stranger, a colleague, a friend, a loved one, was rescued. The stories of those who died, sacrificing their lives in what our Lord and Savior instructed us is the ultimate act of love; “Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends.”The West—our civilization—is unique and the greatest of all civilizations that have ever existed because it rejects the cultural selfishness of the East, where the collective decides what is of import and the individual is, ultimately, expendable. Likewise it rejects the culture of the Middle East, where all that matters is power, whose tribe or clan is the most feared, or which can destroy the most. Ours is such a peculiar civilization in that it eschews the natural instinct to parochialism and power—jettisoning the seemingly genetically obvious “Me First!” instinct—replacing it with the exhortation “servus,” I am your servant, unto death if necessary. The mere fact that our Christian world is greatest symbol is the Cross, a barbaric tool of torture and death, is remarkable. The persecuted are the saved. The persecuted are chosen. The persecuted, those marked for death, have already won. Forever. For these reasons, I choose to see the heart of 9/11 this way, as the greatest affirmation since the Civil War of our Christian heritage and the Christian values built into the founding of this, the greatest nation on God is Earth, peopled by the greatest and most self-sacrificial and grace-filled citizenry in the world. But this should be obvious to anyone who loves America and understands that the West truly is the apotheosis of human culture. But remarkably, there is something missing in the conventional wisdom about September 11, an undeniable fact that the “elite” denied the n and, incredibly, denies even more robustly today. Man is fallen. He cannot be “perfected.” Ask anyone who actually lived under a regime which sees as its putative objective, the creation of a “better” man, be it Robespierre is Paris Commune (a realinsurrection), Lenin is “Workers’ Paradise,” Mao is China, or Pol Pot is Khmer Rouge. Man can choose—individually—to fight his innate and basest tendencies, but his natural state has been the same since the first Neanderthal prized his neighbor is mate or coveted his hunting trophies and killed to obtain them. It matters not where or when it is, Man is always a fallen creature. Ask those herded into the concentration camps of the Balkans less than 30 years ago, or the Yazidi girls sold into sexual slavery by ISIS after Obama so precipitously withdrew our forces from Iraq just a decade ago. And this is the most important lesson on the anniversary of the events from that sunny Tuesday morning 20 years ago. Evil is real. It lurks in the hearts of men, it walks the Earth and will until Judgment Day. It is remarkable to think that 9/11 did not forever convince our “betters” of this truth. The imagery of people jumping from the Twin Towers to their deaths, the towers collapsing—the devastation jihad is brought to New York, DC, and Pennsylvania. But it did not. Nor did the manual decapitation on camera of US citizens, the mass murder of Egyptian Christians on the shores of an ISIS-controlled Caliphate, or even the broadcast immolation of a Jordanian pilot captured by those calling the mselves warriors for Allah. Yet now we witness those self-same “experts” declare their hope for an inclusive Taliban government that will strive for “legitimacy.” This is worse than cretinism, it is a psychotic level of self-delusion. Evil is real. It walks the Earth today and it must be met with courage and brute force until it is crushed, just as it was when we entered the White House to serve a commander-in-chief who vowed to destroy the physical caliphate of ISIS Which we did in just five months, despite being told by Obama that it was a “generational threat” which we just had to get used to enduring. And now, just eight months after President Trump left the White House, the jihad is who protected and gave succor to 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden not only control Afghanistan, they have $83 billion worth of weapons Biden gave the m, as well as new allies who also hate us, including the world is greatest Communist dictatorship, China. Thanks to delusional, feckless cowards in Washington, there will be another 9/11 and only those who understand the true lesson of 20 years ago can save us from it.",0,0,American Greatness

Sanders released ten years' worth oft ax returnsMonday night, fulfilling a long-standing promise to do so. The returns indicated that Sanders is now a millionaire, having collected more than $1 million in 2016 and 2017 thanks to the sales from his booksandBernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution. Sandersdodged questions about his new-found wealth during a Monday night town hall on Fox, declining to say if he would pay a top tax rate of 52 percent, the highest bracket proposed during his 2016 run for the White House. He also did not respond to a question from Fox is Martha MacCallum about if he would voluntarily give money to the government to bring his tax bill up to what he thought a fair rate was. If he did, or if his tax plan were implemented, Sanders would increase his tax liability by nearly 30 percent, analysis of his tax returns indicates. Sanders has not announced any substantive changes to the income tax system during his 2020 run. However, during his 2016 run, Sanders floated a comprehensive overhaul to the tax system in order to help pay for his proposed Medicare-for-All plan. According to analysis from the right-leaning Tax Foundation, Sanders is 2016 proposal would add four new top tax brackets with rates of 37 percent, 43 percent, 48 percent, and 52 percent, It would also add a 2.2 percent ""income-based [health care] premium paid by households,"" which the Tax Foundation writers say is ""equivalent to increasing all tax bracket rates by 2.2 percentage points.""Using the Tax Foundation is estimates of Sanders is brackets, as well as the senator is reported 2018 taxable income of $519,529, we can estimate a total tax liability under his schema of $170,240.11. If Sanders were paying taxes under his own plan, he would be shelling out an additional $36,819.11 to the government, and have a tax liability of 32.7 percent of his income. Luckily for his finances, Sanders does not live under his own tax regime. Rather, Sanders enjoyed a tax cut thanks to the TCJA, just like millions of other Americans.""Ever since President Trump signed the Republican-sponsored tax bill in December 2017, independent analyses have consistently found that a large majority of Americans would owe less because of the law,""reporters Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley wrote on Sunday. ""Preliminary data based on tax filings has shown the same.""Multiple tax-policy think tanks have provided tools to estimate tax liability with and without the TCJA Using the information provided in Sanders is 2018 tax return, these calculators indicate major benefits to his bottom line from the TCJA. (Note: these estimators make a number of assumptions, and so may not perfectly reflect Sanders is real tax liability without the TCJA.)One tool, provided by the Tax Policy Center (a joint project of the left-leaning Urban Institute and Brookings Institute) estimates that Sanders is income tax liability without the TCJA would have been $144,451; with the tax law, it fell to $106,782, a drop of $37,669. Another estimator from the Tax Foundation estimates a total tax liability (including payroll) of $188,753.06 before the bill and $149,773.88 afterwards, a $38,979.18 drop. In other words, the TCJA—which Sandersvoted against—saved him nearly $40,000 in taxes in 2018, roughly the additional tax burden he would have to face if his preferred tax code was implemented.2020 Election,Bernie Sanders,Taxes,Trump Administration",1,1,Washington Free Beacon

When Trump granted a commutation toCraig Cesal, by contrast, he freed a man who had already served 17 years of what was originally a life sentence for repairing trucks that were used to transport marijuana. As those examples reflect, Trump is acts of clemency mixed favors to cronies with relief for genuinely deserving federal prisoners hit with grossly disproportionate penalties. Thecontroversyover his choices highlights longstanding problems with a clemency system that is a woefully inadequate remedy for the injustices routinely inflicted by rigid and draconian federal sentences. Trump isfinal batch of 70 commutations brough this total to 94, which included dozens of nonviolent drug offenders, 18 of whom had received life sentences. He shortened more sentences than all but one of his eight most recent predecessors. The one exception is Barack Obama, who granted a record 1,715 commutations, nearly all in his second term and the vast majority during his last year in office. Even Obama, however,approvedjust 5 percent of petitions for commutations, five times Trump is rate (which was in turn 10 times George W Bush is rate) but still pretty slim odds for people languishing behind bars, often because of conduct that violated no one is rights. On Trump is last day in office,complainedthat he had ""largely bypassed a rigorous Justice Department process for vetting and approving"" pardons and commutations. Yet that process, as theTimesnotedtwo days later, ""has left thousands of petitions waiting for review with a small team of lawyers unable to keep up.""Margaret Colgate Love, who served as the Justice Department is pardon attorney from 1990 to 1997,saysshe was ""continually frustrated by the hostility of the prosecutors to whom I reported, who evidently feared that pardon would undo their hard work."" Those prosecutors ""were unreceptive to suggestions that pardon could tell good news about their work by showcasing rehabilitation and redemption.""As a result, Love says, ""the Justice Department sent few favorable pardon recommendations to the White House."" While some of the system is critics think the White House should cut the Justice Department out of the process (as Trump effectively did) to avoid this conflict of interest, Love argues that a better approach would be for Congress to let judges or executive agencies perform some of the clemency system is functions. People often seek pardons, for example, to recover their Second Amendment rights, something that Love suggests could be accomplished ""by application to an administrative agency or a court."" She notes that the FIRST STEP Act, a 2018 law that Trump supported, authorized judges to reduce prisoners' sentences for ""extraordinary and compelling reasons,"" a reform that could be expanded to cover many of the people who are now desperately hoping for commutations. President Joe Biden has promised that he will ""broadly use his clemency power for certain non-violent and drug crimes."" He should do that throughout his administration, instead of waiting until he is nearly out of office. Biden also favors abolishing the mandatory minimum sentences that he championed for decades as a senator. Such reforms, especially if they are retroactive, would have a much bigger impact than liberal use of clemency: During the first year after the FIRST STEP Act took effect, its relatively modest changes resulted in shorter sentences for more than 7,000 people. That amounts to less than 5 percent of federal prisoners, nearly half of whom are serving time for drug offenses. But the law still helped four times as many prisoners in one year than even Obama managed through commutations in eight. If Biden truly wants to atone for his long history as a hard line drug warrior, he cannot let sentencing reform sink to the bottom of his priorities.",1,1,Reason
50,They Told Their Therapists Everything. Hackers Leaked It All,0.0,47.33,https://www.wired.com/story/vastaamo-psychotherapy-patients-hack-data-breach/,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,25,"Jere woke upon the morning of October 24, 2020, expecting what Finnish college students call, an ordinary day. It was a Saturday, and he’d slept in. The night before, he had gone drinking by the beach with some friends. They’d sipped cheap apple liqueur, listened to Billie Eilish on his boom box. Now Jere (pronounced “yeh-reh”) needed to clear his head. He was supposed to spend this gray fall day on campus, finishing a group physics project about solar energy. The 22-year-old took a walk around the lake near his apartment outside Helsinki. Then, feeling somewhat refreshed, he jumped on the bus. The day went quickly. Jere caught up with his friends, many of whom he had not seen since the pandemic began. They chatted about their Christmas plans, ordered pizzas from a favorite local spot, and knuckled down to work in the cafeteria. This article appears in the June 2021 issue. Subscribe to WIRED At around 4 pm, Jere checked Snapchat. An email notification popped up on his screen. His hands began to shake. The subject line included his full name, his social security number, and the name of a clinic where he’d gotten mental health treatment as a teenager: Vastaamo. He did not recognize the sender, but he knew what the email said before he opened it. A few days earlier, Vastaamo had announced a catastrophic data breach. Asecurity fl awin the company is IT systems had exposed its entire patient database to the open internet—not just email addresses and social security numbers, but the actual written notes that therapists had taken. A group of hackers, or one masquerading as many, had gotten hold of the data. The message in Jere is in box w asa ransom demand.“If we receive €200 worth of Bitcoin within 24 hours, your information will be permanently deleted from our servers,” the email said in Finnish. If Jere missed the first deadline, he’d have another 48 hours to fork over €500, or about $600. After that, “your information will be published for all to see.”Jere had first gone to Vastaamo when he was 16. He had dropped out of school and begun to self-harm, he says, and was consuming “extreme amounts” of Jägermeister each week. His girlfriend at the time insisted he get help; she believed it was the only way Jere would see his 18th birthday. Andrew Williams Matt Burgess Scharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoDuring his therapy sessions, Jere spoke about his abusive parents—how they forced him, when he was a young kid, to walk the nearly 4 miles home from school, or made him sleep out in the garden if he “was being a disappointment.” He talked about using marijuana, LSD, DMT He said he’d organized an illegal rave and was selling drugs. He said he’d thought about killing himself. After each session, Jere is therapist typed out his notes and uploaded them to Vastaamo is servers. “I was just being honest,” Jere says. He had “no idea” that they were backing the information up digitally. In the cafeteria, Jere grabbed his bag and told his friends he’d turn in his portion of the physics project the next day. On the bus ride home, he frantically text ed his best friend to come over. Then his mother called; as the adult listed on his old account, she’d received the ransom note too. She and Jere were on good terms now, but if she got involved she might learn what he’d said in his sessions. Then, he says, he’d probably lose her from his life completely. He told his mother not to worry. That afternoon, he filed an online police report. Jere poured himself a shot of vodka, the n two or three more. He found his va pe pen and took a Xanax, prescribed to him years earlier for anxiety. He’d stored a few pills in his bedroom drawer just in case, but he never believed he’d need them again. He passed out shortly after his friend arrived. The next morning, Jere checked Twitter, where he was both horrified and relieved to learn that thousands of others had received the same threat. “Had I been one of the only people to get the mail, I would have been more scared,” he says. Vastaamo ran the largest network of private mental-health providers in Finland. In a country of just 5.5 million—about the same as the state of Minnesota—it was the “McDonald is of psychotherapy,” one Finnish journalist told me. And because of that, the attack on the company rocked all of Finland. Around 30,000 people are believed to have received the ransom demand; some 25,000 reported it to the police. On October 29, a headline in the read: “Vastaamo Hacking Could Turn Into Largest Criminal Case in Finnish History.” That prediction seems to have come true. If the scale of the attack was shocking, so was its cruelty. Not just because the records were so sensitive; not just because the attacker, or attackers, singled out patients like wounded animals; but also because, out of all the countries on earth, Finland should have been among the best able to prevent such a breach. Along with neighboring Estonia, it is widely considered a pioneer in digital health. Since the late 1990s, Finnish leaders have pursued the principle of “citizen-centered, seamless” care, backed up by investments in technology infrastructure. Today, every Finnish citizen has access to a highly secure service called Kanta, where they can browse their own treatment records and order prescriptions. Their health providers can use the system to coordinate care. Andrew  Williams Matt  BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoVastaamo was a private company, but it seemed to operate in the same spirit of tech-enabled ease and accessibility: You booked a therapist with a few clicks, wait times were tolerable, and Finland is Social Insurance Institution reimbursed a big chunk of the session fee (provided you had a diagnosed mental disorder). The company was run by Ville Tapio, a 39-year-old coder and entrepreneur with sharp eyebrows, slicked-back brown hair, and a heavy jawline. He’d cofounded the company with his parents. They pitched ­Vastaamo as a humble family-run enterprise committed to improving the mental health of all Finns. For nearly a decade, the company went from success to success. Sure, some questioned the purity of Tapio is motives; Kristian Wahlbeck, director of development at Finland is oldest mental health nonprofit, says he was “a bit frowned-upon” and “perceived as too business-minded.” And yes, there were occasional stories about Vastaamo doing shady-seeming things, such as using Google ads to try to poach prospective patients from a university clinic, as the newspaperreported. But people kept signing up. Tapio was so confident in what he’d created that he spoke about taking his model overseas. Before “the incident,” Tapio says, “Vastaamo produced a lot of social good.” Now he is an ex-CEO, and the company he founded is being sold for parts. “I am so sad to see all the work done and the future opportunities suddenly go to waste,” he says. “The way it ended feels terrible, unnecessary, and unjustified.”Tapio grew up in a “peaceful and green” neighborhood in northern Helsinki during a bad recession. His mother, Nina, was a trauma psychotherapist, and his father, Perttu, a priest. His grandparents gave him a used Commodore 64 when he was 10, which led him to an interest in coding. Something in his brain resonated with the logical challenge of it, he says. He also saw it as a “tool to build something real.”The obsession endured: In middle school Tapio coded a statistics system for his basketball team, and in high school he worked for the Helsinki Education Department, showing teachers how to use their computers. Rather than going to college, he set up an online shop selling computer parts—his first business, funded with “a few tens of euros,” he says. A couple of years later, at age 20, he joined a small management consultancy. The idea for Vastaamo came to Tapio when he was working with the Finnish Innovation Fund, a public foundation that invests in solutions to social and environmental problems. The fund sent him on a survey of health care systems in Western Europe. Being his mother is son, he noticed that the Netherlands and other countries seemed to do a better job of providing mental health services than Finland did; the public system at home was known for patchy coverage and long wait times. Ever the coder, he wondered whether a web-based counseling service would help. It could sell vouchers to cities and towns, which could distribute the vouchers for free to residents. People could use the service anonymously. They would not have to worry about the stigma of seeking care, and they’d have access anytime, anyplace. Andrew  Williams Matt  BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoIn 2009, the Finnish Innovation Fund backed Tapio is idea with an initial grant of about $12,000. He and his parents used the money—along with more than $13,000 of their own savings—to start Vastaamo, Finnish for “a place where you get answers from.” Tapio registered the company as a social enterprise, meaning that the bulk of its profits would be poured back into its mission to improve mental health services. He would own around 60 percent, and most of the remainder would belong to his parents. Perttu would serve as CEO Clients could send a message to Vastaamo, and within 24 hours they’d get a personal response from a qualified therapist. (Wahlbeck, of the mental health nonprofit, notes that such services are not regulated by the government.) But counseling by internet “was not enough for customers,” Tapio says. Many of them needed access to in-person therapy. One way to meet that need was to grow Vastaamo into a network of brick-and-mortar clinics. Tapio planned to digitize whatever he could, from bookings to invoices to medical records—everything but the appointment itself. The idea was that independent therapists would join Vastaamo to avoid dealing with their own administrative headaches. Freed by automation, they’d have more time to spend with clients (and rack up billable hours). To deliver on this vision, Vastaamo needed an electronic medical record system, but Tapio did not like the options he found. Either the systems bristled with irrelevant features or they were too tightly tailored to a different area of medicine. The lack of good software, Tapio says, was one of the “main reasons” nobody had done what Vastaamo was about to attempt. A Vastaamo clinic location in Espoo, near where Jere lives. Rather than use an existing system, the company designed its own. It launched in late 2012, around the same time Vastaamo is first in-­­person clinic opened, in the Malmi district of Helsinki. Tapio would not go into technical detail about the system, but in court documents he suggests it was browser-based and stored patients’ records on a MySQL server. More important for Vastaamo is­ purposes, the interface was easy to use. When therapists applied for a job at the company, they heard all about how much it would quicken their work. Andrew  Williams Matt  BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoBut the slick exterior concealed deep vulnerabilities. Mikael Koivukangas, head of R&D at a Finnish med tech firm called Onesys Medical, points out that Vastaamo is system violated one of the “first principles of cybersecurity”: It did not an onymize the records. It did not even encrypt them. The only thing protecting patients’ confessions and confidences were a couple of fire walls and a server login screen. Anyone with experience in the field, Koivukangas says, could have helped Vastaamo design a safer system. At the time, though, fears of a breach were far from Tapio is mind. The summer after Vastaamo is first clinic opened its doors, he took over as CEO and set the company on a path toward expansion. In 2014 there was a change in the regulations around Vastaamo is business. The Finnish Parliament decided to split medical information systems into two categories. Class A systems would connect with Kanta, the national health data repository, so they’d need to meet strict security and inter operability standards. Anyone who planned to keep their patients’ records in long-term electronic storage would have to use a Class A system. Smaller organizations, the kind that kept vital records in manila envelopes and filing cabinets, would be allowed to use Class B systems. These were not as tightly regulated, in part because they would not make very interesting targets for a hacker. Class B operators would simply self-certify to the government that their setup met certain requirements. “The government” being, in this case, a single man—Antti Härkönen—whose purview includes all 280 Class B systems in Finland. The new law gave Vastaamo several years to adopt a Class A system. The problem, Tapio says, is that the Finnish government had not specified how psychotherapy practices should format their data. Vastaamo could build a Class A system and plug into Kanta, but there was “no way to stop, for example, general practitioners at health care centers or occupational health physicians from accessing” therapy records, he says. Outi Lehtokari, Kanta is head of services, pushes back against this claim. “Tapio might have misunderstood how Kanta works,” she says. Patients can choose to restrict access to their information. In any event, on June 29, 2017, Vastaamo registered a Class B system. As Tapio tells it, the company was eager to upgrade to Class A as soon as the government released formatting specs for psychotherapy. But that did not happen. Instead, when the specs came out, Vastaamo kept on going with its Class B Tapio says that Finland is “supervisory authorities” the n signed off on the system “numerous times” in the years ahead. Härkönen, who is one of those authorities, says that to monitor all the Class B systems carefully would be “mission impossible” for him. He adds, however, that there should be more “proactive inspections.”By 2018, Vastaamo was operating nearly 20 clinics and employing around 200 therapists and staff. By the end of 2019, annual revenue had risen to more than $18 million. The company drew the interest of Intera Partners, a Finnish private equity firm, which bought out the majority of Tapio is and his parents’ stakes. Tapio took home nearly $4 million from the deal. Andrew  Williams Matt  BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoWith each new clinic that opened, the original process repeated: Härkönen reviewed Vastaamo is self-certification and gave the thumbs-up. More patient data flowed into the MySQL server. And the reservoir behind the dam rose a little higher. Tapio first heard from the hacker on September 28, 2020. The demand was 40 bitcoin, around half a million dollars at the time. The message came to him and a pair of developers he’d hired in 2015, Ilari Lind and Sami Keskinen. Lind was responsible for maintaining the company is IT systems, including its servers and firewalls; Keskinen was the data protection officer. According to a statement Tapio made to Helsinki District Court, he immediately notified various government authorities, including the police. Lind sifted through Vastaamo is network traffic logs but reported finding no evidence of a hack. Tapio hired a security company called Nixu to investigate further. Two days later, Tuomas Kahri, COO of Intera Partners and chairman of the board of Vastaamo, sent an email to Tapio to thank him for his diligence in handling the breach. Kahri would later say that some of his own loved ones had been targeted in the attack. In early October, Tapio got another shock. Keskinen and Lind called with a confession: Just before they’d joined Vastaamo, they had been arrested as part of a security breach at Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation. Lind had discovered that he could download Tekes’ entire database, containing information on as many as 20,000 companies, by changing the URL on a funding application. He informed Tekes, which fixed the vulnerability—but he also notified Keskinen, who downloaded the database. There was a pretrial investigation for aggravated fraud, breach of confidentiality, and burglary, but the prosecution could not establish that Lind and Keskinen had used the database for financial gain. Tapio says that if he had known about the two men is histories, he would never have hired them. (Keskinen and Lind declined to comment.) As it was, though, he had more pressing problems to worry about. On the morning of Wednesday, October 21, the hacker posted a message on Ylilauta, an anonymous public discussion board. “We have attempted to negotiate with the Ville Tapio, the CEO of vastaamo, but he has stopped responding to our emails,” they wrote in English. Until they got their 40 bit coin ransom, they were going to leak 100 patient records each day. The first batch was already up on a Tor server. Anyone who wanted to could go read them. The hacker started em ailing with Henrik Kärkkäinen, a reporter at the newspaper. To prove they were the real McCoy, they uploaded a file to the Tor server called “henrik.txt”—a snippet of their exchange. In em ails to Kärkkäinen, the hacker scorned Vastaamo: A company with security practices that weak was the real criminal, he recalls them writing. They claimed to have been sitting on the stolen database for 18 months, unaware of its value. When Ylilauta is moderators removed the posts, the conversation migrated to Torilauta, a popular discussion forum on the dark web. The hacker took on a name: ransom_man. At least one desperate person offered to pay the full 40 bitcoin. Another wrote, in English, “I have discussed about very private things with my therapist and will literally k ys myself if they are released.” They had their bit coin ready: “I can send it in minutes, I am constantly refreshing this page.” About 30 payments ended up going to the hacker is Bitcoin wallet, according to Mikko Hyppönen, the chief research officer at F-Secure, a global cy ber security company. It is unclear whether ransom_man actually deleted anyone is information. Andrew  Williams Matt  BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoThe hacker did follow through on another promise, however. On October 22, they leaked 100 more patient records. Some belonged to politicians and other public figures. They contained details about adulterous relationships, suicide attempts, pedophilic thoughts. The next batch came around 2 am the following morning. The hacker also put all the records they’d leaked so far into a single file called “Vastaamo.tar.”And the n something strange happened. Ransom_man replaced the first “Vastaamo.tar” with a much bigger one. It was 10.9 gigabytes—the entire leaked database. This file also contained a Python script that the hacker had used to organize the therapy records. The 10.9 GB upload seems to have been a mistake, because it disappeared in a matter of hours, along with the entire Tor server. Some speculated that Vastaamo had paid the 40 bitcoin, though company officials denied it. One victim had their bit coin ransom at the ready. “I can send it in minutes,” they wrote. “I am constantly refreshing this page.”Either way, ransom_man soon changed tactics and started extorting individual patients. This was unusual. Most of the time, cy ber criminals go after institutions, according to Hyppönen. He knew of only one earlier instance of patients being singled out—in late 2019, after a breach at the Center for Facial Restoration in Miramar, Florida. (Since the Vastaamo attack, he adds, two other hacks have also targeted patients of plastic surgery clinics.) “Most attackers want money, and health care data is not directly monetizable,” Hyppönen says. But with real-world examples of the crime paying off, he adds, “it could become more common.”Vastaamo reacted by offering patients a free counseling session. Therapy continued as normal. One patient says her therapist advised her to consider that not everything being said in the news was true. Some patients picked up a physical copy of their records, to learn what had been stolen, and others joined Facebook groups dedicated to victim support. Jere, however, opted not to; he wanted to minimize his online presence. He changed his phone number and purchased credit protection. He never seriously considered paying the hacker, he says, because “there was absolutely no guarantee they would obey” their own terms. A Vastaamo clinic location in Turku. On the Mondayafter the breach became public, Tapio went to Vastaamo headquarters in Helsinki. He’d been summoned there by Tuomas Kahri, the Intera COO who a month earlier had thanked him. Instead of speaking to Tapio face to face, Kahri had a consultant hand him a letter. It said that Tapio is contract as CEO was terminated. Andrew  Williams Matt  BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoHours later, the company announced Tapio is dismissal. Shortly after that, in response to a legal motion filed by Intera, the Helsinki District Court ordered the temporary seizure of $11.7 million worth of the Tapio family is assets—exactly what Intera had paid for its share of Vastaamo. Kahri declined several requests to comment on Intera is claims, but they are described in public (albeit redacted) court documents. In its filings, Intera says it became aware of two previously unreported breaches at Vastaamo, in late 2018 and the spring of 2019. The second date fell shortly before the buyout went through. “Based on the information received so far, it is reasonable to assume that Ville Tapio was aware of the breach,” Intera argues. Not only that, but he “sought to conceal” it. Intera wanted to dissolve the transaction and reclaim the purchase price. Tapio, as the defendant, submitted written testimony in rebuttal. He claims to have been blind sided by the news of the 2019 breach. The reason he did not find out about it at the time, he writes, is that Keskinen and Lind—the “system architects”—never told him about it. On the morning of March 15, Vastaamo is servers crashed and the patient database was replaced with a blackmail message. Tapio notified staff of the crash at 11:18 am, but no one appears to have discussed the possibility of a breach in either of the reports submitted to the government. According to Tapio is testimony, ­Keskinen and Lind—who shared an administrator account—told him that the crash might have been caused by some minor adjustments they’d made shortly beforehand. But he says that Nixu, the cy ber security company he hired in September, found something else: The shared account read the ransom message and deleted it. In Tapio is version of events, the n, whoever was using that account covered up the March breach. And the reason they did it, he contends, was to conceal a vulnerability they’d created the mselves—one that had left Vastaamo is patient database “without firewall protection” for more than a year. There were supposed to be three levels of security surrounding the database, Tapio tells me: one firewall at the network level, which blocked connections from the public internet; another around the individual server that stored the patient database; and the server configuration itself, which prevented connections from outside accounts. In November 2017, Lind spent a few hours configuring the server to allow remote access. Tapio believes that Lind and Keskinen wanted to be able to manage the server from offsite, and that instead of going to the trouble of setting up a VPN, they simply peeled back the firewalls.“Those are two professionals that know much more about the network and firewall and server management than I,” Tapio says. “I was not responsible.”Keskinen and Lind have not testified in the Intera case. They declined to comment on Tapio is numerous allegations. Until the dispute is resolved, the $11.7 million that Intera wants back—the fortune that Vastaamo built—will remain frozen. In early Januaryof this year, the Vastaamo patient database reappeared on at least 11 anonymous file-sharing services across the public internet. The file contained all the same records as before but was a fraction as big, so it spread easily. Without an accompanying message, the motivations for the upload are hard to discern—but it did appear fewer than 48 hours before Vastaamo is board was due to discuss the company is future. Was this a spiteful push to bring the company down?Andrew  Williams Matt  BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoIf so, the n it was a success. On January 28, Vastaamo was put into liquidation, and it filed for bankruptcy two weeks later. In early March, its staff and services were transferred to Verve, a provider of occupational welfare services. The acquisition did not include Vastaamo is customer data, and Verve will use a Class A system. Almost immediately after the hack happened, Parliament fast-tracked legislation that would allow victims like Jere to change their social security numbers in case of a serious breach. But patients were spooked, one counselor told the newspaper. “Not everyone who needed help may have sought treatment,” he said. Some argue that therapists should never be able to enter session notes into Kanta; now more than ever, patients will not risk having their data travel beyond the consultation room. In wider medicine, Koivukangas says, the Vastaamo scandal has highlighted the “unmet demand” for electronic medical record systems that are scalable, easy to use, and—crucially—secure. This is an area ripe for disruption, he says, and “prior to this breach, many thought with good reason that Vastaamo would have been one of those disruptors.” Until the market­place improves, he says, expect more bespoke solutions, and more breaches. Unless ransom_man is caught and the Finnish authorities sort out everything that happened at Vastaamo, it will be impossible to know exactly how “the incident” began. Would it have happened, for example, if Finland had been more proactive in policing electronic medical systems? Or if Tapio had implemented a more secure system? What is clear is how it ended—in the most painful way possible for tens of thousands of patients. As more health care systems across the world go digital, the risk of that outcome rises.“Being honest about my mental health turned out to be a bad idea,” Jere says. He worries about identity the ft, about some debt collection company calling him out of the blue and demanding tens of thousands of euros. He worries that his history of teenage alcoholism, so well documented on the web, will make it hard for him to find meaningful work as an adult. And he still worries that his mother may read his file one day. It is somewhere in the ether, accessible to anyone. Subscribe now.mail@wired.com.",2,2,WIRED
51,"To Compete with China, Take a Page from the Reagan Playbook",4.33,43.33,https://www.thebulwark.com/to-compete-with-china-take-a-page-from-the-reagan-playbook/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-02,17,"If the USs is to take the initiative in its great power competition with China, we should study America is last victorious grand strategy. The Reagan administration moved the Cold War to its endgame by taking the initiative through measures short of warfare, and that era is technology competition holds lessons relevant for a strategy of geo economics today. At stake in the Sino-American rivalry is who gets to tilt the table of the twenty-first century and slide trillions of dollars of prosperity and international political influence toward a center of gravity in Beijing or Washington. Some commentator son the American right roll their eyes at “zombie Reaganism” in the form of a warmed-over 1980s policy agenda, while liberal skeptics have dismissed the accounts of Reaganites who touted a coherent grand strategy pursued by their administration. Yet, for contemporary strategists and diplomatic historians, Reagan is results stand the test of time. Of course, we cannot and should not try to replay the Reagan performance like an episode of VH1 is. Sound answers to a historical set of geostrategic problems underpinned Reagan is success, but America is problems of the 1980s are not those of the 2020s. What we need to replicate is that era is mode of geostrategic thinking and the lessons learned for how to get America out of a rut. Failing to think geo economically over the last three decades blinded us to Beijing is technology strategy and lost us initiative, but intensifying public-private partnerships for strategic objectives can retake it and enhance American economic competitiveness. Power competition provides the focus and need for American innovation policies, which in turn produce technological breakthroughs that create prosperity when commercialized by the private sector. Debates about what “a foreign policy for the middle class” would look like misses this connective tissue between political power competition and a prosperous middle class. At the heart of the Reagan administration iscompetitive strategy was an aggressive pursuit of winning “the Technological War”—the application of a defense industrial base to strategic objectives. The aim is to make your opponent counter your moves, and dance to your tune, in major resource allocations through industrial policy. Technological war targets enemy willpower directly, paralyzing it with demonstrations of superior capabilities, so that a hot war is postponed or not fought. The 1980s have a rich history of such industrial policy. For example, Reagan-era industrial policies in microelectronics and semiconductor manufacturing were successes that formed the basis of US information technology dominance in the 1990s. In the 1980s, Japanese makers made significant inroads in the semiconductor and high-performance mainframe computer market that were understood to be critical for next-generation military capabilities. To beat back this challenge, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)launched the Strategic Computing Initiativewith $1 billion invested over ten years (1983-93), and also founded the Semiconductor Manufacturing Technologyconsortium in 1987 as a public-private partnership to regain competitiveness for American companies. Surprise in the mind of enemy staff i sa key element of technology strategy. Displays of strategically relevant military, industrial, or scientific breakthroughs—conducted in concert with diplomatic offensives—can sap the adversary is self-confidence in his offensive operational concepts. This imposes uncertainty on him and gains you the initiative, which when paired with a political-psychological strategy can project dominance, the backbone of deterrence. Technological competition is an inevitable fact of international economics, but as a strategy underpinning the military buildup of Reagan is grand strategy, it was devised by defense intellectuals such as Andrew Marshall, longtime director of the Office of Net Assessment in the Defense Department. Marshallchampionedthe view that America had to determine which of the Soviet Union is pressure points were most vulnerable to comparative US strengths and selectively compete with them. Later, Reaganites such as Secretary of DefenseCaspar Weinbergerand Under Secretary of Defense for PolicyFred Ikléapproved approaches that paired offensive and defensive moves for such competition. The offensive move applied our military-industrial base to innovative capabilities that would provoke Moscow to counter them by costly science and technology investments. The most famous and provocative of these was the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), but it was hardly the only or most important offensive move to stimulate Soviet fears about US superiority in high technology. The defensive move orchestrated technology security and export controls to deny Moscow access to Western technical innovation and scientific knowhow, make it more difficult for the Soviets to catch up to American expertise. Iklé is office established technology security policy at the Defense Departmentfor the first time, defining technology as a valuable national security resource and controlling its transfer to allied and friendly governments. Iklé believed—correctly, as we would come to learn—thatSoviet industrial theft and economic espionage of Western technology accelerated its military advances in the 1970s. This technological strategy was the necessary foundation for making effective economic, diplomatic, ideological, and psychological offensives that pushed the Soviet Union off balance and subverted its prestige and willpower in Eastern Europe. America under Reagan took the initiative in the Cold War without firing a shot, and shifted the configuration of force in its favor, through asymmetric military advances powered by technological competition. In this way, the Reagan administration set up the Bush team to win without fighting, and made the 1980s an end game of peaceful victory for America. So, how does the USs get out of a rut this time? Retaking the ge oeconomic offensive requires American statesmen to embrace our history of industrial policy and to reject mythologies about innovation arising merely from commercial competition. Alexander Hamiltoncreated the nation is firstpublic-private partnership to help compete with Great Britain. The USs won the race to nuclear fission and nuclear weapons, and in the decades that followed the Americannational laboratory system built off the Manhattan Project is science and technical innovations. DARPA funding laid the Internet is technical foundations. Of the dozen major technologies integrated in the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, eleven of them stem from or were advanced by US government (usually Department of Defense) support. As Daniel Sarewitzwrites:Americans lionize the scientist as head-in-the-clouds genius (the Einstein hero) and the inventor as misfit-in-the-garage genius (the Steve Jobs or Bill Gates hero). The discomfiting reality, however, is that much of to day is technological world exists because of DOD is role in catalyzing and steering science and technology. This was industrial policy, and it worked because it brought all of the players in the innovation game together, disciplined them by providing strategic, long-term focus for their activities, and shielded them from the market rationality that would have doomed almost every crazy, over-expensive idea that today makes the world go round. For the Sino-American competition, American statesmen must remember this basic offensive move of geoeconomics. A consensus on taking the initiative through industrial policy may be forming already. But what good is the initiative if you cannot keep it? Industrial security and technology export controls paired with rule-making influence at international scientific organizations are critical defenses. Technology denial aims to keep asymmetric advantages from being unraveled by an adversary is overt technology transfer, industrial the ft, or economic espionage. If properly orchestrated, technology security keeps you on the ge oeconomic offensive. Orchestrating domestic technology security measures, multilateral export control regimes, and diplomatic pressure at international institutions will require savvy multilateralism, and they are a major growth area for US defensive action in the Sino-American competition. For example, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the USs (CFIUS) is America is main defensive instrument to mitigate, on grounds of national security, the risk of legal transfer of sensitive technology or expertise through corporate mergers and acquisitions. But CFIUS relies mainly on voluntary reporting for compliance, and many American lobbyists assist foreign corporate clients with navigating CFIUS procedures to purchase US companies and possess their intellectual property. US export controls are similarly disjointed. The problem for Washington is coordinating with foreign capitals to block export to Beijing of knowledge or commodities, such as intellectual property or advanced semiconductor manufacturing equipment, that constitute critical sub-components to the technology competition. The West is main architecture for technological security in the Cold War, the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), impeded Soviet industrial espionage against critical technologies such as microelectronics. COCOM was abolished in 1994 and replaced with the Wassenaar Arrangement, a deficient successor not aimed at China and mostly restricting conventional arms rather than sensitive science and technology transfers. The deepest positional moves of technology security occur at scientific and technical regulatory and governance bodies at international institutions like the UN. This is the grand chessboard where Beijingtriesto convert its scientific leadership into global advantage. US success will preserve Western initiative for defining international legal rules and scientific standards and unravel Beijing is attempts to play Western countries off each other. Diplomacy in these institutions is the long game for pushing and keeping the PRC off-balance in technology competition. Sun Tzufamously judged that attacking the enemy is strategy is best and the worst is to attack his armies and cities. In grand strategic terms, fighting represents the failure to inflict enough uncertainty in the mind of a rival to deter his aggression against the peace. Attacking the enemy is strategy can be done—indeed is done preferably—in peacetime competition. A strategy of technology competition, offensively through industrial policy and defensively through technology security controls, is a way to neutralize rival advantages before the fighting starts.",1,1,The Bulwark

If she were in charge, Greene told Donald Trump is former strategistSteve Bannonon his “War Room” program Wednesday, “I would kick out every Chinese in this country who is loyal” to the communist party because “China tried to kill us, and did kill us, this past year” with COVID-19. “If I had my way, I would come down on China so hard.”Greene subscribes to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory that China, where COVID-19 first emerged,deliberately created COVID-19 to kill Americans.

People who refuse to be vaccinated also serve as “incubators” for increasingly stronger variants of COVID-19 that threaten everyone, health experts warn.“Viruses do not mutate if they do not replicate,” said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House chief medical adviser, last month. “If you give them the opportunity to replicate by allowing them to [spread] from person to person, you are giving them a perfect opportunity to mutate even more and perhaps evade the vaccine.”Greene also told Bannon that to punish China she would crank up Trump is tariffs on the country, apparently mistakenly believing,as the former president did, that China the n would have to somehow pay money to the US treasury. In fact, US importers of Chinese goods pay the tariffs.

53,223 People Have Died With COVID-19 After Getting Fully Vaccinated: CDC,9.67,35.67,https://www.theepochtimes.com/223-people-have-died-with-covid-19-after-getting-fully-vaccinated-cdc_3818232.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/epoch-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-17,25,"Over 1,100 people in the USs have been hospitalized with COVID-19 after being fully vaccinated against the virus that causes it, and more than 220 have died, according to new figures from a top US health agency. The number of hospitalizations among the fully vaccinated is up to 1,136, and the number of deaths among the same population is 223 as of May 10, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The numbers could also be under counted because “national surveillance relies on passive and voluntary reporting, and data might not be complete or representative,” according to the CDC Breakthrough metrics refer to cases, hospitalizations, or deaths among people who have seen two or more weeks elapse since receiving the final dose of a COVID-19 vaccine—the single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine or the second shot of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. Of the people who died after being fully vaccinated, 42 were asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19, according to the CDC Additionally, 342 of the hospitalizations were asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19.“Many, many hospitals are screening people for COVID when they come in, so not all of those 223 cases who had COVID actually died of COVID They may have had mild disease, but died, for example, of a heart attack,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky said on CNN is “State of the Union” on May 16. Under the usual counting program, people who have not been vaccinated but who die of heart attacks or other causes while testing positive for the CCP virus are typically listed as a COVID-19 death. The death rate among the fully vaccinated is “extraordinarily low” when taking into consideration the death rate of COVID-19 itself, Walensky said. Some 115 million people had been fully vaccinated as of May 10. Clinical trials showed the Pfizer vaccine to have a 95 percent efficacy rate in preventing infection by the virus; the Moderna shot to have 94 percent; and the Johnson & Johnson shot to have 66.9 percent. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was studied later than the others. No other shots are currently authorized for use in the USs. The CDC last week dramatically altered previous masking guidance, saying fully vaccinated people can go without masks in many indoor settings.“We now have science that has really just evolved even in the last two weeks that demonstrates that these vaccines are safe, they are effective, they are working in the population, just as they did in the clinical trials, that they are working against our variants that we have here circulating in the USs, and that, if you were to develop an infection even if you got vaccinated, you ca not transmit that infection to other people,” Walensky said on ABC is “This Week.”If people are vaccinated, “they are safe,” she said. She also said health officials are trying to figure out how a COVID-19 outbreak occurred among the New York Yankees, who were mostly vaccinated.“I would consider that, when you look at the details that I am aware of, seven of those eight were completely asymptomatic. The eighth was a mild case. They were detected on routine testing that generally does not happen in many other populations. This is the vaccine working,” she said. “This means that you did not get infected—or you did not get a severe infection. You did not require hospitalization. You did not require death [sic], and most likely those people were not transmitting to other people.”“We are just doing the best we can with it,” manager Aaron Boone said. “Fortunately, he is another one that feels good. So we will just continue to try and be vigilant and handle it as best we can.”",1,0,Epoch Times
54,Whiteness helps shield Donald Trump from election consequences,-19.33,24.0,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/whiteness-helps-shield-donald-trump-election-consequences-n1274244,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,25,"Hervis Rogers, a 62-year-old Black man, waited over six hours to vote in Texas’ Democratic primary in March 2020. “I figured like it was my duty to vote. I wanted to get my vote in to voice my opinion,” het old a CNN report erat the time. “And I was not going to let nothing stop me.”Now,Rogers faces up to 20 years in prison for voting while on parole — despite not knowing he was technically ineligible to vote at the time. Around the time of the primary, former President Donald Trump was already laying the groundwork to challenge the results of the 2020 election,casting doubt on the security of mail-in ballots. Culminatingwith a speech in Washington, DC, on January 6, Trump knowingly incited that day is act of domestic terrorism, as theFBI has defined it, in an attempt to nullify the votes of millions of Americans. Yet, he is facing zero criminal charges. There is, clearly, a disparity between the scope of both crime and punishment here. This injustice is even more appalling when you look at the facts of Rogers’ case. His lawyer has stated that Rogers did not know it was illegal to vote while on parole. In fact,The Washington Post reported that in at least 20 states, it is not a crime to vote while on parole. Also, Rogers was arrested the day before theTexas Legislature began its special session, which Texas’ governor called to enact sweeping voter suppression laws. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who ordered the arrest and himself i sunder indictment for felony fraudcharges,tweeted after Rogers’ arrest: “Hervis is a felon rightly barred from voting under TX law. ... I prosecute voter fraud everywhere we find it!” (But Paxton has said the allegations against him are politically motivated and has denied any wrongdoing, according toThe Texas Tribune.)Trump, however, is not the only Republican using his white privilege to avoid the same penalties Black Americans face for the identical — or lesser — conduct. Trump, however, is not the only Republican using his white privilege to avoid the same penalties Black Americans face for the identical — or lesser — conduct. For example, in Pennsylvania,Trump supporter Bruce Bartmancompleted a request for a mail-in ballot so his mother could vote in the 2020 election. The only problem was his mother had died 12 years before. But Bartman, 70, was so dedicated to helping Trump that he wanted to vote for him twice. (He actually tried to vote for Trump three times by also registering his mother-in-law as a Republican, despite the fact that she was also dead.)In the end, Bartman was able to vote in his late mother is name. An investigation followed, and Bartman was charged. He ultimately pleaded guilty in April to perjury and unlawful voting. His punishment for his intentional scheme of voter fraud: five years of probation. This atrocious disparity is also clear in the recent case of RepublicanEdward Snodgrass, who serves as a local elected official in Ohio. After an election worker questioned the signature on a ballot submitted in the name of Snodgrass’ father, Snodgrass admitted his father had died before the absentee ballot had arrived and that he had forged his deceased father is signature. Snodgrass was initially charged with afourth-degree felony that could have resulted in six months in jail, but instead he was offered anda greed to a plea deal of a $500 fine and serving three days in local jail. Compare that to the case of Crystal Mason, a Black woman in Texas who in 2016 attempted to vote while on supervised release after serving five years in prison. After her mother urged her to vote, Mason headed to the polls not knowing she was ineligible. Mason is name did not appear on the voting rolls, so she submitted a provisional ballot that was never even counted. What was her punishment for simply casting a provisional ballot that was never counted?Five years in prison. That case is now on appeal to Texas' highest court for criminal cases while she is out of jail on bond. Now stop to consider the even more mind-blowing fact that over 500 people have been charged for trying to “stop the steal” as Trump demanded of them — yet he walks free. And alarmingly for our nation, Trump is now back on the roads pewing the same lies that incited the January 6 attack and openly defending the terrorists who attacked the Capitol in his name. As a lawyer this literally makes no sense to me. As an American, it outrages me to see this glaring injustice since we all know that if Trump was Black or Muslim (or both!) he would already be, rightfully, charged with various crimes. Rogers and Mason may end up in prison for years for unknowingly voting while ineligible, while Trump knowingly incited an act of domestic terrorism to overturn the votes of millions of Americans and not only walks free but is being celebrated by the GOP This is beyond white privilege. This is dangerously toxic white supremacy that will very possibly lead to more violence unless Trump is brought to justice.

55,“Overdue”: Biden sets August 31 for US exit from Afghanistan,0.0,46.0,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/08/overdue-biden-sets-aug-31-for-us-exit-from-afghanistan/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-08,25,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said Thursday the US military operation in Afghanistan will end on August 31, delivering an impassioned argument for exiting the nearly 20-year war without sacrificing more American lives even as he bluntly acknowledged there will be no “mission accomplished” moment to celebrate. Biden pushed back against the notion the US mission has failed but also noted that it remains unlikely the government would control all of Afghanistan after the US leaves. He urged the Afghan government and Taliban, which he said remains as formidable as it did before the start of the war, to come to a peace agreement.“We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build,” Biden said in a speech from the White House is East Room. “Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future.”The administration in recent days has sought to frame ending the conflict as a decision that Biden made after concluding it is an “unwinnable war” and one that “does not have a military solution.” On Thursday he amplified the justification of his decision even as the Taliban make rapid advances in significant swaths of the country.“How many more, how many more thousands of American daughters and sons are you willing to risk?” Biden said to those calling for the US to extend the military operation. He added, “I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan, with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.”The new withdrawal date comes after former President Donald Trump is administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban to end the US military mission by May 1. Biden after taking office announced US troops would be out by by the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack, which al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden plotted from Afghanistan, where he had been given refuge by the Taliban. With US and NATO ally forces rapidly drawing down in the past week, there was growing speculation that US combat operations have already effectively ended. But by setting August 31 as the drawdown date, the administration nodded to the reality that the long war is in its final phase, while providing itself some cushion to deal with outstanding matters. The administration has yet to complete talks with Turkey on an arrangement for maintaining security at the Kabul airport and is still ironing out details for the potential evacuation of thousands of Afghans who assisted the US military operation. Biden said that prolonging US military involvement, considering Trump had already agreed to withdraw US troops, would have led to an escalation of attacks on American troops and NATO allies.“The Taliban would have again begun to target our forces,” Biden said. “The status quo was not an option. Staying meant US troops taking casualties. American men and women. Back in the middle of a civil war. And we would run the risk of having to send more troops back in Afghanistan to defend our remaining troops.”The president added that there is no “mission accomplished” moment as the US war comes to an end.“The mission was accomplished in that we got Osama bin Laden and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world,” he said. US forces killed bin Laden in 2011. US forces this week vacated Bagram Airfield — the US epicenter of the conflict to oust the Taliban and hunt down the al-Qaida perpetrators of the 2001 terrorist attacks that triggered the war. Remaining US troops are now concentrated in Kabul, the capital. The Pentagon said the top US commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Scott Miller, is expected to end his tour of duty this month as final arrangements are made for a reduced US military mission. Biden, answering questions from reporters after his remarks on Thursday, said that Kabul falling to the Taliban would not be an acceptable outcome. The president also pushed back against the notion that such a scenario was certain.“Do I trust the Taliban? No,” Biden said. “But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped and more competent in terms of conducting war.”To be certain, the West hopes Taliban gains will be confined mostly to rural areas, with the Afghan government and its allies retaining control of the cities where much of Afghanistan is population resides. And while the Taliban remain a major power in Afghanistan, the government is supporters hope that Afghans will work out the Taliban role in the post-US Afghanistan power structure more through political than military means, partly through the inducements of international legitimacy, aid and other support. Asked by a reporter whether rampant corruption within the Afghan government contributed to the failure of achieving the sort of stability that his predecessors and American military commanders envisioned, Biden did not exactly dismiss the notion. “The mission has not failed — yet.”Biden continues to face pressure from congressional lawmakers to offer further detail on how he intends to go about assisting thousands of Afghans who helped the US military as translators, drivers and in other jobs. Many are fearful they will be targets of the Taliban once the US withdrawal is complete. The White House says the administration has identified US facilities outside of the continental USs, as well as third countries, where evacuated Afghans would potentially stay while their visa applications are processed. Biden added that 2,500 Afghans have been granted special immigrant visas since he took office in January. Still, the president faced Republican criticism following his speech.“The Taliban is gaining more ground by the day, and there are targets on the backs of our people and our partners,” said Representative Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “But rather than taking the opportunity to reassure the American people there are sufficient plans in place to keep American diplomats and our Afghan partners safe, President Biden only offered more empty promises and no detailed plan of action.”John Kirby, chief Pentagon spokesman, said Thursday that the US military is considering several overseas bases around the world as possible temporary locations for those Afghans awaiting a visa. So far, he said, the numbers of those who have decided to leave Afghanistan are not so high that they ca not be handled with a range of installations.“Our message to those women and men is clear,” Biden said. “There is a home for you in the USs if you so choose. We will stand with you, just as you stood with us.”Biden noted that as a senator he was skeptical about how much the US could accomplish in Afghanistan and had advocated for a more narrowly tailored mission. He was somewhat opaque in answering whether the cost of the war was worth it, but argued that the US objectives were completed long ago.“We went for two reasons: one, to bring Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, as I said at the time,” Biden said. “The second reason was to eliminate al-Qaida is capacity to deal with more attacks on the USs from that territory. We accomplished both of those objectives. Period.“That is why I believe this is the right decision and quite frankly overdue.”—Associated Press writers Ellen Knickmeyer in Oklahoma City and Lolita C Baldor in Washington contributed reporting.",2,2,Denver Post
56,“We are Not Allowed to Hang Up”: The Harsh Reality of Working in Customer Service,-7.67,44.67,https://www.propublica.org/article/not-allowed-to-hang-up-the-harsh-reality-of-working-in-customer-service,https://adfontesmedia.com/propublica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-21,24,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they are published. Last year ProPublicawroteabout the world of work-at-home customer service, spot lighting a largely unseen industry that helps brand-name companies shed labor costs by outsourcing the task of mollifying unhappy customers. As we reported on the industry,we invited current and former customer service representatives to contact us. They did. We heard from more than 100 and interviewed dozens. Often, their stories disturbed us. One woman, afraid to take a bathroom break, kept a jar under her desk in case she needed tourinate. Another, afraid to call in sick, paused calls to vomit. A third, afraid to hang up on a customer, did not know what to do when she realized a caller was masturbating to the sound of her voice. These accounts captured how agents are simultaneously ubiquitous and invisible. Customers talk to them all the time but know little about their work conditions. So we are providing accounts from seven agents, many of whom describe the experience of being caught between abusive callers and corporate directives to appease. These seven are highly representative of the 100-plus agents we heard from, as well as the agents we interviewed in our first article. The agents, including some who told us they love their setups, laid out common the mes, describing problems that people at various levels of the industry, including managers, have told us are endemic. We have also found echoes of these complaints in lawsuits and arbitration claims. Abusive callers are such a concern that, a few years ago in Canada, a union for telecommunications workers launched a campaign called “Hang Up on Abuse.” Airbnb, recognizing the emotional strain of taking such calls, offered their in-house customer service agents free therapy sessions. The reps we spoke to needed these jobs, which allowed them to work from home even before the pandemic. They included people with disabilities, caretaking obligations or limited opportunities in rural towns. Recruitment ads touted flexibility and the chance to be your own boss. But many agents discovered the roles came with limited hours, close monitoring and strict performance measurements that put them in constant fear of losing their jobs. A Department of Labor investigator concluded that one contractor, Arise Virtual Solutions, exerted an “extraordinary degree of control” over agents. Most customer service agents are women. Many describe being sexually harassed. One said a caller told her, “I really like the way you type.” Their work belongs to a grim history of women in out sourced roles stretching back to the piecework manufacturing era. A half century ago, temp work exploded, driven by companies hiring women to cut costs compared with full-time employees. These magazine ads from 1970 and 1971 show how women temps were viewed at the time, and the attitudes have certain parallels to how customer service agents are viewed today. While many agents work full time, a growing segment are independent contractors who do not get paid holidays, vacation time or fringe benefits. In the accounts below, most of the agents asked not to be identified, citing nondisclosure agreements that are common in the industry. (To work for some companies, agents must sign NDAs before they can even accept the job.) We have condensed for clarity and verified details wherever possible, collecting Facebook screenshots, email exchanges, company performance review forms, tax records and other proof of employment, along with contemporaneous recollections from agents’ relatives or friends. But there were instances in which we could not get such documentation, owing in part to the premium placed on privacy and security by the companies. Some agents said they were not even allowed to have their personal phone in their workroom while helping customers. Some lost access to their email and the company platform when they quit or were fired, and they had not made copies or screen shots beforehand. In every case we invited the companies that these agents worked with to comment. Christine Stewart has social anxiety and depression. “I have a really hard time being out in public,” she said. She wanted to work from home, so she became an independent contractor for Sykes from 2017 to 2018. The company bills itself as “a leading provider of multichannel demand generation and customer engagement services for Global 2000 companies.” At Sykes, she helped customers using Intuit is TurboTax.“I was actually sick one day, I called, they have a supervisor line, and told them I was going to be [out] sick. And without actually saying it, the lady said, you are going to be in trouble if you do not show up. And me, I do not like to get in trouble at work, I am a good employee. I went to work. I kept hitting my mute button every time I had to throw up.”During training, she said, “they told me if you wanted to work nights, you could work nights. If you want to work days, you can work days. Once you finish the training they are like, ‘This is your schedule.’ I said I ca not work that and they were like, ‘Well, this is the schedule, and if you ca not work the schedule, you do not want the job.’ I was like, ‘I need the job, I do want the job.’ I said, ‘I can do 8 a.m. to 12 p.m.’ They wanted me to do 12 to 12. I have to get my kids on the bus in the morning, I was like, ‘I need to take a five-minute break when the bus pulls up.’ Even that was a huge problem for them. They would say, ‘You ca not keep taking these five-minute breaks.’”Customers berated her. “One person called me the C-word. I’d call my supervisor. They’d say, ‘Calm them down.’ … They’d always try to push me to stay on the call and calm the customer down myself. I was not getting paid enough to do that. When you have a customer sitting there and saying you are worthless … you are supposed to ‘de-escalate.’”“There can be no background noise, no nature noises or cars passing by. I had a den. I had to insulate my den,” she said. (To confirm the expense, she shared a tax form with ProPublica that showed a $100 deduction.) “I had to turn the AC off; you could hear the AC blowing. They called me out on that. When I was training, the lady said she could hear the air conditioner in the background.”One time, she said, “my kid broke his hand.” She dropped her call, dropped everything, to help him, but the n she needed a story, because, she said, had she told her supervisors the truth — that her kid broke his hand and needed her help — “I would have gotten in trouble even if I had a hospital note.”“I said my internet went down. I pulled the plug on everything, because it was their equipment. ... I did not know if they had any kind of monitoring software that was not on the web cam or anything. It was better not to take any chances and unplug the whole thing.”full statement.)She needed money for a medical procedure, so, during the pandemic, she began working for Liveops as an independent contractor, helping customers for Bath & Body Works. She worked from home. For online orders, Bath & Body Works allows shoppers to use just one promotion per order. A customer, for example, can use a code to knock down the price of a particular item, but they ca not combine multiple codes. Customers can get upset when this is explained to them.“We encounter customers who ordered the wrong items and want us to send them the right items for free. We receive calls from customers who have had their packages stolen. And the n we get customers all the time who find out we do not sell a particular fragrance anymore, and they can be just incredibly abusive.”“I may as well say it out loud. We get called bitches all the time. One woman called me a ‘stupid fucking cunt.’”“It can wear on you. We are not allowed to answer back in the same way, nor are we allowed to hang up on them. Nor can we hang up on them after giving them one warning. The policy I am told is, we are not allowed to hang up on any customer under any circumstances, even if they question our race or ethnic background or anything like that. My understanding is that we are not even allowed to give people a warning.”“We have to sit there basically and listen to these people until they run out of steam. It is like they do not see us as a person.”With the pandemic, she said, a lot of agents are young women who lost their jobs and are desperate for anything. A lot of her fellow agents are Black women. “I have heard them say they were called ‘stupid n-----,’ ‘you stupid Black bitch.’”Read MoreWhile some customer service reps are pressed to work more hours than they want, she got too few. Last fall, she signed up to work for four and a half hours during one day. She was paid 31 cents per minute of talking time. So when she was not getting calls, she was not getting paid. For those four and a half hours, she said, she sat there with her headset plugged in.“No calls in those four and a half hours. Nothing. … I got some personal budget stuff done. Surfed web sites unrelated to work. Familiarized myself with products on the website. I hate to say it, but I think I dozed off at one point.”Were there other days in which you got no calls? we asked.“Oh, yes.”“How many?”“I lost track.”Liveops has quality auditors who listen to at least four of an agent is calls per month, she said. They score agents using an audit form, which she shared with ProPublica. It says agents should make a “connected recommendation for each opportunity throughout the interaction” based on the customer is orders. Say a customer buys soap. The agent should ask, “Did you want a soap holder, too?” If a customer buys candles, the agent should also pitch candleholders.“A customer calls to say, ‘Hey, I did not get my package.’ So I am supposed to say, ‘Hey, do you want to buy some more products when you still do not have your package?’ Oh, for crying out loud. Really.”The audit form has 20 questions. They include: “9. Did the agent compliment the customer is selections, reassure about the fragrance choices and/or give general positive reinforcement about the items? … 18. Did the agent apologize when necessary, show empathy and/or recognizes customer emotion? 19. Did the agent let the customer know that we have ‘heard’ the m, that we genuinely care, and did the agent remain engaged throughout the entire interaction?”A Liveops document said that if an agent is scores fall within the “unacceptable” range for three months in a calendar year, “the agent may be subject to removal from the program.”She said she recently received an email saying she had used profanity on a call, so Liveops was terminating her contract. She did not remember saying anything profane. The company provided no recording for her to listen to. She emailed Liveops and called corporate to ask for details or a chance to hear whatever it is she was supposed to have said, but she got no response. (She said she did not make copies of these em ails before her email account was closed.)“No appeal,” she said.full statement.)She worked as an independent contractor for Arise Virtual Solutions, a company that bills itself as a pioneer in the work-from-home industry. Customers, she said, “get mad at us. They start cursing at us. They start threatening to report us to the main office.” One customer, she said, told her he was going to keep her on the line until he got what he wanted; he “started with the F-word,” the n apologized, the n carried on. He “would not stop and would not stop” until finally, realizing the agent would not give in, he gave up. At one time she handled calls from Barnes & Noble customers. “A lot of cursing, a lot of crying — crying — believe it or not. I have been called every name in the book. And I do mean from A to Z Everything in between. I have been hung up on, threatened, told I am going to lose my job. I had one woman tell me, ‘I hope you have a miserable day.’ You ca not laugh. I ca not laugh. I am thinking to myself, ‘You ordered the Bible. You are some Christian person?’ She’d ordered a Bible! Those are the worst! Those are the worst hypocrites! They scream, curse, yell, carry on, threaten. They are the worst.”“The women, their mouths are unbelievable. Or they start crying. They are worse than the men. I am like, ‘It is a book, for God is sake.’”full statement.)She was employed by iQor (pronounced I-core) as a retention specialist and sales agent, taking calls from customers for Sprint (which has since merged with T-Mobile). She worked in a call center.“If the customer is angry and wants to completely cancel, you have 14 minutes to resolve their issue, get them to stay and sell them a new phone,” she said. A unit called workforce management would push agents along. One workforce management monitor would sit at a computer, checking the length of each agent is call. Another would walk the floor. These two would communicate by walkie talkie, one alerting the other to any agent whose call was running long.“At 10 minutes you had somebody tapping on your shoulder. At 12 minutes you had someone tapping on your shoulder and saying, ‘Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up.’ At 14 minutes, ‘What is going on? You need to wrap this up. You need to move on.’”“We had this guy who would run around on the floor yelling, ‘Move it along, people, all hands on deck, move it along, move it along.’”Agents would have management in one ear and customers in the other. Customers would often be insulting, sometimes shockingly so. She remembered one customer in particular. “He was very, very upset. And it is personal. You get called names. ‘I hope you fucking die.’” Another Sprint customer told her: “‘I hope when T-Mobile takes over, you all lose your fucking jobs, your fucking families, your fucking homes, and you all kill yourselves.’”She said she was not allowed to hang up. Only a supervisor could do that. “Where is the line where you no longer have to take that?” she said. “I spent more than one instance in the bathroom, crying, the n shaking it off and going back to work.”“I am pretty thick-skinned, and I had nightmares. It beats you down. Everybody is angry. Eight out of 10 calls, they are angry and they are cursing by the time they get to you. Usually it is the men who make it personal. That is why I coined the term AngryWhiteManistan. ‘I have another resident of AngryWhiteManistan here.’ They will say things like, ‘Well, the n, you better get me someone who is not incompetent.’”In her nightmares, she said, she would be doing some mundane task, such as making dinner in the kitchen, when the phone would ring. She’d pick up and hear: “Are you done yet? We need to move on. We need to move on. We need to move on.”heavily prioritizes customer and agent experience over more traditional call center metrics.”The company is statement added, “We have a long-held policy that all of our experts do not have to tolerate abusive speech or behavior.” (Read the company isfull statement.)did not respond to requests for comment. She is lived in “many, many states” and worked in many call centers. Now she lives out west in a rural setting where jobs, and options, are scarce. A few years ago she found a job that lets her work from home. She started as an agent at Convergys (since acquired by Concentrix), the n became a supervisor.“It is just enough of a wage that you are going to be ineligible for most public support. I am not eligible for any financial aid whatsoever. And yet I go to the food bank every month because I do not make enough money. … I do not go to the doctor, even when I should.”She said the job attracts a lot of new parents. And retirees. And people with medical issues. She said that in her experience, the turnover is “tremendous.” Within months, many people get fired, or “termed,” short for terminated. “We fire more than they resign. A lot more.”Most firings are over attendance. What counts as an attendance infraction? “Anything. It does not matter if it is in your control or not. … Your power goes out and, bam, you are absent. ... Does not matter if you had a hurricane.”“You do not know if you are going to have a job tomorrow.”Once, as a supervisor, she listened to a recording of a call that had been made to an agent working at home, answering calls from customers for DirecTV. “DirecTV had a policy, you never hung up on a customer, ever. You simply were not allowed to, no matter what they said.” (ProPublica interviewed another agent who also understood this to be the case.)“There was a guy who called in and masturbated on the phone. It was awful. … Just imagine being a woman in your office in your home, alone. And here is this guy doing this, and it takes you a few minutes to figure out what that sound is, and when you do you are horrified, and you do not know what to do. All you know is, you are not allowed to hang up the phone. That would be horrible. I felt so terrible for her.”The agent, crying, asked if she could quit for the day without an attendance infraction. “We had the recorded call, it is not like it was ever in doubt. My boss was a man, at first he did not understand why that was an issue.” He did not understand why the agent was so troubled. “I had to go to HR to get them to explain to him why it was an issue.” Only the n could the agent stop taking calls.: “We recognize that the work-at-home environment is not foreveryone. … We take the health and safety of our staff very seriously and do not have a no hang-up policy. Our staff are given extensive training to manage each interaction with techniques to deflect and diffuse situations should they arise. If subjected to harassment or abuse they are trained and empowered to end the conversation.” (See Concentrix isfull statement.)She is in her 60s and wanted a work-from-home job to keep her family safe during the pandemic. She saw a company called Arise Virtual Solutions mentioned online, but she was skeptical. She would be an independent contractor, required to absorb substantial startup costs. (ProPublica isprevious article on customer service noted that Arise is agents often spend more than $1,000 on training and equipment.)Then she saw Bob Wells, a real-life nomad featured in the movie “Nomadland,” talking about Arise on YouTube. She decided to give it a chance. “I was like, ‘I need work.’ … I’d kind of given up on finding something more legit, frankly, because of the pandemic. So it was a pandemic Band-Aid for me.”She answered calls from customers for Home Depot. One, a nurse is aide, had ordered a portable toilet for a client. “This woman was like, ‘I have a 90-year-old lady who needs this thing like, yesterday, and you have not delivered it for three weeks, what is your problem?’” To the agent, this was urgent. “When it became a humanitarian issue, and there were plenty of humanitarian issues, especially during the pandemic,” she would send the matter to people above her, who would the n send it to Home Depot to do something. The customer is problem might the n be resolved. “But my stats would go down,” she said, because she had not resolved the matter herself. (She shared Arise is performance metrics with us.)On days when the phone did not stop ringing — and there were many — she could not step away from her desk. “I had a bottle I kept under my desk in case I had tourinate. I never used it, but I had it there if I needed it. I am in my 60s. … There could be an emergency.”The work was isolating. She joined Facebook groups (and provided screen shots to ProPublica) and began totalk with other frustrated agents. She realized she was among the few white women in her work cohort. And she realized customers were nicer to her — an immigrant with a British accent. “When I first came to this country, I could not believe people could tell the color of a person over the phone. That was a culture shock. ... When people are calling in, I think they find it easier to yell at a Black woman. … I am not the most evolved person, but I began to look at the work through a racial lens. ... I answered the phone, and there were people who called, and right at the beginning of the call, they were full of white-hot rage.” Then they would hear her accent. “Well, the amount of comments I got from people who were like, ‘Wow, they have got classy people here!’ … I was born in a British colony. People think I am a butler or a classy servant.”network of agents, whom it calls service partners. “Arise does not tolerate discrimination or harassment of any kind,” the statement said. “Service Partners interacting with individual customers through the Arise® Platform are protected by both client and Arise policies and processes that include the ability to disconnect callers without penalty or transfer these calls to support resources if they are unable to de-escalate the situation.” (Read Arise isfull statement.)Mara M. was a hairstylist and cosmetology teacher when her health began worsening. “Probably in about 2015, I started sleeping a lot. Any time I would stand up I would get really dizzy, really lightheaded. One of the requirements to teach hair is to be able to stand. I could not stand up. It was a walker and wheelchair for me. … I have postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.”Mara eventually discovered Concentrix, a global customer service outsourcing company, while searching for work-from-home jobs on Indeed.com. She signed on at age 23, hoping she might be matched with a company that sold beauty products. At her orientation three weeks later, Mara learned which account — that is, which of Concentrix is corporate clients — she would be matched with. She would be working part time, doing video calls and live chats for Intuit. She would be helping people use TurboTax. Mara did not have an office. But she did have a closet. So she turned her closet into an office. (She sent us photographs.) “They sent me a blue screen to put behind my chair,” she says. That way, customers would not know she was working from home, much less from inside her closet. She bought a computer, a monitor, a headset.“We were not supposed to hang up. … You are supposed to hear them out, the n empathize with the m, the n acknowledge that the problem was made. I had tried all that. They say, you know, apologize, but the people stay angry.”One customer called her, moaning. “I was very uncomfortable. I could not tell if he was sick; I could not tell if he was watching porn in the background. I just tried to get through the guy is questions.” Afterward she told a friend that she thought the man on the other end of the line had been masturbating. (The friend confirmed this conversation.)She learned that agents were monitored. “We had a webcam, and [the monitors] can see you through the webcam. … I am not sure how often you were watched. But the trainer did say you should shut down your computer after your shift because they can still see you. I was like, that is really Big Brother. … That freaked me out because I spend a lot of time in my room.” And she learned there were no built-in breaks for part-timers. “You ca not step away when you are on the clock.” She said it felt confining, like her closet was a prison cell. She struggled to answer questions about complicated tax forms. She would Google for answers in a different window while trying to look confident to the customer, who could see her on the video call. “I had a nightmare so bad that I’d wake up at 6 in the morning over this job. I cried. I am a sensitive person, so a lot of people probably would not have cried. … I did not know what I was doing. … I was like, ‘I finally have a job, but I do not know what the answers are.’”Mara did not feel like she could quit. For the most part, she said, her metrics were high. But customers were not responding to survey questions about her performance. And her lowest score was her “doc rate” — documentation rate — which penalizes agents for not closing out a chat with a customer. They get credit only when a customer says, “Yes, you have answered all my questions.”“Some people do not answer back after they get the answers they need. For those types of chats and everything, we could not close those cases. My doc rate dropped because ... I could not close the case on some of them.”Read MoreEventually, Concentrix emailed to say that TurboTax wanted her off the account, citing “a review of stats … done over the weekend.” (Mara shared copies of the exchange with ProPublica.)“I do apologize for the inconvenience,” a Concentrix representative wrote. “Please feel free to apply for other Concentrix accounts!”Mollie Simoncontributed reporting.",2,2,ProPublica
57,Nasa is Mars landing is a reminder that good science depends on good politics,-6.0,36.0,https://www.newstatesman.com/international/science-tech/2021/02/nasa-s-mars-landing-reminder-good-science-depends-good-politics,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-statesman-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-19,16,"The successful landing of Nasa is Perseverance rover on Mars last night is a moment of scientific triumph. The mission could uncover profound truths about the Red Planet and our place in the universe. But we should not content ourselves that science is celebrated and accepted everywhere. The past year has demonstrated the ways science can be sidelined whenever it is politically expedient. Most of the differences between the modern world and the ancient one can be attributed to science. The scientific revolution introduced an entirely new attitude toward what could be considered fact. It was not enough any longer to just state what you thought; you had to explain why you thought it, and exactly how you had reached your conclusion. In particular, the founders of modern science, among them those “ingenious and curious gentlemen” (as they described the mselves) of the early Royal Society advocated that there was only one way to discover scientific truths about nature: by patient experiment, observation and reasoning. This same approach is employed to day, not only by scientists but by lawyers, detectives and anyone whose work involves categorising phenomena, forming hypotheses and testing evidence. But the desire to suppress or even stifle intellectual freedom and scientific thinking are equally durable. Such attempts fail in the long run, but they can nonetheless have a chilling effect on progress in science that can last for decades. One infamous example was that of Galileo Galilei. Following his trial by the Inquisition, in which he was found “vehemently suspected of heresy”, the scientist and philosopher René Descartes wrote to a mathematician friend:“I inquired in Leiden and Amsterdam whether Galileo is World System was available, for I thought I had heard that it was published in Italy last year. I was told that it had indeed been published, but that all the copies had immediately been burnt at Rome, and that Galileo had been convicted and fined. I was so astonished at this that I almost decided to burn all my papers, or at least to let no one see them.”The great poet John Milton, who visited Galileo in 1638, wrote that the Inquisition is restrictions on “philosophic freedom” in Italy meant that “nothing had been there written now these many years but flattery and fustian”. But just as science persists, so does the denial of science. Donald Trump, who claimed climate change was “an expensive hoax”, and that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”, denied the alarming conclusions of thousands of climate studies worldwide. As the Trump administration began the process of withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement and attempted to freeze fuel efficiency standards imposed on new vehicles, it also took aim at the science itself, suppressing research that showed the effects of climate change on the US, removing scientific advisers and restricting the data that government agencies could use to make decisions on public health and the environment. In March 1616, the Tuscan ambassador to Rome wrote that “the Roman climate is getting very dangerous [for Galileo], […] for the present Pope [Paul V], who abhors the liberal arts and this kind of mind, cannot stand these novelties and subtleties; and everyone here tries to adjust his mind and his nature to that of the ruler.” Four centuries later, little has changed in the relationship between power and truth. The Covid-19 pandemic, too, has been characterised by the dismissal of scientific opinion. On 22 January 2020, Trump said in an interview that the disease was “totally under control. It is one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It is going to be just fine.” Even in March, in a meeting with Leo Varadkar, Trump continued to brag: “The USs, because of what I did, and what the administration did with China, we have 32 deaths at this point. Other countries that are smaller countries have many, many deaths.” That was less than a year ago. At time of writing, the USs has more than 25 million cases and is nearing 500,000 deaths. Nor was this attitude limited to the Trump administration. Boris Johnson was slow to recognise the grave risks involved, and even after the pandemic had become impossible to ignore, his government did not succeed in putting together a rapid, effective response. All scientific the ories are provisional. Knowledge has to be constantly reappraised as fresh evidence becomes available. But only science can promise a continuous mid-course self-correction, even on simple things: when we were young, milk and eggs were good; a decade later, we were warned off them because of cholesterol; to day, they are recommended in moderation. This is not consistent with politicians’ need to be right, and to stay right. But it is never a good idea to bet against the judgement of science. To do so when human life (as in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic) or the future of the planet is biosphere (as in the case of climate change) is at stake is unconscionable. CP Snow is 1959 lecture on the “Two Cultures” bemoaned the failure of scholars in the humanities to appreciate the “creativity” and imagination that are essential to the practice of science. Science should surely feature in everyone is culture; it is not just for potential scientists. There are two main reasons: first, it is a real intellectual deprivation not to understand the natural world around us, and to be blind to the marvellous vistas opened by Darwin is theory of evolution or by the breakthroughs in modern cosmology – the chain of emergent complexity leading all the way from a “Big Bang” to stars, planets, biospheres and human brains able to ponder the wonder and the mystery of it all. It is essential to marvel at the intricate web of life on which we all depend, and to understand its vulnerabilities. Second, we live in a world where more and more of the decisions that governments must make involve science. Obviously Covid-19 and climate change are at the forefront of our minds to day, but policies on health, energy, the environment and space-related existential risks all have a scientific dimension. But these policies have economic, social and ethical aspects as well. And on those aspects, scientists speak only as citizens, and all citizens should be involved in democratic choices. If there is to be a proper debate, rising above mere sloganeering, everyone needs to be informed, to have enough of a feel for science to avoid becoming bamboozled by propaganda and bad statistics. The need for proper debate will become even more acute in the future, as the pressures on the environment and those resulting from misdirected technology become more diverse and threatening. The US has already rejoined the Paris agreement, but the war on facts waged by Trump is far from over. There remains little agreement on what defines a reliable source, and it seems that we may have to take up Galileo is defiant call (apocryphal as it may be) “And yet it moves” as a rallying cry: a reminder that, in spite of what you may believe, the facts do remain the same. We have been there before. In, Hannah Arendt prophetically wrote: “The ideal subject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction (ie the reality of experience) and the distinction between true and false (ie the standards of thought) no longer exist.”Galileo and the Science Deniers.

Despite what Lee is office described as ""misleading reporting,"" the state is Department of Health ""has not halted the Vaccines for Children Program that provides information and vaccine access to Tennessee parents,"" a spokesperson for the governor said in a statement to WMC.""The department is mindful of ensuring parents, not kids, are the intended audience for any outreach efforts regarding medical decisions for children and has simply re-evaluated some tactics like reminder postcards and follow-up communications,"" according to the governor is office. Fiscus said Monday she was given the option to be fired or resign, but she chose ""to be terminated because I had not done anything wrong."" She told WTVFshe believed she lost her job to appease GOP state lawmakers after she distributed information to doctors about theMature Minor Doctrine, which permits health care providers to treat certain minors without parental consent, according to the ""Rule of Sevens.""The state health department says the rule allows doctors to treat minors age 14 and older without parental consent ""unless the physician believes that the minor is not sufficiently mature to make his or her own health care decisions."" Fiscus said the health department is attorney provided a letter about the doctrine based on a 1987 Tennessee Supreme Court ruling and that her job was to explain what is allowable.""While childhood immunization rates temporarily dropped during the COVID-19 pandemic, we are already seeing vaccination rates rebound to pre-pandemic levels and will continue supporting parents who are working to get their families back on track,"" the governor is spokesperson said. In this image made from video, Michelle Fiscus speaks to the Associated Press, from Franklin, Tennessee, on Tuesday, July 13, 2021. (AP Photo)The program, which includes immunizations DTap, MMR, Polio, Chicken Pox and Hepatitis B, ""will continue to be successfully administered,"" the statement added. According to the governor is office, Tennessee ranked among the top 10 states for MMR vaccination coverage among kindergartners during the 2019-2020 school year, and 95.3% of 2020-2021 kindergarten students in Tennessee were fully immunized. For more than a decade, Tennessee has had above 90% coverage of kindergarten students receiving childhood immunizations, including DTap, MMR, polio, chicken pox, Hepatitis B, Lee is office said. Fiscus said that before her termination leadership at the state health department had instructed the department to ""no longer do outreach around immunizations for children of any kind,"" WMC reported. ""That is infant immunizations, HPV immunization in a state that has one of the highest HPV cancer rates in the country. Flu vaccine outreach in schools has been canceled,"" she said. A health department situation report, first obtained byWSMVin Nashville, said that Tennessee Department of Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Piercey had recently directed department employees not to hold any immunization event in or on school property or hold any COVID-19 vaccine events at organizations whose clientele are solely children. Sarah Tanksley, a spokesperson for Piercey, told the Associated Press the agency had ""in no way halted the immunizations for children program"" and stressed that the state will continue to support vaccine outreach efforts. Tanksley added the state is ""mindful of hesitancy"" surrounding vaccinations and pointed out the department intends to recognize National Immunization Awareness Month. Only 38% of Tennesseans are fully vaccinated against COVID-19, lagging behind much of the nation, according to the Associated Press. State Senator Raumesh Akbari, D-Memphis, said the change was ""dangerous and terrifying,"" arguing the move by the state health department provided ""an example of politics leading our public health department. That is a problem. That is an abdication of leadership.""Shelby County Health Department, which serves Memphis and operates independently from the state, said the new state health department rule would not affect their vaccine outreach. Shelby County Schools said it will continue to advise students, parents and families to get the COVID-19 vaccine. Separately, Fiscus is husband, Brad Fiscus, told The Tennesseanthat his wife received an Amazon package containing a muzzle about a week before her firing – thought it is unclear who sent the item. Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security are investigating the incident. The Associated Press contributed to this report. ",1,1,Fox News

Unilever has once again engaged creative agency RanaVerse, which led the development of the initiative, and tapped acclaimed filmmaker Tourmaline to bring the stories of these communities to life.""Our actions for systemic change will push for a fairer, more socially inclusive society by engaging community leaders, building local support services, and utilizing our communication platforms to create real change to the current anti-LGBTQ+ laws that exist in these cities,"" Fabian Garcia, president of Unilever North America, said in a press release. ""Unilever is a champion in corporate diversity, equity and inclusion practices, and remains committed to encouraging each entity, public or private, to align with these goals in support of LGBTQ+ people.""""We are thrilled to work with Unilever again on the 'United We Stand' campaign, and bring support and attention to these communities,"" said Rana Reeves, founder and CEO of RanaVerse, who has partnered with Unilever every year on the initiative. ""Through careful assessment, we targeted five communities with little to no LGBTQ+ discrimination protections and diverse needs, and used those insights to shape the campaign. This is an initiative that is for the queer community and by the queer community, and it is providing a space for so many untold stories. For me, the opportunity to work with Unilever on an effort so deeply focused on actionable purpose and systemic change has been a game-changer."" Reeves is a British-Indian gay immigrant whose agency, with offices in New York and London, helps brands ensure that their campaign work is made both for and by the community, with queer talent in front of and behind the scenes. Unilever and RanaVerse worked with LGBTQ+ community strategist Sean Coleman to select locales that scored a zero on the Human Rights Campaign is Municipal Equality Index: Monroe, La.; Moore, Okla.; Clemson, SC; Florence, Ala.; and towns and cities in need of support in southwest Missouri. Within each of those areas, they partnered with a local LGBTQ+ organization: Forum for Equality, Freedom Oklahoma, South Carolina Black Pride, the Knights and Orchids Society, and PFLAG Springfield, respectively. Tourmaline, a prominent filmmaker and artist who has also worked with ""United We Stand"" every year, will profile five diverse LGBTQ+ narratives from each of these communities for films that will make up the 2021 ""United We Stand"" campaign and will be released this month for Pride. They will be available beginning next Monday on YouTube and other platforms. While each region has its own set of challenges, there is one overarching similarity -- the lack of support for those who are the most vulnerable. ""Those that are in rural areas, are differently abled, and people of color have the least access to life-affirming services,"" Coleman said. ""'United We Stand' is different in its approach as we looked at the unique intersections that present within these communities and will work to bridge the gap, providing a blueprint that other regions can adopt.""The change-makers within these narratives represent multiple intersectional LGBTQ+ experiences including Indigenous, Black, Latinx, and transgender/nonconforming people. With a focus on ""the language of the heart,"" as Tourmaline describes it, the films will centralize these subjects' unique voices to share their stories and reflect their identities. Together, Tourmaline and her subjects are emblematic of Unilever and RanaVerse is commitment to increasing diversity both on-screen and behind the camera.""Unilever is 'United We Stand' campaign purposefully centers the voices of those organizing against harmful conditions and creating beautiful and powerful solutions in the wake,"" Tourmaline said. ""Queer people have a historic talent for lifting each other up, for banding together as one to fight for the collective good. During a time like Pride, rather than focusing on the pain and anguish of the LGBTQ+ experience, we will celebrate the thriving, abundance, and joy of the community.""The films will kick off a month of spreading awareness and information across Unilever is channels and partners, and it will include a continuation of the Unilever queer leader network, which brings together a mass assortment of LGBTQ+ celebrities, influencers, community leaders, and entertainers to help spread the campaign is message. The 2021 participants include Adore Delano, Detox, Jackie Cox, Jan Sport, Lady Shug, Nicky Doll, Latrice Royale, the Vixen, Aquaria, Heidi N Closet, Willam, Bob the Drag Queen, La'Darius Marshall, and more.

The figure rose to 2,153 in October from 1,805 in September, while the number of COVID-19 deaths reached 1,765 by the end of the month, according to theMinistry of Health, Labour and Welfare. There was also an increase in the number of suicides recorded over the past four months compared to 2019, theMinistryfigures show. In March, 21-year-old student Koki Ozora set up the Japanese online counseling site, Anata no Ibasho and told Insider: ""Anata no Ibasho means 'A Place for You' so I wanted to tell people that even if you are lonely at school, work or home, there is a place for you with us.""He said that he grew up lonely and depressed, and a high school teacher was the first adult he could trust, adding: ""Without him, I would not even be around today. It was a miracle I came across him, so I want to offer that miracle to others.""There are now 700 volunteers involved, many of whom live abroad in different time zones and can provide counseling between 10pm and dawn, when the need for suicide prevention runs highest. The most common calls are from people with suicidal thoughts, while others report stress and anxiety, Ozora added. Although Japan has declared a state of emergency, lock down has never been imposed, but record COVID-19 deaths mean it might be. Experts are concerned about how this could impact mental health, especially that of women who have been disproportionately affected this year, with an 83% rise in suicide cases to 851, compared to a 22% male increase to 1302. Ozora said: ""There are several potential reasons for this. Women make up a larger percentage of part-time workers in the hotel, food service and retail industries - where layoffs have been deep.""In addition, a succession of Japanese celebrities who had many female fans have taken their lives in recent months.""While the Japanese media rarely details the specifics of such deaths - deliberately not dwelling on method or motive - the mere reporting on these cases often causes an increase in suicide in the general public.""Japan has the highest suicide rate in the G7 and subsequently reports its data every month compared to other countries, including the US, the latest national data collected in 2018. However, suicides decreased and fell by 4% to 19,959 in 2019, the lowest amount since records began in 1978,CNNreported. Following the financial crisis of the 90s, Japan is suicide rate hit a record high in 2003 when 34,427 people took their own lives.

That will not have much practical impact on county residents at this point, but the symbolic gesture indicates how far the county has progressed in suppressing the deadly virus, he said.“We are no longer in an emergency responding to Covid-19 from the public health standpoint,’' McMahon said today. County health officials today confirmed just five new cases of the virus since Monday, the lowest one-day total since early September. There are 94 county residents with active cases of Covid-19, the fewest in more than 14 months. McMahon declared a state of emergency in the county March 14, 2020, and issued a variety of executive orders in the following months to deal with Covid-19. His orders expedited county purchasing procedures, required face coverings at county facilities and capped food delivery fees, among many other measures. Given the waning threat from the virus, McMahon said he expects to let most or all of them expire next week.“When it comes to responding to Covid-19, neither the county of Onondaga nor the state of New York is really in an emergency,’' he said. Increasingly, McMahon said he will focus county efforts on reviving the economy and dealing with human service needs that were exacerbated by the pandemic. He mentioned drug abuse, mental health and youth violence specifically. The county on Tuesday finished giving away $100,000 worth of vouchers that can be used at local restaurants. For the second time, the vouchers were snapped up quickly, leaving many people frustrated. Some $75,000 in vouchers became available online Monday evening and were taken within 18 minutes, McMahon said. The giveaway attracted some 60,000 unique visitors to the county website. Another $25,000 in vouchers was awarded today to senior citizens, who could claim them by phone. Those vouchers were gone within two hours, McMahon said. So far, the county has given away a total of $500,000 in vouchers, which can be used to double the value of gift cards purchased from restaurants. McMahon called the program a “wild success’' that will help local businesses recover from the pandemic.“I understand people may be frustrated if you did not get a voucher,’' he said. McMahon said he plans to provide more vouchers in the near future.“We will do another round,’' he said.",2,2,Syracuse Post-Standard

The poll found that 48 percent of voters still want Newsom to remain in office but the number of people who want him out is increasing.

A majority of voters say they do not know yet who they’d want if Newsom is booted from office. Elder has a nationally syndicated talk show and is a frequent guest on Fox News. He calls himself the “Sage of South Central”on his website, a reference to where he grew up in LA Former Fox News anchor and now pod caster Megyn Kelly is a fan, frequently tweeting out “LARRY!” on her feed. Elder said Newsom is handling of the coronavirus pandemic is why he decided to run.“The arrogance of Gavin Newsom was crystalized by the way he handled this pandemic,” Elder told theSacramento ObserverFriday.“This man has presided over the most severe coronavirus lock down in all 50 states. People lost their jobs, people lost their livelihoods, meanwhile his own private business kept open and his own kids remained in in-person private schools,” he said. Elder says he is not focusing on other candidates.“The target is Newsom,” he said. “If he is not recalled, it does not matter. I intend to be the person that you write down or you check off for who you want as a replacement when you recall this guy. He is going.”Elder said he is not normally in favor of recalls or impeachments.“But when someone has become so outrageous, sometimes something has to be done,” he said. The recall effort against Newsom, launched in January 2020, gained strength due to the governor is response to the coronavirus pandemic, which led to the closure of schools and businesses even as Newsom himself was photographed violating state restrictions on indoor gatherings.",1,1,New York Post

I encourage Christians to make this a day of prayer—for peace and calm, and praying for our new leaders, President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris,” Graham, who also leads Samaritan is Purse, said in a statement on Facebook. Graham is call for calm comes in the wake of theJanuary 6 attack on the Capitol building by pro-Trump supporters and others in Washington, DC, that left five people dead. The protesters sought to prevent the confirmation of Biden is victory in the 2020 presidential election by Congress.

Rachel George, a longtime Republican operative in Colorado, sent an email to at least one other local GOP strategist on Tuesday asking them to sign West isPresidential Electors' Acceptance of Nomination form so he can appear on the 2020 ballot in Colorado. George begins the email by asking for “the most random favor”: Would they be willing to serve as an Electoral College representative for Kanye West?It is clear from the tone of the email, obtained by VICE News, that she thinks it is a rather funny, last-minute effort to mess with Joe Biden and Democrats.“I have the most random favor to ask of you ever… would you help me get Kanye West on the ballot in Colorado? No, I am not joking, and I realize this is hilarious,” she wrote. Later, George says she is looking for operatives who are “in on the joke” to help West get on the ballot. George, who now runs her own firm, RBG Communications, has previously held a variety of positions with Republican campaigns and operatives, including a three-year stint as communications director for the n-Representative Cory Gardner. Gardner is now a senator facing an uphill battle for reelection in the blue-trending state. She is also married to Andy George, another longtime GOP operative in the state. Both have spent more than a decade immersed in Republican politics. George is Twitter feed reads as a paean to Gardner, with occasional defenses of Trump. In the email, George makes clear that West is campaign is trying to keep its inner workings out of the public eye. West is nascent campaign has so far refused to engage in a serious manner with reporters, a sign they do not want their efforts scrutinized too closely.“A reporter could request [the form] and call you asking why you signed,” she wrote in the email. “But you would just ignore that call and let me know, and the campaign would handle it.”Republicans have watched giddily as West weighed a potential 2020 bid, hoping he might draw crucial votes away from Biden and boost President Trump is reelection chances. In recent days, the re is been mounting evidence of a coordinated effort by GOP operatives, some with ties to the Trump campaign, to make sure that West does qualify in key swing states. It is unclear how directly involved West is in this process — or how much clear thought he is put into the campaign taking shape around him. West is rambling, partially incoherent campaign launch speech in South Carolina led to public speculation about his mental health, and his wife, Kim Kardashian, recently posted on in sta gram about West is bipolar disorder and asked for compassion from the public. It is easy to get on the ballot in Colorado — presidential campaigns just pay a fee and find nine registered voters to sign a public document pledging to vote for their candidate if they win the Electoral College. But from the email, it is clear exactly how last-minute the efforts to get West on the ballot have been. George did not respond to requests for comment, nor did Gregg Keller, another longtime GOP operative who is been linked to West is campaign.

Senate Bill 33cleared its final vote in the Senate Tuesday afternoon. Over a dozen state shave passed similar bills since 2018, as environmental and climate demonstrations have centered on energy facilities. Critics say the bill deters free speech and attempts to silence civil protests about important issues of the time. SB 33 defines critical infrastructure as oil and alumina refineries; electric generation facilities, substations, switching stations and transmission lines; chemical, polymer and rubber manufacturing facilities; water intake structure, water treatment or waste water facilities; natural gas company facilities, compressors and pipelines, and about a dozen other projects. Bill sponsor Senator Frank Hoagland, a Southeast Ohio Republican, cited examples of people tampering with valves and control systems at pipeline facilities, which can create dangerous situations along transport lines or at energy generating facilities. Construction equipment has been set on fire at facilities.“The facilities that are often targeted by such actions provide essential energy, communications and other vital services and products to the entire state of Ohio and, in some cases, the country as several sections of national critical infrastructure cross our state,” he said in remarks introducing his bill. Cheryl Johncox, the Sierra Club is Beyond Dirty Fossil Fuels organizer, argued that a Cincinnati mother who hangs a sign against Duke Energy is Central Corridor Gas Pipeline Extension Project, concerned about its health effects, could be charged with criminal mischief if SB 33 becomes law. She could face up to a third-degree felony and up to a $10,000 fine.“SB 33′s purpose is to intimidate individuals, communities, and organizations lawfully exercising their First Amendment and other fundamental rights,” she said. “This bill, among other things, is duplicative and amends Ohio is criminal trespass and criminal mischief statutes by extending potential liability to innocent landowners, passersby, peaceful protesters, and community organizations advocating for stronger safeguards for public health and the environment.”In addition to criminal mischief, there would be new penalties for the following crimes on critical infrastructure facilities: criminal trespass, aggravated trespass, making false alarms, telecommunications harassment, among others. The bill also authorizes companies to pursue people who harm infrastructure in civil court. DeWine has not said whether he will sign the bill.

When the suit-clad former prosecutor stepped up to the podium to give her speech, she commended the women who fought for the right to vote and the women in her family who nurtured her.“My mother instilled in my sister Maya and me the values that we chart,” she said, smiling at the camera. She added, “She taught us to put family first. [Both] the family you are born into and the family you choose.”Then, she named an important member of her chosen family.“Family is my beloved Alpha Kappa Alpha,” she said. Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA)—one of the nation is oldest black sororities, whose members include luminaries like actressPhylicia Rashadand poetMaya Angelou—had a profound impact on Harris’ life.

In fact, her emotional connection to the sorority runs so deep that she wore a symbol in support of her sisters—a 34”necklacebejeweled with Akoya and South Sea pearls—to her acceptance speech.“The strand of pearls speaks to solidarity among the members,” Glenda Glover, international president of AKA, told  is Daisy Shaw-Ellis in a 2020 article. “It is a great moment for AKA For African Americans. For women. Whether she wears pearls or not, it is an inspiration.”Harris often expresses this solidary and ha sworn pearls at important events from her college graduation photos hoot to her swearing in ceremony as a USs senator of California in 2017. For this reason, thousands of women plan to wear pearls on Inauguration Day in support ofHarris.“Pearls represent refinement and wisdom,” Glover told Shaw-Ellis. “We train young ladies to be leaders and to make sure they have the wisdom to lead…and that goes hand in hand with the true meaning of what AKA is all about.”According to magazine is Jill Newman, pearls have been a symbol of AKA for decades. Its founders are referred to as the “Twenty Pearls,” and every inductee is given a badge with 20 pearls.

And they have a moral responsibility not just to get a degree for the mselves, but to also enrich the community,” Ross said. “They recognize the structure [of mainstream society] is intentionally created to denigrate them as second-class citizens. And what they are doing typically in the work of the fraternities and sororities is trying to de construct that.”Ethel Hedgeman founded AKA in 1908 at Howard University with similar aims: She wanted to create a support network for black women so that they could uplift the mselves and others. According to the sorority iswebsite, Hedgeman and eight of her classmates formed a group that, “fostered interaction, stimulation and ethical growth among members.” Five years later, the group was incorporated, which ensured its legacy. From its inception, the group has focused on learning, providing aid for the poor and advancing civil rights. By the time Harris gave her acceptance speech last year, the group is numbers had ballooned to more than 300,000 members.“We were not just told we had the capacity to be great; we were challenged to live up to that potential,” Harris wrote of her AKA experience in her autobiography,. “There was an expectation that we would cultivate and use our talents to take on roles in leadership and have an impact on other people, in our country, and maybe even the world.”In her acceptance speech, Harris spoke about how she wanted to have this impact, emphasizing that, “Every human being is of infinite worth deserving of compassion, dignity and respect.” She spoke about solidarity, about how it is necessary to work with others to create a better world. Her message resonated with thousands of women across the country, and many of them plan on wearing pearls this Inauguration Day to support Harris. One Facebook group, “Wear Pearls on Jan 20th, 2021,” currently has around 375,800 members from 99 countries.“When you think about a pearl, its created by the roughness, you know, and we have pearls in every color, shape and size,” says Hope Aloaye, founder of the Facebook group. “Pearls are linked to every woman.”Though Aloaye is not a member of AKA, she still believes that championing other women is important and that wearing pearls can publicly display camaraderie, “[We] have women of every color, race, size, ethnicity and vocation,” Aloaye says. “We have one common goal, which is to represent women on the 20th supporting a woman.”Get the latest on what is happening in your inbox.",2,2,Smithsonian Magazine
69,'We have a deal': Biden reaches $1.2 trillion infrastructure compromise with bipartisan group of senators,-3.33,46.0,https://eu.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2021/06/24/biden-senators-agree-1-2-trillion-infrastructure-deal/5333841001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/usa-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-24,3,"WASHINGTON – President Joe Biden and a bipartisan group of 21 senators reached a compromise Thursday to modernize the nation is deteriorating transportation and public works systems, putting the president in position to pass the first plank of his sweeping infrastructureagenda. Yet Biden made clear he would only sign a bipartisan infrastructure bill if Congress also approves a larger measure focused on ""human infrastructure"" programs like subsidized child care,home care giving and climate change that only Democrats support. Biden announced the breakthrough after a 30-minute meeting with the senators in the Oval Office, ending a weeks long stalemate over the price tag and how to pay for what would be the largest transportation package ever approved by Congress. The $1.2 trillion plan includes $579 billion in new spending over eight years, focusing only on physical infrastructure such as roads, bridges, rail, broadband internet, water and sewer pipes, and electric vehicles. It proposes several ways to pay for the spending – including beefing up IRS tax enforcement – that avoid a gas tax increase that Biden resisted and a corporate tax hike that Republicans opposed.""We have a deal,"" Biden said, smiling as he joined 10 of the senators outside the west wing on Thursday. ""We made serious compromise on both ends.""$1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure deal gaining steam on Capitol HillAlthough not a guarantee to pass Congress, the compromise has strong odds even in a bitterly divided Congress. With the backing of 11 Republican senators and 10 moderate Democrats, the infrastructure bill would surpass the 60 votes required to overcome a filibuster if all Senate Democrats vote for it. In remarks from the White House East Room, Biden touted the ""long overdue"" infrastructure investments that he said shows the world ""we can function, deliver and do significant things."" But he also called it a ""big day"" for only half his economic agenda. In tandem, he said he will pursue separate legislation on ""human infrastructure,"" which is opposed by Republicans and pushed by liberals. To pass the bill, he will have to rely on a legislative maneuver called reconciliation, which would allow Democrats to approve it with a simple majority in the 50-50 Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris can break ties.""We will try to get some compromise the re, and if we ca not, I will see if I can attract all the Democrats into a position,"" Biden said. ""They are going to move on a dual track.""Some progressive Democrats have feared Biden is willingness to compromise with Republicans could jeopardize his more sweeping climate-change social safety-net initiatives. But Biden said he will not sign the bipartisan infrastructure bill into law unless a reconciliation bill with ""human infrastructure"" is also on his desk.""If they do not (both) come, I am not signing it. Real simple,"" Biden said. From the beginning of negotiations, Republicans did not budge from their position that a bipartisan deal stick only to physical infrastructure and avoid tax increases that targeted corporations and the wealthy. The bipartisan deal achieves both GOP aims. It proposes $312 billion for transportation, including $109 billion for repairs to roads and bridges, $66 billion for passenger and freight rail, $49 billion for public transit and $25 billion for airports. The compromise also includes $73 billion for electric and power infrastructure, $65 billion for broadband expansion and $55 billion for water and sewer projects.""We did not get everything we wanted,"" said Senator Rob Portman, R-Ohio, one of the group is lead negotiators, but said the parties came together on a ""core infrastructure package"" without adding new taxes. ""And with the commitment of Republican and Democrats alike that we are going to get this across the finish line.""To pay for infrastructure, senators and Biden agreed to more than a dozen funding sources led by strengthening the Internal Revenue Service to enforce tax collections. By going after those that owe taxes but do not pay them – particularly high-income earners – the federal government could recoup as much as $140 billion over eight years for a net gain of $100 billion that can be used to cover the cost of expanded infrastructure, said Senator Mark Warner, D-Va., one of the senators who negotiated the deal. Biden also agreed to repurpose unused COVID-19 relief funds passed in 2020 during the Trump administration as well as unused unemployment insurance benefits from Biden is American Rescue Plan, a COVID-19 relief bill made law earlier this year. Other sources include public-private partnerships, private activity bonds and asset recycling. The deal would create a new Infrastructure Financing Authority to issue bonds for clean transportation and clean energy. Senator Joe Manchin, D-W Va., a key moderate swing vote, said the deal ""meets the needs of the country for the 21st century."" He would not commit to supporting the reconciliation package but said he is committed to ""working on it.""A new New Deal? How Biden is spending plans stack up to past presidential proposalsDemocratic leaders outlined a quick time line for both bills. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, aims to have votes on both pieces of legislation in the Democratic-controlled House and Senate in July, before Congress departs for its summer recess the next month. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi assured her fellow Democrats the House will not take up the bipartisan infrastructure bill until the Senate sends over a bill focused on Biden is ""human infrastructure.""“There will not be an infrastructure bill unless we have a reconciliation bill. Plain and simple.”Senate Republican leadership blasted that arrangement, signaling a split from moderate GOP senators who led the compromise. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Pelosi and Schumer “pulled the rug out from under their bipartisan negotiators” by saying that the infrastructure deal would only advance if it was tied to a vote on the larger reconciliation package.“Less than two hours after publicly commending our colleagues and actually endorsing the bipartisan agreement, the president took the extraordinary step of threatening to veto it,” McConnell said on the Senate floor Thursday afternoon. “It almost makes your head spin: an expression of bipartisanship and the n an ultimatum on behalf of your left-wing base.”After Biden scaled back his initial $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan and agreed to seek approval of his other proposals separately, the biggest sticking point became how to pay for the bills. Republicans opposed unwinding former President Donald Trump is 2017 tax cuts, forcing Biden to retreat from his push to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% in the bipartisan package. The corporate tax hike and other taxes on the wealthy are expected to be in Democrats' reconciliation bill instead. Republican senators proposed raising the per-gallon gas tax by tying it to inflation and new user fees for electric vehicles. But the White House stood firmly against both options, noting it would abandon Biden is pledge not to raise taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000.""We have agreed on the price tag, the scope and how to pay for it,"" said Senator Susan Collins, R-Maine. ""It was not easy on getting agreement on all three, but it was essential.""Senator Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, said the compromise sends a message ""that we actually can work, that we actually can perform, that we can do something, not for Republicans or Democrats, but for Americans.""White House stands firm against increasing gas tax as Biden, senators prepare to meet on infrastructureBiden ends infrastructure talks with GOP group of senators, pushes ahead with moderatesThe bipartisan Senate talks started after Bidenended previous negotiations with Republican Senatecommittee leaders who had the backing of McConnell. Although Biden is trimmed-down infrastructure proposal earned him support from Republicans – delivering on a campaign commitment to seek bipartisanship – he is gotten push back from progressives, particularly climate advocates. They fear moderate Democrats will not vote for a reconciliation package now that they claim a bipartisan win on infrastructure.""There will not be a bipartisan agreement unless – written in stone – there is an understanding that there will be a major, major reconciliation bill,"" Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, chairman of the Senate Budget Committee sai don The Dean Obeidallah Show. Lauren Maunus, advocacy director for Sunrise Movement, a youth-led environmental organization, said ""we ca not afford to kick the can down the road any further"" on climate-change initiatives. She called Biden is first proposal ""already the compromise,"" arguing $1 trillion a year is needed to fight the climate crisis.""When Democrats agree to water it down more, they are condemning Americans to untold devastation,"" she said. “We demand no climate, no deal.""'Worst is yet to come': Disastrous future ahead for millions worldwide due to climate change, report warnsThe 10 Senate Democratic caucus members who support the infrastructure deal are Manchin, Warner, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly of Arizona, Jon Tester of Montana, Chris Coons of Delaware, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and John Hickenlooper of Colorado. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, also endorsed the plan. The 11 Republicans are: Murkowski, Collins, Portman, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Mitt Romney of Utah, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Todd Young of Indiana and Jerry Moran of Kansas. Biden expressed faith the Republican senators will keep their word and vote for the compromise. He singled out Romney, Collins and Murkowski, saying “they have never broken their words to me” and said he trusted them to “stick to the deal.'""Romney said for “years and years people have been talking about infrastructure needs of our country,"" touting how his colleagues came together ""and got a job done.”“I do not know how far it is going to get,” he acknowledged. “I think it will get all the way. We have got the president behind it, this group here. But we are going to keep working together. We are not finished.”",2,2,USA Today

71,Dems Have Crazy New Plan to Fund Biden is Infrastructure Bill: Make Billionaires Pay Their Fair Share,-16.33,35.0,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/democrats-billionaire-tax-plan,https://adfontesmedia.com/vanity-fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-22,25,"As you have probably heard by now,would like to pass a sweeping infrastructure plan that would make life better for millions of people. Republicans, who have made it abundantly clear that they do not give a crap about improving people is lives, are obviously against anything that does not start with a “t” and end with an “ax cut,” and will thus fight this thing tooth and nail. But Democrats are also having trouble coming to a consensus re: how to fund the thing, with senators likeKyrsten Sinemaexpressing opposition to a rise in tax rates. So party leadership has gone back to the drawing board and come up with a new proposal: making the richest people in the country, the ones who literally shit money, pay their fair share. PerWashington Post:Senior Democrats are preparing a sweeping new tax plan that would aim to raise hundreds of billions of dollars from the fortunes of America is roughly 700 billionaires, an abrupt shift in the party is approach to funding a large expansion of the safety net…. Senate Finance Chair(D-Ore.) is drafting the plan, but both senior Biden officials and other senior Democrats are cautiously optimistic Sinema and other centrist lawmakers support the effort, according to interviews with three congressional aides and two administration officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect sensitive negotiations. “The Billionaires Income Tax is about fairness and showing the American people taxes are not mandatory for them and optional for the wealthiest people in the country,” Wyden said in a statement. “No working person in this country thinks it is right that billionaires can pay no taxes for years on end, and sometimes never at all.”Currently, wealthy Americans do not have to pay taxes on vast accumulations of wealth because they are only taxed once the asset is sold. Billionaires often borrow against their non-taxed assets, which allows them to spend enormous sums of money while effectively paying very low taxes relative to their income and worth. Under the “Billionaire Income Tax” proposal, a summary of which was obtained byth e federal government would require billionaires to pay taxes on the increased value of their assets such as stocks on an annual basis, regardless of whether they sell those assets. Billionaires would also be able to take deductions for the annual loss in value of those assets. It would also set up a system for taxing assets that are not easily tradable, like real estate. The tax would apply to billionaires and people earning over $100 million in income three years in a row. Which seems pretty reasonable, particularly to people who, for example, did not see their net worth double in the past year to $222 billion, as was the case for who recently took to Twitter to tauntJeff Bezosfor only being worth roughly $194 billion, and thus the richest person in the world. (Yes, this happened, and is probably a good argument not just for a tax on billionaires but for bringing back the gulag.)A spokesman for Sinema would not confirm or deny whether she supports the billionaire tax, saying only that she “is committed to ensuring everyday families can get ahead and that we continue creating jobs,” and that “she has told her colleagues and the president that simply raising tax rates will not in any way address the challenge of tax avoidance or improve economic competitiveness.” The White House has reportedly been involved in crafting the details, and Biden has endorsed the concept. Republicans, it is safe to assume, will be throwing an absolute hissy fit over the whole thing in short order, because if the re is one thing they ca not stand, it is the ultra rich paying their fair share.hereto subscribe. Procedural arguments will be heard on November 1, but in the meantime, Texas‘s barbaric abortion law, banning the procedure at six weeks, will remain in effect. Per:The Supreme Court on Friday once again refused to immediately block a Texas law that banned most abortions after six weeks. But the justices agreed to fast-track their consideration of appeals from the Justice Department and abortion providers in Texas, scheduling arguments for November 1. Only Justicefiled a dissent. “For the second time, the court is presented with an application to enjoin a statute enacted in open disregard of the constitutional rights of women seeking abortion care in Texas,” she wrote. “For the second time, the court declines to act immediately to protect these women from grave and irreparable harm.”But she added she welcomed the court is decision to hear arguments in the two cases, which will apparently be limited to the procedural question of whether the Texas law, SB 8, is subject to review in federal court given its novel structure. The court said it would decide this question in the federal government is appeal: “May the USs bring suit in federal court and obtain injunctive or declaratory relief against the state, state court judges, state court clerks, other state officials or all private parties to prohibit SB 8 from being enforced?”While the court rejected a request from Texas officials to use the cases to decide whether to overturn people who think what a pregnant person does with their body is their business and their business alone should not get too excited just yet. In December, the justices will hear arguments in a case concerning a Mississippi law banning abortion at 15 weeks, and it is entirely possible that the court is conservatives will use the opportunity to roll back the landmark decision. Matt Gaetz news…According to The Daily Beast, he will not be representing himself in any courts of la wany time soon:Faced with an onslaught of accusations that he engaged in underage sex trafficking—and bracing for criminal charges—Gaetz allowed his license to practice law in his home state of Florida to lapse this month. On Friday, The Daily Beast revealed that Gaetz had not paid the fees he owes to the Florida Bar, which regulates lawyers there. That mistake prompted the organization to deem him “delinquent” and “not eligible to practice law in Florida.”Rather than assert that letting his license lapse was a simple oversight that he or someone on his staff will soon remedy, Gaetz is communication director initially claimed it was intentional. “Congressman Gaetz is no longer actively engaged in the practice of law. He is focused on representing his constituents in Congress, not the courtroom,” said(After The Daily Beast is story published, the outlet reported that Gaetz “rushed to file a signed petition to get reinstated and pay the $265 fee—plus another $200 in late fees,” citing the Florida Bar.) Lawyers who spoke to The Daily Beast said Gaetz is decision to let his license become delinquent underscores the fact that he is a clown. “He clearly does not take his law license very seriously when he does not take the time to pay the $265 dues,” saidDaniel Uhlfelder,an attorney who lives in Gaetz is district. “He is not a serious lawyer. He is not a serious congressman. He is not a serious person. This is one small but symbolic example of that.”This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

Afterfallingshort of its July 4 goal to have 70 percent of Americans vaccinated, the administration seems to be turning to a more community-focused method. In a Tuesday press briefing, President Biden warned of the danger caused by the COVID-19 Delta variant,tellingreporters that “we need to go to [sic] community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes, door to door — literally knocking on doors — to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus.”Press Secretary Jen Psaki echoed the president is remarks, reiterating the administration is commitment to “targeted, community-by-community, door-to-door outreach to get remaining Americans vaccinated by ensuring they have the information they need about both how safe and accessible the vaccine is.”Some on the political left have criticized Biden is door-knocking initiative as not enough, including Obama-era Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. “You know, we are going to tiptoe around mandates,” SebeliustoldtheNew York Times. “Come on. I am kind of over that.”But the strategy has also generated disapproval from those uncomfortable with the idea of government employees knocking on Americans’ doors. Podcaster Dave Rubinpointedout that America is COVID-19 response changed “[f]rom ‘two weeks to flatten the curve’ to ‘a man with dementia is going to send government operatives to your house to make sure you are vaccinated.’ ”Republican legislators also heavily criticized the policy, with Representative Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas)tweeting, “How about do not knock on my door. You are not my parents. You are the government. Make the vaccine available, and let people be free to choose. Why is that concept so hard for the left?”Representative Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)warnedthe administration against the new strategy: “A lot of people have big government antibodies. Do not knock on those doors.”Republicans also questioned the door-to-door campaign tactic is effectiveness. GOP strategist Matt Whitlocknotedthat government employees showing up at American homes was not a strategy to endear the unvaccinated: “Whoever suggested that the best way to reach remaining vaccine skeptics was totalk about going door to door should be fired immediately. It is the Beto O’Rourke of vaccine outreach.”Pennsylvanian candidate for Senate and veteran Sean Parnell offered the most succinct rebuke to Biden is plan: “Hell no.”The CDCreportsthat 67.1 percent of American adults have had at least one dose of the COVID-19vaccine.

74,The world is happiest people have a beautifully simple way to tackle loneliness,-1.25,36.25,https://qz.com/1591563/the-danish-have-designed-a-simple-way-to-cope-with-loneliness/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"Toad, a 20-year-old Danish woman living in Copenhagen, has been lonely her whole life. She is autistic, and as a child, did not have any friends. When she moved from the country to the city, not much changed. “They says it is a phase, but a phase becomes a life,” she says, surrounded by six other young adults in a cozy apartment in Copenhagen—all of whom are working on becoming less lonely. Toad is among the attendees ofVentilen, or “friend to one” in Danish, a 20-year-old organization set up to bring 15-to-25-year-olds together twice a week with two or three volunteers. Together, the people in the group play games, make meals, go to the cinema, and build the human connections that many feel they lack.“I try to fight my depression by being less lonely, not with medicine,” Toad says. Christian, who is 23, says he too suffered in high school. Though he had two friends with whom he spoke regularly, he rarely saw them in person. He tried anti-anxiety medicine, but coming off it was hard. Then his aunt found Ventilen on Facebook and recommended he try it. “It is helped me to open up,” he says. “I do not feel lonely the same way.”Ventilen currently offers 21 venues in Denmark where young people looking for companionship can meet one another. There are 15 gathering places for people aged 15-25, and six KOMsammen, or “Fit for Friendship” places, which focus on food and movement for those aged 15-30. The essential services its venues offer are straightforward, and yet can be so elusive: a place to go, things to do, and people to do them with. While Ventilen has been around for decades, its simple yet novel approach is getting more attention as governments everywhere wake up to the prevalence, and cost, of loneliness. A recent Kaiser Family Foundationstudy showed that 22% of Americans, 23% of Brits and 9% of Japanese adults said they felt lonely all the time. When theBBC asked 55,000people about their experiences with loneliness,33% of respondents said they were “often” or “very often” lonely. Among those aged 16-24, the figure was a shocking 40%. Vivek Murthy, the former US surgeon general, has declared loneliness an “epidemic,”noting that it was dangerous both in its own right and because of its links to deep societal problems such as addiction and violence: “It is prevalent, it is common, and the studies Julianne [Holt-Lunstad] and others have done have shown aro bust association with illnesses that we actually care about, including heart disease, dementia, depression and anxiety, and very importantly, longevity.”Indeed, Holt-Lunstad is research shows that being disconnected poses comparable danger to smoking 15 cigarettes a day, and is more predictive of early death than the effects of air pollution or physical inactivity. According to Julie Vorsaa, volunteer coordinator for Ventilen, the idea for the organization can be traced back to 1999, when two volunteers (whose names no one remembers) were working for a help line. They noticed a lot of people were not as much in need of help as they were in need of friends. They were lonely, and the help line could only be a band-aid, not a cure. They formed a support group called Bright Point, aimed at facilitating IRL conversation. But when people came together, no one talked. The idea seemed destined to fail. Then someone had the idea of introducing games. “They had a catalyst, and they started totalk over the game,” she says. Later, the group added the idea of making meals, and the n exercising. “They found out food was a good thing to bring people together,” she says. “You talk when you eat. It is more cozy.”Since 2011, Ventilen, which gets funding from the government and private donors, has been measuring its results. Through 2017, nearly 700 people had participated in Ventilen (55.7% men, 44.3% women), with the average age being 20.9. According to its self-reported survey, 70% of participants said they felt less lonely after coming, while 74% reported higher self-worth after coming. Sixty-four percent said they were better at social situations, and 80% said they were more likely to meet other people. About one in 10 young people in Denmark report that they are lonely. While this may seem surprising in a country that is frequently rate done of the happiest in the world, it mirrors data from around the world showing a spike in loneliness among the young as well as the old. While some argue there is no new crisis of loneliness, Murthy says a few things are contributing to raised awareness of the problem. More people are talking about it, creating a snowball effect, while research is showing its ill effects on health and well-being. “It is not new—people have been lonely for hundreds of years,” he says. “But I think the fact that it is an almost universal experience makes it easier for people to be open to thinking about it, even if they do not want totalk about it.”The program is not without challenges. Many lonely people may be too intimidated to come to a venue; some who come will not return. But designating a space for gathering and having activities to bring people together is an effective way to tackle loneliness, says Claire O’Shea, a campaign manager for the UK is Campaign to end Loneliness. “You ca not just bring a roomful people together, you have to find a common purpose,” she says. “It takes the pressure off finding something to say, and that is talking about the moment, or the activity.” She citesMen is Sheds, an organization that promotes community spaces for men to “connect, converse and create.” They gather in areas—empty offices, portable cabin is, warehouses, garages, and in one case, an out-of-use mortuary—to do things like woodworking, metalworking, and repairing and restoring things. They are also there to be together. Because as anyone knows, you can be in a room filled with people or a city and be plenty lonely. When I first ask to go to a Ventilen in Copenhagen, Vorsaa tells me it will not be possible. Privacy is paramount, and the individuals the mselves do not even register their names. (They give their gender, age, and whether they are employed and/or in school.) “It is a safe space,” she explains. It can be very hard to realize you are lonely, and even harder to admit it because of the social stigma. More people will come if they do not have to give personal information. But when we meet in the Ventilen offices, a volunteer reports that a group is happy to speak with me. We bike over to Nørrebro, one of Copenhagen is most diverse neighborhoods, to a comfortable apartment with a small kitchen and eating area, as well as a sitting room with a coffee table. The group has already shopped for lunch and cooked it together before sitting down for games. Some are clearly shy, but open up gradually to paint painful portraits of what it is like to feel very alone. Tuned in to a hyper connected world via social media and gaming, they report wanting the friends and connections they see but feeling that such relationships are out of reach, for reasons varying from chronic pain to video game addiction, social anxiety, and a pervasive sense that they simply do not have the muscles to form social bonds. Simone, 20, says she has been depressed since she was 10. “I am used to it,” she says. “That is the worst part.” When her two best friends moved away, she explains while crying, she reverted to a life of only working and sleeping. She developed chronic pain because she did not move enough. “I did not want to leave my home because I did not need to, and everyone was very busy.”A nurse at a pain clinic told her about Ventilen and she decided to try it. It is been positive for her, she says, in part because being more active means she is not in as much pain. She still takes anti-depressants, and still has severe social anxiety, she says. “My heart is racing just talking to you.” But she enjoys coming. “It is a reason not to go home and go to bed.”The group is not designed to address addiction or severe mental illness, and screens participants accordingly. “We see a lot of people with mental illness and it is fine,” says Vorsaa. “But if the mental illness overshadows the group, if it is too big, it is not the place.”New participants come half an hour before their first group session to meet with a volunteer who makes sure the person is a good fit for the group. They pay for their own meals, since being part of a group means paying your own way. Kasper, who wears glasses and is slight, has suffered with depression and anxiety. High school was very isolating, he says, and he took a break afterward. But he found he lacked the skills he needed to help himself. “In my life I had chosen to be so isolated so I did not know how to communicate.”He spent a lot of time online, which he says made everything worse. “I think it gets worse with the internet,” he says. “We always look at the perfect picture on the internet.” Being part of a group through Ventilen has helped. “I have made some good friendships,” he says thoughtfully. “It is been good for me.”In addition to the groups, Ventilen is now working in 43 schools to train high-school teachers about how to be more supportive of students. “Young people hate going to school,” says Vorsaa. Many feel constantly left out, particularly since so much high-school work is done in groups. Students voice anxiety about being the last to be picked, or feeling that others are being forced to work with them. They feel “it is a game of musical chairs and they will lose every time,” she explains. Having a place to go and people to see outside of school offers a reminder that they need not always feel that way. “What I find profoundly empowering about addressing loneliness is that the ultimate solution to loneliness lies in each of us,” Murthy says. “We can be the medicine that each other needs.”Giving young people a room of their own, and something to do in it, is a good way to get that started.

Braindead brain surgeon Ben Carson and the clown from the MyPillow commercials were teaming up to hawk a laughably phony coronavirus miracle cure, and they’d gotten Donald Trump on board with it. But sure enough, the whole thing was very much a real story. Ben Carson has a documented history of lending his name to useless supplements disguised as phony miracle cures, including hawking tree bark as a supposed cancer cure, so it was not surprising to see him involved in this latest scheme. But the MyPillow guy was somewhat of a surprise. After all, he is always come off as a mere informer cia l do of us who likes Donald Trump way too much. But when MyPillow guy Mike Lindell appeared on CNN with Anderson Cooper to day, it immediately became clear that Lindell was someone different than the happy and goofy guy he portrays in his TV ads. When Cooper explained that there were no clinical trials for Lindell is supposed coronavirus drug, Lindell turned angry and aggressive, as if the mask had finally been pulled back. By the time Anderson Cooper pointed out that there was no real difference between Mike Lindell and a “snake oil salesmen,” Lindell just about lost it. We should have known that there was something more sinister to the MyPillow guy than just being a goofy pitchman who was naive enough to fall for Donald Trump is lies. Lindell exposed himself today in an ugly way. We will see if he now pulls back on this coronavirus scam, before it snowballs and destroys his pillow business as well.

77,RNC leaders stand by Trump is effort to remake party: 'Nobody is turning on Trump here',9.67,34.67,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jan/6/republican-officials-stand-trump-effort-remake-par/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-06,23,"Republican Party officials from across the country are not blaming President Trump for the party is defeats in Georgia is runoffs but instead are rallying to make election security its top priority in the next cycle. At the Republican National Committee Winter Meeting in Amelia Island, Florida, party officials remained steadfast Wednesday in support of Mr. Trump and his remake of the party, despite the election setbacks that gave Democrats a Senate majority and complete control of the levers of power in Washington.“Nobody is turning on Trump here,” said Peter Feaman, a national committee member from Florida who is attending the meeting. “I am talking to members of the RNC from all over the country — from Hawaii to Vermont to Florida to California, from one corner of the country to the other — and there is no anti-Trump sentiment whatsoever here.”Republican Party officials embraced Mr. Trump is claims that ballot fraud and election irregularities marred the November 3 vote. They are organizing a nationwide effort to prevent a repeat.“Election integrity is going to be the Number 1 priority for the RNC in 2021 and 2022,” Mr. Feaman said. “I hear no recriminations against President Trump concerning Georgia, none whatsoever. It is all about making sure the process is fair and honest.”In Washington, pundits and Mr. Trump is Republican critics were quick to blame the president for the Democrats’ wins in the two runoff races Tuesday in Georgia. Throughout the two-month runoff contests, Mr. Trump aggressively pushed claims that ballot tampering cost him the November 3 presidential election in Georgia. He battled the state is Republican governor and pressured the secretary of state, also a Republican, to help him “find” the votes needed to overturn the win by President-elect Joseph R Biden. Distrust of the election system likely helped suppress Republican voter turnout Tuesday, especially in rural counties that are crucial for Republican wins in the state.“It turns out that telling the voters that the election was rigged is not a great way to turn out your voters,” said Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, one of Mr. Trump is most vocal Republican detractors. In Georgia, Republican Party officials were less prone to condemn Mr. Trump is actions.“We ca not place the blame squarely on him, but I think the president was definitely a factor,” said Jason Shepherd, Republican Party chairman in Cobb County, a suburban county of Atlanta. Mr. Shepherd said he counts himself as a Trump Republican. The president is crusade against what he deemed “stolen elections” in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin also fueled protesters storming the Capitol on Wednesday and delaying Congress from officially accepting election results for Mr. Biden is win. Ford O’Connell, a Republican Party strategist with close ties to the White House, said the mayhem at the Capitol should not take away from legitimate concerns about election integrity.“Those issues are not going to go away,” he said. “The Democrats do not want to have this discussion.”Mr. Trump and his allies failed in scores of lawsuits challenging the election results in battleground states. Still, courts never fully heard many of the claims of wrongdoing or irregularities, including that ballots were filled out or backdated by poll workers, ballots were driven across state lines, voting deadlines were changed without legislative approval, and accusations that noncitizens, minors and dead people voted. Mr. Feaman said the Republican Party would be hammering the voter integrity issue and pushing election overhauls in state capitals across the country.“We are going to go to every state legislature in the country to make sure that every legal vote counts and also make sure that the laws are followed, that people who are not qualified to vote are not allowed to vote. This goes to a lot of what happened in 2020,” he said. “The whole process needs to be reexamined to make sure we have fair elections. And it is not just Georgia. It is everywhere.”The RNC meeting in Amelia Island, about 40 miles northeast of Jacksonville, was convened under strict COVID-19 precautions. The 168 committee members who attended, as well as guests and staff, all were tested for COVID-19. Masks were required to be worn at all indoor events, according to RNC officials.

78,San Francisco Buyback An Absolute Joke,14.67,26.0,https://bearingarms.com/tom-k/2020/12/14/san-francisco-buyback-joke/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bearing-arms-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-14,18,"The City of San Francisco is one of the most notoriously anti-gun communities in one of the most anti-gun states in the nation. It is not a place you are going to be comfortable in if you are a gun person. Nor will you enjoy it if you dislike human fecal matter on the sidewalks, but hey, what can you do?San Francisco, like so many other anti-gun cities, recently had a gun buyback. More than 225 guns were returned Saturday during an annual gun buyback program in San Francisco. The event was organized by the San Francisco Mayor is Office ofViolence Prevention Services, the San Francisco Police Department and the United Playaz, a San Francisco-based violence prevention and youth development organization. United Playaz founder Rudy Corpuz said people turned in 228 guns, including 8 assault rifles during the four-hour event Saturday. Those who brought in handguns got $100 and those who turned in “assault weapons” got $100. I am sure people feel so much safer now. San Francisco has a population of over 883,000 people, and they only got 228 firearms? Seriously? This is supposed to count as some kind of a big win?Well, it is not. See, those guns–including the eight “assault weapons” turned in–came from lawful gun owners who simply did not want their firearms anymore and did not know how to sell them otherwise. That is about it. After all, if people knew they could take them to a gun store and have them sold on consignment and thus make a lot more, I suspect people would be all over it. They did not, though, and thanks to California is laws, they could not sell them directly to individuals who they knew to be responsible gun owners, they may not have known there were any other choices. But the number of guns is pathetically small when you think of the size of the city of San Francisco. How many people will actually delude the mselves to believe that the buyback made their community safer? How many actually think that those guns made any bit of a difference?Far too many. Look, I do not begrudge people getting rid of guns they do not want. What I begrudge are communities doing this kind of thing in order to look like they are making some kind of an effort to combat violent crime without having to actually address violent crime. That is all this is. It is the ater, a dramatic presentation to make people feel better about their city and the elected officials who need them for reelection. At no point will this benefit anyone else, so let is not pretend it is some unmitigated good. They did not take guns off the street, they took them from people who represented absolutely no threat whatsoever. The criminals, however, are not going to give their guns up nearly so easily, especially for such paltry sums. No, they will keep their guns and make as much money from a single holdup as they would turning their guns in. Please, as a society, can we stop kidding ourselves about what we are doing with these buybacks? You know, just to shake things up.",0,0,Bearing Arms

Metro Council is approval Tuesday night means Oracle can now begin its work on a more detailed design of its 65-acre riverbank campus,according to company spokesperson Jim Murphy. Construction could begin as early as June. The development, hailed by some supporters as ""transformational"" and ""once in a lifetime,"" marks the biggest economic development deal ever made in Tennessee. The proposed investment will transform the cityscape along the East Bank of the Cumberland River into the city is largest business hub.""This is the largest private investment and the largest job creation deal in our history – all with no expense in our budget and no new debt,"" Mayor John Cooper said in a statement moments after the council vote. The deal could bring a record number of jobs to Nashville. The company hopes to create 8,500 new jobs in Nashville by the end of 2031, with an average annual wage of $110,000. The project is also expected to bring almost 11,500 ancillary jobs and 10,000 temporary positions during construction. By approving the deal, Metro government also has signaled its intent to use half of the annual property tax revenue generated from the site to pay for affordable housing, in addition to any funding already allocated for that purpose in the budget. The actual dedication of the funds, however, will still be at the council is discretion. Thelanguage, proposed by At-Large Council member Zulfat Suara, was added to the development plan during a Monday budget and finance committee meeting and was approved by the council Tuesday. As part of the deal, Oracle will receive a 25-year, 50% property tax discount in exchange for its up-front $175 million investment in public infrastructure near Germantown. That includes streets, parks, greenways, a pedestrian bridge from the Oracle campus to Germantown and an expanded sewer system. While the deal received an overwhelming support from the council Tuesday night, many council members and local activists have voiced concerns about Oracle is proposed job creation, commitment to diversity, as well as its actions to address affordable housing with a booming workforce. Community advocacy group Stand Up Nashvilleposed 20 questions about the Oracle deal and received responses Monday. The group challenged the way Metro government does business with the tech company and demanded actions from Oracle to address the affordable housing crisis and hire minority workers.""Overwhelmingly, we hear from our communities that housing and economic inequality are the priority,"" Stand Up Nashville co-founder Odessa Kelly said in a Tuesday statement. ""What the answers to our questions tell us is that while it is good that Oracle wants to be in Nashville, and this deal is better than deals of the past, it was not a community driven process and we can still improve the way our city operates.""Both local and state leaders have welcomed the development.""Oracle is $1.2 billion investment will create thousands of quality jobs and help our kids succeed in the digital economy,"" Cooper said Tuesday. ""After a challenging year, this helps kick off Nashville is next decade of prosperity.""Council member Mary Carolyn Roberts said Tuesday the deal could attract other tech giants to land in Nashville as well.""We are in a position to have a deal changer in Nashville,"" she said. Tennessee Economic and Community Development Commissioner Bob Rolfe also urged council members to approve the deal during a Monday committee meeting.""This is transformational, once in a lifetime,"" Rolfe said. Howard Schiller and Don Allen of Monroe Investment Partners applauded the vote in a statement Tuesday night. The company created River North, the 100-plus-acre mixed-use development district where the campus would be located.“My partner has been investing in the east bank of Nashville for 20+ years and I am truly excited to see his vision of River North become a reality,” Schiller said in a text message. Monroe will continue to own a significant amount of property at River North after the transaction with Oracle closes.“This is an exciting day for the State of TN and the City of Nashville,"" Allen said in a text. “We look forward to working cooperatively with Oracle and the City and State as River North continues its transformation into a vibrant mixed use environment.""But at the Monday meeting, many council members feared the historic-scale development may be too large for Nashville to swallow. The development and the workforce it may bring, they said, could drive up the cost of living in Nashville and force out low-income families.""You see a house on the market. Before you click on it, it is gone,"" Suara said Monday. ""You have students that cannot afford to pay for housing in the neighborhood that they grew up in. You have people being gent rifi ed out of their homes.""In response to Stand Up Nashville is questions on affordable housing, the company pointed to Suara is amendment and Cooper is proposed budget, which would allocate $30 million in local and federal funds to affordable housing initiatives. Doug Kehring, executive vice president of corporate operations for Oracle, said Monday the company does not intend to exacerbate Nashville is affordable housing problem.""How we support housing may come through ownership, may come through donations, may come through other support mechanisms, but we are very focused on making sure the re is enough (affordable) housing for employees,"" he said. ""We do not want to come to Nashville to create a bigger problem. We want to come to Nashville to create a great solution.""It is also unclear how many of the proposed 8,500 jobs are high-paying position sand what the lowest hourly wage would be for most employees. Council member Emily Benedict posed the question Monday, but received no direct answer from Oracle representatives.""I have not been able to find out in the past two weeks, the multiple times that I have asked, what is the lowest wage that you pay your full-time and part-time employees?"" she asked. Jennifer Birk of Oracle said Monday the company would like to make local hires ""as much as we can."" But under Tennessee law, Metro government has no power to establish local hire mandates or require the level of workforce diversity, the company said in its Monday response to Stand Up NashvilleMultiple council members also demanded concrete actions from Oracle advocating for the LGBTQ communities. The company is considering moving to Tennessee as the state legislature passes several bills targeting LGBTQ youths. Governor Bill Lee, a conservative Republican,became the third governor this year to sign into l awa measure barring transgender students from playing sports under their gender identity. Oracle last month joined 94 businesses in signing a letter by the Human Rights Campaignopposing anti-LGBTQ legislation across the country. But the company has not threatened to pull out of the state because of the legislation. At-Large Council member Bob Mendes asked Oracle on Monday what concrete actions the company would take apart from signing the letter. He previously defended the letter-signing on social media as an important move""even if a fight ca not be won today.""""We get real criticism from well-meaning people that we are just engaging in nonsense the ater and it does not actually mean anything,"" he told Oracle representatives. ""How do you match (what you said)? Are we just being hypocrites?""Kehring responded by arguing the company has a track record of diverse culture and values.""You have the opportunity to attract companies that can help your effort, or you can push those companies away in your attempt to deal with the concern you just raised,"" he said. ""We are gonna bring our culture and values.""Council member Jonathan Hall urged the council Tuesday to invest in education and workforce training to supply quality candidates to the job market Oracle would create. Council member Colby Sledge cautioned his colleagues Tuesday night to continue to address the community concerns around the Oracle deal.""We will have invited the horse in,"" he said. ""For it to be useful to the people of Nashville, it will take all of us working together to tame that horse. If we do not, it will trample our people.""",2,2,Tennessean

A Louisville Metro Police Department spokesperson confirmed the news, viaNPR According to the outlet, interim Police Chief Yvette Gentry signed the letters of termination. On the same day, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced that Erika Shields will be LMPD is next police chief following her role as Chief of the Atlanta PD Both Jaynes, who reportedly supplied false information in the search warrant, and Cosgrove, who fired dozens of rounds into Taylor is home, have 10 days to appeal their termination.

Previously, a grand jury indicted only officer Brett Hankison, who was charged with three counts of first-degree wanton endangerment and fired in June. On Friday, the Kentucky attorney general is office released recordings of the grand jury proceedings in theBreonna Taylor case. There is roughly 15 hours of audio in the recordings, but asnoted, the statements or recommendations from prosecutors to jurors about what charges the officers should receive were not included in the recordings. Daniel Cameron, the Kentucky attorney general who handled the case said the statements ""were not recorded, as they are not evidence.""

Thereports that the city will pay Taylor is family a $12 million settlement in the lawsuit, said to be the largest in the city is history and one of the top in US history. Crumphad previously called for charges of second-degree manslaughter in Taylor is case and has since said the indictment is ""outrageous and offensive.""Prior to the grand jury is announcement, the Louisville mayor announced a countywide curfew, and the interim chief of police declared a state of emergency for the Louisville Metro Police Department. Across the nation,protestors had prepared for the announcement, setting up events in various cities. Now, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron has said that on Wednesdayhe will be releasing the recording from the grand jury proceedings in Taylor is case. The decision comes after an anonymous grand jury member in the case filed a motion to have the records released; the judge at Hankinson is hearing also ordered that the recording be entered into the court record. Back in May, Crump told “They are killing our sisters just like they are killing our brothers, but for whatever reason, we have not given our sisters the same attention that we have given to Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Stephon Clark, Terence Crutcher, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile, Eric Garner, Laquan McDonald. Breonna is name should be known by everybody in America who said those other names, because she was in her own home, doing absolutely nothing wrong.” He continued, “Ifyou ran for Ahmaud, you need to stand for Bre.”Below, what you need to know about Taylor is case, her family is settlement from the city, and how you can help right now. In the early morning, police officers came to Taylor is apartment where she was asleep with her boyfriend Kenneth Walker. According to the, police had a warrant to search Taylor is apartment as part of a drug investigation, though the family is lawsuit states the suspect in the investigation had already been detained at the time of the search. Police believed one of the suspects was using Taylor is apartment to “receive mail, keep drugs, or stash money earned from the sale of drugs,” per theLouisville Courier-Journal. The suitstatesTaylor and Walker believed the plainclothes police were breaking into the apartment since they entered “without knocking and without announcing the mselves as police officers.” A judge had signed a “no-knock” provision for the police, meaning they were able to go into Taylor is apartment without identifying the mselves, though police claim they did. Walker shot at a police officer in what he says was self-defense. Police the n fired into the apartment, hitting Taylor. The suit says Taylor was unarmed and Walker had a license to carry. The lawsuit filed by Taylor is family also states that neighbors have confirmed the police did not knock or identify the mselves before entering. An FBI ballistics lab later found that Myles Cosgrove was the officer to fire the fatal shot at Taylor, the reports. However, a state ballistics test ""was inconclusive.""One officer was shot in the leg, and Walker was arrested and charged with assault and attempted murder of a police officer. Prosecutors have since dismissed the charges. Thereports that no drugs were found in the apartment, and Taylor and Walker had no prior criminal history or drug convictions. New audio was released in July, revealing interviews with police and Walker,per. In the interview, Walker is heard recounting the night of March 13th and the events that led to his girlfriend is death.""It is a loud boom at the door,"" he said. ""First thing she said was, 'Who is it?' No response. We both get up, start putting on clothes, another knock at the door. She is like, 'Who is it?' Loud, at the top of her lungs. No response. I grab my gun, which is legal, like I am licensed to carry, everything. I have never even fired my gun outside of a range. I am scared to death."" He added that Taylor yelled ""at the top of her lungs"" again to ask who was there. ""No response, no anything."" He said Taylor put on clothes to answer the door, but the n it came ""off the hinges.""He continued: ""I just let off one shot. Like, I still ca not see who it is or anything. So now the door is, like, flying open. I let off one shot, and the n all of a sudden the re is a whole lot of shots and we like we both just dropped to the ground.""In an interview, Sgt. Mattingly, who broke down Taylor is door with officers Cosgrove and Hankison, said: ""The first banging on the door, [we] did not announce."" He said, ""I think after that we did. ... After that, each one of them said, 'Police, come to the door. Search warrant. Police, search warrant.'""In his interview, Walker said he did not hear this: ""All I can hear is a knock at the door."" He said, ""Even if somebody was saying something on the other side, you probably could not hear them. But as loud as we were screaming to say who it is, I know whoever will be on the other side of the door could hear us.""In June, Mayor Greg Fischerconfirmedthat Hankison, one of the three officers, would be fired from the Louisville Metro Police. The other officers involved are on administrative reassignment.""I find your conduct a shock to the conscience,"" the department is interim police chief, Robert Schroeder,wrote in a letter to Hankison. ""I am alarmed and stunned you used deadly force in this fashion. The result of your action seriously impedes the Department is goal of providing the citizens of our city with the most professional law enforcement agency possible. I cannot tolerate this type of conduct by any member of the Louisville Metro Police Department. Your conduct demands your termination."" Schroeder also added in his letter that Hankison had been disciplined for reckless conduct in early 2019. According to the, Hankison appealed his firing but the hearing will be delayed until a criminal investigation is completed. Fischer named new interim police chief Yvette Gentry on September 27th, the first Black woman to serve as Louisville is police chief, perWDRB She will replace former police chief Schroeder, who is retiring. ""This is going to signal some change. A new day is coming,"" Gentry said at a press conference,CNNreports. She will hold the position for no more than six months and has not applied for the job permanently. The mayor also said body cameras will now be required when executing a search warrant, and there will be a new civilian review board for ""police disciplinary matters,"" according to the. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear had said the local prosecutor, state attorney general, and federal prosecutor assigned to the region should review the results of the police investigation.reports: “On June 29, the Louisville Metro Council also announced a resolution to investigate the actions of Mayor Greg Fischer and his administration surrounding Taylor is death.”In regards to the grand jury is decision, on September 28, an anonymous grand jury member filed a motion to have the jury is records and sealed transcripts released, according toNBC News. The anonymous juror also asked for permission to speak publicly about the proceedings. In the motion, the grand juror states that Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron ""attempted to make it very clear that the grand jury alone made the decision on who and what to charge based solely on the evidence presented to the m,"" though the jurors were not offered the option to charge the other two officers. The motion states, ""Using the grand jurors as a shield to deflect accountability and responsibility for these decisions only sows more seeds of doubt in the process while leaving a cold chill own the spine of future grand jurors.""Previously,Cameron had said in a news conference that the grand jury agreed with his team is investigation, saying, ""While there are six possible homicide charges under Kentucky law, these charges are not applicable to the facts before us because our investigation showed, and the grand jury agreed, that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in the return of deadly fire after having been fired upon.""After Hankinson pleaded not guilty this Monday, the judge at his hearing also ordered that the grand jury recording be entered into the court record. (Taylor is family had also previously asked for the grand jury details to be released.) Shortly after the motion was filed, Cameronannouncedhe would release the recordings on Wednesday and that the juror was free to share ""their thoughts on our presentation.""TheNew YorkTimesreportsthat Elizabeth Kuhn, a spokeswoman for the attorney general, said in a statement, ""Our prosecutors presented all of the evidence, even though the evidence supported that Sergeant Mattingly and Detective Cosgrove were justified in their use of force after having been fired upon by Kenneth Walker. For that reason, the only charge recommended was wanton endangerment.""Taylor is family filed a lawsuit accusing the officers of wrongful death, excessive force, and gross negligence, according toWashington Post. It was reported on September 15 byLouisville Courier-Journalreports that the city of Louisville will pay a $12 million settlement to the Taylor family. ""I am deeply, deeply sorry for Breonna is death,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer said in a press conference, surrounded by the Taylor family and their lawyers, per the outlet. The settlement also has multiple police reform mandates, including a demand that all search warrants be approved with a judge prior to their use by officers. Other measures include the establishment of a housing credit program to motivate officers to live in the areas they serve over and the utilization of social workers on specific police runs. ""The city is response in this case has been delayed and it is been frustrating, but the fact that they have been willing to sit down and talk significant reform was a step in the right direction and hopefully a turning point,"" attorney Sam Aguilartold CNN Taylor is mother, Tamika Palmer, said the settlement is only one step in the continued pursuit of justice for Breonna.""Her beautiful spirit and personality is working through all of us on the ground, so please continue to say her name: Breonna Taylor,"" Palmer said of her daughter, viaCNN In early June, the Louisville Metro Council is Public Safety Committeeapproveda new ordinance called ""Breonna is Law"" that would make it so ""no-knock"" warrants could only be sought if the re is ""imminent threat of harm or death"" and would also be limited to ""offenses including murder, hostage-taking, kidnapping, terrorism, human trafficking and sexual trafficking,"" per the. On June 11th, all 26 members of the Louisville Metro Councilvotedto pass the ban, which prohibits any search warrant that does not require police to verbally announce the mselves and their purpose at the property. ""Breonna is Law"" also states that any Louisville Metro Police Department or Metro law enforcement must knock and wait a minimum of 15 seconds for a response, according toNBC News. Louisville Mayor Greg Fischersignedthe ordinance on June 12th. After the ordinance was passed, Taylor is mother, Tamika Palmer said, ""I am just going to say that Breonna, that is all she wanted to do was save lives. So with this law, she will get to continue to do that,"" perNBC News. Nearly three months after Taylor is death, the Louisville Police Department released a four-page incident report from March 13th. You can read the report here, although there is not much to see—and what is there runs contrary to what we know about the night Taylor was killed by police. The report details the location (with partially redacted address), age (with redacted birth date), and full name of the victim. (Thenotes that both Taylor is address and date of birth have been ""widely reported"" already.) Charges are listed as ""death investigation — LMBD involved."" Mattingly, 47; Cosgrove, 42; and Hankison, 44 (ages reported via theCourier-Journal) are listed as the three officers whof atally shot Taylor. Hankison is also undergoing a sexual assault investigation after allegations by at least two women. Beyond that, rows of information are left blank and there are two major inaccuracies regarding the night Taylor was killed. The department is report lists her injuries as ""none,"" even though she was shot at least eight times by the officers. The ""no"" box is checked under ""forced entry,"" even though police are believed to have used a battering ram to break through Taylor is door. According to the, the Louisville police department blamed discrepancies on the reporting program. A statement from the department said, ""Inaccuracies in the report are unacceptable to us, and we are taking immediate steps to correct the report and to ensure the accuracy of incident reports going forward.""After the grand jury decision, Taylor is sister Ju’Niyah Palmerposted an Instagramof her and Breonna with the caption: ""sister i am so sorry 🥺"" She also wrote on her Instagram Story: ""sister, you was failed by a system you worked hard for and i am so sorry""In a May 2020 interview with the, Taylor is mother Tamika Palmer said she first found out something was wrong when she got a call from Walker, who said he thought someone was trying to break into the apartment. He the n said, “I think they shot Breonna.”“I want justice for her,” Tamika said. “I want them to say her name. There is no reason Breonna should be dead at all.”Tamika also told the that Taylor was working on plans for her future: ""She had a whole plan on becoming a nurse and buying a house and the n starting a family. Breonna had her head on straight, and she was a very decent person.""In a separate interview with the, Ju’Niyah said: “She was my person. I was her shadow.” She said, “Mostly at night is when I can really think, and I have moments—like, I will cry, but I have not grieved it, if that makes sense. I still do not want to face it.”Writer Cate Young started the #BirthdayForBreonna campaign,compiling a list of action items people can do to commemorate Taylor is life. Young told Refinery29, ""Very often when we have these moments where these stories [of police violence] bubble up, it is usually because several cases happen in a short proximity of time, and when women are involved their names get erased. . . It was frustrating because her life mattered, too, and I wanted to make sure that we were acknowledging that she deserves justice just as much.""AChange.org petition calling for justice in Taylor is death was signed by 11.4 million people, the second highest number ever for a petition on the site, according toCNN Here, just some of the other ways you can help get justice for Breonna Taylor:According to the, Louisville Metro Council member Bill Hollander said he has received thousands of messages to his email and that his voice mail fills up multiple times a day with people asking to fire and charge the officers involved. Governor Beshear has also reportedly received thousands of emails, voice messages, and cards. Some Louisville activists have also taken more extreme measures in their fight for justice, including going on a hungers triketo demand all three officers are fired and stripped of pension benefits.

84,Jobs report shows fewer hires as recovery loses momentum,0.0,48.33,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/02/jobs-report-september-2020.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&par=sharebar,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnbc/,2020-10-02,25,"Nonfarm payrolls rose by a lower than expected 661,000 in September and the unemployment rate was 7.9%, the Labor Department said Friday in the final jobs report before the November election. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting a payrolls gain of 800,000 and the unemployment rate to fall to 8.2% from 8.4% in August. The payrolls miss was due largely to a drop in government hiring as at-home schooling continued and Census jobs fell.""The issue is momentum, and I think we are losing it,"" said Drew Matus, chief market strategist for MetLife Investment Management. ""When you go through a significant disruption to the labor market, it takes time to fix itself. That is without regard to whether the re is a virus.""The decline in the unemployment rate came along with a 0.3 percentage point drop in the labor force participation rate to 61.4%, representing a decline of nearly 700,000. However, a separate, more encompassing measure that counts discouraged workers and those working part-time for economic reasons also saw a notable decline, falling from 14.2% to 12.8%. The unemployment decline for Blacks was even sharper than the headline rate, falling from 13% to 12.1%. The Asian rate declined from 10.7% to 8.9%. Leisure and hospitality led job gains with 318,000 while retail added 142,000 and health care and social assistance increased by 108,000. As expected, government was the biggest drag on the month, losing 216,000 due to a drop in local and state government education as many schools maintained at-home instruction due to the virus. A reduction in Census workers also pulled 34,000 from the total. In other sectors, health care and social assistance gained 108,000, professional and business services contributed 89,000 and the transportation and warehousing sector was up 74,000. Manufacturing grew by 66,000, financial activities added 37,000 and the other services category rose by 36,000. Markets reacted little to the report, with stocks still heading for a lower open following news that President Donald Trump said he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for Covid-19. Despite the deceleration in job creation, there were some positive signs as the economy continues its pandemic-era recovery. Those reporting being on temporary layoff fell by 1.5 million to 4.6 million. Workers holding part-time jobs for economic reasons fell by 1.3 million to 6.3 million, and the totals for longer-term layoffs also decreased considerably. The temporary layoff total peaked at 18.1 million as payrolls fell by 22 million in March and April. However, permanent job losses increased by 345,000 to 3.8 million, in total a 2.5 million increase since February, the month before the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus pandemic.""Permanent jobs losses rose by more than 300,000. That is not a good thing. The labor force participation rate declined, which pulled the overall unemployment rate down. That is not a good sign, either,"" said Kathy Jones, head of fixed income at Charles Schwab. ""We are looking at state and local government layoffs, we are looking at a higher level of permanent job losses and more people leaving the workforce. None of that is good for the long run.""The report comes amid a raft of mostly positive economic signals, including strong signs from the housing market and retail spending, as well as worries that rising coronavirus cases could threaten the recovery. While millions more remain unemployed, September is activity means that about 12 million jobs have been recovered since the mid-March economic shutdown that saw about 22 million layoffs. Previous months' job totals were revised higher. July moved up 27,000 to 1.76 million while August is already strong total went up by 118,000 to 1.49 million. Average hourly earnings were little changed over the month but still about 4.6% higher than a year ago. However, hourly comparisons are difficult in the current environment considering the virus impact and the continued tendency of higher-wage workers returning to their jobs before those on the lower end.",2,2,CNBC
85,Supply chain issues: What are they and how will shortages impact the holiday shopping season?,-1.33,47.0,https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2021/10/15/supply-chain-shortages-issues-impact-holiday-shopping/8450237002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/usa-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-15,22,"Food prices are going up,gas prices are climbing, and finding that great gift for the holidays might get tougher. The reason? Struggles linked to our global supply chain. Last week, President Joe Biden revealed plans to help tackle bottlenecks within our supply chain, including plans to turn ports into 24/7 operations. Meanwhile, shipping companies FedEx and UPS as well as retailing giant Walmart will expand their efforts to ease the strains on the supply chain.“This is the first key step for moving on entire freight transportation and logistical supply chain nationwide to a 24/7 system,” said Biden. So, what is the supply chain, and why should you care about these issues? Let is explain:The supply chain is how we get nearly all of the stuff in our lives that we want and need. It is a system that helps make and deliver our favorite products. It involves the manufacturers of these products, the companies that supply materials to create the m, the cargo ships, trains and trucks that deliver the m, and the stores selling them.“You can think of this as a pipe that connects supply and demand,"" said Tinglong Dai, a professor of operations management and business analytics at Johns Hopkins University. It is also complicated. Take the iPhone, for example. To build one, Apple has supply chains with companies providing materials for its smart phone such as Corning, which makes precision glass for use on the iPhone. Then you have the supply chains Apple uses to distribute iPhones to you.""It is a complex network of various different entities that are working together in order to enable us as consumers to receive our products in the time that we expect,"" said Marko Bastl, the director of the Center for Supply Chain Management at Marquette University. These products may be hard to find due to supply chain issuesWhy are they higher?3 tips to save on your groceriesThe issues affecting supply chains are linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bastl said the pandemic is unique because it has impacted both supply and demand. Some manufacturers still are not operating at the levels they reached before the pandemic. The pandemic also affected companies focused on logistics, such as warehousing to store items that travel overseas and transportation like trucks and trains to deliver them across the country, said Bastl. At the same time, due to millions of us staying at home to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, we ordered a lot of stuff, from personal computers to sports equipment.""It is almost like a perfect storm of loss of manufacturing capacity as well as loss of logistics capacity, married the n with the increase in demand,"" said Bastl. One of the enduring images of this crisis has been several container ships sitting idle at ports waiting to unload their goods. Biden has struck a deal with the Port of Los Angeles to turn it into a 24/7 operation to move ships through more quickly. Dai said the process of unloading these ships requires a lot of work and people, including warehouse workers and drivers to ultimately deliver these products to retailers.“We have increased the number of goods coming here to the US, but we do not have more truck drivers, we do not have more warehouse space,"" said Dai. ""So the n that is where those cargo ships are stuck.""Bastl said it depends on the industry because of the different supply chains they use, but he notes consumer electronics, such as personal computers and video game consoles, as well as toys, have been affected most by supply chain issues. Dai said ""low-end inexpensive products"" across industries will be impacted as well, forcing us to buy a more expensive item to compensate. All of these issues have a direct impact on what we can buy – on what is available to buy. That is the reason consumers have been advised to start their holiday shopping early. Dai projects we will see higher prices and fewer available products. And we may see more empty shelves at stores due to shortages and delays, Bastl said.""The longer that these delays will last, the more likely it is companies involved in production, distribution and movement of our products will not be able or willing to absorb this cost, and they will start pushing them on to consumers,"" Bastl said.",2,2,USA Today
86,"Americans Are Worried About Crime, But That Does not Mean They are Blaming Democrats",-6.67,41.33,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-worried-about-crime-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-blaming-democrats/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-25,25,"Welcome toPollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup. Rising murder, aggravated assault and auto theft rate shave increased concern about crime among the American public. According to polling fromYouGov/The Economist, the share of Americans who say crime is the most important issue facing America has increased since President Biden took office — to a greater degree than any issue except national security. Relatedly, a May 22-25Fox News poll found that 73 percent of registered voters thought there was more crime nationwide than there was a year earlier. Only 17 percent thought there was less crime, and 7 percent thought the level of crime had stayed about the same. Fewer, but still a majority, believed crime was up in their local area, to o: 54 percent, compared with 28 percent who thought there was less crime in their area and 15 percent who thought it was about the same. (It is worth noting, though, that Americans perpetually believe that crime is on the rise,even when it is not.)AGallup poll earlier this year also found that only 27 percent of Americans were satisfied with the nation is policies to reduce or control crime, and that 65 percent were dissatisfied. That is a big change from 2020, when 47 percent were satisfied and 49 percent were dissatisfied. Altogether, this has sparked a narrative that the rise in violent crime poses a political problem for Democrats, who are the ruling party and also traditionally perceived as softer on crime. But at this point, it is not really clear that the crime issue will hurt Democrats and anti-police progressives politically. For starters, Americans are actually pretty divided on what the best solution to stopping crime is. In aYouGov/Yahoo News poll from May 24-26, 32 percent of adults said that law enforcement is not tough enough on most offenders — but about the same amount, 27 percent, said law enforcement ist ough on most offenders. (Eighteen percent thought law enforcement is level of toughness was about right, while 22 percent were not sure.)The public is also pretty sharply divided on whether Democrats or Republicans are better on the issue of crime. When asked whether Biden or former President Donald Trump has done a better job handling crime, 34 percent of respondents to the YouGov/Yahoo poll said Trump, while 32 percent said Biden. (Fifteen percent thought the two were about equally good on crime.) Of course, this just mirrors people is existing partisan preferences — a majority of Republicans preferred Trump is handling, while a majority of Democrats preferred Biden is — but that just bolsters the theory that crime is not an issue that is changing anybody is mind. Similarly, in elections so far in 2021, it also does not look like crime is driving voters toward more conservative candidates. True, this week is Democratic primary for mayor of New York Cityfocused heavily on crime, and the winner was most likelyBrooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, arguably the race is most pro-police candidate. But there are plenty of counterexamples: In the Democratic primary for Philadelphia district attorney, incumbent Larry Krasner — theGeorge Washington of the progressive criminal-justice movement— handily defeated a moderate who attempted to tie Krasner is policies to Philadelphia is rising crime rate. And in this month is special election forNew Mexico is 1st Congressional District, the Republican candidate ran what was virtually a single-issue campaign on crime and policing issues; Democrat Melanie Stansbury ended up winning by 25 percentage points, exceeding the district is D+18partisan lean.1It is possible crime emerges as a wedge issue in the 2022 midterms. But so far, the re is little evidence that it is helping one party over the other. According to FiveThirtyEight ispresidential approval tracker,252.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 42.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of +10.5 points). At this time last week, 51.9 percent approved and 42.0 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of +9.9 points). One month ago, Biden had an approval rating of 54.3 percent and a disapproval rating of 40.3 percent, for a net approval rating of +14.0 points.",1,1,FiveThirtyEight
87,"Women Were the Primary Targets of Nearly 3,800 Reported Anti-Asian Hate Crimes in the Last Year",-4.67,45.0,https://www.popsugar.com/news/aapi-anti-asian-hate-crime-report-statistics-48222291,https://adfontesmedia.com/popsugar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-17,25,"On Tuesday, March 16 — just hours before the fatalAtlanta spa shootings that killed eight people in Georgia— the Stop AAPI Hate coalition release da report disclosing the statistics behind anti-Asian hate crime sin the USs since March 2020. According to the report, there have been nearly 3,800 documented cases of anti-Asian hate incidents nationwide over the last year, and a majority of the victims were women. This is only a fraction of the number of hate incidents that actually occur annually, with cases of xenophobia and bigotry mounting since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet the numbers remain a formidable reflection of recent hate crimes. All but one of the eight victims of Tuesday is massage-parlor shootings were women, and six were Asian, which is a chilling statistic that has only served to ""exacerbate the fear and pain that the Asian American community continues to endure,"" according toStop AAPI Hate. ""The reported shootings of multiple Asian American women today in Atlanta is an unspeakable tragedy — for the families of the victims first and foremost, but also for the Asian American community, which has been reeling from high levels of racist attacks over the course of the past year,"" the group said in a statement on March 17. ""Not enough has been done to protect Asian Americans from heightened levels of hate, discrimination and violence. Concrete action must be taken now. Anything else is unacceptable.""A closer look at the report reveals that verbal harassment and shunning make up the two largest portions of total incidents reported, collectively totaling at just over 80 percent. Physical assault comprises 11.1 percent of reported incidents, while civil-rights violations — including workplace discrimination, refusal of service, and so on — make up 8.5 percent, and online harassment follows closely behind at 6.8 percent. More than one-third (35.4 percent) of these instances of discrimination and harassment happen while a member of the Asian community is at a business, such as a store, salon, or workplace, while one-quarter of incidents take place in public streets or on the sidewalk. Across all 50 states, women are 2.3 times more likely than men to report these crimes. Chinese individuals are the largest ethnic group affected, constituting more than 42 percent of reported incidents. Together, people of Korean, Vietnamese, and Filipino descent make up an additional 31 percent of reported experiences of hate. Just days before the March 16 attacks, Georgia state SenatorMichelle Au gave a chilling account detailing the reality of hateful encounters APIA individuals have faced on a daily basis during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Georgia should not consider itself immune from this epidemic,"" Dr. Au said. ""And to be clear, the epidemic I am referring to is not COVID-19, but racism towards Asian Americans. . . . The thing is, racism against AAPI Americans is not new. Otherization or exoticization of AAPI Americans is not new. Violence against AAPI Americans is not new.""While speaking with Stop AAPI Hate for the purposes of the statistical report, a student from College Park, MD, said, ""One of my professors was talking about the public health response to COVID-19 and explicitly called it the 'China Virus' and that 'we have gotta be very careful about that country and what they'd do to us.'"" Another added, ""Two white, middle-aged men, who have been my neighbors for over fifteen years, approached me threateningly on the street, pulled down the corners of their eyes and said, 'Go back to Wuhan, b*tch and take the virus with you!' When I called them vile, they the n called me a 'Thai wh*re' and threatened to beat up my husband.""Six days after taking office,President Joe Biden released a memorandum aimed at combatting racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the US The memo reads: ""The Federal Government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobic sentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin. Such statements have stoked unfounded fears and perpetuated stigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons. These actions defied the best practices and guidelines of public health officials and have caused significant harm to AAPI families and communities that must be addressed.""In the wake of such prevalent violence toward the APIA community, mandates can only do so much. It is the responsibility of community members to speak up in the face of blatant hatred and take action by donating, supporting local businesses, and being actively mindful of anti-Asian rhetoric.

I think of myself as someone who is very optimistic, almost to a fault, in that I am not as honest with myself or even with those closest to me when I need a break, or when I need help.”Strength in the face of adversity is admirable, Auli’i notes, but portraying a character that is forced to realize she is not as strong as she could be without letting her friends help her was an important aspect that drew her to the project — and something that she is learned to do over the years as her career has skyrocketed.“We all have our chosen family and what really makes them chosen family is relying on them and being as real as possible with your struggles as well as your success in life,” the 19-year-old says. “We all need someone to reach out and check on us every once in a while. You can be that person and you can also be checked on. Allow yourself to be cared for.”Asking for help can be the scariest step, Auli’i says. She speaks from experience, remembering how nervous she was when she told her mom she wanted to see a mental health professional for the first time. “That was so difficult for me, and as teenagers, we are going through it,” she says. “And Amber especially, someone who is dealing with homelessness as well as wanting to fight for her dreams to go to renowned school like Carnegie Mellon. So it is really important to remember that teenagers and teen stories can have these really deep storylines, and can tackle all of these issues, and can touch upon them because they are real.”And Auli’i is right. Nearly4.2 million youths and young adults deal with homelessness each year. Unlike other teenage films,is not afraid to touch upon heavy topics like homelessness, grief, alcoholism, and mental health. It is a film grounded in realism that helps make the film all the more gut-wrenching to watch. But, among the powerfully real storylines are pockets of purity and positivity that remind viewers of the hopefulness in life. Even the original song “Feels Like Home” by Keegan DeWitt acts as a “beacon of hope,” according to Auli’i. Although she auditioned and did not get a role in, director Brett Haley reached out to her for this project. In addition to getting the lead role, Auli’i was involved in the casting process. As someone with a “mixed plate” background (Auli’i is Puerto Rican, Portuguese, Hawaiian, Chinese, and “a little bit of Irish in like, my big to e”) having a diverse cast was incredibly important to her. All Together Nowproves inclusivity is easy — not only in making sure people from varying ethnic backgrounds were represented but in casting and including ne uro diverse people. Each person in the cast has their own storyline, their own unique moments that bring them to life in a way that subverts the belief that inclusion is merely having someone appear on-screen a singular time.“We have people who are non-neurotypical as well as differently-abled on our cast, and our friendship and our chemistry just worked as friends,” she says of the casting. “In no ways are those disabilities holding them back as actors, at all. And they are certainly not holding them back in the genuine relationships that I know I have with the m, as well.”A part of her inclusion in the casting meant Auli’i was also hunting for her on-screen love interest Ty, who is played by Marvel isstar Rhenzy Feliz. In the film, Amber and Ty have a not-so-typical teenage romance — at least one that is not often represented in Hollywood very frequently. Their romance is subtle, blossoming out of a friendship, and genuine love for each other. “That is the great thing about having good friends, everyone,” Auli’i says jokingly. “Friends can become love interests, but they ca not always go the other way around.”Friendships, of course, is at the heart of the film. Amber is a great friend to everyone in her life but refuses to accept the love and friendship in return. For people in a similar situation to Amber, Auli’i says it is important to be kind and gentle with yourself and not be afraid to reach out and rely on others to help you. “Do not try to build up these really hard walls that you, yourself, will have to break down eventually. Which is easier said than done, for sure. I can attest to that. But the reward of feeling free again, in your own body and in your own mind, it is everything.”Auli’i left high school to go into online schooling during her junior year, but still fondly remembers participating in drama class akin to Amber in the film. Also, like her character, Auli’i grew up in a single-parent household. The actor and her mother are very close (“my mom is still very, very much incorporated into my own team — she is CCd on every email that comes through”) and that dynamic is something she wanted to portray with her on-screen mother played by is Justina Machado.“There is something really, really special about just growing up with a mom. It is just you two against the world, at least that is how it felt like to me,” she says. “When I met Justina, that is exactly what she brought to the character. Of almost overwhelming love and just wanting the best for your child. But also being in the circumstance that you are, of financial difficulty, and not being able to give everything that you would want. It is heartbreaking. And I love Justina for her portrayal of that.”Having these open and honest conversations about her character is authentic actions is perhaps one of the reasons Auli’i character inf eels so earnest and real. It is this connection to her character that allows Auli’i to give such a moving performance — even if it was her first live-action role. It is this genuineness that Auli’i brings to not only her roles but her relationships to her fans, many of whom she is had since voicing Moana four years ago.“I really loved being a voice actor, and giving life to Moana,” Auli’i admits. “I did not have to worry about my face, and I just naturally kind of have a knack for showing emotion in my voice, which I am grateful for. But [live action] acting just throws you to the wolves, man. And you have to portray that emotion and get real with it. When you cry and your nose runs, you just gotta let it run.”Although she has ashamedly not watched Beyoncé is new visual album or heard the magic that is Taylor Swift isat the time of our interview, Auli’i says her time spent in quarantine has not gone to waste. In between binge-watching seasons ofRick & Morty,taking socially distanced walks to the park, and making her mom is beloved spaghetti recipe multiple times a week, Auli’i says she is had time to pick up her guitar and ukulele again. While the re is no word on a debut album release, the actress has not ruled out the transition to a rising musical artist. Until the n, fans can streamAll Together Nowon Netflix.

89,The College Admissions Scandal Is Even Worse Than You Think,-13.25,36.75,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/03/13/the-college-admissions-scandal-is-even-worse-than-you-think/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-13,25,"What kind of a world do we live in where very wealthy people—who will already pass enormous economic and social capital off to their children (and at a very low tax rate!)—are driven to lie and cheat to get their children into elite colleges?Paying half a million dollars–or in one case, $1.2 million—and breaking numerous laws is an act of desperation. But evidently, these were risks worth taking. Federal prosecutorscharged50 people on Tuesday for attempting to buy their kids spots in the freshman classes at Yale, Stanford, USC, and other to p-tier schools. Several of the indicted are Hollywood celebrities, including Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Gianulli. Others are wealthy businesspeople. Their kids have every advantage in the world. Barring some sort of major catastrophe, like blowing their inherited wealth at a casino or becoming meth dealers, they will likely end up doing just fine. Yet their parents apparently thought their children is only path to success and sustainable wealth was through the doors of these particular universities. The main story at the moment is the use of wealth to cheat—and at the direct expense of kids whose parents were either too ethical or not rich enough to afford a scheme like that. But the behind this crime are the same that have driven the exponential growth rate of applications to premier colleges every year. Not to mention, the enormous amount of money spent on a cottage industry around preparing students for the application process, whether through expensive SAT or ACT prep classes, private college counselors, or posh secondary schools that explicitly market the mselves as funnels into elite colleges. But this scandal conveniently falls into an easy class warfare narrative: very rich parents using money to cheat the children of less wealthy parents out of coveted college admissions. It is not exactly clear why these parents did not just bribe schools the legal way: write a big check to the school at the same time their kids were applying. (See, for example,Jared Kushner.) As our Editor in Chief Paul GlastrissaidWednesday morning on Hill TV, “It is not an open quid pro quo, but you have a very good chance at getting your child in the school.”Washington Monthly editor-in-chief@glastrissays college admissions scam is an “illustration” of higher education problems.— HILLTV (@HillTVLive)March 13, 2019While this class warfare narrative is valid, there is another class warfare story that I think has stronger explanatory power: the battle between the 1 percent and the .01 percent. Half a million dollars or $1.2 million is a lot of money, but that is not nearly the kind of money that gets rich schools’ attention. Kushner is father donated $2.5 million to Harvard in 1998, which, adjusted to inflation, is $4 million in to day is money. Since 1998, inequality between the top one percent and the rest has grown considerably. But the gap between the 1 percent and .01 percent has become nearly insurmountable. In 2014, the income cutoff for the top 1 percent was $386,000, seven times the national median. The top .01 percent is was $7 million, eighteen times larger. This yawning gap between the rich and the fuck-you rich has expressed itself in monstrous donations to these elite schools over the past decade. In 2014, Harvardreceivedan individual donation of $350 million, its biggest ever. The next year, it got a$400 million individual donation. It might be safe to say that the cost of gaining a favorable judgment of your child is application from elite admissions committees has gone up. In other words, only the top .01 percent can actually bribe these schools the old-fashioned legal way. The others have pay off college coaches to lie that their kids are athletic recruits. This scandal is indicative of the state of higher education these days—overly obsessed with the most selective schools that do not actually educate the vast majority of the American public. In fact, More than 90 percent of higher-ed studentsdo not goto elite schools. But the way our economic system is set up, the re is good reason for this obsession. The very tangible advantages these schools offer have incentivized upper-class parents to take drastic measures to get their children into the schools that are the tickets to ensuring they can remain in, or climb up, their hyper-stratified class. It is a self-reinforcing cycle that restricts opportunity to the already privileged, and, apparently, drives wealthy parents to amazing extremes.",1,1,Washington Monthly

92,The COVID Tracking Project is (nearly) gone. Can we see clearly now?,-4.0,45.0,https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/the-covid-tracking-project-is-nearly-gone-can-we-see-clearly-now.php,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-17,18,"Alexis C Madrigal and Robinson Meyer, colleagues at, set out to answer a simple question: how many people had been tested for the coronavirus in the US so far? The answer, it turned out, was actually quite complicated: in the absence of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it was hard to tell whether low reported case rates to that point reflected low incidence or lowtesting. Madrigal and Meyer sent a form email to health officials in every state; they soon found out that the answer was the latter, and that the federal government did not have a handle on the numbers. As Emily Sohn reported for CJR, Jeff Hammerbacher—a data scientist who had been working to track the same information, and who knew Madrigal from college—saw their work and reached out. They teamed up, and soon, the COVID Tracking Project was born. It was meant, initially, as a short-term gap-filler. “Every day,” Erin Kissane, its managing editor, told Sohn in late March, “we hope the CDC will put us out of business.”But the days went by, and the CDC did not, leaving the Tracking Project is collective of journalists and tech folk to serve,in their own words, as “a de facto source of pandemic data for the USs.”agreed to host the project; its team grew to include hundreds of volunteers, and the project is founders solicited philanthropic donations to pay some of them. “It just got really complex,”Madrigal told CNN is Brian Stelter recently. “At first, we just thought you could pull numbers off dashboards and that was gonna be the main process. As it turned out, we actually needed to do deep research. We made hundreds and hundreds of contacts with state officials… We added race and ethnicity data, we added outcomes like hospitalizations and deaths, we added tracking of long-term care facilities. So all of those things came together to just require to ns of labor; I mean, tens of thousands of hours of people is time.” State and federal officials cribbed the project is data. Other journalists became reliant on it. Now, finally, the project is winding down. It stopped collecting data ten days ago; it plans to spend the next couple of months on analysis work and archiving before shuttering completely. The analysis will mainly focus on data streams—around race and ethnicity, for instance—that are still insufficient, but the project is founders are confident that federal officials are finally adequately replicating much of its core data, and, crucially, that the new Biden administration can be trusted not to turn off the lights at a moment is notice. Writing last week, however, Madrigal and Kissane warned that the landscape of coronavirus data is “persistently messy.” The pandemic response “has been nominally or actually based on the idea that we know what is happening across the country to a precise degree,” they wrote. “And although this idea—that we have solid data about the movements of the pandemic and the effects of the response—is much closer to truth now than it was a year ago, it is very far from universally accurate.”This week, Madrigal and Meyer expanded on that the mein an essay for, pinpointing key truths about pandemic data and officials’ handling of it. The initial pandemic response plan assumed the presence of good data, and failed to account for kinks at every part of the data-production pipeline, from the local, to the state, to the federal. We now have much better national-level data on cases, tests, hospitalizations, and deaths—but this still offers a rather messy compilation of snapshots and time lags, not a real-time “window” into the current state of the pandemic, as officials sometimes imply. (Deaths often substantially lag cases, and commonly go unreported for weeks.) At least five states still “have disturbingly incomplete testing data”; nationally, tens of millions of rapid antigen tests appear to be unaccounted for. “Datamight seem like an overly technical obsession,” Madrigal and Meyer write. “But data are how our leaders apprehend reality.”The press, too. Over the course of the pandemic, responsible news organizations have pledged to “follow the science” and extolled the virtues of data-driven analysis, but as Madrigal and Meyer note, looking at data is less like “peering into a crystal ball” than “watching city sewers empty into a wastewater-treatment plant”—it is more useful than not looking, “but you should not delude yourself about what is in the water.” And yet,as I wrote in the early days of the pandemic, reporters moved quickly to paint unduly certain pictures with extremely incomplete information; reported cases and deaths, for example, were routinely relayed as “totals,” not as clear undercounts, which, of course, they were. Over time, data flows improved; testing, in particular, expanded, even prior to the election of a president who does not view it asa conspiracy to make him look bad. But testing remains highly imperfect. Per the Tracking Project, reported daily tests hit a high-water mark close to 2.3 million in December—a figure,some experts the n calculated, that was adequate to most symptomatic COVID cases and close contacts, but still fell well short of the daily rate that would be needed to properly control viral spread by identifying asymptomatic people. From a public-health standpoint,these metrics are subject to healthy scientific debate; from a journalistic standpoint, every additional test is an extra confirmed truth about the world, and yet media-industry leaders have never pushed with any real consistency or urgency to frame expanded testing,as I suggested last year, as a freedom of information issue. (We are better at demanding to see information the government is hiding than information the government is failing to collect.) In the absence of a further massive ramp-up, the percentage of tests coming back positive often offers more useful insights than flat numbers, yet many outlets have not pivoted to this metric with any consistency either. And in recent weeks, testing rates have generally declined. This could be a function of fewer people needing one (though, again, it depends how you define “need”), but it could also reflect public exhaustion with mitigation measures, bad weather, states’ shift to vaccine infrastructure, and other contingencies. As I wrote recently, journalists covering the pandemic still have to grapple, over a year in, with massive uncertainty. We still have not figured out how best to communicate this—not only around new challenges like vaccines and variants, that currently attract the bulk of our attention, but around the very basic building blocks that we use to define and measure surges and lulls, sickness and death. The visibility of these underpinning realities is still murky. Some outstanding journalists—not least at the Tracking Project—have focused on finding outlines of clarity, and for that we owe an enormous debt of gratitude. Many of us have instead acclimated to the murk, preferring to see what is in front of us, even though it is not the full picture. Below, more on the pandemic:",2,1,Columbia Journalism Review
93,Nebraskans talk extreme weather. Just do not call it climate change.,1.33,47.67,https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2019/0416/Nebraskans-talk-extreme-weather.-Just-don-t-call-it-climate-change,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"The flood carried away edges of his fields, dumped up to 6 inches of useless sand on his fertile loam, and deposited, incongruously, the elastic band of a pair of Hanes underwear on a bush. But everywhere Chad Christianson looks, all he sees is green. The green rye he planted last fall stands in sharp contrast to the brown soil and cornstalks. More importantly, it held the soil in place in all but the most flooded areas of his fields, lessening the waters’ impact. It is a first step in Mr. Christianson is push to become more weather-resilient.“I do not know about climate change,” Mr. Christianson says. “But I think the weather is going to be more extreme going forward.”The severe flooding that inundated Nebraska last month washed away fields, bridges, and roads. But the extreme weather is also starting to sway residents’ thinking about climate. It is a sentiment that is percolating here in rural Nebraska. With the state still in recovery mode, many Nebraskans say it is early for them to start contemplating the long-term implications of last month is epic flood, the most widespread in memory. But as such extreme weather events pile up, some say they are beginning to change hearts and minds here – not politically but practically.“This [flood] did not come out of nowhere but it went beyond almost anyone is expectations,” says Tyler Williams, an educator with the extension service at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which works with farmers. “So I definitely think people in the agricultural world are thinking: ‘All right. I have got to fix something, do something different.’”Part of the change in thought is coming from farmers the mselves, especially those involved with the small but growing regenerative farming movement.“Conversations were already happening before the flood,” says Graham Christensen, a fifth-generation farmer and president of GC Resolve, a grassroots community-development business. “But after the flood a lot more folks are like, ‘Yeah, I have never seen that; my dad has never seen that; my grandpa has never seen that. This is a pattern that is emerging.’”The movement, which focuses on the health of soil, emphasizes techniques like planting cover crops as a way to keep more roots in the soil, beyond the corn and soybean plants that many farmers raise in rotation. These roots keep more nutrients in the soil, make it easier for water to drain (which improves flood resilience), and keep more water stored in the soil (which improves drought-resistance). That is key for farmers like Mr. Christianson here in Fremont. Just do not call it climate change.“We are not necessarily going around and saying, ‘Hey, climate change, climate change, climate change!” says Mr. Christensen of GC Resolve, who travels the state preaching regenerative agriculture. “We are more focused on rallying around the solution, which is better soil-health principles.”The term climate change has become so politicized that it is not readily accepted in rural America, even with the extreme weather. Most pastors in the state are afraid of addressing the issue for fear of splitting their congregations, according to a 2015 University of Nebraska-Lincoln report. A couple comes out of a Lynch, Nebraska, donation center with six gallon jugs of emergency water because the floods have intermittently made their water unsafe. Does the extreme weather imply climate change? “No,” she answers. “No,” he answers, the n gives a short lecture on avoiding preconceived ideas. Skeptics have a point. Last month is flooding was the result of such a fluky combination of snow, rain, frozen ground, and rapid melt that even warming advocates admit that it alone may not be a harbinger of change to come. But previous events – flooding of the Missouri River in 2011, an increasing number of intense rain events, and one of the 10 coldest Februaries on record – have residents reassessing the future.“It is getting to the point where it is hard to ignore,” says Kim Morrow, a behavior change expert at Verdis Group, a sustain ability and climate resiliency advisory group based in Omaha. When Yale University social scientists assessed public opinion about climate change last year, they found that 64% of Nebraskans believed climate change was happening. That was up 6 points from their 2014 survey– a rise consistent with the slow change in a swath of red states from Idaho to Kentucky – but still 6 points behind the national average. The Yale research also reveals an urban-rural split. In Lancaster County, home of Lincoln and the university, 72% of people said change was happening. In rural counties farther west, barely half do.“Yes, I think it is still political and divided, but people are beginning to change,” says the Rev. Richard Randolph, senior pastor at Christ United Methodist Church in Lincoln. He has submitted to this year is Nebraska-Kansas annual conference of the United Methodist Church a petition calling on churches to become better informed about global warming and to set goals for reducing their carbon footprints. “For the most part, I pastor a church that is moderate to progressive theologically. Andy Alexander, director of the Collaborative Ministry Office at Creighton, a Catholic university in Omaha, is not seeing much of a shift at all. “People are skeptical about that kind of thinking, which they call projection,” he says. Even if they acknowledge they need to be more prepared for chancier weather in the future, they are not making a link between their present practices and warming.“I do not hear people saying our use of fossil fuels is leading to this problem,” he says. And they are not making the broader connections Pope Francis has made between warming is impact on the poor and the selfishness and greed that keeps nations from reducing that impact by changing their ways, he adds. “I do not hear anybody saying that.”",2,2,Christian Science Monitor

Marten called for increased federal funding for schools and for a national teacher corps program to train more teachers to work in low-income schools. Shesuggested the incoming Biden Administration provide $350 billion in COVID-19 aid to schools, fully fund special education— something the federal government has never done — triple Title I funding for schools that serve low-income students, and provide more funding for military students. The new administration also should ensure that all 3- and 4-year-olds have access to quality preschool, Marten said. She also called for reinstating the National Teacher Corps, a 1965 program that trained teachers to work in disadvantaged schools.“Now before anyone discards these ideas as unrealistic given the current economic climate, let me remind you that every one of the San Diego strategies for school reform came out of the 2008 financial crisis,” Marten said during a pre-recorded speech, which was delivered online and received about 2,200 views.“Hard times breed clarity of purpose. We can create an educational recovery plan that meets the needs of all of our students by focusing on equity.”Marten warned that the pandemic is causing severe learning losses because of school shutdowns. A national recovery plan with funding for schools is needed to reverse those losses, she said. California public schools were spared from state budget cuts this school year, but there is no such guarantee for next year.“We now risk losing the progress we have made if we must contend with State budget cuts in January,” Marten said. Marten also described what the district has done so far during the eight-month long pandemic. Officials said the district has distributed more than 80,000 Chromebooks and 8 million free meals to children. Marten said San Diego is providing more daily, “live” instruction time than other California districts. San Diego Unified schools are providing three hours of live instruction each day during distance learning. Marten and School Board President John Lee Evans said students are suffering losses due to school closures, but they did not say how much learning loss is happening among San Diego students. The district has not yet released data about students’ academic progress during this school year. Evans said the plan is still for San Diego Unified to reopen on January 4 for elementary students and on January 25 for middle and high school students. But the reopening could be postponed if San Diego County does not improve its COVID-19 rates quickly enough to get out and stay out of the purple tier.“We all know that our students are suffering. We know that damage is being done by this pandemic,” Evans said. “Every person — the superintendent, the board, and all our staff — are working diligently to make sure our schools can open as soon as possible in the safest possible manner.”",2,2,San Diego Union-Tribune
96,Conservatives Keep Missing Opportunities to Really Engage With Blacks,7.67,42.0,https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/01/15/conservatives-keep-missing-opportunities-for-real-engagement-with-blacks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-15,25,"Since the November 3 election, I have received many calls and em ails from influential Republicans and prominent conservatives. Despite losing the White House, they were high-fiving about President Donald Trump is going from 8% of the black vote in 2016 to 12% in 2020. What a sad state of affairs when a 12% market share is reason to celebrate. In most industries, this would be viewed as unacceptable and embarrassing. Herein lies the problem with the conservative movement: Our expectations are so low when it comes to the black community that even miniscule progress is celebrated jubilantly. The reason expectations are so low is because deep down inside, conservatives–for purposes of this column, I am using the words Republicans and conservatives interchangeably–know that they have not really made a serious effort to cultivate relations with the black community. They do, in their minds, just enough not to be called racist. According to this perverse logic, if they have one black on staff, they ca not be racist; or if they grew up with a black nanny, they ca not be racist. I am not kidding; I have had many conservations with conservatives along this line. Those who have followed my writing over the years know that I have been critical of the lack of “substantive” engagement with the black community from conservatives. Most of the blacks invited by conservatives to speak at their events have little to no connection to the black community and, quite often, their speeches are off-putting to the black community. If your goal is to be entertained or to throw red meat to the white base of the party, the n they may be appropriate speakers. But if your goal is to build relations with the black community, they are counterproductive. I challenge conservatives to specify the number of blacks they have in decision-making positions within their organizations. How many blacks do they have around them that tell them what they need to hear and not what they want to hear?How many five- and six-figure black consultants do they have on retainer? How many black vendors do they contract with during the course of a year?When I say decision-making positions, I mean someone who can hire or fire; has budgetary authority to spend money; or can get meetings set up with key executives. This is the 21st century, and many conservative organizations have little to no reflection of the diversity that our country presents. How is this possible?These organizations hire their friends, they give consultant contracts to their friends, they contribute to their friends’ campaigns. They do the same things they accuse radical liberals of doing. They are in a bubble, an echo chamber filled with people who only think and look like them. Are they racist? Absolutely not. People tend to gravitate toward the things they are familiar with; it is a logical and natural thing to do. No, I am not talking about imitating the Democrats. No bean counting. They, as usual, go overboard with their push for diversity, to the point that it is discriminatory. But, if you are a conservative and do not notice that every time you are in a meeting or conference that not one black person can be found the re, that is a problem. Democrats are obsessed with diversity and Republicans are oblivious to diversity. Both are equally wrong and detrimental to our American values. But true leaders understand this dilemma and make a conscious decision to inject diversity into their organizations so they can remain relevant. There is no evidence that conservatives have learned this lesson. I have done PR and crises communications for some of the biggest names in politics, business, sports, and entertainment from all over the world. I refer to myself as a “straticist,” not a strategist. Most people in my profession understand PR or strategic communications, but few understand the merging of both when confronting an issue; thus, the word “straticist.”The Republican Party and the conservative movement have a brand problem. We have allowed radical liberals to brand us as racist. A lie that is repeated enough becomes the truth. Conservatives are under the misguided notion that blacks need to be sold or persuaded on conservatism. Blacks are more conservative than most whites; survey after survey has shown that blacks are the most churchgoing people in the country. Blacks do not need to be lectured about family values and entrepreneurship. We had the most intact, stable families from the 1900s to the 1950s, and the highest marriage rates. Then Democrats in the 1960s injected our community with welfare and all these radical liberal “social” programs. We always have been business-minded, even before slavery; until, that is, Democrats cut off our access to opportunities and capital. Conservatism is in our DNA The sooner conservatives grasp this, the sooner we can begin to make significant progress with the black community. The sooner conservatives stop promoting black minstrel shows dressed up like outreach, the sooner more blacks will publicly join our cause. To cite two examples: The “commentary” of a certain upwardly mobile young lady and a certain comedic duo, each with their own podcasts, play into the worst stereotypes of blacks ever perpetrated. We, as black conservatives, are not here to be used to throw out inflammatory rhetoric against the black community or to entertain a room full of white conservatives with feeble attempts at humor. We want to be a full partner in spreading a positive, conservative message throughout the black community. In the immortal words of my grandmother: “Boy, your actions speak so loud, I ca not hear a damn thing you are saying!”How appropriate for conservatives. Conservatives must first and foremost engage with black entrepreneurs. They are the leaders of the black community, not the preacher-politicians. When all is said and done, so far there has been more said than done.",1,0,Daily Signal
97,House Democrats make their case to Senate Republicans: Trump duped his rioters — and he will dump you,-20.0,35.33,https://www.salon.com/2021/02/11/house-democrats-make-their-case-to-senate-republicans-trump-duped-his-rioters--and-hell-dump-you/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-11,25,"""His directive is Trump first,"" House impeachment manager and Democratic Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island reminded the Senate during the second day of arguments in support of the singular article of impeachment filed against the former president. It is a crucial takeaway that should be heeded by the Senate Republicans who plan to acquit Trump, caring not one bit about the overwhelming evidence of his guilt in inciting an insurrection on January 6. Senate Republicans are putting their loyalty to and fear of the sociopathic man-child from Mar-A-Lago over their patriotism and basic sense of decency. But as Cicilline pointed out, no matter what you do for Trump, no matter how much you debase yourself for Trump, no matter what risks you take for Trump, he will not hesitate to throw you under the bus. The impeachment trial of Donald Trump has been overshadowed by the fact that the majority of Senate Republicans plan to acquit Trump. So the only real question is whether or not the House Democrats who are arguing the case against Trump can maximally expose the cowardice and complicity of the Republicans. House Democrats kicked off arguments on Thursday with a compelling presentation by Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado, focused on how the insurrectionists believed they were there on Trump is orders. ""They actually believed they would face no punishment,"" DeGette explained, noting that the ""mob screamed at officers that they were listening to President Trump"" and ""believed the commander-in-chief ordered this.""The rioters were so dead certain that they were safe from consequences, DeGette pointed out, that they did not bother to hide their identities. On the contrary, as most commentators remarked on in the days after the attack, they were so unafraid that huge numbers of them livestreamed, photographed, or otherwise advertised their participation in the insurrection. The reason these insurrectionists were sure that they'd be free of consequences is not mysterious. It is because Trump promised them that they'd be safe. In the speech he gave sending the mob to storm the Capitol, Trump literally said, ""When you catch somebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules.""Even as the House managers argued their case, more evidence emerged proving it. New court documents from the Department of Justice revealed, CNN reported, that the leader of the Ohio Oath Keepers, Jessica Watkins, ""believed she was responding to the call from the n-President Donald Trump himself."" The documents show that Watkins was deeply concerned ""about taking action without his backing."" As federal prosecutors argued, this was ""evident in a November 9, 2020, text in which she stated, 'I am concerned this is an elaborate trap. Unless the POTUS himself activates us, it is not legit.'""Trump gave the order to ""march"" on the Capitol and instructed that there is ""not going to be cheering so much for some of them."" The insurrectionists felt like they were shielded from consequences and free to ransack the building. After all, Trump promised the rules were now ""very different.""But they were not safe, as DeGette laid out. Over 200 people have been arrested and charged so far, some on very serious charges. Some of the rioters, DeGette noted, have since said they were ""duped"" by Trump,including Jacob Chansley, the ""QAnon shaman"" who became the face of the riot with his weird buffalo headdress. On Wednesday,a lawyer for another one of the rioters released a statement complaining that his client, like many who heeded Trump is call, ""will be spending substantial portions if not the remainder of their lives in prison as a consequence. Meanwhile Donald Trump resumes his life of luxury and privilege.""The evidence does point to the long-standing truth grifters like Trump understand: The best marks are people who think they are part of the conspiracy. That is how Trump gets people. He lures them in by appealing to their ugliest impulses — like the growing Republican desire to unfairly seize power by undermining democracy — and the n leaves his co-conspirators, who clearly followed Trump because they liked the idea of a fascist insurrection, holding the bag.""He lied to his base, saying this was all okay,"" Rep Ted Lieu of California said during his argument on Thursday. Democrats finished their case against Trump in a way that was just as impressive as they began it, meticulously laying out the facts while not shying away from the emotions brought on by these terrible events. Lieu was particularly hard-hitting, pointing out that, ""When you or I make a mistake and something very bad happens, we would show remorse,"" but Trump is reaction to January 6 was to brag about how perfect his behavior was, showing how intentional this was from the beginning. The Senate Republicans who are lining up to shield Trump should really think long and hard about why on Earth they want to protect a man who would not piss on them if they were on fire. A man who always repays loyalty with spit in the face. A man who thanked his vice president, Mike Pence, for years of loyal service by sending a mob to kill him. A man who, as the House managers amply demonstrated with court documents, did not care who he killed by inciting an insurrection, even if the victims were his most sycophantic supporters in Congress. But ultimately, the real question is not whether Trump is guilty. Everyone knows he is. The only question is whether Senate Republicans want to be comp licit with an insurrection that directly threatened their own lives. Presumably, they think they are playing 11th-level chess and will get some political advantage out of it. But in the end, they are no better than the morons who stormed the Capitol because Trump told them it was ""allowed."" And if they believe otherwise, it is because Trump has successfully exploited their own overblown egos against them — as he does to all of his marks.",1,1,Salon

The legal standard established underRoesays states must allow access for abortions performed up until fetal viability around 24 weeks. Mississippi passed the restrictive abortion l awin 2018, along with a slew of anti-abortion provisions that have been blocked by the courts, including a law restricting abortions after six weeks. The Supreme Court announced in May that it would hear the case, setting off alarm among abortion rights activists. The suit filed by the Jackson, Mississippi organization, the only abortion services provider in the state, contesting the 15-week law was successful in the lower courts, which cited precedent preventing states from restricting abortion access during the pre-viability stage. The Supreme Court, however, after months of hemming and hawing, announced that it would hear the state is appeal of the case, raising the possibility it could choose to upend abortion pre-viability abortion restrictions that have been ruled unconstitutional as placing an undue burden on women seeking an abortion. In announcing its decision, the court stated explicitly it was out to reassess “whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.”The announcement signaled a tectonic shift in US abortion law could be coming now that the court is lopsided with conservative justices. The Mississippi brief attempts to chip away at the viability standard, claiming advances in science and technology justify the state intervening earlier and earlier in a pregnancy. Even if the Supreme Court does not explicitly reverse, there are other ways it could defang the law. “As an alternative, Mississippi said the court could reduce the heightened scrutiny that abortion laws must meet and find that Mississippi is law meets legitimate objectives such as protecting the unborn, women is health or the medical profession,” the Washington Postnotes. “It could find that not all pre-viability abortions are unconstitutional, the state said, or that the 15-week restriction does not place an undue burden on a substantial number of women.”What is clear is that the stakes are high and, as the Post notes, Thursday is “brief emphasizes the potential presented in the case,, the most direct challenge to abortion rights at the Supreme Court in decades.” The Supreme Court is likely to hear the case later this year, in November or December, and a decision would be handed down by June of nextyear.",2,1,Slate

For example, Facebook said that searches related to white supremacy in the USs get directed to a Life After Hate group that provides crisis intervention. Images of the alerts shared on Twitter showed messages asking whether users were worried someone they knew was becoming an extremist or if they had been exposed to extremist content. People could opt to click on a link to ""get support"" or simply close the pop-up box. Virginia state politician Nicholas Freitas, a Republican, was among those who shared an image of the Facebook alert on Twitter.""I have a real concern that some leftist technocrats are creating an Orwellian environment where people are being arbitrarily silenced or banned for saying something the 'thought police' does not like,"" Freitas said in the post.

102,"House Appropriations ‘Minibus’ Stuffed With Bad Policies, Overspending",16.67,29.67,https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/07/21/house-appropriations-minibus-bill-stuffed-with-problematic-policies-overspending/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-21,25,"The House is expected to vote later this week on HR 7608, a “minibus” bill that covers fiscal year 2021 spending for the departments of Agriculture, Interior, State, Veterans Affairs, and more. That covers four of the 12 spending bills that fund the federal government. Thebill is text—produced on July 16—is a staggering 689 pages long, meaning that no representative is office has had the time to properly vet it before the vote. The practice of voting on huge spending packages, common in both chambers for years, sacrifices transparency and accountability for the sake of political convenience. While any such legislative package is bound to contain flaws, this one is brimming with mistakes and ideological overreach on issues such as abortion, foreign policy, and welfare, and adds to our already skyrocketing national debt. Experts from The Heritage Foundation have highlighted a number of policy concerns that the House should address. The “minibus” package contains more than $37.5 billion in “emergency”-designated spending. Much of this spending is unjustified. Rather, it continues the use of the emergency spending designation to avertBudget Control Act spending caps for fiscal 2021. The Department of State/foreign operations bill provides $10 billion in emergency funds which,according to the House Appropriations Committee, would be used for global coronavirus preparedness, response, and relief. However, the bill designates only $2.5 billion of the funds directly to health programs. The bulk of the spending would go toward diplomatic programs, operating expenses, development programs, international disaster assistance, economic support, migration and refugee assistance, and the UN. The State Department should be working toward ensuring the health and safety of Americans abroad as the world continues to seek treatments and a vaccine for the coronavirus. However, even of the $2.5 billion designated for global health programs, $800 million is being diverted to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, not the coronavirus. Much of the other funding is simply being used to expand the base operations budgets of various State Department programs. The Interior and Environment bill adds$15 billion in emergency funding for infrastructure projects for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Indian Health Service. Of that, $13 billion would go directly to the EPA for infrastructure grants. As with the State Department emergency funding, this money is not intended to fight the coronavirus or any other true emergency. It would be used to expand functions of the EPA that should be done within the existing agency budget, if at all. Much of the money would be spent in the form of grants to states for drinking water infrastructure, which should be addressed at the local, rather than federal, level. Finally, the bill provides $12.5 billion in emergency appropriations to the Department of Veterans Affairs to cover rising health care costs. Providing quality health care (whether public or private) to our nation is veterans is of the utmost importance. However, doing so by ignoring budget caps and fiscal responsibility sets a dangerous precedent. Congress must prioritize spending on a case-by-case basis to keep programs under control. Offsets, whether they come from within VA programs or other federal programs, should be the bare minimum requirement for new spending initiatives. In2019, a total of $25.4 billion in emergency appropriations were enacted. This “minibus” alone would represent a 48% increase above that number. If all of the money was for fighting the coronavirus pandemic, perhaps it would be justified, but that is not the case. Most of it is simply being used to expand existing government programs without retaining any sense of fiscal responsibility. The House is headed down a dangerous path and should reexamine the emergency provisions of this bill. The House Appropriations agriculture subcommittee has jurisdiction over funding one of the largest safety netprograms; namely, food stamps. The goal of this program is to help millions of low-income Americans buy food. The committee used the appropriations bill to undermine commonsense reforms advanced by the Trump administration to safeguard the program. Section 733 of the appropriations bill seeks to permanently prohibit implementation of the administration isAble-Bodied Adults Without Dependentsrule. This rule strengthened food stamp work requirements that only apply to work-capable individuals ages 18 to 49 who do not have children or other dependents in the home. During a recession, this work requirement rule will understandably not be implemented for this work-capable population. It is only applicable when the state unemployment rate is below a 6% average for the most recent 24-month period. Inasmuch as the June unemployment rate was11.1%,no state will meet the unemployment threshold soon. Moreover, even if there had not been a COVID-19 economic downturn, the number of work-capable individuals without dependents is a small fraction of the overall food stamp pool—about688,000among nearly 40 million food stamp beneficiaries. The bill would also permanently ban the Department of Agriculture isStandard Utility Allowancerule in Section 734. That rule eliminates a loophole known as “Heat and Eat.”The way the loophole works is a bit convoluted. The amount of food stamps a household receives is based on its “countable” income (income minus certain deductions). State governments can game the system by sending households a tiny amount of money through a low-income energy assistance program, which makes the household eligible for more food stamps. The administration is reform to stop this abuse was commonsense, and should remain in place. Finally, the House committee is report language makes a “strong” recommendation against the administration is proposed rule calledBroad-Based Categorical Eligibility. The rule would close a loophole that allows individuals to bypass food stamp eligibility rules. Current rules still allow millionaires to get food stamps. When Congress does pass a bicameral appropriations package, it should ensure that these provisions are not included. Instead, Congress should codify the president is reforms and go beyond them to pursue statutorily fixing these serious issues that threaten the long-term integrity of the food stamp program. The House spending bill would exempt wine grapes, hops, pulse crops, and almonds from the Obama administration is Food and Drug Administrationproduce safety rule. The rule was deeply flawed and ignored the plain language of the Food Safety Modernization Act that it was implementing. The law directs the FDA to regulate fruits and vegetables based on risk, but the FDA instead developed a rule that ignored the risk-based requirements of the law. Rather than directing the FDA to fix this flawed rule,Section 746of the House spending bill would create special carve-outs for certain commodities. That ignores the problems with the rule as it affects other commodities, and it creates a situation where organizations representing specific commodities have to lobby Congress for exemptions from coverage under a rule that they should not be subject to in the first place. Federal bloat: The House bill in general rejects measures to reduce the size and scope of government. For example, the House proposal consistently maintains or increases spending on EPA programs where the president is budget largely reflected measures proposed to reduce or eliminate programs in the EPA that are better left to states, communities, and private individuals. The bill would also block healthy government reform by prohibiting any funds from being used to relocate, close, or consolidate any EPA office, laboratory, or facility. It also includes measures that would increase costs for American taxpayers on infrastructure projects, such as the requirement in Section 421 that all of the iron and steel work in projects using Safe Water Drinking Act grants be produced in the US Cognitive dissonance on federal lands: The bill makes refreshing efforts to fund maintenance on federal lands and national parks. The National Park Service alone holds a backlog of $11.9 billion indef erred maintenance, and Congress historically has neglected prio rit izing those projects. However, the bill neglects to address one of the troublesome roots feeding the systemic maintenance issue; namely, the federal government is preference for buying new acreage, rather than stewarding what it already has. The primary tool for federal land purchases is the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The bill presumes Congress will pass the Great American Outdoors Act, which, among other things, reprograms the Land and Water Conservation Fund as a mandatory spending program of $900 million annually. Doing so delegates away Congress’ power of the purse to bureaucrats at the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Forest Service. Importantly, it appears that Congress has little ability to limit how much of the annual $900 million a presidential administration can spend. At least under the current structure as an appropriated program, Congress must debate which projects to support and how much to appropriate, and retains the option to later rescind certain funds. Nevertheless, the appropriations bill lays the groundwork for implementation of the Land and Water Conservation Fund as a mandatory spending program and reinforces the preference to purchase an ever-growing list of lands rather than to save. For example, Section 425 states: “The Federal land acquisition project lists required by each Agency … shall total for each agency no less than 150 percent of the amount enacted for that agency for the previous fiscal year.”While the House is attention to maintenance needs on federal lands is encouraging, one must wonder whether this newfound fervor will outlast the Land and Water Conservation Fund as a new permanent and mandatory spending program operating largely beyond the hands of Congress. Instead, Congress should be going in the opposite direction and reducing federal land ownership. The House spending bill also includes policy riders that would block EPA efforts to respect both the rule of law and principles of federalism, protect the environment, ensure the use of sound science, and increase transparency in government. Some of those riders would:. One of the most egregious abuses in the Obama administration is EPA was promulgating its “mercury” rule without the agency being able to justify the purpose of the rule (i.e., reducing mercury and other hazardous air pollutant emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants). The costs were as much as 2,400 times greater than the direct benefits. Instead, the agency justified the rule based on questionable ancillary (secondary)benefitsfrom reducing particulate matter, even though particulate matter had nothing to do with the purpose of the rule. To its credit, the Trump administration acted and finalized a rule that would not allow this type of regulatory abuse. Buried within the massive House spending bill is language that would undo this new rule and require the EPA to bless the Obama administration is games with its mercury rule. (Seepage 94).. Under the Clean Water Act, states can use the Section 401certification process to ensure that state water quality will not be harmed by federally permitted activities. But what happens when states abuse this process to address issues that have nothing to do with water quality? What happens when issues not related to water quality delay critical projects? That has become a major problem. Last month, the EPAreleasedafinal rule that would help to better clarify the Section 401 process and eliminate some of those abuses. UnderSection 440of the House spending bill, the EPA would be prohibited from using funds to finalize, implement, or enforce what was the Section 401 proposed rule. Congress would allow states to continue blocking projects under the Clean Water Act even if the reasons have nothing to do with water quality.. It is quite disturbing how some on the left want to ensure that the public does not have proper information to evaluate the science used by the EPA The Trump administration has propose da rule that would improve transparency. Section 447of the spending bill would block funding for those efforts that would promote open government and sound science.. Should the EPA and US Army Corps of Engineers be able to regulate almost any water they want, including even regulating what most people would consider to be dry land?That is what the Obama “Waters of the USs” (WOTUS)rulewould have done. The Trump administration go trid oft hat rule and finalized a rule that did something different when it comes to defining “waters of the USs” under the Clean Water Act. It tried to follow the law. The Housereport(page 99) accompanying the spending bill includes language requiring the EPA to develop reports answering leading questions, with the apparent assumption the answers would make the Obama rule look better. It would do this by conveniently ignoring the rule of law, property rights, the state role in water protection under the Clean Water Act, and the vagueness problems that have undermined the Clean Water Act.. Another provision in the bill would prevent the EPA from finalizing the Trump administration is right-sizing of the Obama-era standards that regulate oil and gas methane emissions. The US has become the world is leading oil and natural gas producer, providing affordable, reliable power to families and businesses. Resource extraction has created jobs across the country, and cheap natural gas is a critical reason why many energy-intensive manufacturers have chosen the US as home. The Obama administration is methane regulations were a costly solution in search of a problem. Producers have an incentive to capture and sell methane, the main component in natural gas, because it has economic value, yielding low-cost energy for consumers and reducing the US allies’ dependence on Russian gas. Even the Obama administration is EPA reported that methane emissions from the industry decreased despite the fact that energy production has skyrocketed. The State Department, foreign operations, and related programs appropriations bill passed by the House Appropriations Committee have several provisions that conservatives should be concerned about. Overall, the level of appropriations is $8.5 billion higher than for fiscal 2020, an increase of nearly 15%. In addition, the bill continues funding normal activities through Overseas Contingency Operations, rather than through the normal funding accounts—a mechanism originally set up to avoid spending constraints. With federal government spending at record, unsustainable levels, such an increase cannot be justified. Instead, appropriators should be seeking to better allocate existing resources. In addition, there are numerous parts of the bill that would change policy to the detriment of US interests, including:Current law enacted in 1994 under the n-President Bill Clinton restricts US payments for UN peacekeeping to 25 percent of the total budget. The UN, however, charges the US nearly 28% of the peacekeeping budget. By permitting payment of “USs assessed contributions up to the amount specified in the Annex accompanying UN General Assembly document A/73/350/Add.1,” the House bill would override current law. That would remove pressure on the UN to reduce US peacekeeping assessment to 25%. Currently, the US withholds funding to the UN organizations for a number of reasons, including withholding 15% of funding if the secretary of state reports that the organization is not meeting legislatively specified transparency and accountability standards. The House bill would override those provisions and mandate full payment of US assessments to UN organizations. Indeed, in the case of UN transparency and accountability, it would maintain the reporting requirement but eliminate the withholding. Withholding is a key point of leverage to press for reforms or, if necessary, to ensure that US taxpayer funds do not support activities counter to the national interest. It must remain an option. Unless the secretary of state reports to Congress that funding does not support the national interest, funding will be renewed. The flaws of theHuman Rights Counciland theUN Relief and Works Agencyare well-established. Congress should put the onus on the organizations to reform and earn US funding. The bill would prohibit funding for the International Criminal Courtinvestigation of Americansand allies, but allows “for technical assistance, training, assistance for victims, protection of witnesses, and law enforcement support related to international investigations, apprehensions, prosecutions, and adjudications of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.”That loophole sends at best mixed signals to an organization that is bent on investigating Americans even though the US has never joined the court, nor acknowledged any jurisdiction over Americans. Regardless of what Congress thinks of the president is decisions regarding the World Health Organization, it is clear that the organization badly mishandled the COVID-19 response, particularly its willingness to unquestioningly echo statements and assertions from Beijing. The US needs to work with other member states to try to reform the WHO or, if that proves unachievable, to forge an alternative mechanism to detect and respond to international pandemics. Providing funding in this way risks sending the message that the US is not determined to reform this flawed institution. The bill sets an arbitrary staffing level far higher than the average of the past two decades and bars the secretary of state from acting to “downsize, downgrade, consolidate, close, move, or relocate the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.”Both unreasonably limit the secretary of state is ability to adjust the department to meet current needs and priorities. The US decided to withdraw from the World Tourism Organization in 1995 after conducting a “comprehensive interagency assessment of US membership in all of the international organizations to which it makes assessed contributions” and concluding that US membership in it was among three organizations in which US membership was least defensible. American taxpayers deserve better than to have their money squandered again on this unnecessary organization. Unsurprisingly, House Democrats have moved to undo significant Trump administration pro-life policy achievements. Specifically, the committee-reported bill contains a one-two punch gutting “the Mexico City Policy,” which ensures that American taxpayers do not fund international organizations that perform and promote abortion overseas. The Mexico City Policy was first announced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Since the n, the policy has been enforced by every Republican president and suspended by every Democratic president shortly after inauguration. Several months after reinstating the policy after taking office, President Donald Trumpexpandedthe policy—now known as “the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Policy”—to apply to even more funding streams than the original policy. Not only does the House bill contain language specifying that none of the funds appropriated under the bill can be used to enact the policy, it also inserts language from the Global Health, Empowerment and Rights (Global HER) Act, which contains language that would permanently repeal the Mexico City Policy. Additionally, the bill increases funding to the UN Population Fund and makes an underhanded attempt to weaken the administration is ability to ensure that US dollars do not support coercive family-planning practices abroad. In 2017, the Trump administration used its authority under the Kemp-Kasten Amendment to withhold funding for the UN Population Fund due to the organization is complicity in violating the rights of Chinese women and men by aiding the Chinese government is draconian coercive population-control policies. First enacted in 1985 and included in every foreign appropriations bill since, the Kemp-Kasten Amendment authorizes the president to withhold federal funding from any organization that “supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.”Like the Mexico City Policy, the Kemp-Kasten Amendment has been invoked—or not—along administration party lines. In addition to funding the UN Population Fund despite the Trump administration is determination to the contrary, the bill contains language that would weaken the administration is ability to invoke Kemp-Kasten in the first place.: On spending, regulations, foreign policy, and the national safety net, the House “minibus” package requires extensive fixes. If the House passes the bill as is, the Senate should steadfastly oppose the myriad divisive policy riders that it contains.",1,0,Daily Signal
103,Thousands of Central Valley farmers may lose access to surface water amid worsening drought,-1.0,45.33,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-23/thousands-of-california-farmers-may-lose-access-to-surface-water,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"As California endures an increasingly brutal second year of drought, state water regulators are considering an emergency order that would bar thousands of Central Valley farmers from using stream and river water to irrigate their crops. On Friday, the State Water Resources Control Board released a draft “emergency curtailment” order for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed. The measure, which was first reported byth e Sacramento Bee, would bar some water rights holders from diverting surface water for agricultural and other purposes. The proposed regulation underscores just how dire matters have become as drought squeezes the American West.“It says that this drought is really severe,” said Erik Ekdahl, deputy director of the state water board is Division of Water Rights. The water board will consider the order is approval on August 3. If approved, it would go into effect about two weeks later at the earliest, Ekdahl added.“This is probably the first time the board has contemplated curtailment orders for the entire bay delta watershed,” Ekdahl said. Some notices of water unavailability were sent out to water rights holders in the delta watershed during the 2014-15 time period, but this type of sweeping, formal order was not utilized, he said. If approved, the order would be implemented first with junior water rights holders, the n more senior water rights holders, and the n the most senior. According to Ekdahl, the board believes that more than 10,000 water rights holders would be affected, with their water largely being used for agricultural irrigation purposes. Some municipal, industrial and commercial entities could also be affected. The proposed regulation would carve out an exemption for health and human safety purposes, meaning that water for drinking, bathing and domestic purposes would not be subject to the curtailment. In mid-June, the board issue da notice of water unavailability— which urges, but does not order, people to stop diverting water — to many rights holders. The proposed emergency regulation comes at a time when the primary Northern California reservoirs that feed into California is lakes and streams are at about 30% of capacity, Ekdahl said. Unusually warm temperatures and dry soils have contributed to reductions in runoff from the Sierra snowpack. The water board has characterized the reductions as “unprecedented.”According to a water board presentation, projections for this year is conditions degraded significantly between April and May, when watershed runoff decreased by nearly 800,000 acre-feet — an amount that is nearly equivalent to the entire capacity of Folsom Reservoir.“We are in an extreme drought that is come on extremely fast,” said Felicia Marcus, water policy expert and former state water board chair. According to Marcus, the proposed emergency regulation shows that the water board is working as it should to allocate water during the shortage.“In theory, it is a math thing. You are looking at how much water is in the water course and if the re is not enough to meet all the water rights, the n you issue curtailment notices and orders,” Marcus explained. “That is the way the water rights system is supposed to work.”",2,2,LA Times

The correct figure, as disclosed by Lockheed in its filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, is 120 jets. WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin delivered 120 F-35s to the US military and international customers in 2020,missing its initial 141-aircraft goal for the year, the company announced. The COVID-19 pandemic proved itself to be a formidable challenge to Lockheed is main F-35 production line in Fort Worth, Texas, as well as its network of suppliers across the globe. As early as April, Lockheed executives sounded the alarm about potential supply chain disruptions that threatened to slow down F-35 production. In May, the company announced it would be18 to 24 jets short of the 141 F-35s scheduled for delivery in 2020. By fall, officials stated they expected Lockheed to deliver a total of 121 aircraft.“The F-35 joint enterprise team rapidly responded to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to deliver the unmatched combat capability the F-35 brings to the warfighter,” said Bill Brotherton, the company is acting vice president for the F-35 program. “Achieving this milestone amid a global pandemic is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the team and their commitment to our customers’ missions.”The 120th aircraft — an F-35A conventional takeoff and landing variant — was built at the final assembly and checkout facility inCameri, Italyand delivered to the Italian air force last week. Over the past year, Lockheed delivered 74 F-35s to the US military, 31 jets to international partner nations that helped pay into the program is development costs, and 18 aircraft to foreign military sales customers. However, the company needed to take steps to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its production lines and suppliers, such as accelerating payments to small businesses that build components for the aircraft and grappling with COVID-19 breakouts that have sometimes led to the quarantine of a portion of its supply chain. In May, the F-35 production line in Fort Worth moved to a three-month adjusted work schedule, slowing the pace of production because its suppliers were not getting components to the line on time. During that stretch, production decreased to about eight to 10 jets per month, Darren Sekiguchi, Lockheed is vice president of F-35 production, said i nan October interview. Instead of surging to meet the 141-jet target — which would have increased production costs and created the risk of future delivery delays — Sekiguchi said that Lockheed would more incrementally ramp production back up to 14 jets per month. It will take until 2023 for the company to catch up to its original production schedule. Valerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

Louis DeJoy was reported to be planning to slow mail delivery and reduce overtime for postal employees. Since Donald Trump installed Republican me ga donor Louis DeJoy in the position of USs postmaster general on May 5, Postal Service mail delivery delays have been noticeably worse in many places. With millions expected to vote by mail in November due to the COVID-19 pandemic, some worry DeJoy is cuts to the service he oversees could affect the 2020 election. Trump has been undermining the US Postal Service since he took office. He has mocked the agency as a “joke,” refused to back a pandemic-relatedbailout for the agency, proposed cuts to its budget, exploredprivatizating it, and insisted that it raise the rates it charges Amazon for shipping. The online retail company is founder, Jeff Bezos,ownsthe Washington Post, a news outlet Trumpfrequentlyderides for publishing unflattering stories. DeJoy is a wealthybusinessmanandfinance chair for the 2020 Republican National Convention who had given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Trump is reelection campaign and other GOP lawmakers before he was appointed. The web site Sludgereportedlast week that DeJoy also gave $114,500 to a special Republican National Committee legal fund dedicated to filing lawsuits to prevent states from expanding voting access. At the time of his appointment, criticsnotedDeJoy had millions invested in US Postal Service competitors and contractors and that he is the first person in decades tapped to lead the Postal Service without prior experience working directly for the agency. In a column published by NBC News in July, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington deputy director Donald K Sherman and Common Cause director of voting and elections Sylvia Albert raised these conflicts of interest and warned that DeJoy is selection “threatens to corrupt one of America is most trusted institutions at a key moment.”Since DeJoy took over, their fears appear to have been borne out. Fortunereportedlast month that DeJoy planned to slow mail delivery and reduce overtime for postal employees. It cited a recent internal Postal Service memo that warned that “one aspect of these changes that may be difficult for employees is that—temporarily—we may see mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks, which is not typical.”DeJoydefendedthe elimination of overtime pay for postal workers as designed to “ensure that we meet our service standards.”The agency is also considering closing multiple local post offices in upcoming months, according to a MarketWatchreportlast week. And many locations have already reduced their hours of operation. Even beyond these cuts, some communities have been experiencing major delivery delays. The Philadelphia Inquirerreportedthis week that delays in the Philadelphia region were leaving some waiting more than three weeks to receive letters and packages. The article noted that coronavirus cases among postal workers have been a contributing factor, leaving many routes without a regular or substitute carrier. With elections coming up and more people planning to vote by mail due to the pandemic, advocates worry the delays could mean ballots will not get to voters or polling places on time. And some have suggested this could be intentional.“We have an under funded state and local election system and a deliberate slowdown in the Postal Service,” Wendy Fields, the executive director of the Democracy Initiative,toldthe New York Times last week. Trump, she claimed, was “deliberately orchestrating suppression and using the post office as a tool to do it.”For his part, Trump has seized on the challenges the Postal Service is facing as an argument against allowing voting by mail at all. Last week, Trump tweeteda video from a Georgia television station showing an experiment in which a reporter mailed hundreds of ballot-shaped envelopes to a post office box to see how long it took them to arrive. Most, but not all, had arrived within several days. The reporter observed that the small percentage that did not immediately arrive could represent an important portion of the vote in a close election. Trump the n cited this “testing” as an example of why voting by mail in the 2020 elections would not work. “Mail-In Voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster,” he claimed. On Monday, he argued against Nevada is new law mandating that every registered voter automatically receive a ballot in the mail for the November election,tweetingthat the “Post Office could never handle the Traffic of Mail-In Votes without preparation.”This week, House Oversight Committee chair Carolyn MaloneyaskedDeJoy to testify next month about “recent changes to US Postal Service operations and standards and the need for on-time mail delivery during the ongoing pandemic and upcoming election.” Hereportedlyagreed to do so. In an email, a US Postal Service spokesperson wrote that the agency is in financial trouble and that “Congress and the Postal Regulatory Commission must enact legislative and regulatory reforms to help address the situation. At the same time, it is imperative for the Postal Service to operate efficiently and effectively, while continuing to provide service that meets the needs of our customers.”The statement noted that “the Postal Service remains fully committed to fulfilling our role in the electoral process when public policy makers choose toutilize the mail as a part of their election system, and to delivering Election Mail in a timely manner consistent with our operational standards.“To be clear however, and despite any assertions to the contrary, we are not slowing down Election Mail or any other mail,” the statement continued. “Instead, we continue to employ a robust and proven process to ensure proper handling of all Election Mail consistent with our standards.”It concluded by noting that “the notion that the Postmaster General makes decisions concerning the Postal Service at the direction of the President is wholly misplaced and off-base.”Published with permission of The American Independent Foundation. On Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris called on Georgia voting rights advocates and elected officials to continue to fight for expanded access to the ballot box as the election cycle gears up for this November is presidential election. The 10 Wisconsin Republicans who posed as electors for President Donald Trump in 2020 even though he had lost the election settled a lawsuit against them Wednesday, acknowledging their actions were part of an effort to overturn the election results.

107,Serbia is Protests Are not the Beginning of a Balkan Spring,4.25,35.0,https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/19/serbias-protests-arent-the-beginning-of-a-balkan-spring-vucic-stefanovic-protests-belgrade/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"BELGRADE, Serbia—Over the past three months, the residents of Belgrade have developed a new weekly ritual: Every Saturday evening, thousands of them gather near Republic Square in the center of the city for a protest march against the political violence, democratic backsliding, and deterioration of media freedoms that have become widespread under the current government and its autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic. BELGRADE, Serbia—Over the past three months, the residents of Belgrade have developed a new weekly ritual: Every Saturday evening, thousands of them gather near Republic Square in the center of the city for a protest march against the political violence, democratic backsliding, and deterioration of media freedoms that have become widespread under the current government and its autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic. The protests, which started on December 8 last year, have spread to several dozen cities across Serbia and have even inspired similar protests in Albania and Montenegro, where activists have risen up against their own crooked political classes. Last Saturday, on March 16, the demonstrations reached a new crescendo when protesters and opposition leaders in Belgrade stormed the headquarters of state broadcaster Radio Television Serbia, which led to their forced removal by riot police. That same night in Albania, protesters lobbed stones and clashed with police in front of the parliament building in Tirana. This blossoming of dissent has led some to wonder if this might be the beginning of a “Balkan Spring.”In Serbia, the protests weretriggered by the beating of Borko Stefanovic, an opposition politician and leader of the Serbian Left party, in the southern city of Krusevac on November 23, 2018, where he was left bloodied and hospitalized after being assaulted by a group of assailants wielding blunt objects. The following day, one of Stefanovic is allies, Dragan Djilas, told reporters that Vucic was “the main culprit” behind the assault. The first demonstration was held in Krusevac a week later under the banner of “Stop the Bloody Shirts” and was organized by the Alliance for Serbia, a coalition of various opposition parties that includes the Serbian Left and spans the entire breadth of the country is political spectrum. The inaugural Belgrade protest took place the following weekend and was organized independently of the opposition alliance by a group of students from the University of Political Sciences. The assault on Stefanovic might have been the spark that lit the fuse, but the protesters took aim at a much greater foe than his attackers: Their target was the government in its entirety and Vucic himself, whom they blame for the deteriorating political conditions in the country. The protesters elicited a typically pigheaded response from the president, who claimed that he would not give into their demands, “even if there were 5 million people in the streets.” This was quickly adopted as their slogan: “One in 5 Million”. Although temperatures in the Balkans are rising, neither budding flowers nor mass protests should be mistaken for the beginning of a Balkan Spring modeled on the revolutions that rocked the Arab world in 2011. Vucic has, lest we forget, seen out mass protests before, following his 2017 presidential election victory, when he finished 38 points ahead of his nearest competitor. For nearly two full months, citizens took to the street on an almost daily basis to protest “against the dictatorship,” as they called it. By the end of May the demonstrations had largelyfizzledout. The protesters opposed Vucic and his hegemonic rule, but they could offer no alternative. Only one opposition figure, the former ombudsman Sasa Jankovic, won more votes thana spoof candidate who promised to build Serbia a coastline. Then, like now, the protesters lacked a serious strategy that would allow them to achieve their aims. They could mobilize a crowd, but they lacked a clearly defined path to victory, and it was inevitable that this aimlessness would eventually cause them to run out of steam. Today is protesters have improved on their 2017 predecessors by setting out several concrete demands: They have called for the resignations of the interior minister, Nebojsa Stefanovic (a right-hand man Vucic frequently uses as an attack dog in public debates), and the health minister, Zlatibor Loncar (who allowed Vucic to pose for a hospital ward photo-op with critically ill children during a flu epidemic without wearing the appropriate medical attire and, critics allege, putting the children is health at risk), as well ast wo senior figures at Radio Television Serbia, which is often accused of being a government mouthpiece. Protesters have also called for convictions in the unsolved 2018 assassination of Oliver Ivanovic, a Kosovo Serb politician and outspoken Vucic critic who had been a thorn in the side of the government, particularly when it came to denouncing organized crime. But it is still unclear how they plan to extract these concessions. The protesters’ main problem is that they are unable to apply any political pressure on the government by rallying around a candidate that might threaten Vucic is stranglehold on national politics. Although the Alliance for Serbia has tried its hardest to attach itself to the protests, the weekly demonstrations are not formally affiliated with any single opposition party or political figure. The entirety of the anti-Vucic ideological spectrum is represented—from student Marxists to Bosko Obradovic, the ultranationalist leader of Dveri, a far-right opposition party of religious conservatives—sometimes causing scuffles among the protesters. This highlights the fragmented and impotent nature of the Serbian opposition, which is united by its opposition to Vucic but unable to agree on much else. The anti-Vucic movement is also hamstrung by the fact that all the opposition alternatives are deeply divisive and unpopular. The aforementioned Obradovic is a homo ph obe whose party opposes EU membership and wants to orientate the country towards Russia. In the 2017 election, Obradovic took 2.28 percent of the vote—four times less than the spoof candidate, Ljubisa “Beli” Preletacevic (a pseudonym for Luka Maksimovic who campaigned in character as Beli). Dveri currently holds the presidency of the Alliance for Serbia. The coalition was founded by Djilas, Belgrade is former mayor and a key figure in the discredited Democratic Party that dominated Serbian politics between the overthrow of Milosevic and Vucic is breakthrough 12 years later. Djilas, like other Democratic Party top brass, is widely perceived to have used his time in office to enrich himself by advancing his private business interests. Borko Stefanovic, whose beating triggered the protests, is also a Democratic Party alumnus. He served as chief negotiator in the 2008 sale of state petroleum company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), to Russia is Gazprom Neft. The deal caused outrage for its closed tendering process and a final sale price that came out to only a fifth of NIS is market value at the time. Many see it as a prime example of the crooked privatizations that followed Yugoslavia is disintegration—and Vucic is government launched an investigation into the sale in 2014. It is deeply ironic and profoundly cynical that someone involved in the hawking of state assets now leads a party that bills itself as “Left.” Borko Stefanovic and his sometime Democratic Party colleagues need to shoulder some of the blame for the country is current political malaise, because it was their failures in office that drove a disillusioned electorate into the arms of Vucic is party. This considered, it should come as little surprise that the Serbian electorate remains unconvinced by the alternatives. My own grandfather is a reluctant Vucic voter who frequently complains about cuts to his pension. When I ask him why he continues to back the ruling Progressive Party, he responds with a shrug: “Who else am I going to vote for? Djilas? As if the opposition is any better.”This cuts to the heart of Serbia is political malaise:It is not that Vucic and his party are widely adored but, unlike the opposition, they have yet to experience a self-inflicted fall from grace. In contrast to their opponents, they still have political capital to spend. Until this changes, protesters will struggle to rally the sort of mass mobilization that finally pushed Milosevic out of power in 2000. At the moment, no one is able to present a radically different vision for the country. The Alliance for Serbia published a “30-point”political program, but two-thirds of these points are just single-line slogans. There is no Serbian Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie Sanders who can convincingly pledge to transform the country is politics. Centrists can promise a freer media and less political violence, but for most people these are relatively minor tweaks to the status quo. Their main selling point is that they are not Vucic. No candidate can realistically offer substantially better living standards because Serbia is problems—an aging population, brain drain, poverty, corruption, a stagnant and left-behind economy that is ill-equipped for the 21st century—predate the current government. Serbia is neighbors, even ones that hold EU membership, like Croatia and Bulgaria, all face similar challenges. This would remain constant even if Vucic were to be deposed, and most voters understand that, which dents the opposition is draw. The president is domination over political life in Serbia also distracts from a much deeper rot in the country is political system. Serbian politicians frequently switch parties. There have been more than500 defections since the 2016 local elections, and some 45 percent of these have crossed over to Vucic is Progressive Party. Smaller parties, like the Socialist Party of Serbia, repeatedly act as king makers in coalition talks, an arrangement that allows their politicians to remain in government in perpetuity. Ivica Dacic, the current foreign minister, is a prime example: a key figure in the Socialist party since the early 1990s, his closeness to Slobodan Milosevic earned him the nickname “Little Sloba.” Before taking up his current position, he served as both interior minister and prime minister in just the last decade alone. Dacic is hardly an isolated example: Zorana Mihajlovic, Maja Gojkovic, and Aleksandar Vulin are just three prominent government figures with similar resumes. This creates a malign sort of continuity in which each new government contains remnants of the one that preceded it, such that nothing ever seems to change. Even if Vucic were to step down, many of his cronies would remain in some capacity, ready to build upon his troubling political blueprint. This is why any talk of a Balkan Spring should be taken with a pinch of salt. There is no panacea that will end the country is malaise, and meaningful, lasting change will only be achieved through a complete and total overhaul of Serbia is institutions and political culture. Deposing Vucic might be the first step toward achieving this aim, but the challenges that follow would be much greater. The protesters should bear that in mind, otherwise this latest wave of demonstrations will amount to nothing more than a brief gust of warm wind in Serbia is long post-Yugoslav freeze.

110,First debate: Biden sows seeds of fear and offers little else,22.33,13.0,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2020/sep/30/debate-shows-joe-biden-sows-seeds-fear-and-little-,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-30,23,"The first presidential debate of the 2020 election season is in the books. President Trump was at times brash and abrasive, constantly interrupting Democratic nominee Joseph R Biden and continually refusing to yield to either his opponent or to the moderator, Chris Wallace of Fox News. In other words, he was Trump. His manner surprised no one. Some were surprised, however, when former Vice President Biden tried to play the same game. Early in the debate, he went to the “Liar Liar, Pants on Fire” offense, repeating multiple times that Mr. Trump was lying. Mr. Biden referred to the president as “this clown” at least twice. He also resorted to the schoolyard mantra of “Will you shut up, man?”The last person who tried to get down and dirty with Mr. Trump in a debate was Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the Republican primary season in the 2016 election. Mr. Rubio is public standing was permanently damaged by the exchange. It seems that while people accept Trump being Trump, they still expect a higher level of discourse from other politicians. Mr. Rubio failed, and it torpedoed his candidacy. Mr. Biden is insults did not do much to help him, either. The former vice president is biggest problem, however, was that he spent most of the evening sowing the seeds of mistrust. Not just mistrust in Mr. Trump, the electorate would expect that. Throughout the evening, Mr. Biden expressed distrust in a wide variety of groups and institutions. He indicated he did not trust the CDC in handling the coronavirus pandemic. He was clear that he does not trust Johnson & Johnson or the other private entities to create a safe and effective vaccine against the coronavirus. Mr. Biden does not trust a constitutionally assembled US Supreme Court to render decisions on Obamacare, the 2020 election or apparently any other legal issue. Mr. Biden does not trust private insurance companies to provide health care options to the American public. Perhaps the most alarming issue he raised was why kids are back in school. During the discussion on COVID-19, Mr. Biden literally asked the question, “Why are schools open?” The simple answer comes directly from the CDC Their statistics show that 99.98% of Americans under the age of 18 survive the coronavirus with little or no ill effects. To clarify, that is 99.98% of those who have been infected, not of the population at large. The total population numbers are even more impressive. The point is that schools are open because kids are not dying in any statistically significant number. The fact Mr. Biden does not know that and apparently wants to shut schools down again is very disconcerting. As a bonus Mr. Biden also indicated he does not trust White America at large. “People have to be made aware” he said, that Whites are inherently racist and society reeks of injustice. Great. Mr. Biden supports a government education program that will instruct all of us what to do and what to think. Stalin would be proud. One of the more perplexing Biden statements came when he was speaking of law enforcement and emphasized he was quite sure America suffers from systematic injustice. In the very next sentence, the former veep said the vast majority of police are good, decent, hardworking people. So which is it? Is law enforcement the home of systematic injustice, or are the people who make up that system good and decent? It ca not be both. During a discussion on the Supreme Court, debate moderator Chris Wallace asked Mr. Biden if he supported the idea of expanding the size of the Supreme Court and thus giving himself four lifetime appointments of justices. Mr. Biden is answer? “Whatever position I take, that will become the issue, so I will not answer the question.” Of course, his position is an issue. Apparently, one more group Mr. Biden does not trust is the voting public. He does not believe voters should hear his position on what would be the most significant change to the high court in US history. He does not trust you to hear his words and decide for yourself if you agree. Let is review:Mr. Biden does not trust the CDC Mr. does not trust the pharmaceutical companies to make a safe and effective vaccine. Mr. Biden does not trust the Supreme Court. Mr. Biden does not trust you to choose your own health insurance. Mr. Biden does not trust public schools should be open. Mr. Biden does not trust you to understand White supremacy and White privilege, so he will educate all of us. Mr. Biden does not trust the police. Mr. Biden does not trust voters to hear his opinion on matters of importance so he simply will not share it. All of that in 90 minutes. Mr. Biden did not outline action plans during the debate but instead spent virtually all of his time sowing the seeds of mistrust and fear. He would rather burn down our institutions and create chaos than run for election standing for anything. The content of the former vice president is debate was embarrassingly bad. Can you tag Mr. Trump with the “rude” label for all his interruptions? Yes. You can also assign him one other label from the first debate: the winner.

112,What will cable news do without President Trump?,-11.67,40.0,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/what-will-cable-news-do-without-president-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,24,"Greetings from stormy St. Petersburg, Florida. Tropical Storm Eta rolled through the Tampa Bay area as I was writing this newsletter, so hopefully the words are not blowing off the screen. A tropical storm and Christmas music on the radio at the same time? Yep, it is 2020. There is no question that President Donald Trump has been a ratings booster for cable TV news. Fox News, CNN and MSNBC are enjoying some of their best ratings ever. To be clear, there are other factors for why folks are interested in the news these days, including a once-in-a-hundred year pandemic. It also should be noted that on a good night, the big three cable news networks draw fewer than 15 million viewers in prime time — decent for TV, but a pretty low number compared to the overall population. Still, the Trump presidency has been good for business. He tweets. He rants. He raves. And the cable news outlets eat it up. But, Variety is Brian Steinberg writes, “There is palpable concern the spotlight may fade with the departure of President Donald Trump and the arrival of President-elect Joe Biden.”So what will happen when Trump is no longer president?There are different the ories. One is that interest in the news will remain high, so even with a Biden presidency, ratings will continue to thrive. Plus, the major news story — coronavirus — will remain a story that Americans must follow, perhaps for another year, if not longer. But as far as politics and the White House, the cable news outlets might see a drop in viewership. In a recent earnings call, Fox Corporation CEO Lachlan Murdoch said, “I would expect as we enter a more normal news cycle, which has to happen eventually, that appetite for news will shift back to appetite for the great American pastimes of watching football, and watching baseball, and watching ‘The Masked Singer’ or ‘I Can See Your Voice,’ and we look forward to that shift.”A “more normal news cycle” would mean no coronavirus and a president who is not constantly elbowing his way into the news cycle. Lachlan, however, thinks Fox News will continue to lead in cable news viewership.“What we aim to control is share,” Murdoch said on the earnings call. “And I strongly believe and we have seen this through, I think, now 18 years, off the top of my head, of different administrations and different political cycles, we have maintained our Number 1 position through all of that. … So the news cycle will moderate. We fully expect to be Number 1 and maintain share through that.”That, perhaps, is true. There is plenty of speculation about what will happen to Fox News, a favorite among conservatives and right-leaning viewers. On one hand, maybe a Biden presidency is not the worst thing ever. Primetime pundits such as Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham can rail on Biden and his policies for the next four years. Complaining about Biden might be better programming than had Trump remained president with no election on the horizon. On the other hand, Trump supporters might quickly grow tired of being reminded every night that their favorite president did not win the election — and complaining about the other guy will soon grow old. Think of it like fans of a sports team. They can complain about a loss on sports-talk radio right after the game, but they do not want to keep harping on it for weeks and months on end. After a while, it just becomes depressing. There are other wrinkles to consider. Might Trump start his own network or throw his support behind a place such as OAN? Is CNN boss Jeff Zucker going to leave CNN and what might that mean?But let is also give credit to the cable news networks. They are run by smart people and have charismatic prime time personalities. We can assume they adjust what they have to attract viewers. And, hey, 2024 is not that far away. The New York Times building. (mpi43/MediaPunch /IPX)There are many reasons why The New York Times is such an outstanding news organization. But here is a perfect example of what makes them so good. With all this talk about election fraud coming from the White House, The New York Times rolled up its sleeves, picked up the phone and went to work. The headline says it all:“The Times Called Officials in Every State: No Evidence of Voter Fraud.”The Times’ Nick Corasaniti, Reid J Epstein and Jim Rutenberg wrote, “… top election officials across the country said in interviews and statements that the process had been a remarkable success despite record turnout and the complications of a dangerous pandemic.”They also wrote, “The New York Times contacted the offices of the top election officials in every state on Monday and Tuesday to ask whether they suspected or had evidence of illegal voting. Officials in 45 states responded directly to The Times. For four of the remaining states, The Times spoke to other statewide officials or found public comments from secretaries of state; none reported any major voting issues.”Jeffrey Toobin (Photo: PGDC/MediaPunch /IPX)Jeffrey Toobin has been fired from The New Yorker. During a video call last month with staffers of The New Yorker and WNYC radio, Toobin reportedly exposed himself. Following an investigation, Conde Nast, which owns The New Yorker, announced Wednesday that he has been let go. In a memo to staff reviewed by The New York Times, Conde Nast is chief people officer, Stan Duncan, said, “I want to assure everyone that we take workplace matters seriously. We are committed to fostering an environment where everyone feels respected and upholds our standards of conduct.”Toobin announced his firing on Twitter, writing, “I was fired today by @NewYorker after 27 years as a Staff Writer. I will always love the magazine, will miss my colleagues, and will look forward to reading their work.”Toobin also has been suspended from his job and is on leave as a legal analyst for CNN Looking for an expert source?

Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue of Georgia called on the state is secretary of state to resign, citing “failures” in the election process. However, they did not offer any specific evidence to support their claims. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution pushed back hard, doing something pretty much unheard of. It put an editorial above the front-page banner. You can see what it looked like by clicking here. The AJC editorial read, “Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue have assaulted Georgia is election system. That is dangerous behavior, both for this state and for the nation. Speaking on the record, Purdue and Loeffler offered no specifics. And that is what makes their campaign-speak attack message so unacceptable. Georgians are wise enough to recognize these antics. And Purdue, Loeffler and others should know better.”NBC News’ Andrea Mitchell speaks with former Defense Secretary William Cohen on Wednesday. (Photo courtesy of NBC News.)Why is it so important that President Donald Trump concede the election and that a transition to President-elect Joe Biden gets underway? Here is a helpful quick explainer from MSNBC is Katy Tur, who said this on her show Wednesday:“They do have the benefit of Biden previously being in the White House and knowing some of the lay of the land. But I was talking to a senior administration official who was telling me that part of the big problem is not that Biden knows what he is doing, it is that they ca not look at the various agencies, see how they are staffed and who needs to be plugged in. They also ca not start the process of the national security background checks, which can take a long time. So that should be unnerving for any American who wants to see a seamless transition of power.”Tur asked Associated Press White House reporter Jonathan Lemire how much longer senior White House officials will continue “soothing the president” before pushing Trump to concede and begin a transition.“This is important,” Lemire said. “This should not just be about soothing the hurt feelings of a president who lost. … National security is at stake here. There is a surging, out-of-control pandemic in many states right now. And (Trump is refusal to concede) is slowing everything down, not handing over the keys, so to speak.”Lemire said sources he talked to said this ca not go on forever, but they do not see it ending anytime soon. It could end after Thanksgiving or maybe not even until the electoral college meets in mid-December. Meanwhile, on MSNBC is “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” former Defense Secretary William Cohen called Trump is refusal to concede “completely inappropriate … reckless and it is consistent with how Donald Trump has conducted the presidency.”He added, “When you do not help the incoming administration protect the country the n you have failed in your duty. You have failed royally, if I can use the word royal, because the president wants to act like a royal, that everyone else is in his court and they must pay obeisance and pay tribute to him.”MSNBC is Steve Kornacki talks with Savannah Sellers. (Photo: courtesy of NBC News.)One of the stars of election week TV coverage was CNN is John King, who spent most of the week on his feet and wearing out CNN is Magic Wall. My Poynter colleague Amaris Castillo caught up with King for a good Q&Athat you should check out. King told Castillo, “I am a mix of exhausted and excited. The election results are clear, but there is so much news and uncertainty — from the Trump refusal to concede to the continued counting of ballots to the Biden transition launch and the horrific COVID surge. So sleep has to wait a bit longer. That is OK It is a dramatic news story and at a very consequential moment, so this is why we do this — and sleep and rest can wait.”John King was not the only big board star during election week. How about MSNBC is Steve Kornacki?NBC News’ Savannah Sellers went to the big board to get the lowdown from Kornacki, including questions for Kornacki from Chrissy Teigen. The most pressing questions?Gabriel Escobar has been named top editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer. Escobar had been editor and vice president — second in charge in the newsroom — since 2017. The Philadelphia Inquirer is Anna Orso and Jesenia De Moya Correa wrote about Escobar: “A former foreign correspondent, he is respected inside and outside The Inquirer as a skilled journalist and an even-keeled manager, as well as a deep listener always armed with a notepad.”Escobar replaces executive editor Stan Wischnowski, who resigned in June after a controversial headline — “Buildings Matter, Too” — in the wake of protests about race. That headline led to the Inquirer doing some soul-searching about the culture in its newsroom and how it covers issues involving race. After Wischnowski resigned, Inquirer Publisher and CEO Lisa Hughes said the company would conduct a national search to replace him, according to the Inquirer. But she stayed in-house by naming Escobar. She told The Inquirer that Escobar is “a seasoned leader who embodies our values, embraces our shared strategy, and understands the diversity of the communities we serve.”The Inquirer wrote, “Escobar, who was born in Colombia, will be one of the highest-ranking Latinos at a US news organization.”Here is something political and election junkies might enjoy. The Tampa Bay Times is hosting a video chat with journalists today at noon Eastern called “Election 2020: Where do we go from here?” The Times describes it as a “discussion about the election and what it means for our region, state and country.”If you want to listen in,click here. Writing for The Undefeated, William C Rhoden with“Tony Dungy is Life Lesson About the Tuskegee Airmen and the Meaning of Humility.”In The New York Times, Amanda Rosa with“What Happens to Some LG BT Q Teens When Their Parents Reject Them.”If 2023 felt tumultuous, 2024 seems to have gone completely off the rails. Poynter is media business experts dig into the causes — and effects. It is not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or make stuff up. But few share Trump is disregard for factual accuracy.‘Let is build proper support systems and processes to deal with high levels of stress and unrealistic expectations.’‘I am sorry for everything you have all been through. No one should have to go through the things that your families have suffered.’Our working paper found that the tech giants owe publishers billions of dollars.

But when CNN is Dana Bash asked Clegg, who is Facebook is vice president of global affairs, about Haugen is claims, specifically about how the company is algorithms boosted content ahead of January 6, he gave a roundabout non-answer.

She has filed numerous complaints to the Securities and Exchanges Commission alleging that Facebook “misled investors and the public about its role perpetuating misinformation and violent extremism relating to the 2020 election and January 6th insurrection.” She has also called for more oversight of the social media giant, though, as my colleague Ali Breland recentlyargued, even her proposals fall short on the sort of structural overhaul Facebook needs.",1,1,Mother Jones

ByThe EditorsPublished onDecember 6, 2020•We are told, over and over, from media outlets and social media platforms, that claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election are “baseless” and “unsubstantiated.” Twitter flags every article alleging voter fraud, and even stories allegations of voter fraud. Hostile news stories may even put “voter fraud” in scare quotes. Despite this relentless media campaign, there are now scads of evidence of fraud. This evidence is far more robust than anything the media used to keep the Russia collusion hoax alive for years. And it is far more robust than the uncorroborated and contradictory “evidence” the press used to try to destroy Brett Kavanaugh is life. There was never any evidence, for instance, that Kavanaugh had even met Christine Blasey Ford. The most visually sensational evidence of election fraud is the time coded security video footage from the State Farm Arena in Georgia. Democratic counters sent home Republican poll watchers and members of the media, claiming there was going to be a break. But four stayed behind, and later, when no one was watching, they appeared to pull cases of ballots from under a table (which one of them had set up that morning) and started counting thousands of ballots, for hours. We have sworn affidavits from the Republicans that they were told to leave. And on the day in question (election day, November 3rd), the media reported that counting stopped at 10:30 pm. NEW: The election department sent the ballot counters at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta home at 10:30 p.m., Regina Waller, the Fulton County public affairs manager for elections, tells ABC News.— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics)November 4, 2020This is a visual age, and the re is nothing like security video showing what looks like nefarious behavior. But at the moment, we are still groping for exact details. Some officials are denying anything untoward happened (as they would). Perhaps it is not what it appears to be. But press “debunkings” of the story, so far, consist of quoting election officials — the very ones accused of incompetence — or claiming the containers holding the extra ballots were not “suitcases” but rather … ballot containers. Big deal. The fact that they are even disputing such a trifle is suspicious. In any case, this is prima facie evidence. Of course, many observers fraud on election night. We all remember when vote counting in several battleground states suddenly paused. The media is fishy explanations — a plumbing leak, vote counters needing to sleep, etc. — only confirmed the suspicion. But the evidence goes far beyond fishy smells. The best evidence of electoral fraud is mostly in the form of sworn affidavits and testimony from on-the-record eyewitnesses, whistleblowers, along with (often confirming) statistical analyses of events. Statistics can help us tell if some event is far more likely to happen by fraud than by chance, even if it ca not tell us how the fraud happened. Focus on this evidence. If juicy video evidence appears and stands up to scrutiny, fine. But do not be distracted by eye-catching visuals. And do not suppose that a lack of video evidence means much if anything. Remember, murders happen every day. We almost never have video of them happening. Finally, be skeptical of everything. If some Democrats committed fraud in the November election, they would be smart enough to anticipate some of this would be detected. Thus, they would be smart enough to seed social media with sensational examples of fraud that they know conservatives would pass around and retweet. And the n, when those were debunked, the comp licit media would use this to paper over solid, but less catchy evidence. Here is the reality: the media and social media are suppressing and burying the best evidence. We have watched articles and stories get buried by Google in near-real time. Twitter and Facebook have been utterly shameless in censoring and misdirecting users. You can see the result of this social media “curating” by looking for relevant stories on Google, Bing, and Duck Duck Go. For instance, Google “Pennsylvania hearing on voter fraud.” (Google is by far the worst.) You will find many, many “stories” describing Trump cancelling his trip to the hearing, and “rambling” when he called in instead. Note how hard it is to find a straightforward news summary of the content of the hearing. It is almost like Google is trying to keep you from finding such information. Or, try toGooglethe excellent summary of suspicious anomalies published recently in the US edition of the (UK). I will even give you the exact title of the piece: “Reasons why the 2020 election is deeply puzzling.” Note how long it takes for Google to provide a direct link the article itself (as opposed to recent pieces that make reference to the original, which Google has not yet buried). If you did not have the exact title of the piece, you might as well be searching for a microscopic needle in the mother of all haystacks. Next, try the same search atBing, for a different experience. For a real hoot, search for “the very best evidence of electoral fraud 2020” on several different search engines. Another example: Search for the phrase “widespread election fraud.” The press has filled the info sphere with that word “widespread.” But of course, the best evidence is election fraud is highly in a handful of cities and counties dominated for decades by Democratic machine politics. One final example (we could do this all day): Search for “Donald Trump, electoral fraud speech, December 2, 2020” on any search engine. Notice the relentless bias. Here is one version of the video without a biased title (at least until YouTube pulls this version). Now multiply this experience with search engines ten thousand times to get a sense of how social media and media in general have worked to bury evidence of electoral fraud. This is, in effect, an information propaganda campaign by virtually the entire establishment in control of the flow of information. But even without this media censorship, how does the average person discriminate between good and bad information? In the last few weeks, a to n of bogus and misguided claims have flooded the relevant channels. These are sticky and more likely to get shared on Twitter than more solid but less sensational information. And even some sophisticated statistical analysis falls apart on closer inspection. As a result, it is hard for most people to find reliable sources, and to separate the wheat from the chaff. So, here is a representative sample for the honest inquirer, who does not have countless hours to research the subject. (We will update this piece periodically, so you might want to bookmark it — especially since it will likely get buried or labeled on social media.)There is really no substitute for watching the videos of the state hearings the mselves (links below), but this requires many hours and the testimony varies on quality. Short of that, at least spend a few hours reading the following articles, including summaries of the hearings. If you do that, you will know more about the evidence of fraud than anyone that relies on their Twitter feed or CNN for information.

Texas Governor Greg AbbotttoldFox News on Monday night that Democrats who fled the state to stop the state is legislature from voting on bills during a special legislative session will “be arrested” the moment that they step foot back in the state and hauled to the state Capitol to do their jobs.“What the law is, it is in the Constitution, and that is the house, the State House of Representatives who were here in the Capitol in Austin right now, they do have the ability to issue a call to have their fellow members who are not showing up to be arrested, but only so long as that arrest is made in the state of Texas,” Abbott said. “That is why they have fled the state. Once they step back into the state of Texas, they will be arrested and brought to the Texas Capitol, and we will be conducting business.”Related:",1,1,Daily Wire

118,Liz Cheney is heresy,-22.67,29.67,https://theweek.com/articles/981319/liz-cheneys-heresy,https://adfontesmedia.com/week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-07,24,"For years now, Representative Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) has been one of the most influential Republicans in Washington. Scion of one of the most powerful families in conservative politics, she served in several positions in the Bush administration and was elected as the House representative from Wyoming in 2016 — the same seat her father held for many years. She the n moved up to the third-ranking position in the House Republican caucus, and was widely assumed to have a bright future. But now her political career is coming to an end. She faces a primary challenge from the extreme right, and an upcoming vote backed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to kick her out of her leadership position. She is expected to lose in both cases, but even if she does not, it is clear her upward trajectory in Republican politics is over. Completely unscrupulous will to power and to adying fealty to Donald Trump are now mandatory preconditions for participating in conservative politics. It is important to be clear up front that Cheney has had an exceptionally monstrous career thus far. Her domestic policy record is the usual Bush-era mix of social conservatism and total deference to the oligarch class, but her real passion is foreign policy. Just like her father, she is a bloodthirsty imperialist warmonger. After working in support of the Bush administration is wars of aggression inside the administration, she founded a think tank to advocate for an invasion of Iran, and was constantly on conservative media stoking frenzied bigotry against Muslims.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. In office she has advocated relentless violence — indeed, one of her few quarrels with Trump' foreign policy was that hewas not belligerent enough, despite him hugely ramping up drone strikes(and attendant civilian casualties) and his illegal assassination of a top Iranian official. She has also been a passionate defender of torture. A toll of800,000-plus dead in America is bungling, pointless imperialist crusade in the Middle East is apparently not enough for her. AsJohn Nichols points out at The Nation, prior to January 6 Cheney was a bitter partisan, known for telling hysterical lies about Democrats; while campaigning for Trump in 2019, she said Democrats were ""the party of anti-Semitism, the party of infanticide, the party of socialism."" She is more responsible than most for inflaming right-wing extremism. That said, when Trump attempted to overthrow the government and install himself as president-for-life with a putsch, Cheney turned against him. Shevoted to impeach him afterwards, and continued attacking his lie that the election had been stolen. For a brief time after the putsch — when, let us remember, numerous GOPmembers of CongressandVice President Pencewere nearly lynched by the mob — that was an acceptable opinion for a Republican to have. It is no longer. Trump has reasserted complete control over the Republican Party, demanding (and receiving) slavish obedience to his will. In this he has the backing of the vast majority of the Republican base, some70 percent of whom believe his lie that Biden stole the election. Cheney is stubborn refusal to submit to Trump is the refore heresy that must be stamped out. Now as her career goes down in flames, Cheney has written an op-edfor The Washington Post urging her fellow Republicans not to abandon democracy. ""Trump is seeking to unravel critical elements of our constitutional structure that make democracy work — confidence in the result of elections and the rule of law. No other American president has ever done this,"" she writes. ""The Republican Party is at a turning point, and Republicans must decide whether we are going to choose truth and fidelity to the Constitution.""The effect of this argument on her fellow Republicans is a foregone conclusion. It will be angrily rejected — indeed, it likely increases the chances she will be purged from the party. One reason is that she is needed as a scapegoat to deflect from other Republicans' betrayal of Trump after the putsch. As she notes, McCarthy himself said on January 13: ""The president bears responsibility for Wednesday is attack on Congress by mob rioters. He should have immediately denounced the mob when he saw what was unfolding."" What is more, McCarthy is reportedly worried he would be called to testify before the proposedJanuary 6 Commission about how he called Trump that day begging him to call off the mob. He would rather that episode be forgotten. Another reason is the character of Republican elites. They are ruthless in their quest for total power, but they can also be counted on to be utter cowards when it comes to confronting Trump or the right is other deranged media personalities. As oneRepublican official told The Washington Post in November after Trump refused to concede his loss, ""What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?"" (AskCapitol Police officer Mike Fanoneabout that.) Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, after briefly criticizing Trump for the putsch, has thereafter clammed up about the former president to the point of studiously pretending not to hear Trump is constant personal insults — here fused to commentThursday on a Trump statement calling him ""gutless and clueless.""There was a moment, probably lasting no more than a few hours after the putsch, when Trump critics might have rounded up enough Republican votes in the Senate to convict Trump and prevent him from holding federal office ever again. This might have even been a smart political move — Cheney is likely calculating that given Trump isabysmal approval rating, the GOP would be better off ditching him and pretending his whole presidency never happened, as they did with Richard Nixon. But almost all the critics (including Democrats) chose to dither and procrastinate, which allowed Republicans to dose the mselves up with right-wing propaganda and get back on the low road. Conservative media has gradually pivoted from downplaying or denying the Capitol putsch to outright defending it. The putschist strategy of winning at any cost, regardless of votes, has become the overt GOP plan for upcoming elections. As my colleagueJoel Mathis writes, ""The insurrectionists have taken over the Republican Party.""So the choice Cheney outlines in her article has already been made. Republicans have chosen Trump over the Constitution, which they are plotting to overturn to set up one-party rule. If he runs in 2024, he almost certainly will get the nomination. Previous conservative policy dogma no longer matters in the slightest. As the conservative Club for Growthpoints out, Cheney is probable successor, Elise Stefanik, has a much less orthodox voting record. But when it comes to licking Trump is wingtips, her record (like Trump is shoes)is spotless. Her political future, unlike Cheney is, is bright.",1,1,The Week

In a Sunday interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, Trump described Babbitt as an “innocent, wonderful, incredible woman”and once again demanded that the identity of the shooter be released.“People want to know [who shot Ashli Babbitt] and why,”the former president claimed.

The identity of Babbitt is shooter has not been released, but it had been believed to be a Capitol police officer who fired the shot, allegedly to prevent Babbitt and others from breaking through a door. Trump, however, has suggested that it was the“head of security”for a top Democrat who was behind Babbitt is death. Bartiromo first brought up the“speculation,”and Trump confirmed he is heard the same things.“I have heard also that it was the head of security for a certain high official, a Democrat,”Trump said.

Great interview this morning with@MariaBartiromo. Liberal pundits have not been so suspicious of the death, and many blasted the president is latest suggestions, claiming it could“inflame”some on the right.1. Trump is, right before our eyes, rewriting January 6 into a stabbed-in-the-back narrative, with Ashli Babbitt as a Horst Wessell style martyr. And Fox, once hesitant, is now on board out of fear they are losing audience to NewsMax and OAN. have been reporting on the meaning of Ashli Babbitt to the far right for a few months now. Trump is interview with Maria Bartiromo about the shooting this morning was a big escalation of the story is weaponization. The rewriting of January 6 is underway, and Democrats are doing little to push back against this Stalinist attempt to alter the historical record. leaving office, Trump has continued to hold rallies and release public statements on current events. He also recently joined a class action lawsuit against Facebook, Google, and Twitter, seeking to take away those platforms’ ability to discriminate against people based on political opinions. Trump is political future, however, has been open to speculation, with the president hinting multiple times that a 2024 presidential run could happen. Asked if he will be running by Bartiromo, Trump said he“knows”whether he is running or not and people are“going to be very happy”with his decision.“I absolutely know my answer, and we are going to do very well and people are going to be very happy,”he said.",1,1,RT
120,Portland is Independent Police Review opens more than 40 investigations into alleged police misconduct at protests,0.33,49.0,https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/08/portlands-independent-police-review-opens-more-than-40-investigations-into-alleged-police-misconduct-at-protests.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,25,"Portland is independent police oversight body is investigating more than 40 complaints related to protest policing since June, according to the director. The Independent Police Review is quarterly report offers the first look at the swelling number of complaints against Portland police at the nightly protests. The city is complaint process is the public is main avenue to hold police accountable for specific actionsThe report, which covers April, May and June, was released at a time when the future of the oversight office is in doubt. A proposal for a new oversight system was unanimously referred to the November 3 ballot by the City Council at the end of July. The vast majority of the Independent Police Review investigations are related to allegations of unnecessary force by police at the protests, director Ross Caldwell said. The office also has some open complaints about the general conduct of officers interacting with Portlanders at protests. Protests against police brutality and systemic racism began in Portland in late May after George Floyd died when a police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. The protests have routinely drawn hundreds, and sometimes thousands of people. The protests quickly became a flash point between police and protesters. Some protesters scrawled graffiti, broke windows and threw things at officer son May 29. The night culminated in forceful dispersals by police after some protesters looted luxury stores and a Target, and lit a fire inside of an office at the downtown Justice Center. The city responded with several days of curfews and much-criticized tactics of hitting Portlanders with batons and deploying tear gas, pepper spray, stun grenades, impact munitions and an ear-splitting warning sound that caught other demonstrators and journalists in the middle. Police have continued to use force since the early days of protest, as have protesters continued to tag buildings with graffiti and throw various objects at officers, including water bottles, eggs and fireworks. Federal judges have barred or limited use of many of the tactic sunless police say they believe life or public safety are at risk. Police have more recently used batons and lines of officers to push people back at protests and occasionally,used tear gas and munitions after declaring civil disturbances. Portland is Citizen Review Committee, an advisory body to Portland police and the Independent Police Review condemned the police tactics in a June statement.“While these demonstrations are first and foremost about the worth of Black lives, the response to them is also illuminating a troubling pattern of police violence against protesters that interferes with public safety and freedom of speech,” the statement said. Sgt. Brent Maxey, an 18-year veteran of Portland police,told KGW in an interview last Thursdaythat people who are not engaging in unlawful conduct have been subjected to force by Portland police at protests. In June alone, the office received 185 such complaints, more than in March, April and May combined. At least 113 of those contacts were “directly related to protest activity,” according to the quarterly report. Some of those complaints were about the same incident, Caldwell said. While the Independent Police Review averaged 6.3 “intake investigations” a day in April and May, that number jumped to 22.5 a day in June, the report says. While intake investigations are preliminary to assess if the group wants to move forward, Caldwell said the 14-day process includes interviewing people who filed complaints, pulling police reports and identifying involved officers. The Independent Police Review investigations represent a fraction of the thousands of complaints filed since the protests began. Many of those complaints were form letters listing demands the Independent Police Review has no power to enact, like abolishing the Portland Police Bureau, Caldwell said. The office also has a narrow definition of what it can investigate. Complaints related to the conduct of officers who work for agencies assisting Portland police are forwarded to the employing agency, although none have an equivalent oversight body. Caldwell said many of the forwarded complaints were about federal officer sand theMultnomah County Sheriff is Office. While Caldwell said people filing complaints have struggled to identify officers or their agencies at times, he said the investigators often pinpoint the information after reviewing reports and protest footage. Caldwell said his office can only investigate community allegations that Portland police officers have violated bureau directives. The sharp increase in protest-related complaints along with others unrelated to protests, drastically increased the oversight body is workload, Caldwell said. Floyd is killing, “combined with the numerous killings of Black people by police that came both before and after, exposed previously unaware community members to the inequities built into the system and galvanized an already passionate, vocal population into taking sustained action,” the report says. The report called for systemic change and increased accountability to strengthen the current system. Independent Police Review, which is housed in the city auditor is office, lacks direct access to reports from police, further complicating its ability to investigate police actions. While the office has a voting member on the board that recommends disciplinary actions, the chief of police and Mayor Ted Wheeler, who serves as the police commissioner, have the final say. However, the police union can challenge discipline to a state arbitrator, who has the power to overturn it.“Police oversight in Portland needs the support of its leaders, policymakers and the community to better address the barriers to full transparency, independence and authority necessary for any oversight system to flourish,” the report says. State law and the police union agreement limits what information about investigations the Independent Police Review can turn over to the public.“These two constraints mean few cases are ever made public, and when they are it creates the opportunity for an arbitrator to overturn the decision if they conclude the disclosure violated the labor contract,” the report says.-- K Rambokrambo@oregonian.com@k_rambo_Subscribe to Oregonian/OregonLivenewslettersandpodcastsfor the latest news and top stories.",2,2,The Oregonian
121,Democrats Keep These Inconvenient Facts From Constituents,15.67,30.67,https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/04/02/fight-left-wing-lies-with-facts-democrats/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-02,25,"A couple of years ago, I gave a speech before a conservative, predominantly white audience. I could not help but notice a tall, heavyset black man, arms folded, standing in the back. From time to time, I would look at him, only to see him frown and shake his head, I assumed disapprovingly, when I made what I considered important points. After the speech, he came up to me. “I am angry,” he said. “Not at you—at myself. I thought I was well-informed. I read the news. I watch the news. I now see I have been manipulated by the party that I voted for all my life.”He the n ticked off some of the points I made in my speech that he said surprised or even shocked him. He said he had no idea that (according to a 2004 Thomas B Fordham Institute study) 44% of Philadelphia public school teachers send their own school-age kids to private school. Yet the Democratic Party adamantly opposes school vouchers, which would give K-12 children of urban parents a chance at a better school. He did not know that Democrats, including President Barack Obama, tried to end the Washington, DC,Opportunity Scholarship Program. It is a lottery that allows fortunate parents to opt out of their local public school for a better private school. The program is so popular that there are far more parents who want to participate than there are seats.“What is more important, ” he asked me, “than making sure are kids arewell-educated?”He did not know that, in 1965, 25% of black kids were born outside of wedlock, versus 70% to day, a phenomenon that cannot be attributed to slavery and Jim Crow. He did not know that Obama once said, “Children who grow upwith out a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools, and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.”He said he was unaware that out of the approximately 390,000 slave owners in 1860, no more than a “handful” were Republican, according to conservative Dinesh D’Souza. He did not know that more Republicans, as a percentage of their party, voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than did Democrats. Nor did he know that more Republicans, as a percentage of their party, voted for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 than did Democrats. He did not know that Democrats founded the Ku Klux Klan and that one of its goals was to stop the spread of the Republican Party. He said he was unaware that, before 1938, when the first federal minimum wage law was enacted, a black teenager was likely to be employed than a white teenager. He did not know that, according to Harvard economist George Borjas, illegal immigration creates winners and losers. But the big losers are low- and unskilled American workers of color who compete against low- and unskilled illegal immigrant workers—who place downward pressure on the wages of the native-born. The man did not know that, according to The Washington Post, in recent years, more unarmed whites have been killed by the police than unarmed blacks. He was unaware of studies, including one by a black Harvard economist, that found the police more hesitant, more reluctant, to pull the trigger on a black suspect than on a white suspect. He did not know that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, police killings of blacks declined almost 80% from the late ’60s through the 2010s, while police killings of whites have flatlined. He did not know that, about racism, the n-Senator Barack Obama said: “The previous generation, the Moses generation, pointed the way. They took us 90% of the way there. We still got that 10% in order to cross over to the other side.” This would be the same Obama who, when he became president, said: “The legacy of slavery, Jim Crow, discrimination in almost every institution of our lives—you know, that casts a long shadow. And that is still part of our DNA that is passed on. We are not cured of it.”According to MSNBC political analyst Steve Kornacki, 43,000 votes in just three states would have switched the winner from Joe Biden to Donald Trump. This means all Republicans need to do is change the minds of a small percentage of the electorate. The man at my speech proves this is more than doable. DISTRIBUTED BYCREATORS. COM",1,0,Daily Signal
122,Will Armenia is political turmoil undo its democracy?,0.0,43.0,https://www.newstatesman.com/world/middle-east/2021/03/will-armenia-s-political-turmoil-undo-its-democracy,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-statesman-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-08,16,"Armenia, the small country in the South Caucasus between Russia and Turkey, has been mired in political crisis for two weeks, after a group of army officials signed a letter calling for Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to step down in what the country is leader characterised as an “attempted military coup”. The context of the unrest is Armenia is catastrophic defeat in a short war against Azerbaijan late last year over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Swathes of territory which had for three decades been governed as a de facto extension of Armenia were recaptured by Azerbaijani forces in a stunning advance. (Shortly after the end of the war, I visited Azerbaijan and some of its recently reconquered territories,reporting from the region for the.)The crushing defeat struck at Armenia is sense of self. As Thomas de Waal, a fellow at Carnegie Europe, wrote in, his account of the conflict, for almost 30 years after the end of the Soviet Union, Armenia was no longer the “weeping nation” defined by the genocide of 1915. Rather, it had become a regional power, able to defeat its neighbour to claim land it considered rightfully its own. Until it was not. It is no surprise that last year is defeat has roiled the country is politics. Pashinyan, who toppled former president Serzh Sargsyan in a peaceful revolution in 2018, is blamed by many in the country for the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan is President Ilham Aliyev has repeatedlycitedPashinyan is provocative statements, notably a fiery speech made in August 2019 saying that “Artsakh [the Armenian name for Nagorno-Karabakh] is Armenia, full stop” – as a casus belli. Nor was the Armenian government honest with its populace during the war. Manybelievedthat Armenian forces were on the cusp of victory against Azerbaijan, right until the November night when Pashinyan appeared with Aliyev and Russian President Vladimir Putin to sign a cease fire deal containing crushing concessions. As a result, the sudden news of Armenia is surrender shook the country, leading to repercussions only now coming to the fore. The final straw was Pashinyan appearing to claim in February that a Russian-made missile system used by Armenian forces had proven ineffective. As the cease fire is underwritten by Russian peacekeepers, the unsubtle pronouncement went down badly with the military, wary of alienating Armenia is patron, now more indispensable than ever. Yet even so, the apparent attempted coup appears remarkably half-hearted. It seems to have been limited to 40 or so army officers signing a letter calling on Pashinyan to go. The military did not detain civilian officials or seize government buildings. The contrast between the ruthless efficiency oft he military coup in Myanmar, carried out by the country is experienced and pitiless junta two weeks earlier, is striking. Pashinyan has offered to call snap elections, confident that he will retain power. Unusually, the opposition have so far refused the offer unless the prime minister concedes power to a transitional authority, probably because most polls show him comfortably winning re-election, though his approval ratings have more than halved to around 30 per cent since he came to power. Pashinyan claims figures from the ancien régime he swept away three years ago are behind attempts to de stabilise his leadership. Former leaders – widely perceived as corrupt – attempting to make a comeback not through elections but through coercion “shows how deep Armenia has fallen into chaos and uncertainty, bordering on state collapse, following defeat in Karabakh,” says Hovhannes Nazaretyan, an Armenian journalist. Pashinyan is coming to power in 2018 heralded remarkable liberalisation in Armenia, which, along with neighbouring Georgia, is now one of the only democracies in the region. The prime minister had harboured dreams of closer alignment with the West, shelved with the arrival of Russian peacekeepers. Most Armenians have no great fondness for Pashinyan but believe any plausible replacements would be worse. The outcome of this latest power struggle will determine the fate of Armenia is fragile democracy for years to come. Related",1,1,New Statesman

It is part of The Democratic Squad is effort to put increasing pressure on Biden in his response in dealing the violence which has lasted 10 days and killed more than 200 people. An early draft of the joint resolution of disapproval (JRD) was obtained by Jewish Currentsand is co-sponsored by Ocasio-Cortez, Tlaib, the two other squad membersIlhan Omarand Ayanna Pressley, as well as Representatives Mark Pocan, Cori Bush, Andre Carson, Pramila Jayapal and Betty McCollum.'At a time when so many, including our President, support a ceasefire, we should not be sending 'direct attack' weaponry to Prime Minister Netanyahu to prolong this violence. It is long past time to end the US policy of unconditional military arms sales, particularly to governments that have violated human rights,' Ocasio-Cortez wrote in an email calling on her congressional colleagues to support her bill. The squad-backed resolution would halt the transfer and sale of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and Small Diameter Bombs from the US to Israel. Both bombs are outfitted with special guidance systems intended to hit specific targets. They announced their move on the day Biden told Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu he wanted a  isignificant de-escalation' and said he wanted an eventual ceasefire. But Netanyahu defied Biden is request and said he would continue attacking Hamas. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (left), Rashida Tlaib (right) and other Democrats will introduce a resolution that would block Joe Biden is $735 million sale of bombs to Israel in the midst of their growing conflict with HamasBiden held an intense, nearly eight-minute conversation with Tlaib on the tarmac in Dearborn, Michigan on Tuesday. She criticized Biden is response to the conflict and said US-bought explosives should not be used on schoolsOn Tuesday, Tlaib confronted Biden when he landed in Dearborn, Michigan for a tour of a Ford plant.'Palestinian human rights are not a bargaining chip and must be protected, not negotiated,' Tlaib told him, according to her congressional office.'The US cannot continue to give the right-wing Netanyahu government billions each year to commit crimes against Palestinians,' she continued, an aide told NPR Israel used JDAMs and Small Diameter Bombs in its recent attack on Gaza. It is unlikely, however, that the resolution will pass the 51-member committee, which includes a number of pro-Israel legislators on both sides of the political aisle. On Monday, a report from unnamed sources revealed the US approved a week before the conflict broke out a $735 million weapons deal that included the precision-guided missiles. Omar, the first Muslim woman elected to Congress and member of the Foreign Relations Committee, blasted the deal with Israel, who is a top recipient of US military aid.'It would be appalling for the Biden administration to go through with $735 million in precision-guided weaponry to Netanyahu without any strings attached in the wake of escalating violence and attacks on civilians,' the Minnesota representative in a statement.'If this goes through this will be seen as a green light for continued escalation and will undercut any attempts at broker ing a ceasefire,' she continued. A report revealed the deal was approved a week before the conflict in the Middle East broke out, but the sale of the weapons produced by Boeing in the US still needs congressional approvalOmar said Washington should not  istand idly by while crimes against humanity are being committed with our backing.'The arms deal has to make it through congressional review before it is finalized. A group of 28 Democratic lawmakers, led by Jewish Congressman Jon Ossoff of Georgia are calling for a cease fire to 'prevent further loss of life and further escalation of violence'. The conflict so far, which has seen a barge of bombs between the two nations, has killed over 200 people and sparked a humanitarian crisis. After reports emerged of the sale and as the conflict with Israel and Hamas escalated, Biden held a phone call Monday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. According to a readout of the call, Biden justified Israel is actions as self defense.'The President reiterated his firm support for Israel is right to defend itself against indiscriminate rocket attacks. The President welcomed efforts to address intercommunal violence and to bring calm to Jerusalem,' the readout states.'He encouraged Israel to make every effort to ensure the protection of innocent civilians. The two leaders discussed progress in Israel is military operations against Hamas and other terrorist groups in Gaza. The President expressed his support for a cease fire and discussed US engagement with Egypt and other partners towards that end.'Israel argues it has only sent bombs into Palestinian territories where it feels it has evidence Hamas is operating – including in a media building leveled by an Israeli airstrike.

According to the call, Biden stopped short of calling for an 'immediate' cease-fire. The readout concluded 'the two leaders agreed that they and their teams would remain in close touch.'Biden is statement came the same day Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell mocked efforts to apply equal pressure on Israel and Hamas.'To say that 'both sides' need to de-escalate downplays the responsibility the terrorists have for initiating this conflict in the first place, and suggests Israelis are not entitled to defend the mselves against on-going rocket barrages. I completely reject this obscene moral equivalence,' McConnell said.

125,Biden is First 100 Days Have Been a Tale of Two Presidencies,-22.67,37.0,https://inthesetimes.com/article/biden-first-100-days-progressive-speech-congress-infrastructure-economy-war,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-04-29,25,"As President Biden reaches the100-day mark of his first term, we can discern two prominent features of the new administration. The first is that, when it comes to non-defense spending in the federal budget and non-defense related appointments, progressives have been pleasantly surprised. Biden is Covid relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, included grow thin a slew of social programs, from expanded unemployment insurance to a beefed-up child tax credit, direct temporary payments, and assistance for food and housing. The people advising Biden in the White House include Cecilia Rouse, Bharat Ramamurti, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, who have demonstrated support for a progressive economic direction. And, the administration has been subject to pressure from Democrats in the Senate on a variety of matters relating to foreign policy. Examples include pleas for relaxation of intellectual property rights that are hampering India is ability to cope with an explosion of Covid-19cases, and calls to withdraw support for Saudi Arabia is slaughter of Yemenis. That is not to say Biden has yet to move much beyond the Obama administration, only that the pressure from Democrats is now coming from the left, not just the center. Before Biden took office, these developments might have seemed less plausible in light of the narrowness of the Democrats’ majorities in both the House and the Senate, but that narrowness has proven to come with some offsetting influences. Holding a razor thin majority in the Senate has promoted unity and discipline in the Democrats’ caucuses, which tend to afford centrist Democrats less leeway to perform their traditional rites of conservative independence. The fact that Republicans retain strong institutional support from the Supreme Court, Trump is federal judges, the Electoral College and gerrymandered state legislatures has made the political stakes clear, illustrating that Democrats cannot afford to lose another election. This has helped motivate Biden is party to undertake action that under other circumstances might have been written off as too bold or moving too fast. Yet despite their structural advantages, it is also the case that Republicans have weakened their position in two ways. By indulging the riotous (and deeply discrediting) demonstration at the US Capitol on January6, as well as the patently absurd noises coming out of Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and their co-thinkers, the GOP has proven itself a party more interested in extremism than governing. The other self-inflicted wound is that, by indicating no interest at all in any sort of bipartisan deals on legislation, Republicans have just encouraged Democrats to go their own way. Why pretend to seek compromise with those who a) condone lunacy, or b) betray no interest in compromise?The upshot for progressives in all this has been a lot of good stuff in the non-defense component of Biden is federal budget, including the embrace of achildren is allowance, and all manner of other initiatives in the name of pandemic relief and economic stimulus, with hardly a whisper about the formerly feared specter of the national debt. Biden is proposed budget includes increases for education, social services, science and the environment. And his infrastructure proposals, the American Jobs PlanandAmerican Families Plan, contain a host of progressive priorities, from investments in affordable housing to paid family leave. These shifts to the left have not been borne solely out of a personal transformation by Biden. Rather, tireless organizing by progressive groups outside the halls of power has helped pull the administration toward bolder action, especially on issues around climate. And a leftward tilt within the Democratic caucus on economics, led by progressives such as Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, has helped spur the administration is openness to big spending packages. The expansion of deficit spending tends to give rise to tight labor markets, which is the source of upward pressure on wages. I have argued before that this is the most important issue in public policy. What does a tight labor market look like?It looks like employers complaining about an inability to attract job applicants. It looks like bosses offering people bonuses just to show up for job interviews. Both of these dynamics are now coming into play. Workers of course need other help too, especially in the realm of union organizing rights as would be provided by thePRO Act, but this is still a very good development. The openness to deficit spending reflects an important turn in thinking about economic policy. For those interested in the underlying, arcane theoretical issues involved, John Jay College Associate Professor of Economics Josh Mason wrote awell-regarded review of the subject. In a nutshell, the new turn in policy reflects a de-emphasis on​“supply-side” factors such as labor force participation and savings, towards more attention to the​“demand side,” which simply means spending by households, governments and business firms. When the economy is below full employment — and it is still way below it — more spending begets still more spending, along with employment. My qualification to the enthusiasm on the Left is that there has yet to be a parallel revolution in economic theory. As John Maynard Keynes said in his landmark​“General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money,” economic theory from obscure scribblers eventually ends up in the mouths of those with actual responsibilities for policymaking — so it matters. For all the welcome empirical research by economists on the minimum wage, non-competitive labor market conditions, unionization and the absence of a link between deficit spending and inflation, there is no parallel rise of a theoretical leadership. The’ columnist Paul Krugman, scourge of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaigns, ai not it. He is often on progressives’ side, but is usually bringing up the rear. The so-called Modern Monetary Theory is successful as an academic school of thought, but its tribunes have yet to be welcomed into the new administration. The vacuum in theoretical leadership means that in the future, we could again be plagued with the same bad arguments about the perils of deficits. On foreign policy, the pickings for progressives are slimmer. In a recent interview, thinker Noam Chomsky, who has a strong reputation for being right about basically everything, described the current posture of the Biden administration as​“dangerous.”Two of the most important issues now facing the country are: re-entering the nuclear deal with Iran to prevent a nuclear catastrophe, and waging a full-court press on behalf of India and under-developed countries as they struggle with the still raging pandemic. While Biden has promised to reinstate the agreement with Iran, the administration appears to be slow walking the process, evidently for the sake of gaining some advantage. The case for pressuring Iran on​“weapons of mass destruction” — shades of the Iraqi campaigns of the1990s carried out by another Democratic president — was always fallacious. The concern was never really over any threats to use such weapons against the USs, which would lead to Iran is annihilation — something the Iranian government could not fail to understand. Rather, it has been about curbing Iran is political sway in the region, for the sake of Israel and other US allies. The situation in India, with the virus rapidly spreading and deaths skyrocketing, might be likened to a potential holocaust. Some might blanch at that expression, but when potentially tens of millions of lives are at risk due to policy misfeasance (Trump), malfeasance (the Modi regime), and nonfeasance (Biden), I fail to see how the language could be too strong. Former President Trump is protectionist instincts led him to embrace policies that hampered exports of vaccines to countries such as India. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, meanwhile, ha sheld mass rallies shirking the need for social distancing, and his government has forced Twitterto censor criticism of his policies. Biden has been susceptible to Trump is vaccine hoarding impulses as well, though he has lately shown some flexibility, allowing the shipment of certain Covid-19treatments and materials to India. There is still much more to do in the matter of intellectual property restrictions that constrain vaccine production and distribution outside of the USs. In our own hemisphere, the Biden administration has shown a stubborn insistence on supporting an unelected leader of Venezuela, Juan Guaido, over the democratically elected President Nicolas Maduro. Biden is moves so far also show little sign of a thaw in relations with Cuba, displaying some retreat from the Obama administration. Still, there are some glimmers of hope. Some action has been taken to curb Saudi Arabia is bombardment of Yemen, though the administration could go further to stop the war. Biden announced a withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan (albeit by September). And there is the shift mentioned above in commitment to come to the aid of India, with Biden promising to deploy additional supplies to the country including the rapeutics, test kits and ventilators. When it comes to Biden is defense budget proposal, the fact that it includes an increase means it is a step in the wrong direction. However, an increase of1.6% (as Biden proposes) is what advocates of non-defense spending describe as​“flat funding,” i.e. given expectations of modest inflation, it amounts to little or no real increase. What is really at issue is not a misguided increase — it is a failure to cut the defense budget. Then the re is the issue of immigration, where Biden has disappointed many progressives by failing to rescind all Trump-era restrictions, and not opening the border to more migrants, while also keeping the current broken system in place. We should expect more pressure on the administration to ramp up from activists in the coming months. In general, our narrow escape from the threat of a neo-fascist consolidation of power has, so far, brought greater returns than expected. It could hardly be otherwise. Democratic leaders would have to be fools to fail to realize that if they do not deliver the goods, their party could be consigned to permanent minority status. Similar collapses at the state level would follow, and the USs would be a very different place. For now though, we have some space to breathe, even as more fights loom.

To make the school year easier on parents, Orleans Parish School Board President Ethan Ashley recommended that families test all technology before school begins and that they stay up to date with the independent charter organizations in charge of implementing remote plans for families.""I ca not stress this enough,"" Ashley said. ""Be in close contact with your schools.""Schools are set to begin starting the week of August 3, although specific dates vary by charter. The update was given a week after the district and Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced that the roughly 80 charter schools authorized by the district — as well as the now direct-run school, Mary D Coghill — would have a virtual start amid increasing coronavirus cases in Orleans Parish. The update also came a day after district officials admitted they were still grappling with the fact that about 20% of the district is nearly 45,000 students lack internet access as remote learning looms. Dina Hasiotis, the district is school support and improvement officer, said that works out to about 9,000 students, and officials said they were still also working to get computers in the hands of every student.""Schools are closing that gap daily as they purchase hot spots and other tools,"" Hasiotis told the OPSB in a committee meeting Tuesday. Lewis, Hasiotis and others acknowledged that there had been looming questions after the July release of the district is""Roadmap to Reopening"" plan, which called for a mix of remote and in-person learning when schools resume in-person instruction. This week, they pointed to supplemental resources that offered at least some answers. Among other things, the guidance offers a distance learning toolkit for families,including on-demand extracurricular programming from the New Orleans Recreation Department Commission, World Health Organization tips on ""parenting 24/7"" and more. There is also supplemental guidance that includes a screening tool to see if students need extra help to catch up to grade level and resources for English language learners and students with disabilities. The guidance also gives instructions to schools for when kids do return,which could happen after Labor Day if the city is in Phase 2 and meets certain health requirements, including a sustained period of less than 50 new COVID-19 cases a day. Among the biggest questions, officials noted, was: When schools do return, what happens if someone gets sick or comes into contact with someone who caught the coronavirus?In response, the district is calling on schools to do daily health screenings and to immediately isolate children or staff who exhibit 100.4 fever or above. If a coronavirus case is confirmed, a school should notify the Louisiana Department of Health. Then, all students and staff who have been in a classroom with a confirmed case or had close contact are to quarantine at home for at least 14 days, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control, officials said. ""Close contact"" is defined as being within six feet for at least 15 minutes.“We have specific protocols for our schools to follow in those instances that have been vetted by our medical advisors,” Hasiotis said. The safety portion of the guidance also offers tips on how to properly wear face masks, which are required of most students under district rules. It says to provide clear masks for students who are deaf or hard of hearing, and that children should not wear face masks at all if they have trouble breathing with it on, if it gives them anxiety attacks or if they are are likely to increase exposure ""because they are touching their face more frequently.""The guidance also advised that classrooms should be composed of either ""static groups"" of teachers and students that remain together all day or groups of students who stay together as they transition to different teachers. To help implement these rules, the district is holding multiple training sessions for teachers, staff and nurses, officials said, including some in partnership with Children is Hospital. The district was also giving remote therapy and mental health support for students who need it and educating school staff on the legal implications of the virus, Hasiotis said. Earlier in July, Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards signed into law HB 59, a bill that provides schools with immunity from COVID-19-related litigation.",2,2,NOLA.com

Now, They are Stranded.",-5.33,46.33,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/05/they-went-back-to-india-to-care-for-parents-dying-of-covid-19-now-theyre-stranded/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-06,25,"Medical staff attend to COVID-19 patients in the emergency ward at the Holy Family hospital in New Delhi on May 06, 2021. Rebecca Conway/Getty ImagesIn early April, Ashu Mahajan and his wife, Neha, got the bad news: Ashu is father in India was sick with COVID-19. For days, Ashu and Neha kept tabs on him from New Jersey, but when he took a turn for the worse, Ashu decided to fly to India to see him one last time. Nearly two weeks ago, Ashu arrived in India, and rushed to his father is bedside to say goodbye. His father passed away a few days later. Ashu was consumed by grief, yet he was also eager to get back to Neha and their nine- and 15-year-old daughters in the USs. But the re is a problem: He ca not. President Biden is ban on travel from India began Tuesday night, so Ashu is effectively stranded. Even before Ashu left, Neha said she knew in her heart that her husband may have bought a one way ticket to India.“We both knew that this can get really, really bad for us,” she said. “Immigrant workers here in the USs of America, we are all going through this dilemma—to take care of our sick parents in India, or to stay here just to make sure that our visa stamping does not expire, so that we do not lose what we have built with all the hard work that we have done.”Technically, Ashu should be able to come home. President Biden istravel ban, instituted amid skyrocketing cases of COVID-19 in India, is not supposed to include US citizens, permanent residents, international students on visas, or Indians on non-immigrant work visas such as H-1B who have children born in the USs. Ashu and Neha Mahajan with their two daughters in New JerseyNeha and Ashu MahajanAshu is in that last category, but a bureaucratic hurdle stands in his way: H-1B workers, whenever they leave the USs, have to get their visas stamped at a US consulate in their home country before they can return. But right now, all the consulates in India are closed because of the pandemic. “I heard about the travel exemption, but it does not do anything for us,” said Neha, who is an advocate for skilled visa workers and an outreach manager at a law firm. What about those who need to get a visa stamped but cannot get it as the consulates are closed? DOS should restart visa stamping within US like they did till 2004. Makes no sense to make someone travel to 🇮🇳 to get a visa when he is living in 🇺🇸 for 10+ years.— Anirban Das (@anirb_das)May 5, 2021Neha and Ashu are not the only ones whose family has been separated by the travel ban. While it is hard to estimate the actual number of Indian H-1B visa holders stuck in India, my reporting turned up dozens of stories. Earlier this week, I joined a Telegram group on Indian visa holders with 20,000 members and asked how many were in this situation. More than 200 people replied to my message on the same day, though Indian advocates say the number is likely to be in the higher hundreds or thousands. On Telegram, the heart-wrenching stories just kept coming: a father separated from his toddler son. Children on dependent visas of H-1B holders unable to get their visas stamped and return to school. Pregnant women who could not get their visa on time and had to deliver in India in the middle of a pandemic. A fiancé who flew for his wedding and is stuck. Many left the USs to take care of sick parents during the pandemic. My phone is continuously pinging with replies such as these (responses very lightly edited for clarity):“Both me and my husband are stuck here. My husband is going to lose his job with a reputed employer as they do not allow working from India.”“My wife and US born kid are stuck. Cannot get stamping.”“We have been stuck in India for the last six months. I got my visa stamped, but my son who is not a citizen and is on a dependent visa had his appointment cancelled. He is very upset and depressed.”“I traveled while pregnant as my mom and dad were both diagnosed with COVID and were admitted to hospital. My son needs an H4 visa which he ca not get because the consulates are closed. Husband is also here and ca not work remotely for very long. Our future has become uncertain.”“I am stuck in India and two-year-old son and wife are alone in San Francisco.”“We came since my father passed away, but our appointments were canceled last week We can travel with a US born kid, but how can we travel without a valid visa? My elder son studies there and his education has also gone for a to ss.”“We are stuck in India because of stamping and our company ca not hold the job for long…we could lose our jobs. We have mortgages.”According to a2020report from the USs Citizenship and Immigration Services, there are around 500,000 workers on H-1B visas in the USs Most of them work in the technology sector, though there are also manydoctors, pharmacists, consultants, and marketing professionals. Around70 percent of these visas are held by Indians. Because of a Trump administration policy, many H-1B workers were already in India before the ban went into effect. In 2020, during the last year of his presidency, Trump ordered a temporary suspension on all new H-1B visas. For many months last year, US consulates in India were also closed due to the pandemic. Both of these things together made it difficult for H-1B visa holders to travel back and forth to India. The Trump-era ban expire dat the end of March, and the situation was supposed to improve. The Covid situation in India improved for a little bit earlier this year, and consulates opened for a short while and resumed processing visas, but with this new travel ban and an escalating pandemic, those who have been stuck since last year have no way of getting back anytime soon. Another complicating factor is the absurdly long waitlist for green cards: over to50 years, according to estimates from the CATO institute. Every year, thousands of H-1B holders qualify for green cards, yet the re is a cap on how many green cards can be issued to each nationality. As of May 2018, nearly600,000workers and their families were waiting for employment-based green cards. More than 90 percent are Indians, who receive about 10,000 employment-based green cards a year. Meanwhile, they have to rely on visa renewals and stamping of the visa at consulates at regular intervals.“Without a green card, there is always an invisible sword hanging over my head,” said Neha, who has been stuck in the green card backlog since 2012. Immigration advocates believe the travel ban is not worth the stress it is causing families. Cyrus Mehta, a New York based attorney who specializes in immigration law, said that the ban is not very useful in stopping the spread of the virus since citizens, permanent residents, and others are still allowed to travel. But the ban disproportionately affects those who are working on temporary visas such as the H-1B visa.“Representing H1B visa holders, I know what they have gone through,” he said. “Each time they go to India, the re is a ban imposed on them. In the Trump administration, they were subject to bans. Then they wait patiently. They have now scheduled a visa appointment. And their appointment for later this week has been cancelled because of this latest COVID ban on India. So they have got a double whammy.”Mehta suggests stricter controls and protocols such as rigorous testing, quarantining, and vaccination requirements as a better approach to controlling the spread of the virus. Neha has a full-time job, two kids and is recovering from surgery. For the past few weeks, Neha has spent all her free time calling consulates, politicians and speaking with journalists to find a way to get her husband back into the country.“I have not slept a wink,” she said. “I am not a religious person, but these days I am praying to god everyday.”",2,1,Mother Jones

During the Obama years, Republicans engaged in regular bouts of brinkmanship over the debt ceiling, demanding the administration enact the preferences of the Freedom Caucus. But to day,the hostage takers have no demands. So what is the fight actually about?Like aepisode, this debt ceiling fight is about nothing. But it could still do real damage — and it is not only the Republicans who are to blame. The Democratic position is that Republicans should join in raising the debt limit because they share the responsibility for the rising debt — as they unquestionably do. Raising the ceiling should not be a political football, but a routine matter, since the real decisions are made when taxes and spending levels are set by Congress. Escape your echo chamber.

Coming together that way would certainly be better than these constant pointless battles. But getting political cover is hardly something worth risking the full faith and credit of the federal government over. If the Democrats could eliminate the debt ceiling problem on their own, surely that would make more sense than joining the Republicans' incredibly risky game. And the Democrats had every chance to do so. They could have included an increase in the debt ceiling in the original reconciliation bill, for example, or passed a stand alone debt ceiling raise through reconciliation. They could eliminate the filibuster for debt ceiling bills on a party-line basis, just as Republicans did for judicial nominees — or they could eliminate the filibuster entirely in the same manner. All these choices carry political risks, but they are all within the Democrats' power, and are obviously superior to allowing a default. So why have not they done any of them? Because they are trying to force the Republicans to take responsibility for their role in the government is fiscal situation, and trying to force them to admit with a vote what they overwhelmingly admit to the press: that the debt ceiling must be raised, full stop. But that is the thing about being the governing party: You have to govern. If Democrats had wanted to set a positive example, they could have eliminated the debt ceiling entirely as soon as they got the majority. That would have been the right thing to do, and politically wise as well, since it would deprive future Republican majorities of a hostage to take. Instead they are playing chicken in order to prove that Republicans are the irresponsible party. What a responsible thing to do.",1,1,The Week
129,Abortionist Who is a Convicted Sex Offender May Have to Close His Seven Abortion Clinics,27.75,21.0,https://www.lifenews.com/2019/04/16/abortionist-who-is-a-convicted-sex-offender-may-have-to-close-his-seven-abortion-clinics/,https://adfontesmedia.com/life-news-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,22,"Abortionist Vikram Kaji, 82, whose medical license was voluntarily surrendered earlier this year after he was found incompetent to practice medicine, entered into a consent agreement on April 10, 2019, with the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners that requires him to sell seven New Jersey abortion businesses that operate under the American Women is Services banner, according to the“It is our hope that no buyer will be found for these shoddy abortion shops, and that they will be forced to close. They should have been closed years ago,” said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue. “American Women is Services is the most dangerous and deceptive abortion chain that is still operating in this country. Every day they are open they are exploiting women and risking their lives by cutting corners and lying for the sake of profit without regard for their customer is lives and health.”New Jersey law prohibits those who are not licensed from owning medical practices. The consent order gives Kaji sixty days to sell the abortion businesses to a “licensed physician” and submit copies of the sales contract and any management contracts to the Board for review. The abortion businesses originally were owned by disgraced abortionist Steven Chase Brigham, whose own medical license was revoked in November 2014, transferred ownership of his New Jersey abortion clinics to Kaji, who served as his medical director, for no monetary exchange and without Kaji being aware that he was the new owner. Brigham continues to run the abortion businesses behind the scenes in an “administrative” capacity while using an aging and incompetent Kaji as his shill. Kaji suffered a stroke and impairment in his dominant right hand along with memory difficulties that made it impossible to properly conduct his duties as owner and medical director of seven busy abortion clinics. Operation Rescuefiled a formal complaint with the New Jersey Attorney General is office detailing research that showed no record of the ownership “transfer” and evidence of Brigham is continued operation of the abortion chain. The New Jersey Attorney General is office described the business transfer as a “sham”and took steps to end Brigham is participation – steps that were put on hold for four years while Kaji is competence was under evaluation. If Kaji can sell the second-rate abortion businesses – and that is a big “if” – it is hoped that Brigham will also be cut off from any further profit and control. It is possible that if Kaji cannot sell within 60 days, the state could order the abortion clinics to shut down. Those include American Women is Services clinics in the following New Jersey communities:The American Women is Services has been fraught with controversy and accusations of illegal activity over the years, which has resulted in the loss Brigham is medical license in six states. In 2010, Brigham was caught operating an illegal bi-state late-term abortion scheme similar to one that cost him his medical license in New Yorkin 1994. He would begin abortions as late as 30 weeks or more at his unlicensed office in Voorhees, New Jersey, where he was legally permitted to conduct abortions up to 14 weeks. To avoid running afoul of New Jersey law, Brigham would induce the women into active labor the n caravan them to a secret late-term abortion facility in Elkton, Maryland, where the abortions would be completed. Brigham, who was never licensed in Maryland, conducted abortions illegally in Elkton. He shielded his illicit activity by using the license of another elderly physician, whose mental and physical abilities were also impaired, as a cover in a similar way that he used Kaji. However, that scheme fell apart after Brigham and his new trainee, Utah abortionistNicola Riley, nearly killed an 18-year old woman during a seriously botched 22-week abortion. Complaints filed by the Union Hospital in Elkton and the Johns Hopkins surgeon who saved her life resulted in the legal (if not practical) end of Brigham is medical career. Kaji has had his own set of troubles in the past. He was convicted by the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners in 1993 for having improper sexual contact with three patients. Kaji reportedly had sex with one young girl at his office during business hours and later plied her with drugs. He knew his victim was vulnerable to his advances because she had been a depressed victim of child sex abuse with a history of psychiatric hospitalization. Kaji was also accused of giving improper breast and rectal exams to two other women. The NJBME placed Kaji on a 1-year suspension and fined him $5,000 and ordered him to undergo psychological counseling. Brigham continues to operate abortion clinics in Florida, Virginia, Washington, DC, and Maryland, where a woman,Maria Santiago, was killed during a botched abortion in 2013. These clinics are not expected to be impacted by any action in New Jersey. Pennsylvania permanently banned Brigham from practicing medicine or operating any medical facility in that state in 2010, but that did not stop him from surreptitiously opening an abortion business in Philadelphia in 2012. Once his affiliation was found out and complaints were filed by pro-life groups, including Operation Rescue, it was forced to close in 2013.“Brigham has learned well how to evade the law from his decades of legal woes. It is likely that he may try to transfer ownership of the clinics to someone close to him that will allow him to continue exploiting women for financial gain with his sloppy and dangerous practices. Hopefully, the Attorney General is office has had enough dealings with him that they will see through any attempts to pull off another sham transfer deal,” said Newman. “Closing Brigham and Kaji is American Women is Services in New Jersey will be one of the best things the state has ever done to protect women.”",0,0,Life News

132,Facebook Oversight Board Upholds Trump Ban but Ridicules the Reasoning,-18.33,30.67,https://newrepublic.com/article/162310/facebook-oversight-board-upholds-trump-ban,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-05,25,"He has yet to launch his rumored social media platform, but we now know where the former president will be posting for at least the next six months. It is calledFrom the Desk of Donald J Trump: a drab, dated micro blog that would be equally comical and forgettable if it were not the new mouthpiece of this country is most powerful demagogue. Unless Parler backs up a truckload of cash to Mar-a-Lago, this might be Trump is only option. He remains banned from Twitter, and on Wednesday morning the Facebook Oversight Board—or FOB, a pseudo-legal organization conceived and subsidized by Facebookto issue binding decisions on major content moderation issues—declaredthat Facebook is post-Capitol insurrection ban of Trump could stand. “The Board found that the two posts by Mr. Trump on January 6 severely violated Facebook is Community Standards and Instagram is Community Guidelines,” wrote the FOB in its decision, arguing that Trump broke “rules prohibiting praise or support of people engaged in violence.” (Trump is posts encouraged rioters to go home peacefully, but they also contained statements supporting their false grievances about a stolen election.)FOB and its parent organization agree here, but perhaps nowhere else. Facebook initially declared its Trump ban temporary but indefinite, the n asked the FOB to weigh in. The board on Wednesday excoriated that decision as a reflection of Facebook is rudderless policies, and its members are not pleased at being used to run political interference for the company. “In applying a vague, standard less penalty and the n referring this case to the Board to resolve, Facebook seeks to avoid its responsibilities,” declared the FOB. “The Board declines Facebook is request and insists that Facebook apply and justify a defined penalty.”Punting the decision back to company leadership, the FOB said that Facebook now has six months to decide what to do about Trump—and to get its policies together in the process. It is a vital, long overdue request, and Facebook shows no sign of being able to fulfill it. Meanwhile, Trump now has another six months to rile up his legions by painting Facebook as a leftist shill that silences conservatives. “Free speech has been taken away from the President of the USs because the Radical Left Lunatics are afraid of the truth, but the truth will come out anyway, bigger and stronger than ever before,” read aTrump statement distributed via email. “The People of Our Country will not stand for it! These corrupt social media companies must pay a political price, and must never again be allowed to destroy and decimate our Electoral Process.”This messy, embarrassing result, which will satisfy few across the political spectrum, must come as a shock to Facebook. While the FOB had a respectable roster of academic and political luminaries, it was widely considered a rigged regulatory body that would, perhaps temporarily, pacify legislators and activists critical of Facebook policies. Instead, after issuing a few sober-minded decisions on lower-profile matters, the FOB has come out with surprising aggression, showing up its minders as blithe techies ignorant of the damage their platform causes. Yet however silly Facebook ends up looking, the FOB decision still represents a qualified success for the company. The system—Facebook is system—works. It just needs some clarity and fine-tuning. Facebook, which is used to riding from scandal to scandal, has six months to improve procedures and gauge the political weather vane, after which it can again declare itself a responsible steward of public conversation. Facebook surely will remain undaunted in the wake of the board is judgment. Time and again, the company has proven unable to reckon with its own scale and impact, as it recklessly pursues growth at all costs. This is especially true in certain foreign markets likeSri Lanka,India, andMyanmar, where Facebook has been manipulated by illiberal and authoritarian governments to spy on dissidents, propagandize, and provoke real violence. In his use of Facebook as a rallying tool for an aggrieved base capable of its own sudden acts of political violence, Trump has more in common, stylistically and strategically, with India is Narendra Modi or Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte than with Germany is Angela Merkel, who lamented Trump is initial ban. Facebook is political utility and its runaway popularity have always outstripped its policies and its identity. While notionally liberal, it is hard to say what Facebook stands for—even its supposed devotion to free speech has been watered down as something called“Voice.”The company has no firm public standards for how to deal with lying demagogic political leaders weapon izing its platform to intimidate opponents and manipulate supporters. It claims to have “human rights commitments,” including aCorporate Human Rights Policybased on UN standards, but the platform is a constant site of abuse. It probably should not be available in nondemocracies, which is to say nothing of its destabilizing effects on our own rickety political infrastructure.“Facebook has become a virtually indispensable medium for political discourse, and especially so in election periods,” wrote the FOB. “It has a responsibility both to allow political expression and to avoid serious risks to other human rights.” Because it can be a tool for free expression and also one for spreading misinformation or political incitement, the board said, “Facebook is human rights responsibilities must be understood in the light of those sometimes competing considerations.” In short, Facebook is own values may be in conflict with one another, perhaps irreconcilably so. There is a deep reckoning to be had over how Facebook handles content moderation at scale, freedom of expression, and the outsize influence of certain politicians. The FOB is decision was not it. This necessary round of criticism will do nothing to solve Facebook is core problems, which revolve around its business model, its profound dependence on surveillance, monetizing user behavior, and stoking division to boost engagement. The problem with Facebook is Facebook. We are well past the point of reform. All that remains is more bumbling, mealymouthed corporate decision-making that will only further enrage the left and right alike. Perhaps Trump is stay of social media execution can somehow unite those political factions to take down Facebook, but more likely we will all be in the same place six months from now: yelling about Facebook is obscene power, while the company ravenously accrues more of it.",1,1,New Republic

During his remarks, Biden promised to unify the USs and work for all Americans, including those who passionately supported former President Donald Trump.“We must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. We can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. If we show a little tolerance and humility,” he said.“Together, we shall write an American story of hope, not fear. Of unity, not division. Of light, not darkness.

""We opposed this shocking violation of privacy, alongside many victims’ rights advocates.""Uber disclosed the existence of thousands of sexual assaults nationwide in its2019 safety report. Afterward, the CPUC demanded detailed information about cases that occurred in California—including the time and place where assaults happened and names and contact information of witnesses. The CPUC order does not specifically ask for the names of victims. However, in many cases the victim would be the only witness, so CPUC was essentially seeking to unmask hundreds of sexual assault victims. Uber objected, noting that most of the victims had not consented to have their identities or stories shared with third parties. Even if the records were kept confidential, Uber argued, a CPUC investigation of these cases could force victims to revisit one of the most traumatic moments in their lives. In a revised order, the CPUC allowed Uber to submit the information under seal to ensure that the data did not become public. But beyond that, the CPUC refused to budge, issuing a second order in January demanding that Uber turn over the data. Victims' rights groups like the Rape Abuse Incest National Network (RAINN) rallied to Uber is defense. ""RAINN is exceedingly concerned that the Commission is ruling"" directs Uber to ""share a list of victim names, contact information, and additional incident details with the Commission, without the consent of the victims,"" the group wrote in an August filing with the CPUC.""The vast majority of sexual assault victims choose not to report to police,"" RAINN added. ""Surely, they never envisioned that a state regulatory commission would require disclosure of information that the y, the mselves, have explicitly decided to not share with the state.""RAINN argued that enforcement of the CPUC is demands would ""nullify each victim is right to decide when, and to whom, to disclose their assault"" and would ""risk re-traumatization of victims.""But the CPUC seemed unmoved by these arguments, whether they came from Uber or from groups like RAINN In aMonday ruling, the agency held that ""this decision does not require the disclosure of such information that could potentially traumatize the victims a second time."" Instead, the agency reasoned, the rules ""require only that the information regarding sexual assaults and sexual harassment be submitted to the Commission under seal.""The CPUC concluded that Uber had ""refused, without any legitimate legal or factual grounds, to comply"" with the data request. The agency held that Uber is actions were particularly severe because they had ""harmed the regulatory process.""In setting a fine, the CPUC is supposed to consider whether a party is actions were in the public interest. But in Uber is case, the agency concluded that ""there are no facts to mitigate the degree of Uber is wrongdoing."" So the CPUC slapped Uber with a harsh $59 million penalty. Ironically, after hitting Uber with a massive fine for refusing to name sexual assault victims, the ruling allows Uber to submit its data in anonym i zed form.""Uber shall work with the Commission is staff to develop a code or numbering system as a substitute for the actual names and other personally identifiable information"" of victims and witnesses to assault cases, the ruling said. Uber seems to be the only taxi or ride-hailing service that has faced these kinds of questions from the CPUC The company is decision to publish statistics about sexual assault and other crimes against its passengers set a new standard for transparency, but the report seems to have attracted extra scrutiny from California regulators.""These punitive and confusing actions will do nothing to improve public safety and will only create a chilling effect as other companies consider releasing their own reports,"" Uber said in its statement. ""Transparency should be encouraged, not punished.""",2,2,ARS Technica
135,The Significance of the Derek Chauvin Verdict,-9.33,39.33,https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-significance-of-the-derek-chauvin-verdict,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,25,"At the Hennepin County Government Center on Tuesday afternoon, Judge Peter Cahill opened a yellow envelope and read out the verdict against Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who, last May, kneeled on the neck of George Floyd for nine minutes and twenty-nine seconds, killing Floyd and igniting a nationwide uprising against police abuse and systemic racism. Chauvin wore a pale-blue face mask. His eyes darted from side to side. The verdict was guilty on charges of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, and second-degree manslaughter. And, within just a few minutes, it was over. Chauvin, now a convicted murderer, was handcuffed and led out of the courtroom. Cahill thanked the jury for its “heavy-duty service.” Bail was revoked. The sentence will be handed down in eight weeks. Outside, on a broad lawn, several hundred people had congregated to wait for the news. There were Black Lives Matter activists, reporters, and many people who rushed to the area after getting alerts on their phones that the judge would soon read out the will of the jury. And, when they heard the first of the three guilty verdicts, the reaction was loud and unambiguous.“It was an explosive cheer,” Jelani Cobb told me, by telephone, from the courthouse. Cobb, a staff writer at, a historian, and the Ira A Lipman professor of journalism at Columbia University, has been in Minneapolis covering the trial for the magazine. And he has been covering issues of race and criminal justice for many years, from Newark to Atlanta and beyond. We spoke at length on Tuesday; our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. I am in front of the courthouse, on the lawn, at the same spot where, last week, Ben Crump, the lawyer for the Floyd family, had a rally and press conference. When the news came that there was a verdict coming, the crowd here went from fifty to several hundred in no time. Before the verdict was announced, there was a lot of anxiety. There was a sizable military contingent on the scene, too, in case of a verdict that caused an . . .reaction. People were nervous. People were jumpy. People were watching on their phones. Someone from Black Lives Matter had a bullhorn, and when the first ‘guilty’ was called out the crowd reacted. Real ebullience. Lots of raised fists in the air. And now there are loads of cars jamming the intersection here, people hitting their horns, a huge traffic jam. Honestly, I am surprised that they came back guilty on all three counts. But it turns out that the prosecution pitched a shutout. From experience and from learning about the unpredictable dynamics of these situations, you might have expected some sort of split verdict, kind of splitting the difference, but to get all three guilty verdicts was, at least to me, unanticipated. How am I feeling? It is hard to describe. It is important to remember that nothing that happened today changes the fact that we were witness to a man losing his life in the most excruciating way, while constantly saying he could not breathe and begging for intercession from his dead mother. Some things you will never get out of your mind. Rather than say of the verdict that this is the best-case scenario, I’d prefer to say that it is the least worst-case scenario. I was not shocked, no. I was disgusted and horrified. But you had to know, if you have been observing these things for long enough, that such things are always possible. That is been one of the most essential things about this whole case—that we are now, all of us, Black and white, on the same page. Or should be. It is that rare moment when we see through the same lens. We see what the terms are. We see what the issues of criminal justice in this country really are. This clarifies the terms of the discussion. Right. Because, on the one hand, you have the catharsis of a triple-guilty verdict. But at the same time, in the of the trial, we had the police shooting of a young man, Daunte Wright, just down the road, in Brooklyn Center. There are lots of questions. First, what kind of police department are they going to have? There are people here in town who are still organizing around abolishing the force as it exists and creating an alternative structure for public safety. Also, I’d anticipate increased attention to the other trials coming up, in August, of the three other officers who were present when George Floyd was killed. It is been incredibly tense. A lot of establishments and buildings in town were boarded up. There was real fear. They were worried that a lesser verdict or an acquittal would set off a wave of demonstrations and violence. Talking with people in various communities, I found that there were a lot of people who expressed the idea that, at best, Derek Chauvin might be convicted of the least of the charges. And nearly everyone here, across all kinds of lines of age and race and class, predicted chaos if he was acquitted outright. Younger African-Americans, in particular, did not rule out the possibility of an acquittal. The prosecutors did a few things that were interesting. The first notes that you heard from them were the emotional notes. They went through how deeply the community near where George Floyd was killed was traumatized. Not only the people who knew him but others, too, like the 911 dispatcher. Then came the real meat of the case. You got a parade of experts—medical people, especially—knocking down the defense is contentions, one after another. The prosecution is closing argument was especially revealing. The argument was calibrated to any jurors who might have had any qualms about sending a police officer to prison for many years. The the me was, subtly, “Remember, it is not the system that is on trial—it is this one guy.” In a way, this was a pro-cop strategy for the prosecution, and it was carefully designed to assuage any uneasiness a juror might have.[Many] reporters were not in the courtroom. So, like you, we never saw the jury and its reactions. And we saw Derek Chauvin only infrequently. He remained an enigma throughout. Here was this person at the center of a national tempest, and yet we could not really tell what his thoughts or reactions were. Was he contrite? The one time we got to hear from him was when he said he would not testify, and there he seemed almost cavalier. And people noticed that. But, in general, it was hard to see how he was processing all this. He remained as shrouded in mystery as he was in the nine minutes-plus that he was kneeling on George Floyd is neck. The defense? I’d make a baseball analogy: a pitcher who throws a lot of everything—knuckleballs, screwballs, curves—and hopes that something,, works. So, for instance, they brought out their carbon-monoxide defense, saying that George Floyd was affected by the exhaust from the squad car. It reminded me of the Twinkie defense in the killing of Harvey Milk, in 1978, in San Francisco. Remember that? The defense threw out everything they could, playing the game of raising any kind of doubt they could—the drug-overdose theory, the heart-attack theory—and it was all knocked down. In the end, the defense lawyers had the unenviable task of getting a jury past a video that the whole world had seen. If Derek Chauvin had not been convicted, it would have said to the world that there is absolute impunity for police. Most Black people already think that. Recently, we saw another instance that made the systemic nature of things plain. In Chicago, not only did the police shoot Laquan McDonald in the back—the entire system in that city was implicated because the video of that killing was buried. And, in North Charleston, we saw on video a police officer shoot Walter Scott in the back, and the n we learned that he had dropped a Taser near his body, to imply that Scott had run off with the Taser. Even that initially ended in a mistrial. And that all took place in the context of the massacre when a white supremacist killed nine Black people in a church in downtown Charleston. There is this question about the extent to which the system is culpable. With Derek Chauvin, you could not get around the systemic implications of what had happened. The fact is that George Floyd is life was extinguished, and no one intervened. Chauvin had been on the force for well over a decade. The trial, the whole affair, started to add up to its larger implications. The trial strategy tried to limit things to a conversation about one man going rogue, that Chauvin did what no good cop would have done. Ultimately, that is not true. It is not just one cop. Everyone here in Minneapolis, all the people I have talked to, say the same thing: we all know how much work needs to be done on the greater issue, on the issue of systemic racism.",1,1,The New Yorker

137,Immigrants Detained by ICE Say They Were Thrown in Solitary for Requesting Covid-19 Tests,-11.33,46.0,https://inthesetimes.com/article/ice-detention-center-covid-19-outbreak,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2020-12-02,25,"Long-time US resident Shemoi Edwards looks on after release from immigration jail. Edwards, like many others, was locked in solitary confinement because of Covid-19. Photo by Cydni ElledgeThe InterceptInside his cell at the Etowah County Detention Center in Gadsden, Ala., Karim Golding began feeling sick one day in June2020. He had a fever, a pounding headache, cold sweats, an​“onion burning sensation” behind his eyes and he was sleeping for days on end. When he finally felt well enough to emerge,​“the entire unit” was sick, Golding recalls.​“Everybody have some symptom or the other.”Three months earlier, as reported in April,Golding, who has asthma, was a lead organizer of a protest inside the jail, pushing for stronger precautions to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Now, as Golding looked around, he realized their worst fears had come true. Etowah contracts with the federal government to hold people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). To prevent becoming a Covid-19hotspot, Etowah claims (in court documents) it follows guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — including quarantining new arrivals, implementing social distancing measures and providing cleaning supplies. But Golding and more than a dozen other people detained by ICE say the measures taken were more than just inadequate — they led to a massive Covid-19outbreak. Seven of them say people were given a single disposable mask to last for three weeks. One shares a photo of what he says were the only​“cleaning supplies” he received — a toothbrush, toothpaste, comb and combo shampoo/​body wash — which came inside a gift bag emblazoned with the words​“Merry Christmas” from the Salvation Army. Immigrants detained inside Etowah also say many new arrivals were housed in quarantine for only five days or eight days — rather than the recommended two weeks — potentially allowing the virus to spread inside the jail. According to a partial Etowah roster obtained byandIn These Times, ICE transferred at least24people into the facility in June. By the second half of July, the agency reported that21people — nearly a quarter of those housed in Etowah is ICE unit — were sick. When Golding finally emerged from his cell, the organizer part of his brain clicked back on.​“I am looking at people that is literally looking pale in the face,” he says.​“And medical is doing nothing for them.” So, Golding told everyone in the unit to request a test for Covid-19.“So you have Africans, you have Jamaicans, you have El Salvadorans — you have different groups,” Golding explains.​“What I did was say,​‘Hey, listen, you talk to your peoples, you tell them this.’ ”Many people were apprehensive about asking for a test, as guards had already placed the few who were presumed positive into solitary confinement, a fate considered by the UN to be torture. In solitary, detainees say they were locked in cells without air conditioning for around23hours a day. The average high temperature in July in Gadsden is91degrees. Nevertheless, by July4, everyone in the unit — more than80people — had put in requests for a Covid-19test, according to interviews with Golding and another immigrant detained by ICE, as well as the affidavits of nine detainees included in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus Golding filed on his own behalf in the Northern District of Alabama in September. Two days later, according to those11, Etowah County Sheriff is Office Capt. Mike O’Bryant called a lock down of the unit. O’Bryant the n read the names of the10most vocal detainees calling for mass testing, including Golding. These10, O’Bryant said, were going to solitary. At the time of their transfer, none had tested positive for Covid-19. All11sources say they felt this was punishment and retaliation for requesting the coronavirus tests.“I noticed that all of us who were randomly picked were the ones who were vocal, outspoken and shown desire to be tested,” Stanley Walden wrote in an affidavit dated August7.“He handpicked cells and made an example, in front of everyone, that he really meant to throw anyone who get tested into a dungeon,” Sebastian Abalo Cunna wrote in an affidavit dated July28.​“It feels like punishment for standing up for our right to health and safety.”After locking down the unit, O’Bryant and other staff members went from cell to cell asking whether anyone still wanted a Covid-19test, according to Golding and the affidavits of nine others. Most declined and signed waivers saying as much. In a recorded conversation involving two Etowah employees obtained byandIn These Times, one employee described the events of July6as an attempt to​“bully” people into not getting tested. Afterward, both employees said in the recording, immigrants inside Etowah appeared too scared to seek even basic medical care. Four of those who went to solitary say they were unable to communicate with family for days. Some of their concerned family members called the facility. The relatives of one detainee say jail staff assured them that their family member was fine. At the time, he was in solitary confinement having developed symptoms of Covid-19. Golding is mother says she was told there was no evidence of the virus at the facility, even as Covid-19at Etowah was listed on the ICE website. According to the family members interviewed for this story, neither ICE nor Etowah ever reached out to tell them their loved ones were sick. The Etowah County Sheriff is Office did not respond to detailed questions fromandIn These Timesabout the jail is Covid-19precautions, the detainees’ allegations of retaliation and whether detainees had authorized the release of their medical information to family members.“The health, safety, and welfare of those in our care remain a top priority and concern for the agency,” a spokesperson for ICE wrote in an emailed statement.​“Since the outbreak of Covid-19, ICE has taken extensive steps to safeguard all detainees, staff and contractors, including: reducing the number of detainees in custody by placing individuals on alternatives to detention programs, suspending social visitation, incorporating social distancing practices with staggered meals and recreation times, and through the use of cohort ing and medical isolation.”ICE is own guidance on how its detention centers should respond to the Covid-19pandemicsays​“facilities must ensure that medical isolation is operationally distinct from administrative or disciplinary segregation, or any punitive form of housing.” And yet a previous investigation by found that a number of ICE detention centers have failed to adhere to this requirement. According to immigrants detained at Etowah, solitary confinement was used not only as leverage to discourage requests for testing, but to isolate people with Covid-19.andIn These Timesspoke with five men who tested positive for Covid-19while detained at Etowah. Each says he spent weeks in solitary. Shemoi Edwards developed Covid-19symptoms just days before Golding. At first, Edwards hoped to quietly sweat out whatever illness he had picked up, but he soon hobbled over to an officer and said he felt like he’d been hit by a truck. With a history of bronchitis and a recent diagnosis of sickle-cell trait, Edwards was too scared to ride out the illness on his own. Not long afterward, Edwards says, he was transferred to solitary. The men universally describe conditions in the solitary confinement unit as squalid. In their affidavits, many expressed distress that they no longer had access to mental health professionals, the law library, sunlight or fresh air.​“Civil detention have turned into torture,” Falaye Kourouma wrote. Bakhodir Madjitov, who was deported in September, wrote that there were cockroaches and flies in the unit. Golding wrote that he was fed uncooked frozen food and did not have access to drinking water because the sink in his cell did not flow properly.“No one wants to be treated how I am currently being treated,” Dawa Sherpa wrote in his affidavit.​“I fear that I may die here at Etowah County Detention Center.”One man says he spent21days in isolation. Another counted35days, a third54. Edwards says he was put in isolation June29and released July28—29days. Golding says he was in solitary confinement from July6to August28—53days.“We was getting the same treatment as [when] you get in trouble,” Edwards says.​“Even though it is probably a different word — it is​‘isolation’ — it is still a form of punishment that they are putting us in.”Edwards received the results from his coronavirus test July8, after he had been in solitary for more than a week; he was infected. One day later, Golding received the same bad news. In isolation, the men say, their phone access was limited. They could make calls only during a brief daily free period (no more than75minutes), which occurred on an irregular schedule. Sometimes, they say, it popped up in the middle of the night. Before he got sick, Edwards would speak with his mother and brother — Nickoy Edwards, a police officer in Flint, Mich. — a few times each week. Nickoy, after not hearing from his brother the first week of July, decided to call Etowah. After finally getting someone totalk to him, Nickoy says,​“that person answered and told me that they looked in the computer and they told me,​‘Shemoi is OK He is on the floor. And nothing is wrong with him.’”Nickoy believed the facility — at first. Then, weeks later, his brother finally called, telling Nickoy he was in solitary confinement and had the coronavirus. Nickoy called Etowah again.​“And they told me the same thing:​‘He is OK.’“I felt like they were not telling the truth,” Nickoy says.​“I was a little upset, you know, and concerned because, you know, I want him to be OK.”Their mother, Tyson Mills, also began to worry. When she was finally able to get through to Etowah, Mills explained who she was and asked about her son.​“Ma’am, he is OK,” Mills says she was told.​“He is alright. Nothing to worry about.” She says it was suggested her son did not have enough money on his commissary account to call.​“It was not nice,” Mills says.​“I was like breaking down in tears.”Golding is mother, Mervine Duhaney-Metzgar, says she called Etowah six times after not hearing from her son. At first, her calls were transferred around.​“And it happened that I called again, and they told me that everything is OK, and the re is no evidence of any illness being there. And I know that was not true,” she says.​“It was very disturbing as a mother.”Nicholas Phillips, Edwards is attorney, is not surprised by the lack of communication experienced by the families of these detained men.​“ICE is essentially kind of a closed book to us,” Phillips says.​“Etowah adds another level of complexity to it because Etowah is a county jail. And so it is not really run by ICE It is run by the Etowah County sheriff is department.”According to a2015agreement, Etowah is responsible for medical care inside the facility. But ICE is36-page guidance on how detention facilities should handle the pandemic does not mention how (or whether) facilities should notify family members of immigrants who get sick. Jessica Vosburgh, an attorney at the Adelante Alabama Worker Center, has represented immigrants seeking release from Etowah because of medical conditions that put them at risk during the pandemic.​“Because the jail is a healthcare provider, HIPAA applies to the m,” Vosburgh says of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.​“They have to respect patient privacy, which means not disclosing someone is medical information without their consent.”“When I need to get someone is medical records from Etowah, I need their signed consent and the n [the jail] can share it with me. And I think it would work similarly for a family member,” Vosburgh says.​“I do not think the re is anything in HIPAA that would require or allow people to lie or provide false information about someone is health. That is different than not disclosing, right? If the re is something they ca not disclose, they just have to say,​‘I ca not disclose.’ ”​“Even if someone is being imprisoned, they have the right to proper health, to proper medical attention,” Golding is mother, Duhaney-Metzgar, says. Even before Golding got sick, she had put in a complaint to the office of her congressperson, Representative Gregory Meeks (D-NY), asking for an investigation into how her son had been treated in ICE custody and requesting that he be transferred to a facility closer to home.“My office has repeatedly reached out to follow up on the case for Mrs. Metzgar is son Karim, and it has been months since their last reply,” Meeks says of ICE.​“ICE is response time is simply unacceptable, especially now during a pandemic when it is a matter of health and safety.”“I am so hurt deep down with what is going on,” Duhaney-Metzgar says.​“Behind it, I strongly know that it is an act of racism.”Phillips agrees. “[The Trump] administration, in my view, does not give a shit about detainees, immigration detainees,” he says.​“So how does it fit into the kind of larger discussion about racial justice and Black Lives Matter? I think it is an integral aspect of that. I mean, immigration detention is, in many ways, simply an extension of the kind of mass incarceration crisis that America has gone through.”The criminal justice system and the immigration system are deeply entangled, with harsh consequences for Black immigrants in particular. One out of every five people facing deportation because of a criminal conviction is Black. As of July2020, about half of the people detained by ICE at Etowah were Black, including Golding, Edwards and many of the other men interviewed for this story. Several are lawful permanent residents, but have lost their green cards and became​“deportable” after criminal convictions. Rather than accept deportation, many immigrants remain at Etowah for years as they fight their cases, often because they have nothing to go back to. Golding and Edwards were both born in Jamaica and came to the USs as children. Edwards, now30, arrived at15on a green card; most of his family now also lives in the USs. Golding, now36, arrived at9to reunite with his mother, who had fled an abusive relationship; he has never since been back to Jamaica. Before being incarcerated by ICE, Golding served a10-year sentence in federal prison. He and his family say they did not know there would be immigration consequences for his criminal conviction and that he has served his time.“I just want my son to get to come home,” Golding is mother says.​“Every one of us has the right to be forgiven.”Edwards was just shy of hitting one month in isolation when his third Covid-19test came back positive. Medical staff at Etowah had informed everyone that they would need two consecutive negative tests to leave solitary and return to the general population — so when a guard later woke Edwards up and told him to pack his things, Edwards was confused.​“I thought I was going back to my original unit,” he says. But a sergeant appeared and told him he was being released.“And I am like, OK!” Edwards says.​“So I just got to packing, you know, packed all my legal work, and I gave all my commissary away to everybody.”Phillips, Edwards is attorney, had won a case just two weeks earlier (on July16,2020) on behalf of Jervis Glenroy Jack, a lawful permanent resident. The federal government had sought to deport Jack because of a conviction on unlawful gun possession in New York state. The judge Jack saw in the2ndUS Circuit Court of Appeals, however, ruled the state-level gun conviction did not qualify as a deportable offense. Edwards is case was nearly identical to Jack is: Edwards, a longtime permanent resident, served two and a half years in prison on a similar conviction in New York. When Edwards was out on parole, immigration authorities took him into custody. Doing his own legal research, Edwards came across the Jack case in2019, the n reached out to Phillips, who agreed to represent him. After Phillips won the Jack case, he assumed the reversal would also help Edwards — but no one from ICE contacted Phillips, until moments before Edwards was released. Outside the immigration jail, Edwards asked the ICE officer for his ID and a Greyhound bus ticket.​“I am basically explaining to him, like, I am from New York. How are you going to bring me all the way down here and the n just tell me that you just gonna release me with no ID, no bus ticket, plane ticket, no nothing to get back to my family?” Edwards says.​“He was saying that because the way I won my case, he is not entitled to give me anything.”But the ICE officer did give Edwards something — directions to a Greyhound bus station a mile away. After that, Edwards was on his own. It was87degrees as Edwards started his walk down a four-lane highway, schlepping a heavy black garbage bag full of legal paperwork. He had about $100and a dead cell phone on him. He stopped at the first gas station he saw to buy a mask; the one he had at release, he says, was weeks old and filthy. When Edwards finally made it to the bus station, he asked about the next trip to New York. Two days, the person at the counter said. And Flint? A week. His best bet would be to keep walking up to Walmart, where he could buy a phone or a charger. At Walmart, Edwards started making calls: to Phillips, to his brother and to Shut Down Etowah, an organization that helps immigrants after release from ICE custody.​“I basically explained my situation, and they said,​‘We are gonna have somebody come and pick you up. Just stay at the Walmart.’ ”Shut Down Etowah booked Edwards on a flight to Detroit (out of Birmingham, Ala.) that same evening, and a volunteer accompanied Edwards to the airport. The airport was eerily empty, and Edwards was nervous, he says. He did not have any identification and worried he would be sent back to jail.“My main mindset was that I do not want to go through this in a different jail,” Edwards says.​“Even if it is for two, three hours, or even a day. I do not want to do that.”The representative from Shut Down Etowah did most of the talking, pulling different legal documents out of Edwards is bag to explain who he was. Somehow, he got on the plane.“I guess the [airport security] guy must have felt sorry for me,” Edwards says. Arriving in Michigan felt surreal to Edwards. Everyone he knew had grown up in the years he’d been away.​“They literally was babies when I left,” Edwards says. Edwards is mom calls every day to hear his voice, but he has not been able to see her. She lives in Massachusetts; Edwards still has not been able to get a driver is license. Edwards now works long hours at a factory and has decided to stay in Flint. He is started working with Shut Down Etowah and speaks with college students and other groups about his experience in immigration detention and the criminal justice system. After almost a decade behind bars, he does not believe anyone should be incarcerated, especially not for immigration violations.“You saying we incarcerate somebody for rehabilitation? I do not see it. They do not rehabilitate you. They just put you in there till your time up and be like,​‘Go.’ That is it,” Edwards says.​“I do not feel like we have the right to do that.”Edwards, Golding, and the other men interviewed for this story who contracted the virus while at Etowah say they are experiencing possible long-term symptoms of Covid-19: trouble breathing, exhaustion, gastrointestinal problems, and more.

As I often say, we are just one person and a small team trying to produce a holistic view on the news of the day. That makes reader feedback really valuable to us, because we get to hear from both American and international readers with a diverse set of views. Below, I have tried to pull together a wide range of challenging, thought-provoking and well-reasoned feedback about the things we have published in the newsletter. By sharing it, I hope you can get a glimpse of the range of responses that are out there to the issues we cover. As always, thanks for reading (and for writing in). Remember: you can reach us anytime by just replying to this email. A reader from Jerusalem responded to yesterday is edition on the clashes in Israel. Another reader wrote in about the conflict in Israel and said this:Michael from Sebastopol, California, responded to the story on Representative Liz Cheney. Kendra from Phoenix, Arizona, replied to the newsletter on the latest jobs report — and wanted to chime in about why people are not returning to the restaurant industry. Another reader, who asked to remain anonymous, wrote in about what they are seeing in the retail jobs market more generally. In response to a reader question about guns, I wrote that “advocates for a gun-free future tend to ignore the hundreds of thousands of self-defense incidents that occur every year thanks to firearms. The CDC estimates that there are between 500,000 and three million incidents every year where victims of crime use firearms to defend the mselves. That is one reason why gun ownership is so popular.”Julie from Brooklyn wrote in and said the following:Replying to the edition on Trump is Facebook ban, Jonathan from Seattle, Washington, said:Writing in about the ban on menthol cigarettes, a former tobacco executive made this point:I think one of the flaws about the messaging around systemic racism on the left is born out of the bubbles we all live in. Progressives are often talking to other progressives, which means they are learning and adopting language together that makes sense to them — or language that is commonly used in progressive circles. If you pick a random suburb in America and strike up a conversation about “equity” or microaggression, you are probably going to encounter some glassed over eyes. In my experience, it is not at all difficult totalk toolder, white, upper-middle class Americans about racism if it happens in their “language.” I have had plenty of conversations with people who fit that description and happily concede Black Americans have “gotten a raw deal,” or have been “boxed out of powerful positions at corporations,” or are facing the after-effects of generational wealth disparities and laws that gave huge advantages to white people just 50 years ago. Usually the friction comes when you press them on the advantages gained by being a part of that system. Nobody wants to be told what they have is not well-earned. This friction only grows when progressives describe an institution, system or country as “racist” because it produces racially unequal results. The fact that many Americans do not usually use the word racist in this way (but instead as you defined it: open hatred of a group of people) results in a great disconnect. One of my regrets from covering the Tim Scott issue was that I could have tried to preface the conversation with definitions of racism or systemic racism, which is often helpful. As basic as it is, some people are just using the same word to mean two different things. Asking people, or defining it yourself, would probably be useful in the conversations you are having. As I often say in politics, personal experience always prevails. All the data and studies in the world can fail to convince someone that there are, say, disparate outcomes in how job applications are received with minority-sounding names. But if someone can talk about their experience as a person of color being interviewed or applying for a job, and the tiny clues they pick up on about the biases of the person interviewing the m, that is a more compelling story. What I often see in these debates is one side throwing links and data at the other side, trying to compel them to abandon a belief they might have come to from their own life experience. But if you center the self, and talk from your own first-person experience, that is a different ball game. For example: I could argue that there was a Harvard study showing police are more antagonistic when pulling over Black drivers. That might be a somewhat compelling data point for a person who does not think there is any discrimination in policing. But if I could compare my own experiences being pulled over as a driver with the time I was pulled over while a Black colleague was driving, and explain the differences I witnessed in how the police acted, that is going to be a much more convincing story. Ultimately, if your goal is to move someone is position on an issue, any issue, giving them space to explain why they think the way they do and the n centering your own personal experience (rather than an article you read in Vox) is a really productive way to have a conversation. It is also why I so often share my own personal anecdotes in Tangle, because I think that may help readers understand why I feel the way I do — and that allows more space for them to consider the supporting evidence I may bring to an argument.

About five weeks earlier, John Havron was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer, which ravaged his body. The day had come for him to leave his house for hospice. But it was tough going. Havron is wife, son and stepson kept asking him — how do you feel? Are you ready to go? Is it time?Confused and slightly disoriented, Havron could only say, “OK.”“Dad was struggling. He was out of it,” his son, Todd Havron, said about that day in 2018. “He could not really vocalize. It was hard to see somebody so strong be so scared.”After about an hour, someone said, “Do we want to call Felice?”Felice Apolinsky — longtime program director of Nashville cancer support organization Gilda is Club — became close friends with John Havron nine years earlier. That is when Havron showed up at Gilda is Club because his first wife had been diagnosed with cancer. With kindness and love, Apolinsky walked him through his wife is illness and death in 2010. About eight years later, Havron himself got cancer. And Apolinsky walked beside Havron and his relatives again. She showed up to his house just 15 minutes after she got the call. Everyone inside relaxed as soon as she walked in.“It took about two minutes,” Todd Havron said. “He looked at her, said her name, and said, ‘Yeah, I am ready to go.’”Apolinsky has been building that kind of trust with people since arriving at Gilda is Club 22 years ago. In June, Apolinsky, 56, announced her retirement to spend more time with her 87-year-old father, who died July 29. But the curly-haired, pint-sized “angel on earth” will retire anyway. Apolinsky will be honored Sept. 3 at Gilda is Club isannual Red Door Bash fundraiser, a virtual event this year. She leaves behind a legacy of helping thousands of people with cancer — and loved ones of people with cancer — with big hugs, a quick smile, an open heart and quiet competence. Of those thousands, Apolinsky perhaps grew closest to Havron, who entrusted her with a sacred duty just before he died two years ago. The roots of that relationship started two decades ago when Apolinsky, the n a 34-year-old social worker, practically forced herself onto the staff of a brand new Gilda is Club. She’d been working with Nashville adolescents and others. In 1996, Apolinsky — just months after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer — found herself at an organizational meeting for a Nashville chapter of New York-based Gilda is Club, named for comedian Gilda Radner, who died of cancer in 1989.“I immediately fell in love with the mission,” said Apolinsky, who connected strongly with the group is emphasis on building a community of those dealing with cancer. She sent Nashville Gilda is Club founder Sandy Towers a 14-page pitch and convinced Towers to go to lunch with her.“She had a better handle on the mission that I even did,” Towers said. “I sat there in utter amazement.”For “minimal pay,” Apolinsky enthusiastically started support groups for those with cancer and for relatives and friends of those with cancer. She also launched nutrition and cooking classes, grief groups, programming for children of people with cancer and more; they are free for participants, supported by donations. Apolinsky and other staffers help Gilda is Club members walk through the sadness of death, but they are quick to point out there is much joy celebrated as well. Much of the club is programming teaches members how to live life after battling cancer. Apolinsky has gone to hundreds of cancer-free anniversary celebrations, birthday parties, baby showers, weddings and parties. Her friends say her sense of humor sometimes is downright goofy. Michael Dinwiddie, Havron is stepson, called Apolinsky “this wonderfully strong yet kooky person.""The real gift, friends and club members say, is her ability to balance those parts of her personality and to walk through endless days of super-charged emotions.“I am always amazed at the resilience she has to get up every morning and put herself out the re,” Towers said. And, Apolinsky has a way of making deep connections with members from their first interactions, several participants say. Katherine Sjoblom, 54, of East Nashville, said she called the club 10 years ago, distraught, after finding out she had bone marrow cancer.""What do I tell my young kids?"" she remembered asking. A staff member put the call through to Apolinsky, who calmly and kindly answered Sjoblom is questions.“I felt heard, and I felt like someone understood this is a really horrible moment in my life,” Sjoblom said, voice cracking as tears spill from her eyes.“How many times has she given this advice, and yet she still made me feel important?”Apolinsky shows the same compassion and respect to volunteers and fellow staff members.“Felice is genuine, caring, supportive, inclusive and authentic, and what she shows you is from the heart,” said volunteer Dana Davis, 53, a social worker who runs support groups at Gilda is Club. “I consider Felice a warm hug. And I do not say that about many people.”Apolinsky remembered that John Havron came into Gilda is Club for the first time in 2009, devastated that his wife of 40 years, his childhood sweetheart, had brain cancer. Havron stood out to her.“He had sparkly eyes and a beautiful smile, even when he was weeping when he introduced himself,” she said. Havron is wife died eight months or so after that, and Havron kept coming back for grief groups and for support.“It was a really dark time for him,” Apolinsky said. “His biggest cheerleader had died, and he was going home to an empty house. The nights were very long and very lonely.”Apolinsky started to call Havron regularly. She saw him in her office for informal one-on-ones and encouraged him to do volunteer work. The two formed a strong bond, and eventually Havron emerged from the darkness. He started to date again. Havron brought his girlfriend, and eventual wife, Belinda Dinwiddie Havron, to Gilda is Club to meet Apolinsky.“I was absolutely terrified to meet her, much more so than I was to meet his children,” Dinwiddie Havron said. “I knew she was a very important part of his life. He knows Felicia and trusts her. What if she says it is too soon or she does not approve?”Apolinsky approved, and she helped Havron walk through feelings of guilt and disloyalty toward his first wife. Two years ago, Havron called Apolinsky in her office to tell her he had cancer. The prognosis was bleak. She sat in stunned silence for a few minutes before the tears came.“My heart literally hurt,” she said. After Havron went to Alive Hospice, Apolinsky checked in or visited every day until he died three weeks later. During one visit, Havron asked his family to leave the room so he could speak to Apolinsky privately. No one hesitated. Havron the n dictated affirmations for each of his children, grandchildren and stepchildren, while Apolinsky clumsily typed into her iPhone notes app. He spoke of one grandchild is spunk and personality, another is grace, another is tenacity. He pointed out one child is sense of humor, another is reliability. Havron is message for his wife: “You are my everything.”Days later, Apolinsky read the affirmations aloud during Havron is funeral, looking each of his loved ones in the eyes as she read his final messages to them.“It went from honoring my stepfather to him honoring us,” Havron is stepson Michael Dinwiddie said. “I realized the n even more how dear Felice was to my stepfather. Her giving that speech was probably the most appropriate thing.”Apolinsky called it “one of the most important things I had ever done.""“What a gift for each person to know what they meant to him and what he loved most about them and what he wished for them.”:gildasclubmiddletn.org:e.givesmart.com:gildasclubmiddletn.org/ways-to-give/volunteer",2,2,Tennessean

Accordingto the Loudoun Times, the bill passed despite Republican objections that the bill would minimize acts of terror targeted at police as law enforcement units nationwide bear the brunt of historic animosity and anarchic calls to de fund their departments.

143,How the LAPD and Palantir Use Data to Justify Racist Policing,-8.33,42.0,https://theintercept.com/2021/01/30/lapd-palantir-data-driven-policing/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-30,25,"The killing ofGeorge Floyd last May sparked renewed scrutiny of data-driven policing. As protests raged around the world,1,400 researchers signed an open letter calling on their colleagues to stop collaborating with police on algorithms, and cities likeSanta Cruz,New Orleans, andOaklandvariously banned predictive policing, facial recognition, and voice recognition. But elsewhere, police chiefs worked to deepen partnerships with tech companies, claiming that the answer to systemic bias and racism was simply more data. In her new book, “Predict and Surveil: Data, Discretion, and the Future of Policing,” sociologist Sarah Brayne slays that assumption with granular detail. An assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin, Brayne did months of fieldwork at the Los Angeles Police Department and other law enforcement agencies in the area, tagging along as cops used software from Palantir, PredPol, and other companies. She learned that software vendors routinely show up at the department to peddle their wares, like pharmaceutical representatives visiting doctors’ offices. She noted how police used an automated license plate reader mounted outside an emergency room to build out networks of victims’ associates. A sergeant explained that family or friends would often drop off an injured person and the n speed away. With the automated license plate reader, he said, police could use plate numbers to determine who else was connected to the victim, even if there was no other evidence linking them to a crime. Riding along in department helicopters, Brayne saw how data was used to justify extreme measures. In order to get a reduction in crime in one division, police concluded that they had to fly helicopters overhead 51 times per week. They often increased that to 80 to 90 flyovers for good measure, meaning that many residents’ days were regularly interrupted by the noise of buzzing choppers. The cops seemed to register the intrusion. They dubbed the copters “ghetto birds.”Image: Courtesy Oxford University PressFor years, scholars and activists have critiqued the algorithms used in data-driven policing, arguing that they merely tech wash bias by making sloppy investigative work seem objective. Leading the charge in Los Angeles is theStop LAPD Spying Coalition. Through public records requests, the group is activists have obtained documents on police use of data analytics, and in 2018, they successfully pushed the city is Office of the Inspector General to audit the department is use of technology. “Surveillance is basically the tip of the policing knife,” said Hamid Khan, a co-leader of the coalition. “When you look at policing and the history of policing, from our vantage point, it is not about public safety when it comes to nonwhite folks. It is about the content to cause harm.” Big data, he added, simply gives police more ways to do that. Brayne is contribution is showing exactly how data is distorted in the hands of police. “Most sociological research on criminal justice has focused on those who are being policed,” she told The Intercept. “I very deliberately wanted to flip the lens to focus on those doing the surveil ling — on the police the mselves.”Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, a law professor at American University and author of “The Rise of Big Data Policing: Surveillance, Race, and the Future of Law Enforcement,” said that Brayne is work is an unflinching look at what happens when people in power use emerging technologies. “Her book is a completely original inside look at the development of big data surveillance at the height of the first generation of its adoption,” he said. “Sarah has been given access to the reality of big data policing in a way that no one else has — and probably, because of her success, no one else ever will.”LAPD Captain Elizabeth Morales shows a printed map of predicted crime hot spots in the Foothill Division of Los Angeles, Calif., on Monday, October 24, 2016. Brayne first embedded with the department in 2013 as a 27-year-old graduate student. It was a critical moment for policing tech, and the LAPD and other departments were ramping up their use of technology. The LAPD had signed on with Palantir Gotham, which merges data from crime and arrest reports, automated license plate readers, rap sheets, and other sources. The department also had a contract with PredPol, which generates “boxes,” or hot spots, where property crimes like burglaries and auto theft are predicted to occur. A third program, Operation LASER, which stands for Los Angeles’ Strategic Extraction and Restoration program, used a points-based system, called a LASER score, to evaluate the risk that individuals posed. In Brayne is first interview, a captain boasted that the LAPD was at the forefront of technology adoption, detailing how software that had been developed for counterterrorism work was helping the department ward off future crimes. Afterward, Brayne asked to go on a ride-along with an officer. That trip revealed a more complicated picture. Instead of pulling up PredPol is software on the laptop mounted to his dashboard, the cop worked with a printout of PredPol is hot spots. He explained that the department is in-car lap tops had trouble loading even standard internet browsers. So much for technological wizardry. Brayne and the officer took a break to eat In-N-Out burgers under a highway overpass, where they watched his colleagues bust up a grow operation and drag marijuana plants onto a flatbed truck. Then when they drove to a new location, Brayne noticed that the officer typed in his address manually, rather than let the car is automatic vehicle tracker register his location. The union opposed officers being tracked, he explained. While predictive policing systems had caught average citizens in an opaque dragnet, police grew squeamish when the technology was turned back on them. The notion that better technology can fix policing dates to at least the early 20th century. Back the n, police departments were closely tied to city government political machines. Arguing that a data-driven approach would make policing more professional, reformers introduced tactics drawn from military operations, including signal boxes, telephone kiosks, and pin mapping. The militarization of police accelerated during the 1960s and has continued to the present day, to the point where even departments in placid American suburbs now have armored vehicles, night vision viewers, and bayonets.“That is a very visible manifestation of the militarization of policing,” said Brayne. “But something that is more invisible is this creep of surveillance software into the daily operations of policing.”A Los Angeles County Sheriff is Department is patrol car, outfitted with a computer system developed for the battlefield by a military contractor, is seen in Los Angeles on November 16, 2011. After 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security gave state and local police $35 billion in grants, a portion of which was spent on developing data infrastructure. The infusion of cash created needs where there had been none. Police chiefs realized that the data they collected for Homeland Security could also be used for regular policing. In Los Angeles, some officials came to believe that predictive analytics and big data might also solve the department is many problems. The LAPD had been racked by a stream of high-profile scandals, most infamously the 1991 beating of Rodney King. In 2001, the Department of Justice imposed a consent decree, a court order mandating that the department conduct regular audits and capture more data on officers and crimes. (A spokesperson for the LAPD declined to comment for this article.)A key figure behind the shift toward predictive policing was William Bratton, who brought the data management system COMPSTAT to New York City before becoming the chief of the LAPD in 2002. Bratton oversaw the LAPD is effort to merge various streams of data. One result was Operation LASER, which was funded with nearly a million dollars from the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance. When they came into contact with someone who seemed suspicious, officers filled out a card with the person is name, address, physical characteristics, vehicle information, gang affiliation, and criminal history. Each new point of contact with police earned a person one additional point. “There are a lot of chickenshit violations you can stop someone for,” a sergeant explained to Brayne during a ride-along. “Yesterday, this individual might have got stopped because he jaywalked. Today, he might have got stopped because he did not use his turn signal or whatever the case might be. So that is two points.” The sergeant went on to argue that even such minor violations could help police predict the next crime because, taken together, they show “who is out on the streets.”Such a system means, of course, that individuals in overpoliced neighborhoods can easily get caught up in a vicious cycle where they are, as Brayne writes, “more likely to be stopped, thus increasing their point value, justifying their increased surveillance, and making it more likely that they will be stopped again in the future.” But some of the administrators whom Brayne encountered were apparently less interested in accuracy than they were in amassing more records. The goal, one captain told her, was simply to get people “in the system”: to capture larger and larger amounts of data on seemingly harmless individuals in the hope that the data would help solve a crime later on. Once an officer had a person in the system, they could set an alert to automatically track changes in that person is profile. Brayne watched Los Angeles police fill out cards for Operation LASER and noted that they often listed the people who were with a person when they were stopped. She calls this a “secondary surveillance network.” You do not actually need to have contact with police to be caught up in the system; you just need to have had contact with someone who did. Similarly, Brayne learned that images captured by automated license plate readers sometimes showed the faces of people who were stopped with a person of interest. Those people too became data. When Brayne raised the issue of possible legal constraints around the rampant collection and sharing of information, an employee in the Los Angeles County Chief Information Office declared bluntly, “Consent is anachronistic.”In some cases, even being the subject of a query can boost someone is suspiciousness. Brayne watched one detective search a national database for a juvenile. He remarked that he could see how many times other users had queried the same name. He claimed that the feature had helped police catch criminals because it told them other officers had suspected the same individual. When Brayne asked why that was useful, he replied, “Just because you have not been arrested does not mean you have not been caught.”Decades of research and years of cell phone videos have shown, of course, that police regularly target people who have not committed crimes. On ride-alongs, Brayne watched cops run the plates of law-abiding drivers stopped at traffic lights, just in case the numbers turned up a record. But the anecdote underscores how thoroughly big data reinforces existing police biases. One captain claimed, “It is just math.”A banner displays Palantir sign age during the company is initial public offering in front of the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 30, 2020, in New York. In Brayne is fieldwork, Palantir is technology came in for special praise. “They catch bad guys during every training class,” one sergeant told her. A captain rhapsodized about the platform is constant addition of new data sets, marveling at the addition of foreclosure information: “I am so happy with how big Palantir got.” Another said of Palantir, “We have dumped hundreds of thousands [of dollars] into that. They are so responsive and flexible about what we want. They are great. They are going to take over the world. I promise you, they are going to take over the world.”But up close, the software was only as good as the people maintaining and using it. To make sense of Palantir Gotham is data, police often need input from engineers, some of whom are provided by Palantir. At one point in her research, Brayne watched a Palantir engineer search 140 million records for a hypothetical man of average build driving a black four-door sedan. The engineer narrowed those results to 2 million records, the n to 160,000, and finally to 13 people, before checking which of those people had arrests on their records. At various points in the search, he made assumptions that could easily throw off the result — that the car was likely made between 2002 and 2005, that the man was heavy-set. Brayne asked what happened if the system served up a false positive. “I do not know,” the engineer replied. There were dissenters. Some of the people tasked with implementing data-driven policing at the LAPD complained to Brayne that the software did not work as advertised. One person working in information technology said, “Our command staff is easily distracted by the latest and greatest shiny object.” Data integration was uneven. Some divisions had certain software, while others did not. Another employee told Brayne that the detective case management system was “sort of like a pimple,” adding, “they just, like, stuck it on to p.”When management was out of the room, police were honest about their doubts. “Looks bitching, but it is worthless,” one sergeant told Brayne of the LAPD is data analysis infrastructure, which is housed at the department is Real-Time Analysis and Critical Response Division. One group of officers bought their captain a Ouija board to mock his faith in algorithms. A captain told Brayne that person-based predictive policing was “a civil liberties nightmare” and that he would never adopt it. (His division adopted it after he left.)Activists who have fought for years against department use of technology told The Intercept that Brayne is work is useful — but only to a point. “It was very helpful to uncover and learn about the extensive amounts of stuff that LAPD was doing,” said Jamie Garcia, an organizer with Stop LAPD Spying. “But the n what?” In general, she added, she is tired of academics treating surveillance like a problem to observe and evaluate. “The information goes back to the ivory tower, and the ivory tower has this conversation with the mselves about what they think about it instead of that information being brought directly to the community.”Brayne said that she hopes her work can be useful to a broad variety of people. “Transparency is the first step towards accountability,” she said. “It is impossible to hold an individual or organization accountable if you do not know what they are doing.”Forrest Stuart, a sociologist at Stanford who studies policing, said that her book is essential at a moment when anti-racism protests have prompted some law enforcement officials to further embrace technology as a means for reducing bias. “Some of the most popular proposed solutions to the over-policing and over-incarceration of black and brown communities have involved new technologies,” he wrote in an email. “There is a sense that if we could just design a good enough computer program, we could deploy police more fairly and reduce, or perhaps even eliminate, unwarranted disparities in criminal justice. Brayne is book makes us take real pause and recognize the faults in this techno-optimist dream.”The LAPD ended its contract with PredPol last April,citing financial constraints brought on by the pandemic. Operation LASER ended in 2019. But a range of othercompanies, including heavyweights likeAmazonandMicrosoft, have moved into the space nationally, and a guidebook published by the LAPD last year makes clear that big data will continue to prominently figure in policing in Los Angeles. Palantir, meanwhile, has lately expanded its access to data by moving into coronavirus tracking and vaccine safety analysis. Last year, the company broker ed lucrative contracts with the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. It went public in September. Since the n, its stock prices have more than tripled. ",1,1,The Intercept
144,"In Dramatic Policy Shift, Biden Withdraws US Support for Saudi “Offensive Operations” in Yemen",-7.0,47.33,https://theintercept.com/2021/02/04/biden-saudi-yemen-arms/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-04,25,"In his first major foreign policy address, President Joe Biden announced on Thursday that he would end American support for Saudi and United Arab Emirates-led “offensive operations” in Yemen, echoing a promise he made on the campaign trail in 2019. Speaking at the State Department, Biden told diplomats that he would prioritize diplomatic solutions to the conflict and appointed, as a special envoy, one of the department is top Middle East experts. He also announced support for a cease-fire and an effort to restart long-stalled peace talks.“This war has to end,” Biden said. “And to underscore our commitment, we are ending all American support for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant arms sales.”The move signaled a dramatic shift in US support for Saudi Arabia, a move that has long been urged by progressive activists. Under President Donald Trump, Congresspassedresolutions blocking certain arms sales and directing the US to end its role in the hostilities, but Trumpvetoedthem. One of the primary backers of the vetoed resolutions, Representative Ro Khanna, D-Calif., told The Intercept by phone that Biden is announcement was a victory. “This is now a decisive step and really what the war powers resolution was calling for, so I am very pleased,” Khanna said. Asked if Congress is job was done, Khanna said he thought the legislature still had a role to play in supporting diplomatic efforts and reversing last-minutepolicy changes by the Trump administration. The Biden administration had previously placed a temporary freeze on billions of dollars in arms sales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as well as saying that it would review the transfer of advanced military hardware, including air-ground munitions, that the Trump administration sought to advance over the objections of Congress. Saudi Arabia and the UAE launched their intervention in Yemen in March 2015, after an Iranian-backed rebel group known as the Houthis took over the capital and forced out Yemen is internationally backed president. The US has supported the intervention, first under President Barack Obama and the n under Trump, with weapons sales, intelligence, and logistical support, even after Saudi air strikes increasingly targeted civilian sites like hospitals and schools. The Biden administration has not yet announced operational details of the move or clarified what they meant by “offensive operations.” In his address, Biden said that the US would continue to help defend Saudi Arabia from drone and missile attacks, some of which have come from Yemen and have led the Saudis to claim that they are pursuing the war in self-defense. An administration official declined to share operational details of what the cutoff meant but pointed to the fact that the Biden administration had previously announced they were “reviewing several arms sales to ensure they are in line with our strategic goals, including ending the war.”Briefing reporters on Thursday morning, national security adviser Jake Sullivan said that the prohibition would extend “to the types of offensive operations that have perpetuated a civil war in Yemen that has led to a humanitarian crisis,” but would not result in the US halting its own operations against Al Qaeda in the country. Kate Kizer — policy director with the progressive group Win Without War, which has lobbied to end US support for the intervention — told The Intercept by phone that understanding the details of the distinction are important because the Saudis have frequently claimed that they were acting defensively.“The coalition has tried repeatedly in the past to say that air strikes in residential areas in Yemen have been ‘defensive’ operations because they were responding to a ballistic missile strike,” Kizer said. “So it is really important to define what that means.”Biden is call is a hard won-victory for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, much of which had urged Obama and Trump to end US support for the war. Khanna, along with Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had repeatedly introduced various measures to stop US support for the war, all of which initially failed in Congress. Khanna told The Intercept that a turning point on Capitol Hill was the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based Saudi dissident who was brutally killed by Saudi agents, like lyon the orders of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — who is also a key architect behind the Yemen war.“When we started, there was such a strong US relationship with the Saudis that it was very hard to break through,” Khanna said. “And it took a lot of work in the House; we were taking on our own leadership in the beginning. But the n after Khashoggi is murder,things changed.”Kizer told The Intercept that building support for ending the war has been a long process among progressive activists, and that it was important to move the discussion beyond a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. “I think what really has been the game changer over the years is building a public education campaign that really changed the terms of the debate about what is happening in Yemen,” Kizer said. “When we started in 2015, it was totally framed through the lens of Iran, and the détente with Saudi Arabia and the Iran nuclear deal. Very little was said about Yemen.",2,1,The Intercept

148,"In Italy, I have Rediscovered the Power of Three Types of Praye...",-1.0,35.0,https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2020/march-web-only/italy-covid-19-prayer-coronavirus-psalms-lament-intercessio.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2020-03-26,25,"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how Italian Christians pray and live their faith, amid a nation reeling from more than 10,000 deaths—the highest tally in the world—among 92,400confirmedcases, second only to the USs [as of March 28]. During lockdown, we can no longer gather on Sundays or in home groups. Social gatherings, travel, and weddings are suspended, as are most businesses. If someone is caught outside their home without a valid reason, there can be a heavy fine. But this season of exile has helped us discover three facets of prayer we often neglect in times of abundance. Psalms of lament often felt hyperbolic a month ago. For example, Asaph is complaint that God has made his people “drink tears by the bowlful” could seem overdramatic; David is cry to God of “How long will you hide your face from me?” was a distant feeling. But as humanity struggles to contain a fear- and anxiety-provoking pandemic, lament feels newly relevant to all of us. In March 2020, Psalm 44 sounds pitch perfect:Awake, Lord! Why do you sleep?Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever. Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression?We are brought down to the dust;our bodies cling to the ground. Rise up and help us;rescue us because of your unfailing love. Few Western Christians have experienced poverty, injustice, or persecution. Consequently, our worship usually reflects the moods of resourceful individuals in times of prosperity and peace: composed and mainstream. We do suffer individually; however, seldom is our corporate worship fueled by protest and mourning before God. Lament is suffering turned into prayer. It is the worship of people who feel out of balance and out of place. Historically, it has been the prayer of minorities, the poor, and the persecuted—of Chinese pastors in prison cells and of black slaves singing of justice and Christ is coming. If lament felt foreign to most Italians a month ago, pastors have found eerie echoes of biblical stories in what is currently taking place in the country. “To see wives who ca not perform rites or bid farewell to their dying husbands reminds me of how Jesus was hastily buried and women returned to the tomb to anoint his body,” Gaetano di Francia, director of the Union of Christian Biblical Churches in Italy, told me. “Their lack of closure will produce a deeper grief.”The language of lament may prove to be one of the bittersweet lessons Christians learn from this crisis. It can help believers unlearn a spirituality of the center and learn a spirituality of the margins (as pastor Abraham Choremindsus). Never have I spent so much of my time in prayer interceding for others. I am ashamed to confess that, in the past, I have often told people, “I will pray for you,” but the n forgot to do it. But now that the virus ravages Italy, I have been moved by images of overworked doctors and people lying in makeshift hospitals. A member of our church fell gravely sick, but the emergency room turned him away because it is fielding so many cases of the new coronavirus. I ca not meet or lay hands on him due to the current national lockdown, but I have been praying for his recovery. As a church, we have prayed for doctors, created a common fund to help those in economic need, and fasted for our country. The coronavirus crisis has united Italian evangelicals, who observed a National Day of Prayer this past Sunday [March 22]. “Pentecostals, Reformed, Wesleyans, Baptists, Congregationalists, and others met at the feet of the Lord, united by the Holy Spirit,” Giacomo Ciccone, president of the Italian Evangelical Alliance, told me.“It is as if God prepared leaders and denominations around the country to come together in prayer for the nation and for the church,” Leonardo de Chirico, the alliance is vice president, told me. “It was the easiest event to organize. Nobody needed convincing; all were already on fire for it.”Mila Palozzi, a pastor at my congregation, Hopera Church in Rome, agrees that evangelicals desire to come together.“In the Promised Land, Israel understood itself as a collection of tribes but in exile as one nation,” she told me. “So does Italy: this crisis is bringing churches and tribes together to pray as one body for our country.”It is a foretaste of the spirit of unity and intercession spreading around the world. For example, this coming Sunday [March 29] the World Evangelical Alliance will convene a Global Day of Fasting and Prayer. However, the news is so bleak and the suffering so global these days that we can feel overwhelmed in prayer. How can my prayers possibly meet this moment? Our honest response may be, “Lord, I am dumbfounded. I do not know what to say.”When I watched army trucks driving corpses to be cremated because there is no longer space in cemeteries in parts of Italy, I was speechless. But to wait upon the Lord is valid. To put our wordless trust in him is a legitimate prayer. When Paul writes about our present weakness and suffering, he adds:“We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. And he who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God is people in accordance with the will of God.” (Rom. 8:26-27, NIV)When words fail us, we can be still and know that God is God.“As a family, we have chosen to fill our silences full of doubts with the secure promises of God,” Stefano Picciani, a preacher at Stadera Church in Milan, told me. “Asaph is statement of trust in Psalm 73—‘Yet I am always with you’—provides words for our prayers.”We rightly long to return to normalcy and corporate worship. Imagine the victory parties, and the joining of hands!When this pandemic will be defeated, many will resonance with the sense of relief of Psalm 126 (“Those who sow with tears will reap with songs of joy.”) and the joy of Psalm 150 (“Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.”). But alongside celebrations, we will be wise to remember the prayers we uttered in this time of sickness. May this pandemic humble our hearts and teach us the prayers of the weak, the concerned, and the speechless.

149,"In Promoting New Nuclear Power, Biden-Harris Back Fiction Over Science",-27.67,31.33,https://www.counterpunch.org/2020/11/13/in-promoting-new-nuclear-power-biden-harris-back-fiction-over-science/,https://adfontesmedia.com/counterpunch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,25,"Nuclear fuel assemblies being inspected before entering a pressurized water reactor in the USs – Public DomainAlthough possibly a sad comment on his predecessors, incoming US president, Joe Biden, is offering the most progressive climate policy so far of any who have previously held his position. As Paul Gipe points out in his recent blog, theBiden-Harris climate pl anuses the word “revolution” right in the headline — a bit of a departure from the usual cautious rhetoric of the centrist-controlled Democratic Party. But ‘revolution’ is proceeded by two words which let us know we are still lingering in conservative ‘safe’ territory. They call it a “clean energy revolution”, which Gipe rightly refers to as “focus-group shopped terminology.” He goes on:”Clean energy is a term forged by Madison Avenue advertising mavens in the crucible of focus groups. It ‘polls well,’ as they say. It means one thing to one interest group, something else to another. So it is perfect for politics in America.“To environmentalists, it means wind and solar energy, often only those two forms of renewable energy, and sometimes only solar. It also means good times to the coal and nuclear industry. (Ever hear of ‘clean coal’?)“So clean energy is one of those misleading words that party leaders and, importantly, fund raisers can use to elicit money from donors of all stripes. Why say renewable energy, when you want to raise money from the coal and nuclear industries?”The Biden-Harris energy plan hits all the right notes in its opening paragraphs, focusing on a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and emphasizing infrastructure, international collaboration and the protection of poor communities of color, who suffer the most harm from unfettered polluters. As we know from his public statements, Biden will bring the US straight back into the Paris Agreement on climate and sees the climate crisis as the “number one issue facing humanity”. The Paris Agreement is not enough, but the US absence weakens it further. Still on the right track, the Biden-Harris climate plan looks to the rights and wellbeing of workers and jobs creation. It will adhere to “science, not fiction” and recognizes that energy efficiency has an essential role to play. And the n it goes very badly — if predictably — wrong. In the section entitled “Biden is Year One Legislative Agenda on Climate Change,” the document proclaims “We have to get rid of the old way of thinking,” the n reverts precisely to that, clinging on to nuclear power as a necessary component of its plan. So the Biden-Harris agenda lists small modular reactors under its “game-changing technologies.” In a way, that is correct. Diverting money into small modular reactors be game-changing. It will put us firmly on the road to climate failure. The good news is that nuclear power does not play much of a role in the Biden-Harris plan. But the bad news is that, when it comes to nuclear power, the Biden camp has indeed chosen fiction over science. A bullet point called “Identify the future of nuclear energy” reverts right back to the failed Obama “all of the above” approach to “look at all low- and zero-carbon technologies”, instead of recognizing that nuclear power, a failed 20th century technology, does not have a future. As Amory Lovinspoints out, this “low-carbon” approach is a perpetual mistake made by politicians and seized on and influenced by the nuclear industry — to look only at carbon savings, and not at cost and time as well.“Costly options save less carbon per dollar than cheaper options,” Lovins writes. “Slow options save less carbon per year than faster options. Thus even a low- or no-carbon option that is too costly or too slow will achievable climate protection. Being carbon-free does not establish climate-effectiveness.”When you look at the precipitating drop in renewable energy costs versus the ever soaring nuclear ones; when you examine how you can reduce more carbon emissions faster and more cheaply with renewables than nuclear; and when you observe the real life examples of countries whose carbon reductions are greater after investing in renewables rather than clinging onto nuclear; the n the only reason to include nuclear power in a climate plan is political. The Biden-Harris platform will likely continue to listen to the old school. After all, it is who they know. But if they really want that revolution, they should open their eyes to the reality on the ground. A recent article in the Socialist magazine,pointed to an example in the Netherlands where a decision was made not to expand an existing nuclear power plant and instead build two offshore wind farms. Although the Fukushima disaster slightly influenced the decision, at the end of the day, as the article pointed out, it was all about “the law of value”, in other words, money. “With the declining cost of renewable energy, nuclear power simply does not make economic sense,” it said. In an important new study out of Sussex University in the UK —Differences in carbon emissions reduction between countries pursuing renewables versus nuclear power— the researchers concluded that choosing nuclear crowds out renewables and vice versa. This means that continuing to use old uneconomical nuclear plants — or investing in new ones — actually hampers renewable energy development, and the reby progress on climate change, and results in smaller carbon reductions and at a much higher cost. The study notes that, “per dollar invested, the modularity of renewables projects offers quicker emissions reductions than do large-scale, delay-prone nuclear projects,” the same point made by Lovins. And, as the study also says, the more we use renewables, the more improved their performance, exactly the opposite of nuclear which sees “rising costs or reduced performance with the next generation of technology.”This last is an important point for the Biden-Harris energy team to note. By including so-called new nuclear, they are dooming the mselves to wasting both time and money better spent focused on renewables. Small modular reactors will not, as their plan asserts, come in at “half the construction cost of to day is reactors.” They will be far more expensive in relation to the electricity they would eventually produce. And of course they would arrive too late, and in too small a quantity and generate too little — and very expensive — electricity to make any difference to climate change at all. Biden-Harris must look at empirical data, not listen to spin doctors and establishment cronies who will keep them anchored to the status quo, thus deferring the very energy revolution they claim they will lead.

150,Voting rights hit the Supreme Court.,-0.67,44.0,https://www.readtangle.com/p/voting-rights-supreme-court,https://adfontesmedia.com/tangle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-02,16,"Plus, a question about migrant facilities. The Supreme Court is voting rights battle. Plus, a question about migrant facilities. Voting rights. Today, the Supreme Court will begin hearing arguments i na case in Arizona that could shape the future of voting rights for decades. The case challenges two Arizona laws: one that calls for a ballot to be thrown out if it was cast at the wrong precinct, and another that bans the collection and delivery of ballots by third parties (also known as “ballot harvesting,” which is permitted in 24 states and the District of Columbia). The plaintiffs, supported by Democrats, are arguing that these rules discriminate and infringe upon the rights of minorities, especially Native Americans, Black and Latino voters, by making it more difficult for them to vote. The state, supported by Republicans, argues that they are neutral laws that codify reasonable ways to secure elections. While the case is specific to Arizona, it could have monumental national implications. Up until 2013, the Voting Rights Act required states with a history of discrimination to get permission from the courts or Justice Department before changing its voting rules. This was called a “preclearance test,” dictated by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. But the Supreme Court suspended that requirement in 2013 after it ruled that Congress had not properly updated the criteria to determine whether a state was discriminating or not. Without the pre clearance requirement, states like Arizona began implementing laws that would have otherwise needed to clear the Justice Department and the courts first. Now standing in the way of these two Arizona laws is Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which says a state cannot pass a law “which results in a denial or abridgment” of the right to vote based on race. In the past, Section 2 has been applied to cases of gerrymandering, or “vote dilution.” This time, the plaintiffs are attempting to apply it to “vote denial.”Given that the court is expected to interpret Section 2 in this case, its ruling could set up dozens of similar, sweeping rulings across the country, and impact how other states legislate their elections.“The specific issues in the case are narrow, but to resolve the m, the court has to address for the first time a question of major consequence: how the Voting Rights Act should be applied to regulations of the electoral process,” New York University law professor Richard Pildes told The Wall Street Journal. “The way that question is resolved will affect a myriad of election-law issues for years to come.”This has become increasingly important since the 2020 election. Now, Republican-controlled state legislatures across the US are proposing new voting laws they say will secure elections. Opponents of the laws say they are designed to be restrictive and limit the number of minorities, who predominantly vote with Democrats, casting ballots. However, these two cases preceded the 2020 election. In 2017, a federal judge ruled in favor of the state, saying the rules were minimally burdensome and did not impact the majority of voters. But the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that decision, siding with the plaintiffs and the Democratic National Committee, which had joined the lawsuit. There are other voting rights stories right now, too, including the Democrats’ push to pass HR1., a federal bill that would substantially update election laws. But today we are focused on what is happening at the Supreme Court now. The left is vehemently opposed to these laws, saying they represent an existential threat to minority voters’ ability to participate in the democratic process. In Slate, David Gans said“state legislatures run by Republicans are engaged in a concerted effort to roll back voting rights, particularly for communities of color,” with “new hurdles to prevent voters of color from fully participating in our democracy.”“After, the Voting Rights Act has been hanging on by a thread,” Gans wrote. “The key to its continuing promise is Section 2 is nationwide ban on electoral practices that result in a denial of equal political opportunity to voters of color. Section 2 is results test is critically important because its plain language targets discriminatory results, not merely purposeful discrimination by state policymakers. It forbids state laws that result in voters of color having ‘less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.’“Now, in, the results test is in the crosshairs. If the court slashes what is left of the Voting Rights Act, states will have the green light to enact new voter suppression measures that make it harder for voters in communities of color to register to vote, cast ballots, and have them be properly counted. As in the aftermath ofShelby County, state voter suppression measures will once again proliferate. One of the most powerful weapons to combat white supremacy and safeguard a participatory democracy will be reduced to a historical relic.”In The New York Times, Charles Blowwarned that voter suppression is “always draped in noble language” and “those who seek to impede others from voting, in some cases to strip them of the right, often say that they are doing so to ensure the sanctity, integrity or purity of the vote.“However, when the truth is laid bare, the defilement against which they rail is the voting power of the racial minority, the young — in their eyes, naïve and liberally indoctrinated — and the dyed-in-the-wool Democrats,” Blow said,citing 253 proposed bills that would restrict voting access in 43 states. “They can use all manner of euphemism to make it sound honorable, but it is not. This is an electoral fleecing in plain sight, one targeting people of color. We are watching another of history is racist robberies. It is grand larceny and, as usual, what is being stolen is power.”The right is hoping the Supreme Court narrows the places that Section 2 can be used, and makes it clear that any discrimination must be proven to be “substantial” for a court to throw out an election security provision. The Wall Street Journal editorial board said the Supreme Court has a chance to“restore the Voting Rights Act to its original purpose,”noting that Section 2 initially required proving intent, not just outcome, before the law was expanded in the 1980s.“Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 to stop states from disenfranchising blacks with underhanded methods like poll taxes and literacy tests,” the board wrote. “But Democrats now argue that any state regulation that makes it a little harder for anyone to vote violates the law—even if it applies equally to minorities and whites. Importantly, the Voting Rights Act (VRA) puts the burden on plaintiffs to show that minorities, based on the ‘totality of circumstances,’ have ‘less opportunity’ than others ‘to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.’“Even the Biden Justice Department told the High Court last month that it does not ‘disagree’ with Arizona is argument that its law is legal under Section 2 is ‘results test.’ The Court is highly likely to agree, and the shrewd liberal Justice Elena Kagan will no doubt tell Chief Justice John Roberts he can get a 9-0 ruling by holding that the Ninth Circuit committed a clear error in overturning the lower court findings of fact,” the board said. “But that would be a lost opportunity…“Arizona is election laws are clearly not a violation of Section 2 as a matter of law, and the Court needs to protect state procedures that protect ballot integrity from electioneering lawsuits. But it would be even better if the Court goes further and clearly defines what the language of Section 2 means.”In SCOTUSblog, Megan A Larrondo and Robert A Berry, deputy attorney generals for the state of Idaho, which joined Arizona, said “The court should clarify that, on a Section 2 challenge, the plaintiff must show that (1) the entire voting and registration system provides voters in some protected groups with unequal voting opportunities and (2) the challenged law, not some other factor, causes the unequal opportunity.“States are the entities entrusted with running elections,” they wrote. “States must be given the space to enact and enforce neutral laws of general applicability to run those elections. The Supreme Court should reject an evidentiary standard that puts a wide swath of state laws at risk and improperly inserts the federal judiciary in the role of micro manager of state electoral systems.”Putting aside what the Supreme Court might do, or whether it should rule in a specific way, the central issue here is more straightforward for me: that Arizona is legislature is implementing these laws in the first place. At the Supreme Court, Democrats will probably have to prove that the laws Arizona is trying to enact are having a statistical, disproportionately negative impact on minority voters in the context of the election system as a whole. They will simultaneously need to win the argument over how Section 2 should apply to those laws. I do not think their chances are good, and voting rights activists are wise to brace for impact. But just as Democrats will need to show their work, Republicans should too. That is why the 2013 ruling, which pared back the Voting Rights Act, has been so destructive. I will be the first to admit that ballot harvesting makes me uncomfortable. The idea of collecting and delivering a group of ballots seems to give at least another opportunity in the chain of custody to commit fraud — and I am not at all sure how I feel about it as a general idea. About half of the states do not allow ballot harvesting, and Arizona is not unique for banning it. At the same time, if the claim is that ballot harvesting leads to fraud, where is the evidence? Before the law was passed,USA Today reported that there “has been no evidence or cases linked to fraud related to the collection of ballots.” In a 2016 ruling, Arizona judge William Fletcher said the same: “there is no evidence of any fraud in the long history of third-party ballot collection in Arizona.” I could find jus tone case of ballot harvesting that Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who is taking this case to the Supreme Court, prosecuted in 2020. Two women from Yuma were charged with collecting four ballots in the August primary election. They are now facing two years in jail and a $150,000 fine. This is the monumental threat to election integrity we are worried about?Voting in the wrong precinct is a much more open and shut case to me. It should be allowed. Or, at the very least, voters should have a chance to “cure” their ballots if it is not. Casting a ballot in the wrong precinct is almost never a sign of fraud, it is a sign of confusion. And it is easy to see why: many voters live further away from the precincts they are supposed to be voting in. Sometimes voters move a few blocks in an urban area and return to the same place they voted last time, only to find out they are in the wrong place (this has, literally, happened to me). I do not buy for a moment that throwing those votes out makes our elections more secure. In Arizona, these challenges are unique. Democrats have rightly argued that minority voters cast a disproportionate number of out-of-precinct ballots. This is because, in Arizona, they are more likely to be low-income and thus more likely to have unstable housing, which means their address changes more often. Similarly, Native Americans and Latinos living in remote places in Arizona had previously leaned on community programs to collect and deliver their ballots (i.e. ballot harvesting). Given that these voters disproportionately cast ballots for Democrats, and absent any evidence that ballot harvesting or voting in the wrong precinct has opened the door to fraud in Arizona, it is tough to conclude that this is anything but a cynical attempt by Republicans to preserve power in the state legislature. If the goal is to shore up election integrity, why not actually shore it up? Build out the infrastructure to track voters who cast ballots out-of-precinct and create non-partisan, government-supported initiatives to ensure voters in remote areas can get their ballots in on time. A legislature honestly invested in election integrity and democratic participation would be pursuing goals like that, not going to the Supreme Court in a fight to throw ballots out and limit the ways voters can deliver their ballots to polling places. Amidst all this is the reality that Arizona Republicans are trying to thread an uncomfortable needle. They are simultaneously framing this as a state is rights argument but also bucking their own secretary of state, Katie Hobbs, who is a Democrat. Of course, Hobbs does not (and should not) get to overrule the Republican-controlled state legislature, but her dissent on this issue is notable. She is, by law, the state is highest-ranking election official. She has testified in court that ballot collection laws, as well as throwing out ballots cast in the wrong precinct, were “certainly meant to disenfranchise voters” and were “unnecessary because voter fraud already is a felony.” She won her election in 2018 running on a campaign to remove “barriers that can make it harder for minorities, seniors and low-income people to vote.” Then she inherited her predecessor is legal fight that is currently in front of the Supreme Court. I have loudly and proudly maintained that the 2020 election was one of the most secure in US history. There were instances of fraud, as there are in any election, but they were few and very far between. The vast majority of ballots were cast by mail, which requires paper ballots and several checks on a voter is registration, signature, address and identification and are the easiest ballots to verify. In Arizona, this was not a big change from years past — 80% of voters cast ballots by mail. I am a proponent of securing elections. Adding more checks to the system, insisting on paper ballots that create a reliable trail and creating a central database to track voters across states and precincts would make our elections more secure. I am also interested in ways to make it easier for more people to vote without sacrificing that integrity. I do not see how these laws do that. And while protecting them may be a winning case in front of the Supreme Court, the fact the Arizona legislature passed them in the first place is a losing cause for Arizonans and the American public. Generally speaking, the argument they are bad hinges on three things: 1) asylum law 2) the conditions of the facilities and 3) family separation. In general terms, American asylum law dictates that anyone arriving at our border can seek asylum here if they qualify as a refugee. Part of that qualification involves reasonable fear about returning home. Since 2004, the vast majority of people who arrive at the border go through expedited removal processes. In that process, they are screened to determine if they have a credible or reasonable fear about returning home, and are the n detained until appearing in court, or they are assigned a court date and released into the US, where they often will find friends or family (this is often referred to as “catch and release”). Opponents of migrant detention facilities generally point to the high rates of return for court appearances as proof that detention is not necessary. At the same time,Democrats contend that conditions for children at these migrant facilities amount to prison: cold temperatures, lack of clothing, lack of food, lack of education or physical activity, and mistreatment from immigration law enforcement officers have all been documented. Access to the facilities for inspection has at times been limited or outright denied. There is a history of medical abuse and neglect. Finally, the issue of separation: migrant facilities for children sometimes exclude adults, meaning parents can be separated from their children when they are detained at the border. This was obviously a prominent issue under Trump, but has occurred in other administrations, too. The case for migrant facilities is basically all of these things inverted: That thousands of migrants are “released” into the US and never show up for court; that facilities are necessary but need better funding to accommodate the migrants; that if we do not want to house migrants the n we can simply deport them or keep them on the Mexican side of the border; and that family separation acts as a deterrent against immigrants attempting to cross the border in the first place. Personally, I am not opposed to migrant facilities in principle. I think housing asylum seekers, especially children, is an inherently good thing when they arrive at the border. But I certainly think the facilities need better funding — or perhaps better allocations of funding — to ensure the children are kept in an environment that at least approaches something that is appropriate for kids. Many facilities, right now, are not meeting that standard. New data show that one year into the pandemic, which forced states to revise their revenue forecasts, many of the worst outcomes have not come to fruition. That is in part due to a $600-a-week federal unemployment supplement, according to a new analysis. But it will hamper the case in the Senate to spend big on filling budget gaps at the state level. “By some measures, the states ended up collecting nearly as much revenue in 2020 as they did in 2019,”The New York Times reports.“A JP Morgan survey called 2020 “virtually flat” with 2019, based on the 47 states that report their tax revenues every month, or all except Alaska, Oregon and Wyoming.” Total state revenues were down just 1.8% from April to December this year compared to 2019. A New Jersey plumber drove 22 hours to Texas to help people who were overwhelmed by the winter storm. Andrew Mitchell, along with his wife, 2-year-old son and apprentice, packed $2,000 of equipment into his car and took off for Texas to help out. “A lot of the people we have helped were telling us they either ca not get a plumber on the phone or—if they do get one on the phone—the wait to be serviced is three to four weeks out, so they ca not have water during that entire time,” his wife Kisha told the BBC Mitchell first stopped at his sister-in-law is home, the n worked out from the re, servicing 6 to 10 houses a day for more than a week.

Collectively, they will get $791 million from the richest man on Earth, although Bezos did not specify how much would go to each group.“I have spent the past several months learning from a group of incredibly smart people who have made it their life is work to fight climate change and its impact on communities around the world,” Bezos said on Instagram. “I am inspired by what they are doing, and excited to help them scale.” The Amazon CEOannounced the creation of his personal $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund in February. Support for mainstream environmental groupsHis fund is equivalent to more than 7 percent of his net worth. It is also10 times as much as philanthropic foundations gave globally in 2018 to efforts to slow climate change. For his first round of funding, Bezos chose to back a handful of legacy organizations with an established history of advocacy on behalf of the planet. His choice in recipients so far signals support for mainstream environmental groups rallying for new policies and research on climate change. It is also somewhat of a departure from contributions that Amazon and other giants have made recently to climate tech startups. Amazon,Microsoft, andStripe, in contrast to Bezos, have all pledged to funnel money toward developing brand-new technologies to reduce and capture their industries’ greenhouse gas emissions. Much oft he first round of funding from Amazon is $2 billion climate fund will go toward getting more electric vehicles on the road and capturing carbon dioxide emissions, the company announced in September. Microsoftsaid in Januarythat it would spend $1 billion over four years on technologies that remove planet-heating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Carbon-capture tech favored by tech companies is still in its infancyBut the carbon-capture tech favored by tech companies is still in its infancy. In contrast, some of the advocacy groups Bezos pledged to fund today have been fighting for environmental protections since close to the birth of the modern environmental movement in in the US in the 1960s. That includes the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), which is led byGina McCarthy, an Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency administrator and vocal critic of Trump is environmental rollbacks. “This generous gift from the Bezos Earth Fund enables NRDC to move even faster on achieving the climate solutions we need at the federal, state and local levels to protect people is health, strengthen nature is ability to help fight climate change and grow the clean energy sector and all the jobs that come with it,” McCarthy said in a statement. Bezos also named the Environmental Defense Fund, which tends to take a more corporate-friendly approach to its advocacy. It is worked with companies like Walmart and McDonald is on their sustain ability goals. “The needs are enormous,” Environmental Defense Fund president Fred Krupp told after the Bezos fund was announced in February. “No matter what organization receives this funding, what is important is that the money be put to work.” Krupp and McCarthy is organizations will each receive $100 million, according to statements from each group. Some of the big green groups Bezos chose, however, have been beset by scandal lately. Human rights abuses came to light in a 2019investigationinto the nearly 60-year-old conservation charity World Wildlife Fund. The organization is anti-poaching efforts supported paramilitary groups that captured, tortured, and killed villagers and indigenous peoples in Asia and Africa,BuzzFeedreported. Two more groups Bezos will fund have had recent shifts in leadership as part of a broader reckoning with systemic racism and sexism with inscience fieldsandenvironmentalism. The CEO of conservation group Nature Conservancy decided to le ave his post in June 2019following allegations of gender discrimination within the organization. The president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, Ken Kimmell,said that he would step dow nat the end of the year. Kimmell is decision follows the high-profile resignation of the organization is former coalitions coordinator, Ruth Tyson,who penned a public lettersaying, “It was really stressful and traumatic for me working [at the Union of Concerned Scientists] and I hope no other Black people ever have to share this pain.” World Wildlife Fund and Nature Conservancy said they would each get $100 million from Bezos’ fund, while the Union of Concerned Scientists said it is been given $15 million. Among the established organizations, Bezos also decided to fund a recently formed group that centers racial equity in its work, the NDN Collective. It was founded by a diverse group of Native American activists in 2018 to fund and support indigenous-led movements and sustain ability initiatives. Bezos will also fund the new Hive Fund for Climate and Gender Justice, which was launched in 2019 with a focus on supporting women in the Southeast US Bezos is funding research groups, too, like the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute and World Resources Institute. Bezos has so far avoided key activist groups that have been critical of him and AmazonBezos has so far avoided key activist groups that have been critical of him and Amazon, like the Sunrise Movement, which has spearheaded campaigns for a Green New Deal. “A reminder that Jeff Bezos has made over $48 Billion during the pandemic while over 40 million Americans have filed for unemployment. Imagine if he actually had to pay taxes and what that money could help fund,” Sunrise Movementtweeted in September. Still, Sunrise Movement has not necessarily ruled out accepting funding from Bezos to promote its campaigns. “It is better his extreme wealth sits with organizations like the Climate Justice Alliance and Sunrise than in some offshore tax haven,” Stephen O’Hanlon, Sunrise Movement communications director,said to i n an email after the Bezos fund was announced in February.",1,2,The Verge

153,Symbols and Words from the Pope in Iraq,1.67,38.33,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/symbols-and-words-from-the-pope-in-iraq/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-09,25,"It was the clumps of beard hair on the ground that stay in my memory, even more than the destroyed buildings. Walking around the Old City of Mosul in May 2018, accompanied by an Iraqi police general and armed guards, we were guided along the paths that had been cleared of ISIS booby-traps and unexploded coalition bombs. Several of the churches had only been cleared of bodies in the previous days, and the unpleasant sludge of remains was still visible on the floors. The Islamic State had used many of the churches in the Old City, all now destroyed or severely damaged, as headquarters, prisons, and torture chambers. My friend—a journalist and fellow Englishman traveling with me—remarked that there was human hair on the floor; I told him it was just carpet. Yet as we looked into a room where another body had been, I realized that it human hair, facial hair. The general told us that ISIS fighters had shaved their beards in the last days of fighting in order to avoid capture. During their brutal control of Mosul, where Abu Al-Baghdadi had proclaimed the caliphate, from 2014 to 2017, men of the Islamic State were expected to grow their beards long, and could face 20 lashes if they shaved. Destruction was all around: cars riddled with bullet holes or upside down, and so many buildings destroyed, with rubble everywhere. A year later I was back. The situation had improved somewhat, with some of the rubble cleared and many buildings, including the building where ISIS threw homosexuals from the roof, fully demolished. However, the churches were still in wreckage, and the only church due to reopen was a prefabricated building that had been in a refugee camp in Erbil, which was being moved to Mosul. Virtually no Christian families had returned, and there was no resident priest or bishop. This last Sunday, Pope Francis became not only the first pope in history to visit Iraq, but one of the very few international figures to venture into the Old City of Mosul. His short visit, to the same square, surrounded by the destroyed churches of the different denominations that had once thrived in this ancient city, was a remarkable moment, perhaps the most remarkable picture of the three-day visit to Iraq. It was not so much what he said—he recited a prayer for all the victims of war and violence and called for peace and toleration—but the symbolism of his presence. There is still no resident bishop, only one resident priest, and that pre-fabricated building is now the Church of the Annunciation, the only functioning church in the city. Very few Christian families have returned. Mosul has not been rebuilt and many residents feel that the Iraqi government has greatly neglected the city. It is still considered dangerous, with ISIS cells re-emerging and, more importantly, the different Shia militias (who are the real powerbrokers) vying for control. Add to that the story that was barely touched on by the world media—the desire of an expansionist Turkey to claim back Mosul, a city it once controlled under the Ottoman empire—and the full import of the moment becomes apparent: The pope of Rome came when so many fear to return. Iraq is beleaguered Christian population, and other religious minorities, especially the Yazidis, hoped that the pope is visit will bring the world is attention to their plight, and that the civil powers in both Iraq and the Kurdish Regional Government would fully recognize their civil rights. Christians specifically wanted Pope Francis to encourage the m, acknowledge the martyrdom that many suffered, and be a voice for their future. His words to Iraqi civic leaders on his arrival, apart from the usual niceties, had two direct challenges that the precarious minority groups wanted to hear: He challenged corruption and “disregard for law” in Iraqi society, and he asked that “no one be considered a second-class citizen.” The Iraqi Constitution treats all non-Muslims as second-class citizens, not equal under the law, so this statement was essential, but not as forceful as many had hoped it would be. Perhaps the most powerful words addressing the suffering Christians had endured were uttered in the Syriac Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of Salvation, after the meeting with civil leadership. That was the church where, in 2010, Islamist terrorists had attacked the congregation during mass, detonating suicide vests to kill two priests and more than 40 men, women, and children. The pope described the cathedral as a place “hallowed by the blood of our brothers and sisters who here paid the ultimate price for their fidelity to the Lord and His Church.” He reminded the Christians, and more importantly those who deny the Christian population a place in Iraq, that Iraq is a “land so closely linked to the history of salvation, and you are a part of that history.”Many Christians in Iraq had worried that the emphasis of the Vatican would be on religious dialogue and “Human Fraternity.” And that was certainly a major feature of the visit, referred to in almost every speech. The key moment, joint prayers with other religious groups at the birthplace of Abraham in Ur, was certainly a striking spectacle, but noticeably absent and unmentioned was the former Jewish community of Iraq. The great fear of Christians is that what happened to the Jews will happen to them. Francis strongly condemned the persecution of the Yazidi community, something to be welcomed, and particularly drew the world is attention to the thousands of Yazidi women and children still missing. The courtesy visit to the Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani, the spiritual leader of Iraq is Shiite Muslims, did not bring his signature to the Abu-Dhabi agreement on “Human Fraternity,” signed in February 2019 that the Vatican had hoped for, but Sistani is words on the right of Christians to equality in Iraqi society were very valuable. Apart from the hugely symbolic moments in Mosul on Sunday, the last two events of the trip were meant to be entirely devoted to the Christian communities of the Nineveh Plain who have suffered so much at the hands of ISIS Undoubtably the pope is presence was the cause of the greatest joy. Perhaps his rather understated words both in Qaraqosh, the largest Christian town on the Nineveh Plain, and in the final mass in Erbil will not be remembered for their lack of emphasis on the sufferings the communities had endured. While encouraging Christians to “not give up,” and “not lose hope,” peculiar phrases in the last homily at the soccer stadium in Erbil warned that “hearts must be cleansed from the temptations of power and money,” which caused a degree of confusion, given that most of the Christians on the Nineveh Plain have neither. Some are speculating that the influence of Fr. Antonio Spadaro, one of the Pope is closest advisors, could be seen in many of the speeches and homilies. The long-term success of the visit will be judged on two factors: firstly, whether Christians and other religious minorities are given equal rights under the Iraqi Constitution; and secondly, whether the dangerous level of emigration of Christian families and young people can be reversed, which may depend on economic stability and the hope of employment. The fact that the pope came, in a time of pandemic and danger, is something all Iraqis, and certainly the indigenous Christian community, welcomed and appreciated with great joy. Whether the visit will be remembered as a beautiful symbol, and not much else, remains to be seen.",1,1,The American Conservative
154,How to Forecast Outbreaks and Pandemics,-2.67,46.67,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-06-29/how-forecast-outbreaks-and-pandemics,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-29,17,"In 1900, the deadliest hurricane in US history hit Galveston, Texas. The storm, estimated to have been a Category 4, all but washed the city away. An estimated8,000 people died, and even more lives would likely have been lost if Isaac Cline, the chief of the Texas section of the US Weather Service, had not spent the day before the hurricane is arrival walking around and urging people to seek higher ground. He did so on little more than a hunch based on the fact that a bad storm had recently passed over Cuba. The science of weather forecasting had yet to emerge; guesswork was the best anyone could do. Over a century later,hurricane forecasts are a central feature of summer and fall for millions of Americans. Such forecasts, along with those predicting winter storms, tornadoes, and floods, have saved an untold number of lives and many billions of dollars. Even fair-weather forecasts play an important role in modern life. Take the airline industry, for example. “Even when you have got clear skies, that has an economic benefit,” explained Greg Romano of the National Weather Service, “because the n you do not necessarily need to plan to reroute as much, so you can perhaps take on less fuel; you know that you can have tighter schedules.”With the world moving quickly toward an age of pandemics, the story of how weather forecasting in the USs improved deserves attention. Because when it comes to modeling the likely course of contagious outbreaks, the country is in some ways closer to the bad old days of deadly, no-notice hurricanes than to the current era of precision storm tracking and multi day weather forecasts. Today, if a hurricane was barreling down on Florida, no one would suggest that an arbitrary assortment of academics gather data, quickly develop models to predict the storm is course, anticipate its landfall, tell agencies where to preposition response teams, and craft warnings for the public. That, however, is essentially what the US government has done during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of course, sophisticated disease modeling has contributed a great deal to the response to the pandemic. Early in the outbreak,modelersestimated that the new coronavirus would prove more deadly than influenza. Others concluded that rapid containment of the virus in China was unlikely, based on the unusually high number of infected international travelers. And when the USs was in the throes of the worst outbreak in the world, it was modelers whose work informed the White House task force that coordinated the federal response, including the decision to begin (and later extend) the “Slow the Spread” campaign of social-distancing measures and business closures. Unfortunately, however, the full force of epidemiological expertise in the USs is not being brought to bear. Despite some successes, serious gaps remain in the ability of infectious disease models to inform public health policy. That is because the country has no centralized system for disease forecasting; there exists no epidemiological equivalent of the National Weather Service. That is precisely what the country needs to succeed in the fight against COVID-19 and to avoid future failures and missteps of the sort that has marred the US response to the current pandemic. This is hardly the first time that academics have filled the disease-modeling vacuum. In 2009, during the H1N1 pandemic, officials in Pennsylvania consulted modelers as they deliberated about whether to shut down schools. During the Ebola outbreak of 2014, modelers helped the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Servicescalculate the risk that travelers would import cases into the USs, how many hospital beds would be needed domestically, and how many future cases could be expected under varying scenarios. But after those outbreaks ended, the ad hoc and informal ties that had developed between modelers and decision-makers were not institutionalized;no formal system emerged for centralizing expertise within the government. So it should have been no surprise that the few modeling experts who do this work within government agencies were quickly overwhelmed by the enormous number of consequential decisions demanded by the COVID-19 pandemic. And once again, academic modelers have stepped in to fill the gap. This is part of a familiar pattern. During contagion crises, modeling becomes a priority. However, ast he sense of urgency fades, attention shifts to other issues and relationships between experts and decision-makers fade. The chief danger is that as the results of modeling shift, those changes will not get on the radar of policymakers. “The projections provide information at a particular moment but unfortunately will change all the time. It is important to communicate that uncertainty,” said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental health sciences at Columbia University. Shaman is research has been consulted by the White House task force on COVID-19, but Shaman says that the working relationship has been limited. The CDC is epidemiology task force has convened weekly meeting swith pandemic experts. These meetings are a marked improvement in coordination and information exchange over such efforts in previous outbreaks. However, the connection to key decision-makers, including the White House task force, has not been clear. One result has been a proliferation of models without enough people to make sense of them. “It is really hard to separate the wheat from the chaff, without someone or a group of people evaluating the assumptions and form of each model,” said Shaman. “There are a lot of teams who want to contribute to modeling efforts, but we do not have a clear game plan for separating and combining the various projections.”To better integrate disease forecasting into decision-making, the CDC and other public health agencies should look to the history of the National Weather Service for inspiration. Americans take for granted the elaborate, highly detailed weather information they can easily access. But such tools developed only after decades of sustained public investment. Numerical weather forecasting emerged in the 1920s in the wake of mathematical advances that helped describe atmospheric physics. Decades later, computers allowed meteorologists to apply more elaborate models. Othernew technologies—aircraft, weather balloons, satellites, and digital communications—made it possible for scientists to add ever more data to the models, creating a virtuous cycle that led to progressive improvements in forecasting over time. National Weather Service employees monitor storm maps and data in Norman, Oklahoma, April 2019William Widmer / The New York Times / ReduxBut technological change is only part of the story; the other part involves organizational change. During the Civil War era, tracking and anticipating weather was a largely academic effort. Later, disparate independent efforts emerged in multiple federal agencies, including the Department of War, the Department of Agriculture, and the Navy. Finally, in the late 1960s, what would eventually become the National Weather Servicewas established as an integrated office in the Department of Commerce. This unification and centralization was crucial: it allowed for significant investment over time and created a stable point of contact between forecasters and policymakers by giving weather experts a permanent seat at the table. Outbreak modeling and analytics should be centralized in a similar way. Over the last decade or so, public investments in disease forecasting have yielded some progress. Programs funded by the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Homeland Security have advanced modeling capabilities, generated excellent research, and helped to develop a cadre of well-trained experts. These programs, however, are largely focused on developing basic science, as opposed to helping public health officials navigate difficult decisions about outbreak control. And they rarely receive the kind of reliable, sustained funding that has long supported weather forecasting. Generally, funding takes the form of grants to principal investigators that typically last only three to five years and must result in academic publications—the kind of research that is necessary but not sufficient to the task at hand.“Everyone is on grants,” noted Cécile Viboud, a staff scientist at the National Institutes of Health. “So if you do not have a particular dedicated line of funding to work on the [outbreak], the n you do it on your own time. You just run those estimates because maybe it can help.”Making matters worse, private-sector innovation and advanced data technologies have hardly made an appearance when it comes to contagion modeling, in part because there is usually not a great deal of market demand, public health agencies are ill-equipped to evaluate new data technologies, and new technologies must pass through a torturous regulatory path before gaining approval. Roni Rosenfeld, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University, pointed out another problem. “By far the biggest obstacle is the data,” he lamented. Health data are fragmented across the US health-care system in silos that cannot talk to one another. And public health agencies are not known for being forward leaning on data technology. This hampers their ability to acquire, process, share, analyze, and communicate data that would inform an outbreak response.“There is no systematic report format for individual locations to provide data in,” said Lauren Gardner, an engineering professor at Johns Hopkins University who led the team that built the university iscoronavirus map, which has become one of the most reliable sources of data on the spread of COVID-19. “Even when data is provided, it may not be in a usable format. Together these issues substantially limit the capabilities of disease models to be able to inform policy in real time.”Unfortunately, the pandemic is laying bare these data challenges. The White House task force announced last month that all 4,700 or so hospitals in the USs would be asked to send daily em ails to the task force with data on their capacities. It is baffling that in the country that sparked the digital revolution, hospitals must rely on such a rudimentary, unreliable tool in order to transmit vital information. It is also striking that the most timely and detailed data on new cases of COVID-19, diagnostic testing, and personal protective equipment have been available mostly through web sites set up and run by volunteers or journalists. It is wonderful that so many skilled individuals have been motivated to help out in a time of crisis. But the country is pandemic response cannot rely on volunteers. And although journalism is crucial during an outbreak, responsibility for tracking the spread of contagions can hardly be out sourced to media organizations. The best way to address these vulnerabilities would be the establishment of a National Center for Epidemic Forecasting and Analytics (CEFA). The center would handle research and development in outbreak science, develop technology for producing disease forecasts, and provide guidance for preparedness and response to outbreaks. The center is structure should resemble that of the National Weather Center, located at the University of Oklahoma. The NWC has a unique structure that enables academics to work closely with federal employee sand develop a mutual understanding of respective challenges and capabilities. In the same manner, the new center would work with the CDC, nonprofit organizations such as the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, public health departments in all 50 states, and the National Governors Association to improve outbreak science and analytics, decision-making during outbreaks, and the data and technologies needed to support these efforts. During an epidemic outbreak, CEFA scientists could help to forecast how many cases might emerge in a given place during a given period, which interventions would be most effective, and where to direct resources, and would assess progress in the fight against the pathogen. During the COVID-19 pandemic, each jurisdiction has been on its own when it comes to finding modelers to help make those kinds of determinations. Sadly, those jurisdictions without access to world-class modelers or epidemiologists were left out in the cold. CEFA would change that by providing all governors and mayors access to high-level insights. Between outbreaks, CEFA scientists would develop new models and advance the science of forecasting and analyzing outbreaks, just as atmospheric scientists work constantly to improve the accuracy of weather models. Initially, the center would focus on improving the predictive analytics needed to produce forecasts of new cases and deaths. It would also work to improve visualizations and communication approaches to make as clear as possible the implications and uncertainties involved in all modeling. To be successful, CEFA scientists would need the ability to directly advise decision-makers on preparedness and response, as forecasters do in other countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, theScientific Advisory Group for Emergenciesbrings together experts in various fields, including epidemiology and modeling, to advise the government. The United Kingdom has not always managed to successfully bring scientific expertise to bear on emergencies, but the fact that it has a formalized way of bringing experts together puts it in a better position than the USs. Other countries have similar mechanisms. In the Netherlands, for example, theInfectious Diseases Modelling tea mat the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment is chaired by Jacco Wallinga, an esteemed modeling expert who also holds a prominent academic position. In addition to working with officials, just as local meteorologists translate the complex weather models into forecasts that are easily understood by the public, CEFA science communicators could bring forecasts and analyses to the public to help individual decision-making. Just as people rely on weather reports to know when to bring an umbrella, CEFA forecasts could make it easier to decide whether to tele work during flu season or whether to wear a face covering. People want to know how to keep the mselves and their families safe, and providing information to help them do so would be an enormous advance for public health. To meet its mission, the center would need to be able to identify, adapt, and adopt cutting-edge technology and attract the best data scientists, engineers, and technologists. That would require significant, sustained funding: approximately $1 billion over the next ten years. But it would be money well spent. The COVID-19 pandemic should serve as the epidemiological equivalent of the Galveston hurricane. It is a stark reminder that Americans are vulnerable to the forces of nature. But as with weather forecasting, with sufficient vision and investment, the USs can develop the ability to anticipate and respond to such outbreaks. The country can do better—and it must do better, so that this never happens again.",2,2,Foreign Affairs
155,We Must Change How Our Criminal Justice System Treats People with Mental Illness,-7.67,42.0,https://time.com/5876045/we-must-change-how-our-criminal-justice-system-treats-people-with-mental-illness/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,25,"In this moment of rethinking law enforcement, we must examine how both our policing and our correctional system exacerbate the crisis of mental health in America. As an inpatient psychiatrist, I treat patients who are psychotic, plagued by voices or visions or paranoid delusions. Or they are in the throes of mania. Or they are actively trying to harm the mselves or others. Their lives are replete with hardship. Many of my patients are homeless. Some are drug-addicted. Nearly all have been victims of significant trauma. They have few safe havens, and the illnesses that besiege their minds wage a relentless war on their stability, their happiness, their safety. Many of them also serve or have served time in jail and prison. Environments that exacerbate psychiatric symptoms and routinely make mentally ill people worse and in which they face a disproportionate risk of being victimized by both officers and other inmates. In addition to my work at the hospital, I also perform forensic evaluations for the courts, and once I began working in prisons I found a system that runs counter to every principle of human flourishing that I know. Mentally ill Americans suffer from diseases of the mind, but when they come in contact with police, they also suffer from our law enforcement policies. At the 2016 annual meeting of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, former Portland, Oregon police commander Sara Westbrook illustrated this truth to a roomful of doctors. She recounted a call her department had recently received about a mentally ill man at the city is downtown Waterfront Park. The man was large and muscular and had a gallon jug filled with fluid attached to a long chain. He was grunting loudly, swinging the chain in a large circle above his head, and charging at people. The police arrived, and the man began charging at the officers. Over the course of the next two and a half or three hours, the police officers worked diligently to get the man into custody with what Commander Westbrook described as “very little force.” When they succeeded, they took him to the hospital for psychiatric care. But due to a chronic shortage of psychiatric hospital beds, he was discharged from the ER before the police paperwork had even been finished. Police would soon be called again, and this time they would take the man to jail. Encounters with police require obedience, and people with manic or psychotic symptoms—who are in the grip of delusions, or who are distracted by visions or voices, for example—are not always able to comply. The misalignment between the expectation that people follow commands and their medical inability to do so has the potential for disaster. Of the roughly 1,000 fatal shootings by police in 2018,approximately 25% of the victims were mentally ill. People with mental illness are sixteen times more likely to be killed in a police encounter than people who are psychiatrically well. This statistic is even more sobering given that it is often desperate friends or family members seeking help for their mentally ill loved one who have called police in the first place. Even when, as in this case, police are able to safely de-escalate a psychiatric emergency, their presence at the front lines of mental health crises means that the y—not clinicians—decide whether a person should be taken to jail or to the hospital. In the moment of the police encounter, law enforcement becomes the arbiter of psychiatric care. Once police are involved, even if they attempt to opt for treatment over punishment, a the rapeutic and just outcome is by no means guaranteed. If psychiatric units are full, police are often forced to turn to jails to house the acutely mentally ill—facilities that have what a prison psychologist once described to me as “an iron-clad, no-refusal, admission policy.”When mentally ill people in crisis are not admitted to hospitals, Westbrook said, she and her officers view taking them to jail as a last resort act of compassion. Given the lack of community services available for the mentally ill, she said, jail is at least “three hots and a cot, and I know somebody will check to make sure they are still breathing.”Across the country, jail is now seen as a treatment option—and sometimes the lone treatment option—for disadvantaged citizens with mental illness. There is even a term for this response: compassionate arrest. We use “compassionate arrests” only for people who suffer from lack of access to care for their psychiatric illnesses. We would never incarcerate people in order to obtain treatment for their cancer, or their asthma, or their diabetes. But we have come to treat psychiatric crises as legal problems rather than the health care emergencies that they are. The consequences of such an approach are stark, and have resulted in the fact that today our country is largest mental health institution, holding more than 2,000 mentally ill people, is Chicago is Cook County Jail. We have ended up as a society like this because of a very specific series of choices by the government over the last 50 years. The closing of state psychiatric hospitals in the 1960s, ’70s, and ’80s led directly to the influx of mentally ill people into correctional facilities. The prospect of liberating tens of thousands of people from long-term psychiatric institutions was initially thrilling, especially given the egregious treatment and even abuse that many of the facilities’ residents had endured in the name of psychiatric “care.” In 1963 the Community Mental Health Centers Act was passed with the intention of shifting care for the mentally ill out of the asylums and into the communities. State mental hospitals across the country were de funded and closed, but the accompanying promises of community resources—from psychiatric treatment to vocational training to social supports—never materialized. Without funds, without treatment, and suddenly also without housing, our nation is most vulnerable citizens fell out of health care and into the realm of the legal system. The criminalization of mental illness had begun. Since that time, the field of psychiatry has seen more than fifty years of institutional reform alongside tremendous advances in neuroscience and pharmacology. The care that hospitals like mine are now able to provide is both humane and the rapeutic. However, the woefully insufficient funding of mental healthcare in America has only worsened, and the refore such care is not widely accessible. Following the 2008 recession, five billion dollars were cut from state mental health services and 4,500 psychiatric hospital beds were eliminated across the country. The lack of resources for psychiatric care in our communities means that people who suffer from severe mental illness all too often receive inadequate treatment, if they receive treatment at all. With a chronic lack of availability of both inpatient and outpatient mental health services, our mentally ill citizens are relegated to emergency rooms, to homeless shelters, and to correctional facilities. As a result, our system continues to indiscriminately shift large numbers of people who belong in the rapeutic environments into punitive ones. Today, ten times more people with serious mental illness are in our nation is correctional facilities than in our state psychiatric hospitals. Once in jail—no matter the rationale behind the incarceration, no matter the state of their minds—all people behind bars are subjected to the same strict rules and harsh punishments. When we under fund psychiatric care in our country and the n ask police to serve on the front lines of mental health emergencies, everyone loses. People who belong on treatment wards end up on cellblocks, and the results can be catastrophic. If my patients become assaultive in the hospital, their symptoms are more aggressively targeted with medications and therapy. We aim to quickly and safely reduce their delusions or ease their hallucinations. In correctional facilities the responses to the same actions are drastically different, as was true for a man I evaluated who, in the grip of paranoia, punched a correctional officer. He incurred a felony assault charge that comes with a possible penalty of 15 years in prison. In just this way, when we punish people for the symptoms of their illnesses, our overcrowded correctional facilities become inundated with the psychiatrically ill. The practice strains our prison system and drains money from state coffers. It is also unjust and cruel. Widespread demands for change offer us an opportunity. Calls to shift money from policing to mental health can move people who suffer from mental illness from beneath the auspices of police and corrections and back into healthcare where they belong. But if we continue to use police as the front line workers for mental healthcare, we perpetuate the criminalization of mental illness that began sixty years ago at great cost to the legal system, to the mentally ill, and to us all.

Uprisings in Portland have happened nightly since the end of May, in response to police violence against Black Americans, including renewed attention to Jason Washington, a Black resident of the city who was shot and killed by police in 2018. Tensions have escalated in recent weeks as federal officers began appearing at the events. Last week, there were reports of agents in unmarked vans stopping next to protesters, whisking them away in the vehicles without stated justification and without identifying who they were. Those actions prompted outcry from Portland residents, and action from a group of mothers who appeared over the weekend to protect demonstrators by standing between them and officers. Those individuals, known as the Wall of Moms for their way of interlocking arms as a means to protect protesters, were the mselves attacked by officers with tear gas during their peaceful demonstrations. On Monday, several social media posts from the group known as “PDX Dad Pod” encouraged its members and others to appear with leaf blowers, even telling users who followed them on social media that it would be a great purchase to support local businesses. Video from confrontations between demonstrators and officers on Monday night into Tuesday morning highlighted how protesters used hockey sticks to scoot tear gas canisters back toward those who fired the m, and the leaf blowers as a means to dissipate clouds of chemicals away from protesters.

When they started snatching people [off] the street, it becomes apparent that the federal government is just … not in check,” Turner said. “It was even tampering down, and the n the feds get involved and lit it up. It is like throwing gas on a fire.” After word reached the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) about the use of leaf blowers against tear gas, an official within the department told Washington Post reporter Nick Miroff that they were frustrated with efforts by protesters to do so, and astonished that they’d return the chemicals back toward the federal officers who initially fired them off. That prompted a number of responses, some comical and some in disbelief, from users on social media over that official is bewilderment.

159,The Tax Day Outrage You Do not Know About,-4.71,40.71,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/04/16/the-tax-day-outrage-you-dont-know-about/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"If you like to leave things until the last minute, you probably know April 15 as the day to squint at a 1040 tax form or rush through TurboTax. In the past, conservatives have also used this occasion to rally against Big Government, or to write listicleschronicling “six of the more infuriating ways that [tax] money has gone to waste.”But the lesser known fact about Tax Day is all the money that come in. ProPublicaestimatesthat every year, the public misses out on $18 billion in revenue thanks to a whittled down workforce of government tax auditors. Hamstrung by eight years of budget cuts, the Internal Revenue Service has shed staff dramatically. As of 2017, the organization had 9,510 auditors—a third less than it had in 2010. That means fewer bookkeepers to investigate shady claims or to go after people who do not bother to file taxes. No wonder the department is inspector general estimates that the amount of lost revenue has gone up by at least $3 billion each year. It is just one example of how politically popular calls to cut federal workers often do not pan out to be the straight-forward, belt-tightening measures they are pitched to be.“It is been two years since we have hired anyone,” one Department of Labor bureaucrattoldRachel Cohen, writing for. “We have lost 25 percent of our staff, and our employees know nobody is being hired—but we are not allowed to admit it.”That Trump is bureaucracy is riddled with vacancies is intentional. Soon after taking office in 2017, the president announced a freeze on hiring federal workers. He reversed that decision 79 days later, but Trump is budget director Mick Mulvaney (now doubling as his acting Chief of Staff) solicited recommendations on how to rebuild the executive branch “from scratch.” Mulvaney said that Trump wanted to start with “a literal blank piece of paper.”He is hardly the first president to push for an overhaul of the executive branch. Bill Clinton is ‘Reinventing Government’ initiative called for eliminating hundreds of thousands of government positions, and he followed through. Regan and George W Bush pressed for cutstoo. Sometimes the rationale is belt-tightening; sometimes it is making government more competent. Often, it is both. But simply cutting the government work force, both in executive agencies and in Congress, often achieves neither aim.“Hiring freezes—not only in terms of explicit policy but also the struggle to hire when the budget is so uncertain—these have huge and dramatic implications for the federal government” said Donald Kettl, a political scientist at University of Texas at Austin. When staff are cut in government, agencies still have to find a way to complete their legally required duties. The Social Security Administration ca not not send out checks. The IRS ca not not collect taxes. Enter private contractors, hired to help the government do its work when federal employees have been whittled down. Writing for this magazine, Gilad Edelmanshowedthat while the US population has ballooned since the mid 1960s, the federal work force in 2016 was about the same size as it was in 1966. What has gone up, however, is the number of contractors the government uses. They tend to be more costly than civil servants, sometimes dramatically so, which is why just cutting federal workers does not always save taxpayer money. It is also vital that the government have enough staff to oversee those contractors. But often, they do not. When the US went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, it dramatically increased the cost and complexity of its private defense contracts. A government report found that the work of the federal employees who manage these contractors increased seven-fold. But the number of defense contract managers was cut in half in the mid 1990s, and it continued to decrease even when their workload went up. Partially as a result, cost overruns for weapons systems contracts went from an average of 6 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2009. Sometimes, regulatory agencies actually turn to the industry they are overseeing for extra manpower—in effect asking private companies to help regulate the mselves. The Federal Aviation Administration, for example, has for years enlisted Boeing is assistance in inspecting and approving the company is own planes. That policy of delegation has come under scrutiny after two crashes involving Boeing is 737 Max 8 jets. “It seems pretty clear that the FAA did not have the capacity to be able to review the plans that Boeing was putting forward,” says Kettl. But this problem is not just limited to the executive branch. It is an issue for Congress, too. As Iwrotefor the most recent issue of the, legislators’ struggles with technology can be traced back to staffing cuts in the 1990s, when Republicans won both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years and called for budget cuts across government. They eliminated the Office of Technology Assessment, which helped educate legislators and their staff on science and technology. They cut a third of staffers in the House who work on committees—where much of the policymaking happens. And they cut support agencies, like the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office, by about a quarter. Those numbers have not rebounded, and current staffers feel it. A recent survey of senior aides found that 84 percent thought “high-quality, nonpartisan, policy expertise within the legislative branch” was “very important,” while just 24 percent were “very satisfied” with the status quo. With fewer policy and research staff available, and without in-house science and tech wonks, lawmakers will continue to struggle to understand some of the most pressing issues. But this is a fixable problem: Congress controls the whole federal budget and could easily decide to allocate more money for its own staff. While they are at it, they could increase funding for the IRS—and help recoup billions in the process.",1,1,Washington Monthly
160,"In Trump is January 6 recast, attackers become martyrs, heroes",-10.33,36.33,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/18/trump-jan-6-recast/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"WASHINGTON — A cocktail of propaganda, conspiracy theory and disinformation — of the kind intoxicating to the masses in the darkest turns of history — is fueling delusion over the agonies of January 6. Hate is “love.” Violence is “peace.” The pro-Donald Trump attackers are patriots. Months after the the n-president is supporters stormed the Capitol that winter day, Trump and his acolytes are taking this revisionism to a new and dangerous place — one of martyrs and warlike heroes, and of revenge. It is a place where cries of “blue lives matter” have transformed into shouts of “f— the blue.”The fact inversion about the siege is the latest in Trump is contorted oeuvre of the “big lie” compendium, the most specious of which is that the election was stolen from him, when it was not. It is rooted in the formula of potent propaganda through the ages: Say it loud, say it often, say it with the heft of political power behind you, and people will believe. Once spread by pamphlets, posters and word of mouth, now spread by swipe of finger, the result is the same: a passionate, unquestioning following. Trump stokes January 6 conspiracy the oriesTechniques of glorifying your side and demonizing the other with skewed information, if not outright lies, have been in play at least since World War I, when the US government roused sentiment for the cause with posters depicting the German soldier as an ape-human with a willowy American maiden in his clutches. That paled next to what followed years later with Nazi Germany is terrifying use of propaganda for the slaughter and subjugation of millions. Whether the deception feeds warmongering or merely a defeated president is ego, some of the methods are the same, like telling the same fabrication over and over until it sticks. Trump perfected the art of repetition — about the “election hoax,” the “rigged election” and ”massive voter fraud,” with none of those accusations substantiated in the dozens of court cases and official post-election audits but engrained nonetheless among his supporters. Four years ago, Trump appeared to equate white supremacists and racial justice protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, with his comment that there were “very fine people, on both sides.”This time, in this telling, the very fine people on January 6 were on one side: his. For the other side — the police, overwhelmed for hours and bloodied in the insurrection — Trump only has an in-your-face question that doubles as a four-word conspiracy theory: “Who killed Ashli Babbitt?”Those words have become a viral mantra meant to elevate Babbitt as a righteous martyr in the cause of liberty. They ricochet around the mainline social media platforms where Trump is banned for spreading misinformation but his followers still commiserate. The woman died from a police officer is bullet fired as she tried to climb through the jagged glass of a smashed window toward the House chamber during the riot. Babbitt has become the face of the insurrection — emblazoned on T-shirts and cheered in basement ballrooms at hotels around the country where conspiracy the orists gather to vent. In Washington is Georgetown neighborhood, flyers are plastered on street lamps and building facades telling of an unveiling of a statue of Babbitt in nearby Alexandria, Virginia, on July 27, at “high noon.”Trump and many Republicans have cycled through various characterizations of the insurrection, each iteration wholly unlike the previous one. The attackers were said to be leftist anti fa followers in disguise. Then they were said to be overexcited tourists. Now they are heralded as foot soldiers for freedom. Each iteration has required Americans to ignore the rage they saw on their screens, and some lawmakers to ignore that they were among the shocked targets of the attackers that day. The hunted now praise the hunters. Taken together, the revisionists and their believers are “swimming in a vast sea of nonsense,” said Brendan Buck, a former top aide to onetime House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. That sea is currents are familiar to historians who study what makes some conspiracy the ories and propaganda persuasive. Once people buy into the lies, there can be no convincing them they are not true, said Dolores Albarracin, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a coming book, “Creating Conspiracy Beliefs: How Our Thoughts are Shaped.”Despite the well-documented facts about what happened on January 6, believers often dismiss anyone who tries to set them straight by claiming they are either duped or part of the conspiracy, Albarracin said.“The belief contains a device that protects it,” she said. “Nothing can invalidate the conspiracy theory. Trying to refute the theory proves the theory and signals you as a conspirator.”DJ Peterson, an expert on authoritarianism and propaganda, is president of Longview Global Advisors, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm, and worked at the Eurasia Group and the RAND Corporation. He said that in an online world awash in information and a real world riven by polarization, “you pick and choose what you want to believe, including sticking your head in the sand.”Trump, Peterson said, excels at amplifying claims that galvanize his core supporters and turn them against other Americans.“That is where the power of Trump is,” he said. “He is good at picking up on these threads … that lower the level of trust and create division.”Recent polls are consistent in illustrating the country is divide over Trump and his post-election histrionics. In essence, two-thirds of the population is against him; two-thirds of Republicans for him. In one of the latest, Quinnipiac found that 66% of Republicans consider President Joe Biden to have been illegitimately elected. That number and others like it in multiple polls represent tens of millions of people who were hoodwinked into believing allegations of election fraud that have been thoroughly investigated and refuted, including by Trump is own attorney general, William Barr. Trump is fabrications have stuck and now undergird the attempts by him and those closest to him to glorify the January 6 mob.“The consequence of lying is you kind of never get back to where you were before,” said Harvard historian Jill Lepore, whose podcast, “The Last Archive,” explores hoaxes, deceptions and what has happened to truth. “That is what is pernicious about our particular moment.”Of Trump, she said: “His method is generally to just create chaos so that people really do not know which way to look.”In the case of the insurrection, his followers looked away. An aggressive amnesia seems to have taken hold over how ugly it all was, even though the scenes that were broadcast and streamed in real time are forever. Swarming to the Capitol after a staging rally where Trump told them to “fight like hell,” and vowed, falsely, that he would be right there with the m, the attackers beat the vastly outnumbered law enforcement officers, injuring scores of them. In one particularly awful case, an officer was crushed against a door by people pushing to get in, his mouth bleeding as the side of his face pressed against the glass of the door. Lawmakers inside ran for their lives, hiding for hours as the mob wandered the halls of Congress holding up Trump flags. The assailants called out for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and wanted Trump is vice president, who was the re, too. “Hang Mike Pence,” they chanted. Babbitt was part of the group that was trying to beat down the doors of the House chamber as Capitol Police officers were evacuating the House floor and as some members were still trapped in the upper gallery. The officers used furniture to barricade the glass doors separating the hallway from the Speaker is Lobby to try to stave off the attackers, who were breaking glass with their fists, flagpoles and other objects. Only three police officers were guarding the doors on the other side of the stacked furniture as at least 20 attackers tried to get in, screaming, “F– the blue!” and “Break it down!” One smashed the door glass next to an officer is head; another warned the officers they would be hurt if they did not get out of the way. A Capitol Police lieutenant pointed his gun. “Gun!” “Gun!” the attackers shouted as the hysteria reached a fever pitch. They started to lift Babbitt up, to climb through the window. The officer fired one round. Babbitt was struck in the shoulder. She later died. The officer was cleared of wrongdoing, and his name was not released. Trump now states falsely — and with a stream of repetitions — that she was shot “right in the head.”“They were there for one reason, the rigged election,” he told Fox News a week ago. “They felt the election was rigged. That is why they were there. And they were peaceful people. These were great people. The crowd was unbelievable. And I mentioned the word love. The love — the love in the air, I have never seen anything like it.”___Klepper reported from Providence, RI",1,2,Denver Post
161,In Defense of Liberal Conspirators,-20.67,33.33,https://newrepublic.com/article/162318/astra-taylor-defense-liberal-conspirators,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-06,25,"The following is an excerpt from Astra Taylor is new book,Remake the World.“It is as natural as breathing” is a cliché because, when all is going well, nothing else is more effortless than inhaling and exhaling, something we do approximately twenty thousand times a day. Typically, most of us do not think much about it. We breathe as we sleep, breathe as we eat, breathe as we move, and breathe as we talk. But that changed in 2020. We worried about our lungs and gasped for air. A novel illness sickened millions and tanked the global economy, thousands ingested tear gas protesting police violence, and cities were smothered by plumes of dark, noxious smoke from nearby forest fires. During the first tense few weeks of the Covid-19 shutdown, we thought we could stop the spread of the disease by washing our hands. Our hands were something we could control. We could keep them in our pockets, wear latex gloves, have sanitizer at the ready, and scrub off the pathogen with soap and hot water. We did not have all the facts. The coronavirus, as US authorities knew by early February, is airborne, transmitted through invisible particles and droplets emitted and ingested during the most automatic of physical acts. The pandemic has revealed “that our bodies function more like sponges than fortresses,” my sister, the disability rights activist and scholar Sunaura Taylor, observed. “In a variety of visualizations, we see our bodies extending beyond their usual bounds: graphics of our coughs, sneezes, and even breath show how far beyond our own skin our bodies reach; the six-foot rule of social distancing a daily acknowledgment that our bodies not only leak and ooze, but that they absorb the conditions of others.” Epidemiology and physics colluded to prove that even at a seemingly safe distance, we touch by virtue of breathing the same air. In the worst cases, Covid-19 causes acute respiratory distress. Experts describe succumbing to the disease as akin to drowning. Early in the outbreak I read a piece by a doctor attempting to educate readers about how our lungs operate and what contracting the illness might entail. A healthy lung is so soft, she wrote, it “has almost no substance”; touching it feels like “reaching into a bowl of whipped cream.” Covid changes that, filling the twin organs with a yellow goo that blocks the free flow of oxygen: “The lung texture changes, beginning to feel more like a marshmallow than whipped cream.” To be soft and permeable like a sponge is to be healthy. To be rigid and closed off, fortresslike, spells doom. This is true, it turns out, not just for our lungs but also for our very selves. When we breathe, we pull air into our windpipe, or trachea. That pipe than splits into our lungs’ two main airways, calledbronchi, which the n branch off into smaller and smaller passageways, leading to tiny twig-like tubes called bronchioles that culminate in clusters of microscopic sacs calledalveoli. In medical diagrams these passageways resemble the branches of an upside-down tree, as though every human being contains a piece of an inverted forest inside their chest. It is a fitting image, because if it were not for trees, we would not be able to breathe. By photosynthesizing, plants generate carbohydrates and oxygen in equal measure, nourishing our bellies and filling our lungs. Without them we’d starve, but not before we choked on lethal levels of carbon dioxide. In this sense, the thousands of fires that raged across North America in 2020, burning more than eight million acres, charred the lungs of the earth. In those months, some communities gagged on smoke, others on pepper spray. On May 25, forty-six-year-old George Floyd was asphyxiated by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police offer who kneeled on Floyd is neck for eight minutes and forty-six seconds with an expression of untouchable, detached superiority. Floyd is alleged transgression was using a counterfeit twenty-dollar bill. The assault was caught on video, and perhaps because the pandemic had slowed things down, people paid attention. Floyd is murder galvanized the biggest protest movement in US history, attracting up to twenty-six million participants by midsummer. Police and federal agents responded with unrelenting force, blinding over a dozen eyes with rubber bullets and burning thousands of people is lungs with chemical weapons, including smoke grenades. In Portland, Oregon, residents used leaf blowers for self-defense, redirecting fumes away from innocent crowds and back toward the cops. Floyd is last words echoed Eric Garner, who uttered a phrase that would become a common chant at Black Lives Matter protests as he was killed by police in New York City in 2014: “I ca not breathe.” In streets full of tear gas, demonstrators could not breathe either. The right wing, predictably, responded to these developments with aggressive denial. Millions of people already devoted to conspiracy the ories merely had to add a few new twists to preexisting narratives to bring them up to date. The coronavirus, like global warming, was a hoax, an elaborate ruse by an elite and evil cabal to control the populace—not a pandemic but a “plandemic.” Likewise, the fires in California and Washington were not connected to shifting weather patterns caused by greenhouse gas emissions, but the result of arson, violent acts committed by mythic anarchists and anti-fascists who were never found but who were certainly in cahoots with Black Lives Matter. From his White House perch, Donald Trump amplified falsehoods, uplifted racists, and sowed confusion and doubt. Research showed he was the single largest source of disinformation about Covid-19. While condemning millions to disease and destitution, Trump told his followers they were victims not of a vastly unequal society (helmed by a sociopathic plutocrat no less) but of public health protocols and marginalized groups seeking equal rights; he comforted those afflicted with delusions that a reassertion of white supremacy and a revolt against a spectral “deep state” could cure the crisis. A network of right-wing individuals and foundations funded and fomented discontent, emboldening armed vigilantes who gathered at state capitols demanding a return to business as usual. In Michigan, fourteen men, aggrieved by coronavirus restrictions, were arrested for plotting to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Court documents show they also discussed storming the legislature to “take hostages, execute tyrants, and have it televised.” Instead of being snapped back to their senses by a deadly illness, people retreated further intof antasy and fallacy, in which face masks were part of a far-reaching conspiracy to suffocate patriots and stifle freedom. According to my dictionary, a conspiracy is “a plotting of evil, unlawful design; a combination of persons for an evil purpose.” This is the definition that describes the most popular conspiracy the ories of our day, which claim to ferret out a demonic sect pulling society is strings, whether they are nefarious globalists, Jewish bankers, a Satanic pedophile ring, a “shadow government,” or some dastardly combination the reof. While such misapprehensions are as old as the nation itself—some historians point out that the USs was born of a conspiracy theory, as evidenced by the Declaration of Independence is paranoid litany of Britain is “abuses and usurpations,” including unleashing “merciless Indian savages” and “absolute despotism”—the Trump era was uniquely steeped in them. Trump is rise to power began with the racist lie of birth er ism (insisting that Barack Obama was not a true US citizen) and ended in the authoritarian insistence that the election was rigged and stolen by “socialist” Democrats, with the help of some disloyal Republican officials (among them Attorney General William Barr). While people on the political left are not immune to it, this kind of cons pi racism is more endemic among and useful to the right wing. If we go further back, however, we will find the word conspiracy has a different, more profound meaning that might help us comprehend our present predicament. It comes from the Latinconspirationem,“agreement, union, unanimity,” andconspirare,“to be in agreement; to ally”—or, literally, “to breathe together.” That is what the more powerful segment of society, the ruling class, have never wanted the rest of us to do—to come together as allies and, god forbid, form unions. Throughout US history, the most influential and destructive conspiracies have emanated not from the fringes but from the country is political and financial centers of power, and their goal has been preventing regular people from banding together to improve their lot. Polls reveal shockingly high levels of isolation and loneliness among the US population, conditions that are known to make people more susceptible to the destructive, paranoid conspiracy the ories that abet the right wing. We are all living amid the wreckage of a long, ongoing, and intentional sabotage of progressive collective action: a profit-driven health care system ill-prepared to cope with a pandemic, runaway climate change threatening the future, a bigoted and broken criminal justice system, a misinformation-addled (and conspiracy-promoting) corporate media sphere, and an economy in which the majority of people can barely keep their heads above water. Our inability to truly conspire is why so many people are struggling to breathe today.“The power to define what is and is not a conspiracy is a jealously guarded privilege,”Michael Mark Cohenwrites in his fascinating bookThe Conspiracy of Capital: Law, Violence, and American Popular Radicalism in the Age of Monopoly. In the early days of the USs, this battle would be fought overwhelmingly in the courts. The first labor conspiracy case in the USs was thePhiladelphia Cordwainerstrial of 1805 to 1806, and it remains one of the most significant trials in labor history to this day. “A group of journeyman shoemakers attempted to combine to demand higher pay and prevent the hiring of replacement workers,” Cohen explains, and in response they were charged with forming “a combination and conspiracy to raise wages.” Shoemaking was one of the city is most profitable industries, and it was also the most contentious. A dispute over wages led to a seven-week strike and the n a lawsuit, with eight journeymen indicted. A scab testified that the “workers were foreigners seeking to overthrow the laws of the USs” (the trope of the outside agitator was already in effect). The prosecution argued that the workers’ collusion threatened not only the shoemaking industry but also the entire city is economy. While the workers got off with a small fine, the case set a disturbing precedent. Other courts interpreted the verdict as a ban on labor unions, which meant that organizing efforts were henceforth subject to suppression from both employers and the state. Between 1806 and 1842 there were more than twenty-one labor conspiracy trials involving “cordwainers, tailors, hatters, spinners, and carpet weavers,” Cohen reports. Strikers won six of them. But in each and every case, unions were deemed illegal “combinations” and “conspiracies” and forbidden. Speaking for countless others, Philadelphia labor leaderStephen Simpsonrailed against a double standard that tilted the playing field in favor of employers. “If mechanics combine to raise their wages, the laws punish them as conspirators against the good of society, and the dungeon awaits them as it does the robber,” he wrote in 1831. “But the laws have made it a just and meritorious act, that capitalists shall combine to strip the man of labour of his earnings, and reduce him to a dry crust, and a gourd of water.”Robert G Ingersoll, a famed agnostic and social reformer, would later express the same sentiment in a pithier formulation: “If the rich meet to reduce wages, that is a conference; if the poor resist the reduction, that is a conspiracy.” The double standard would be etched into law: At the same times workers were under attack, the owning class was provided with a bevy of new rights. A corporation would be redefined as a “legal person” entitled to equal protection. Limited liability companies received state sanction and support while labor unions were deemed illegal. As the age of monopoly wore on, conspiracy charges ramped up. The common law doctrine of criminal conspiracy allowed the captains of industry to regulate working-class organization with incessant litigation, turning courtrooms into centers of class conflict. A vague and broad accusation, the conspiracy doctrine implied guilt by association and was used to suppress dissent, “to ban unions, outlaw strikes, pickets, and boycotts, to criminalize radical ideologies like anarchism and communism,” in Cohen is words. The doctrine was considered “the darling of the prosecutor is nursery” for its sweeping application and loose evidentiary rules, which meant it was perfect for suppressing dissent—anyone could be sucked into the ring of conspirators, even those who had never met before. “If there are still any citizens interested in protecting human liberty, let them study the conspiracy laws of the USs,” the famed radical lawyer Clarence Darrow, implored. “No one is liberty is safe.”Born in 1857, Darrow defended countless workers and organizers from conspiracy charges over his career, inspired, in part, by the famous Haymarket trial, a miscarriage of justice that saw eight anarchists charged with conspiracy and seven sentenced to death for an explosion at a small rally (a pardon would be issued in time to save three of them). In an attempt to mount more successful defenses, Darrow dug into the conspiracy doctrine is history to uncover its basis in English common law, only to discover that its original purpose had been turned on its head. First codified in 1305, the conspiracy doctrine began as a medieval English law designed to prevent malicious persecution. “It was an ancient law that a man who conspired to use the courts to destroy his fellow-men was guilty of treason to the state,” Darrow concluded. “He had laid his hand upon the State itself; he had touched the bulwark of human liberty.”The Age of Revolution flipped the script, shifting the doctrine is purpose from the prevention and punishment of private abuse of the jury system to the subversion of efforts to build working-class solidarity. In 1721, English judges ruled inRex vs Journeymen Tailors of Cambridgethat workers’ efforts to strike to raise wages amounted to an unlawful and criminal conspiracy, setting the stage for the Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800, which made trade unionism illegal in Britain, though laborers continued to put up fierce resistance. “The aristocracy were interested in repressing the Jacobin ‘conspiracies’ of the people,” Cohen explains, while “the manufacturers were interested in defeating their ‘conspiracies to increase wages.’” The Combination Acts did both. A cross section of elites gained power, and labor was forced into the shadows. As a result, the historian EP Thompson notes in his study of the English working class, organizing became more furtive, or “conspiratorial” in its modern-day sense. Workers could unite only in secret, ever watchful for employers, magistrates, parsons, and spies who might be their undoing. Workers fought back, but always from a defensive crouch. In the USs, laborers exploited on the job faced retaliation for demanding better treatment. They could be fired, wounded, or lynched, whether by hiredPinkertonguards or volunteer reactionary mobs. World War I inflamed ethno-nationalist tensions and put targets on the backs of radicals, with thousands arrested and often deported in the infamous Palmer Raids. The wartime Espionage Act strengthened the hand of the state, making it possible to prosecute labor partisans for words alone. The legendary organizer Eugene Debs was jailed for declaring that the only war in which he would enlist “was the war of the workers of the world against the exploiters of the world.” Voicing that sentiment landed him in prison for sedition, a charge held up by a unanimous Supreme Court decision. With hindsight, we regard theHaymarket affair, the first wave of the Red Scare, and the Palmer Raids as egregious abuses of state power. But rather than being aberrations, they epitomize a troubling current that has coursed through US history since the colonial days, carried across the Atlantic via British common law all the way to the present day—a disastrous determination to squelch the efforts of working people to become organized. “The most dangerous conspiracy the ories, especially right wing conspiracy the ories, do not exclusively populate the extremist margins of American politics and history,” Cohen observes. “Rather, the most dangerous conspiracy the ories in American politics emerge from the very center of power, in which white supremacist, anticommunist, and anti-terrorist ideologies, each defined by shifting fears of subversive conspiracies, are promoted and enacted by presidents, business leaders, military men, judges, prosecutors, police, and vigilantes.” The most destructive purveyors of conspiracy the ories are not average people who anxiously embrace half-truths. Rather, the real threat comes from those who hold official positions of influence and who actively trade in damaging lies to maintain dominance, fully aware that their continued authority depends on the disorientation, distraction, demoralization, and disarray of millions of others. If that sounds conspiratorial, it is. “I think a little conspiratorial ism on the left is sometimes healthy. There actually is a cabal of ruling elites that seek to poison and imprison this world in the name of profits,” Cohen told me by email. “And those people have names, addresses and regularly meet to plot their crimes against humanity and nature. We have much to gain by naming and fighting them both individually and as a group.”In 1961, sociologist Daniel Bell speculated that there is “in the American temper, a feeling that ‘somewhere,’ ‘somebody’ is pulling all the complicated strings to which this jumbled world dances.” The esteemed historian Richard Hofstadter echoed that sentiment, publishingThe Paranoid Style in American Politicsto great acclaim. Over the course of the Trump presidency, countless op-eds, journalistic exposés, academic articles, and books have articulated a similar concern, citing the explosion of conspiracy the ories and the elevation of some of the most outlandish ones to the halls of power. The same election that evicted Trump from the White House secured victory for two congressional candidates who publicly supportedQAnon, a convoluted conspiracy devoted to interpreting message board missives from “Q,” a mysterious figure and supposed government insider with knowledge of Trump is plan to vanquish the Devil-worshipping, child-molesting globalists who currently run the world and send them to Guantánamo Bay with the help ofJohn F Kennedy Jr., who faked his own death in 1999 and has been in hiding ever since. At the end of 2020, NPR and Ipsos published the results of a poll assessing QAnon is reach. Seventeen percent of respondents said it was “true” that “a group of Satan-worshipping elites who run a child sex ring are trying to control our politics and media,” and 37 percent more said they did not know. Without a doubt, it is alarming when millions of people reject basic reality, even the reality of something as banal as a celebrity is death. Yet attempts to diagnose the problem is source and identify possible cures too often fall short. The bookA Lot of People Are Saying,from 2019, epitomizes the genre. Authors Nancy Rosenblum and Russell Muirhead describe what they call the “new conspiracism,” or “conspiracy without theory.” In their schema, classic conspiracism is evidentiary basis (picture dozens of JFK assassination aficionados poring over photographs of the grassy knoll) has been abandoned in favor of pure affect; hypotheses and suppositions gain purchase through repetition, not proof. Digital networks drown internet users in dubious information designed less to persuade than to overwhelm, as social networks circulate and recirculate sensational claims. Those who know how to game algorithms amass enormous followings, and those with the most “engaging” content always win, accuracy be damned. In 2020, millions of jobs evaporated overnight, but hucksters hit pay dirt. The click bait economy launched the careers of an astonishing number of “conspiracy entrepreneurs,” a handful of whom, like Alex Jones, are national figures while the vast majority carve out a specialized niche, perhaps exposing “crisis actors” (the people who purportedly pretend to be victims of mass shootings as part of a larger plot to undermine the Second Amendment) or tracking “chem trails” (mind-controlling vapors allegedly released by planes). Rosenblum and Muirhead quoteStefanie MacWilliams, a twenty something woman fromBelleville, Ontario, who gained notoriety for propagating the myth of “Pizzagate,” which held that prominent Democratic political operatives (includingHillary ClintonandJohn Podesta) ran a pedophile ring housed at a popular pizza parlor inWashington, DC, calledComet Ping Pong, which inspired a man to travel from North Carolina, enter the premises, and fire a military assault rifle, demanding the release of imaginary sex slaves he believed were being held in a nonexistent basement. Despite the fact that someone could have been killed during the commotion, MacWilliams was unremorseful: “I really have no regrets and it is honestly really grown our audience.”A Lot of People Are Sayingmaintains that while cons pi racism has long pervaded US politics, something significant has changed in recent years. “Today, cons pi racism is not, as we might expect, the last resort of permanent political losers, but the first resort of winners,” the authors observe, in a reference to Donald Trump is rule asconspiracist-in-chiefand theRepublican Party istendency to paint itself as a victim even as it wields political power. For all the authors’ supposed historical acuity, their insistence that conspiracy the ories originating from the powerful is anew phenomenon only holds if you selectively interpret and idealize the past. A cursory glance at US history, or a close read of Michael Mark Cohen, shows that the powerful have claimed to be victims since the founding of the nation. The lies peddled by Trump and theGrand Old Partyare just the latest iterations of the truth-destroying, state-building ideologies of yore. Today we use the term Red Scare to indicate an overreaction, but the mania lasted the better part of the twentieth century, peaking twice, first around World War I and the n after World War II During the second surge, theHouse Un-American Activities Committee, or HUAC,devoted incredible energy to pinpointing communist influence in government and industry, an influence that zealots detected inNew Dealsocial programs, strong labor protections and trade union militancy, and the civil rights movement, whichRepresentative John Rankinof Mississippi denounced as “communistic bunk.” Operating in a similar vein, SenatorJoseph McCarthylaunched a crusade in Congress, seeking out subversive elements in Washington and Hollywood. His efforts lost steam only when they were broadcast on national television and public opinion turned against his inquisition (an unforeseen reaction that sparked the first denunciations of the “liberal media”). But of course, the cons pi racism did not stop with the end of the demented government hearings. Under the fervid anticommunist leadership of J Edgar Hoover, the Federal Bureau of Investigation continued to spy on citizens, including via COINTELPRO, a counterintelligence program designed to surveil, infiltrate, discredit, and disrupt left-wing groups. As one official memo put it, the aim was to “enhance the paranoia endemic in [dissident] circles” and convince activists that FBI agents lurked “behind every mailbox.” A letter sent by the program tried to pressureMartin Luther King Jr.to kill himself. The CIA abetted the cause withOperation CHAOS, initiated by PresidentLyndon Johnsonin 1967 and expanded by Richard Nixon, which “infiltrated antiwar groups, black power organizations, and even women is consciousness raising sessions to determine if foreign communists were secretly directing them.”As Kathryn Olmsted documents in her illuminating bookReal Enemies,US citizens are suspicious of their government for good reason. Government lies have cost livelihoods and lives. In 1962, the Joint Chiefs of Staff presented Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara with a plan to deceive Americans into supporting a war on Cuba by launching self-inflicted terror attacks on US soil. While that idea was scuttled, US policies of deception and secrecy were par for the course in Vietnam, Cambodia, Argentina, Guatemala, Indonesia, and elsewhere. In its final tally, anticommunism is responsible for the deaths of millions of people worldwide. As these and many other abuses of power were revealed, the public became increasingly perturbed. After HUAC, McCarthyism, Watergate, COINTELPRO, and the Iran-Contra scandal, anything seemed possible, and many assumed more explosive secrets must lie in store. September 11, 2001, appeared to validate their gravest fears. TheGeorge W Bushadministration made an unprecedented grab of executive authority to battle a nebulous enemy and cooked up a baseless story about weapons of mass destruction to deceive the public into war with Iraq. Brown University is Watson Institute estimates that over five hundred thousand people have perished as a result of the war on terror, not counting casualties in Syria. As if deception and carnage were not bad enough, a movement of9/11 “Truthers”are convinced something even more diabolical transpired—the destruction of theWorld Trade Centertowers was an “inside job.” There was no limit, some believed, to what the government might do. Bush-era conspiracy the orists, Olmsted notes, were “more interested in making accusations and identifying the government as irredeemably evil than enacting reforms.” The same holds for millions of suspicious minds today.“The new cons pi racism drains the sense that democratic government is legitimate without supplying any alternative standards,” Rosenblum and Muirhead write inA Lot of People Are Saying. They are correct, but we have to understand the cause. For the last century, anticommunism run amok helped repress legitimate and necessary alternatives, leaving nihilistic reaction and unhinged conjecture to fill the void. Eight months into the pandemic, a television news station in Kalamazoo, Michigan, broadcast a telling exchange. The newscaster stood in a desolate suburban parking lot, reporting on the reaction to the state is new Covid-19 restrictions. The owner of a nearby establishment, a weary-looking older man, walked up and told the host he had something to say. He was resisting the shutdown and wanted to say why.“My government leaders have abandoned me,” he said. “They have put me in a position where I have to fight back.” Four trillion dollars of stimulus money was given to special-interest groups and campaign donors, he continued, “enough money to give every family,every family in this country,$20,000 to go home for two months.” If he were given that sort of support, the man said, he gladly would have closed shop and let the virus settle down. “But I am not going to do it alone.” When asked if he would continue to violate the state order, the man was defiant. “This is not a state order; this is a conspiracy, a tyranny … and I have got patriots coming out and supporting me.” The eighty-second clip encapsulated the ways government failures fuel conspiratorial thinking. On one level, the man was correct and his indignation justified. When the bailout funds were dispersed in the spring of 2020, a conspiracy of sorts was indeed afoot—bankers and corporate executives made a mad grab for public money with few strings attached, while regular people, who should have been paid to stay home, scraped by on crumbs. But he was wrong to imagine patriotism and a reckless disregard for public health as the solution to a problem caused by plutocracy. After all, the rich can share citizenship status with poor and working people and still dispossess them. Numerous studies show that insecure, vulnerable, and threatened populations are more susceptible to conspiracism. “Conspiratorial ideation” is driven by both ideology and instability. Feelings of powerlessness, research shows, predict such beliefs. InRepublic of Lies,Anna Merlan cites an analysis of letters by readers ofTheNew York TimesandChicago Tribunebetween 1890 and 2010 that found that conspiracy the ories fluctuated in response to times of enormous social upheaval, with the first spike around 1900. Research also indicates that conspiracy beliefs are high particularly among members of stigmatized minority groups. But as Merlan rightly points out, these groups have well-founded grounds for mistrust, given the violent history of white supremacy in this country. Not every community is sense of persecution is equally valid. In a perverse way, many prominent conspiracy the ories are a cry for justice and connection, even if they frame the world in a Manichaean binary of good versus evil, shunning a structural analysis along with complexity and contingency—positing a cadre of cartoon villains who possess the incredible ability to mastermind world events, leaving nothing to chance. Nevertheless, such the ories are typically populist in form, in that they purport to expose the destructive actions of a power elite against regular, unwitting people (a power elite sadly often imagined in ways shot through with anti-Semitism). QAnon is slogan, “Where we go one, we go all,” often shortened to#WWG1WGA, evokes the Wobbly motto, “An injury to one is an injury to all,” by way of theThree Musketeers. It is a mash-up of cultural references, stereotypes, thwarted expectations, and dashed idealism. No doubt, many con spira cists are irredeemable racists and authentic fascists, but there are undoubtedly some who would likely be receptive to other messages if they were as omnipresent and aggressively promoted. We will never know how many people would prefer the opportunity to have a face-to-face conversation with a community organizer instead of watching a talking head spout nonsense online, because they never get such a knock on the door and a chance totalk. Far from the country of civic associations described by Alexis de Tocqueville inDemocracy in America,the US today is a land of anomie where, sociologists observe, a growing number of people suffer from an “epidemic of loneliness.”The spread of misinformation and fake news has inspired hand-wringing among liberals, who bemoan the public is gullibility and lack of knowledge. I confess I have wrung my hands, too. But it is not enough to denounce fake news or bewail the inability of regular readers to verify facts or “trust science” (a telling phrase since “trust” is unthinking, an act of faith rather than critical reflection—it means, in effect, know your place). Of course, some people could use a look in the mirror—many liberals spent the Trump years deeply invested in “Russiagate,” which played into dated, xenophobic Cold War clichés about “the Russians” and exaggerated foreign influence while failing to acknowledge homegrown threats to democracy. After all, it was theElectoral Collegethat handed Trump the presidency, notVladimir Putin. Worse still, liberals came to lionize the very institutions—the FBI and CIA—that have been the primary agents of counter subversive conspiracies, trampling liberties and destroying lives around the world. As Jonathan Swift quipped in 1721, “Reasoning will never make a Man correct an ill Opinion, which by Reasoning he never acquired.” Ideologies are always shaped by emotions and informed by lived experience. The man in Kalamazoo represents millions who are justifiably angry because they have indeed been abandoned, and who are desperately grasping for explanations that make sense of their circumstances. The challenge is reaching them before mendacious narratives do. But given the right wing is long and effective assault on labor unions, quality free public education, and nonprofit media—the means and channels through which understanding generally spreads—that is increasingly difficult. The bipartisan project of undermining the left in this country has been, quite literally, a fool is errand. By destroying the social solidarity, economic equality, and class conscious world view that a robust, organized left helps provide, ruling elites have created a vacuum in which unhinged conspiracies propagate. Far from being a rational system as proponents claim, capitalism ineluctably tends toward the illogical and ludicrous. Plutocrats will embrace and promote paranoia as long it is profitable; manufactured lunacy provides useful cover, distracting the public from unpopular policies (tax cuts, attacks on unions, a decimated safety net), just as obsessively naming enemies (Democrats, the press, communists, socialists, antifa, anarchists, feminists, intellectuals, “woke” students, and so on) deflects responsibility and blame. In the memorable words of Stephen Bannon, conservatives counteract the allegedly liberal media by “flood[ing] the zone with shit.” The goal is not to manufacture consent but to promulgate confusion, and digital capitalism expands the arsenal used to assault our senses. (In 2020, videos endorsing false claims of widespread voter fraud were viewed on YouTube more than 138 million times during the week of the election alone; polls soon showed that one-third of Americans believed that voter fraud helped Joe Biden win.) “Those who persistently blame others for indulging in conspiracies have a strong tendency to engage in plots the mselves,” Theodor Adorno smartly observed in 1952, and so it goes today. The world is a complicated place, and we are permeable, interconnected beings subject to infection by ideas and viruses. We are connected across time and space: our beliefs shaped by past events, our bodies impacted by what happens on the other side of the planet, our lungs filled with air exhaled in the next room. Autonomy is an impossibility. Faced with the prospect of this revelation, some recoil, taking solace in revanchist notions of separation, nationalism, and self-reliance laced with magical thinking. To have a chance of bringing people back to reality, or preventing them from losing touch in the first place, we will need to speak to their apprehensions and misgivings. Consider the growing suspicion of vaccines, which correlates with religious affiliation and higher socioeconomic status, making it one of the preferred conspiracy the ories of the comparatively privileged. While anti-vaxxers are a serious threat to public health, there are plenty of reasons to be wary of the medical and pharmaceutical industries. Bill Gates using vaccinations to microchip the masses is not one of them. (Bill Gatesblocking researchers from waiving intellectual property protections to make Covid vaccines available to people in poor countries is the real concern.) Or take speculation about the source of Covid-19. The fact is, viruses do not care about the imaginary boundaries human beings construct, whether those are national borders or the species barrier. Like other zoonotic diseases, the coronavirus jumped from one creature (likely a bat or pangolin) to our kind. It did so because industrial patterns of land use and meat production—picture clear-cut forests, crowded factory farms, and so-called wet markets—push human and nonhuman animals into ever-more intimate contact. In other words, while Covid-19 was not concocted in a Chinese lab or caused by 5G wireless towers, it has political dimensions worth unraveling and discussing, particularly if we want to prevent the next deadly pandemic. An ancient habit of the human mind, cons pi racism will never be entirely stamped out, but it can be diminished if we deprive it of the instability, inequality, and isolation on which it feeds. “We will not be a less paranoid country until we are a fairer one,” Merlan correctly observes. You ca not fact-check people out of a problem that requires collective action, mass empowerment, and clearheaded strategy to solve. Instead of chastisement, we need a credible vision of better society and a recognition that it will take mass movements to manifest it. That means building the one thing nostalgic right-wingers and neo liberal centrists both hate to see—an organized and mobilized multiracial working class fighting for their shared interests. It will take a conspiracy of epic proportions to counteract this country is ruinous and unrelenting war on people is ability to come together for the common good, but that is the only way we will all ever be able to breathe.",1,1,New Republic

165,Running for New York City Mayor — How Much Chaos Can We Expect Between Now and June?,-7.67,43.67,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/02/04/running-for-new-york-city-mayor-how-much-chaos-can-we-expect-between-now-and-june-22/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-04,17,", you could walk up to Gracie Mansion and touch your fingers to the cool brick of the walls surrounding the grounds. Those days, like so much before the coronavirus, are long gone. The Upper East Side mansion, erected in 1799, sits behind NYPD barricades. The metallic gates are everywhere, cutting off the walking paths that used to invite visitors to the home of the mayor of New York City. Gracie resembles, a year into the pandemic, a fortress under siege. On June 22, when the virus may well be less pervasive, Democrats in New York will choose their nominee for mayor. In our heavily Democratic city, this primary victory will be tantamount to election. And given the ease with which incumbents glide to a second term — the oft-maligned Bill de Blasio won his 2017 primary with nearly 75 percent of the vote and easily swatted away a Republican by 38 points — this election will effectively determine who gets to govern the largest city in America for the nextyears. (The last one-term mayor, David Dinkins, left office in 1993.)There may be no more important election — in this city, at least — in modern history. Not since the city nearly went bankrupt in 1975 has it been so close to the brink. COVID-19 has killed more than 27,000 of our fellow citizens. The restaurant, tourism, and hospitality industries are decimated. The true unemployment rate, some experts estimate, could exceed 20 percent. The murder rate is up all over America, and here in New York it has soared 41 percent over 2019. This past summer, protests against police brutality shook the city during some of the tensest days and nights in memory, drawing savage crackdowns from an NYPD that de Blasio — a left-leaning Democrat — has repeatedly failed to reform and discipline. The Gracie Mansion barricades went up around the time of those hot, violent nights, as de Blasio, known for his stubborn workouts at the Park Slope Y and his refusal to show up anywhere on time, seemed to retreat from his city. While the gangly mayor has real, lasting accomplishments — he created a universal prekindergarten program and helped pass laws increasing the minimum wage and guaranteeing paid sick leave — he has been mocked and derided for his quixotic national ambitions and for failing, along with Governor Andrew Cuomo, to contain the spread of COVID-19. The city, laid so low, may be even more immediately beleaguered than it was in the 1970s, when a fiscal crisis triggered mass layoffs and enormous cuts to social services. “Here the challenge is much greater,” says City Comptroller Scott Stringer, one of the front-running candidates. “We have no tourists, no arts and culture, no restaurant or dining to speak of. This is unprecedented territory.”Candidates crisscross neighborhoods as large as small cities, courting varied racial, ethnic, and interest groups that can diverge wildly in their needs and wants. There is a Hasidic vote, a Chinese vote, an Afro-Caribbean vote, and an MSNBC liberal vote. There are dozens of labor unions, civic organizations, churches, block associations, and Democratic clubs that all want to feel that the mayor will represent the m, and often, them alone, even though the primary has drawn close to 1 million voters in the past.“Running for mayor involves having an understanding of these different communities, having some people who have some ties in these communities and understanding issues that matter to the m—and that does create some whiplash for candidates,” says Lis Smith, a prominent Democratic operative who worked on de Blasio is 2013 campaign. “One day you are talking to a group that is very progressive, very liberal, and the next day you are talking to a group of voters that are more fiscally conservative, socially conservative. There are a fair amount of anti-abortion Democrats.”The pandemic, of course, has upended all of this. The last time there was an open mayoral race, candidates had months to glad-hand at parades, block parties, and Sunday services, slowly building name recognition as voters spotted them on street corners and subway platforms. Once an unknown, de Blasio himself had to cajole commuters at the subway, hunching his six-six frame to give his elevator pitch to the people rushing by. These days, the candidates are locked into Zoom forums. Andrew Yang, one of the top contenders, hustled across the city in January, staging walking tours and riding the subway with reporters in to w. On February 2, he announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19. His diagnosis may well convince the other contenders to avoid crowd contact, at least for now. “The last time I had a flu no one gave a shit,” Yang joked. Pandemic campaigning, generally, has meant increased phone banks, more glossy campaign mailers, and additional digital and TV ads to replace door-to-door canvassing. For candidates without built-in followings, this is cutting down on opportunities to meet voters and demonstrate momentum, either with a big rally, a strong showing at a parade, or even a staged arrest, cameras flashing.“I am still a believer, as far as citywide races, that regular cable TV is important,” says Jerry Skurnik, a longtime Democratic consultant. “That is why de Blasio won eight years ago. It seems to me that TV is even more important this year. I am sitting home right now — the TV is on.”More than 30 candidates, remarkably, have registered to run with the city is Campaign Finance Board, though there are only five or six Democrats who have a viable chance of seizing the nomination and breezing to victory in the fall. Much of this has to do with money: A competitive mayoral race costs millions of dollars, and only a handful of Democrats will be able to raise and spend that kind of cash. Two of the candidates, Stringer and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, have been enmeshed in the city is political machinery for decades, taking the most traditional route to power. Stringer, who has been the city is comptroller since 2014, is a Manhattanite with a base on the white, liberal Upper West Side. He is the undisputed endorsement king — three members of Congress, including the newly elected Bronx firebrand Jamaal Bowman, are backing Stringer is candidacy, along with a deep roster of state lawmakers. Stringer has been courting the city is resurgent left, criticizing power elites like the real estate industry and proposing an ambitious plan to phase out all fossil fuel infrastructure citywide. Once a more risk-averse, clubhouse politician, Stringer is hoping he can woo progressives in the primary, recreating a version of the playbook that got de Blasio to Gracie Mansion in the first place. Adams, unlike Stringer, does not chest-thump over progressive credentials. A former state senator, police captain,and Republican, Adams proudly fund raises from the real estate developers loathed on the left. A power broker in Brooklyn is Black neighborhoods, Adams has been a muscular voice on police reform, pitching an idea to let community groups select police commanders. He said he would publicize the names of police officers being monitored for bad behavior. (Adams did not return multiple requests for comment.)Stringer, who has promised to “manage the hell” out of the city,has banked close to $6 million for the race so far; Adams has about $6.6 million. Both of them are expected to be prolific fund raisers in the months to come. In 2001, a little-known, charisma-challenged billionaire named Michael Bloomberg defied the Democratic establishment, winning the mayoralty in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Bloomberg triumphed on the Republican line, all but impossible in to day is city, unless you can spend $100 million, which is out of reach for all of the current candidates. In 2013, horrifying entrenched Democrats while delighting every newspaper in town, Anthony Weiner plunged into the Democratic primary, fresh off the first of many sext ing scandals. Before his implosion, he was a polling leader, drawing huge crowds in the streets. At the same time, Eliot Spitzer, the former governor felled in a prostitution scandal, was running for city comptroller, whipping up a singular frenzy around a municipal contest. In 2021, there are no black swan candidates like Weiner and Spitzer, but there is a famous outsider: Yang, the entrepreneur who gained widespread recognition running for president on a platform to give $1,000 to every American every month, forever. Mayoral candidate Yang cannot propose anything so ambitious — his current cash-transfer proposal is micro-targeted to very poor households, and would cost $1 billion annually out of an $88 billion budget — and he has mixed worthy progressive goals, such as a public bank for New York City, with the more curious,including a casino on Governors Islandthat would be forbidden under a federal deed restriction.“I am running for mayor for one reason and one reason only: I believe I can help New York City recover from this crisis faster than others,” Yang says. He is chasing the progressive vote, like Stringer, but he is also hoping to cross over everywhere, knitting together moderates and exciting the city is burgeoning Asian communities. Before testing positive, he took to street-level campaigning with particular gusto, and is easily recognized when he ventures out.“There is like a real need in New York to have someone who people have a sense of pulling for the m,” Yang continues, pitching his candidacy, “and one of the things happening in New York City right now — the nature of the race is a lot of noise — to me, as long as New Yorkers are happy to see me, I am pumped to fight for them.”The bubbly Yang is, more than any other candidate, resented by the rival campaigns, who treat him with a mixture of derision and fear. His top consultant, Bradley Tusk, advised Bloomberg is failed presidential campaign and grew rich advising Uber, drawing ire from the left. Maya Wiley, a former counsel for the de Blasio administration and a civil rights lawyer who rose to greater fame as an MSNBC analyst, is seeking to become New York is first female mayor. (Wiley declined an interview request.)And the city is Wall Street titans specifically recruitedRay McGuire, a Citigroup executive, to run for mayor; he has raised nearly $5 million from business heavyweights in a short amount of time, vaulting himself into the top tier.“I do not owe anybody anything,” McGuire says, boasting of his status as a first-time candidate. “Zero. I am unbought.” Celebrities such as Spike Lee and Samuel L Jackson are in McGuire is corner. As a Black business executive, he has spoken openly about racial justice and coalition building between the city is millionaire class and leftists who seek to check their power. Some on the left are hoping Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive, can catch fire. Though the Democratic Socialists of America, an emerging power center in New York politics, are not formally backing any candidate, members of the organization have been drawn to Morales, who has called for slashing the NYPD budget in half and redirecting the funds to social services.“I kind of reject the idea that we ca not talk about decreasing this sort of system that criminalizes poverty for Black and brown people because people are going to be unsafe. Black and brown folks are already unsafe,” Morales says. “We need to be morally committed to people is needs to live in dignity.”And there is no shortage of technocrats: de Blasio is former Sanitation commissioner and interim NYCHA chair, Kathryn Garcia, and ex-HUD secretary and federal OMB commissioner Shaun Donovan are hoping to vault into the first tier. Each boasts of governmental experience that outstrips the rest of the field. “I am absolutely the most qualified,” Garcia argues. “I think I am the only person in the race who really understands what this job is. This is a day-to-day, deliver for the people job.”Donovan, who was also a housing commissioner under Michael Bloomberg,drew attention when he proposed giving every city child a $1,000 “equity” bond that could grow to $50,000 by the time of their high school graduation. “With all due respect to the other candidates, no one else has ever run a four trillion dollar budget,” he says, referring to his tenure at the federal level. “No one else has sat side by side with Dr. Fauci in the Oval Office or Situation Room.”In the old days, candidates clawed for slivers of the electorate. If no one won 40 percent of the vote, there was a citywide runoff between the top two candidates. These were vicious, if low turnout, affairs. Ranked-choice allows voters to rank their top five candidates. Getting second- and third-place votes matter. The runoff is no more. No one quite knows how this will impact one candidate or another, although everyone has a theory about why they are the most well suited for the new era. It is already produced coalitions: Stringer and Morales shared a co-endorser, a state senator from the Bronx, and some Democrats are speculating that Stringer wants to elevate Morales to undercut other progressive rivals, including Wiley. Adams, meanwhile, has aggressively opposed the systementirely, on the premise that the voter education has not been there to make it happen effectively. The race, like the city, is in flux. There is no candidate with a clear claim to the nomination. There is no single woman or man with the best argument, either — not with multiple technocrats, a citywide elected official, an unorthodox figure of national renown, a well-regarded civil rights attorney, and many others seeking the prize of governing one of the world is great cities. Come 2022, inordinately challenging decisions will have to be made. New York will be emerging, slowly, from pandemic hell. At some point, the new mayor will have to lower the barricades — metaphorically and literally — and enter the streets where the city, ravaged by plague, longs for compelling leadership.“We have to get it right this time,” says Stringer. “We have to have a reset.” ❖More:2021 NYC ELECTIONSNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

168,Judicial Activism Strikes Again As Tallahassee Judge Strikes Down DeSantis Administration is Mask Mandate Ban,23.33,26.0,https://bigleaguepolitics.com/judicial-activism-strikes-again-as-tallahassee-judge-strikes-down-desantis-administrations-mask-mandate-ban/,https://adfontesmedia.com/big-league-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-28,25,"Florida is Gorvernor Ron DeSantis has become a very popular figure in the conservative movement in recent months due to his efforts to push back on leftist tyranny wherever he and his administration is able to. Unfortunately, he seems to have hit quite the roadblock in the form of Judge John Cooper of Tallahasse. Earlier on Friday, the activist judge struck down the mask mandate ban the Governor has been trying to enforce, saying that they are “arbitrary” and that children lack “legal authority”. Correspondents will surely wait with baited breath to see if Judge Cooper will say the same thing regarding “legal authority” when it comes to lowering the voting age to 16 or lower.“I conclude that this evidence demonstrates that face mask policies that follow [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidance are, at this point in time, reasonable and consistent with the best scientific and medical and public opinion guidance at this time,” Cooper wrote. “I am enforcing the bill passed by the Legislature and requiring that anyone who uses that bill has to follow all of the provisions, not some of the provisions.”And since the CDC is as infallible as the Pope, it would seem logical that the CDC with its stellar track record be the bellwether with which judicial decisions should be made for the country is third most populous state. Governor DeSantis’ primary motivation for this legislative effort was not only to provide parents the authority and autonomy needed to make informed and uncoerced medical decisions for their children, but to also push back on the emerging medical tyranny that has metasticized over the last year and a half, which seems to be the globalist is latest and most fashionable attempt to claw away humanity is freedom and dignity. It would also appear that many Republicans in Florida is State Legislature are content with the trends in the Sunshine State and the rest of the country. One major exception appears to be State Legislator and Congressional hopeful Anthony Sabatini, who has on multiple occasions and venues called out what he considers the RINO leadership in the GOP at all levels of government. With the uni party establishment taking greater pains to maintain their entrenched positions, it would appear that Republican politicians will continue to diverge in their actions, with more establishment types helping with maintaining the status quo and America First nationalists working harder and smarter than ever to overturn what they perceive to be the rot in all levels of government. The question of who will succeed will certainly be answered by time either way. Share:",0,0,Big League Politics

170,An ex-student of Carol Dweck identified a new mindset for success — Quartz at Work,0.33,50.0,https://qz.com/work/1883138/an-ex-student-of-carol-dweck-identified-a-new-mindset-for-success/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-27,25,"We all know someone who barrels into tasks without putting much thought into it. Just give them a directive—a household repair job, a homework assignment, a data entry project—and they dive right in. Then there are others who ca not so much as wash the dishes or make a sales call without first devising an optimal plan of attack. They go to work every day not assuming that the accumulation of their labor will one day lead to a promotion. Rather, they are going to analyze how promotions are awarded, to whom they go and why, and develop a road plan to check off the boxes that should get them that pay raise and prestige faster. The planner types have what the psychologist Patricia Chen, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore, and Carol Dweck, the noted Stanford University psychologist and Chen is former adviser, have identified as a strategic mindset.“Those with a strategic mindset tend to ask the mselves strategy-eliciting questions, such as, What can I do to help myself? How else can I do this? Or, is there a way to do this even better?” Chen tells Quartz. “People who ask these strategic-mindset questions tend to generate and apply more and better strategies that end up making them more effective than others.”In a new paper,published in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), lead author Chen and a team of researchers, including Dweck, assert that a strategic mindset “uniquely predicts how much people report actively using strategies and, in turn, how effective they are at pursuing goals across life domains.”Crucially, they note it is not enough just to have mastered a methodology for conquering a goal, or to know when you should try other means to reach your end. Nor is it enough to simply value the process of thinking about how you think (what psychologists call metacognition). When you have a strategic mindset, you actually use multiple strategies and keep track of what is working for you, or not, habitually. The paper reported on three studies in the US involving more than 800 adults. First the researchers sent surveys to more than 350 students with queries about how often they step back to assess the ways they study for different classes or whether their study methods give them an advantage. “The higher they scored on a strategic mindset, the more they reported planning, generating strategies, monitoring, and adjusting their techniques during learning, and, in turn, the higher they scored in their GPAs,” says Chen. A second study—one that asked randomly selected people to complete an online questionnaire—showed a correlation between having a strategic mindset and making greater progress toward a life goal, whether at work, school, the gym, or anywhere else. The third study described in the paper is most compelling, if also messy. In a lab test, participants were presented with 30 eggs and asked to separate the whites and yolks in under two minutes. They were told that whoever separated the most eggs and collected the highest volume of egg whites would receive a $100 prize.“Although this task does not seem like the kind of task that most people will encounter in modern life or the modern workplace,” the authors note, “it was carefully designed to meet the following criteria: The task was relatively unfamiliar and challenging for most participants; it could be accomplished with different methods, some of which were more effective than others; and there were clear performance metrics.”To discover whether there might be a causal relationship between a strategic mindset and goal achievement, some participants in the egg-separation study were randomly selected to be primed to think about a strategic mindset by reading and summarizing a Lifehack article about the concept, while the control group read an article about an unrelated topic. The researchers hypothesized that the first group would be more apt to explore several ways to speedily and cleanly remove the golden yolk from its sea of albumen, and to evaluate their methods along the way. And they did. You can probably guess which bunch were the fastest at the job. What is more, when participants were given eight extra eggs they could use to practice if they felt like it, those who had strategi zing on their mind were more likely to do so. Do not worry, Chen and her team controlled for any casual bakers in the group. Each person is experience with egg separating under normal conditions—i.e., as cooks at home—was first measured and taken into account in the study is scoring rubric. Everyone in the study also watched a demo of a common “but suboptimal” method for separating eggs, the authors write:the back-and-forth sifting technique recommended by typical meringue or custard recipes that call for egg separating. The psychologists wanted to see whether people would default to that option and never improve upon it, or look for smarter, quicker methods. In the study appendix, researchers labeled the five dominant more innovative techniques they observed in the lab, like Hand Straining (“letting egg white run through fingers while holding the yolk back”); the Break-and-Grab (“cracking eggs into a bowl and the n removing the yolks with hand, tool, or eggshell”); and the Pincer (“partially cracking open the egg, allowing only the egg white to fall out whilst holding the yolk in”). Chen says her future research will investigate why and how some people develop strategic mind sets and others demonstrate less of this trait, instead going through life passively or even blindly, she says. Without a strategic mindset, it may be easier for a person to become frustrated with a task, or to give up entirely—an unfortunate outcome when someone wants to, say, quit smoking for health reasons, or learn to code in order to become more competitive in the job market. There may be a clue in Chen is own life experience as to how the mindset is inculcated. When she was young, Chen says, her mother would regularly point out people or systems that were working ineffectively. Running errands in Singapore, her mother would say to Chen and her sister, “Look at what that person is doing. Do you think that is the best way of doing it? Can you think of a better way?” Chen recalls.“She would ask us, ‘What do you think they could do to make this better’ for their customers, or students, or people? And she’d make us think about the answers and brainstorm multiple answers to these questions,” says Chen. In time, running through that process became second nature to her. People who did not grow up with that kind of nudging from a parent or teacher probably can still develop the same habits. Dweck is famous research about the growth mindset is proof of this potential. “Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset,” as Dweck once explained in theHarvard Business Review. “They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into learning.”The growth mindset conceit is widely praised—if not always practiced—in the corporate world. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella claims his embrace of it served as a foundational principle in rebuilding the company is culture. Dweck has been name-checked by both former US president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama. Her theory has become so popular that Dweck herself ha shad to debunk common misconceptions about what it i sand is not. In contrast, the concept of a strategic mindset is still in the early stages of research. Chen says she and Dweck have spent a lot of time discussing how a strategic mindset differs from a growth mindset, and concluded that the two frameworks complement each other. “Both mind sets can be helpful in moments of challenge or difficulty, but in different ways,” says Chen. “The strategic mindset motivates strategy, while the growth mindset promotes effort, investment, and persistence, which may or may not involve initiating different or better strategies.”Combing both ideas ought to be powerful, at least in theory. Imagine someone is pursuing a long-term goal, says Chen. “Even if they believe that their abilities can be developed, people may not necessarily think about how best to develop their abilities and channel their efforts. And we certainly believe that simply exerting yourself can become discouraging if people simply double down on wrong and unproductive strategies.”Enter the strategic mindset, she says, which “can motivate people to search for and try out new strategies, maybe seek out experts, maybe consult with mentors, and so on.”The team is conducting studies with preschool children, college students, students, and other adults to better understand how to cultivate this mindset, she says. One of her earlier papers, published in 2017,has already demonstrated that a 15-minute intervention that asked students to reflect on how they craft a study plan led to better grades, lifting B+ students into the A range. More data about what else could work is still to come, but Chen suggests that teaching someone else about the strategic mindset, or just talking about it, might help a person internalize the process. What is most important, she says, is to question your own strategies when you are faced with a tough challenge or aspiring to make a personal change. “Even if it is to be a happier person, or be a more optimistic person, or to relax more,” she says, “there is no harm in asking yourself, ‘How else can I do this?'”Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",2,2,Quartz
171,At Least Seven Colombians in Haiti Assassination Received US Training,0.0,42.67,https://theintercept.com/2021/07/16/haiti-assassination-colombia-us-military/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"More thana quarter of the ex-Colombian soldiers currently suspected in the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse received US military training, The Intercept confirmed Friday, with some of the alleged attackers participating in programs as recently as 2015 that ranged from vehicle maintenance and professional development to counterterrorism and drug war operations. Courses were held in both Colombia and the USs. The Pentagon and the State Department are currently reviewing internal records to determine precisely how many of the alleged assassins were trained by the US “To date, State and DoD have identified seven individuals among a possible 25 alleged to have been involved by Haitian authorities, that previously participated in past US military training and education programs, while previously serving in the Colombian military,” a US government official confirmed in an email to The Intercept. “Individuals had been approved for a variety of training activities held both in Colombia and the USs between 2001-2015.”On Thursday, the Pentagonconfirmedto the Washington Post that “a small number” of the Colombian mercenaries suspected in the July 7 assassination had received US training, though the department did not say how many, nor when, nor what type of training was provided. According to the official who spoke to The Intercept, “Examples of the types of training received were various types of military leadership and professional development training, emergency medical training, helicopter maintenance, and attendance at seminars on counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism.”From 2000, when the USs first launched the massive, multi billion drug war aid program known as Plan Colombia, to 2018, the US administered more than 107,640 trainings of Colombian security personnel, noted Adam Isacson, director of the Defense Oversight program at the Washington Office on Latin America, a figure that far surpasses any other military collaboration the US maintains in the region. “Nothing comes close to 107,000 over the last 20 years,” Isacson told The Intercept. “Nothing.”Eighteen former Colombian soldiers are currently being held in Haiti in connection with Moïse is assassination, including some who previously served in elite Colombian special operations units. New details on their involvement in the assassination continue to break by the day. On Wednesday, the Colombian news magazine Semanareportedthat one of the former soldiers confessed that the mercenary team was responsible for the assassination and that the killing was orchestrated by an inner circle of seven mercenaries within the larger group. The magazine reported that investigators had also recovered surveillance footage of the attack. Family members of many of the detained Colombians have said that their loved ones believed they were being hired to provide personal security for a VIP in Haiti and that they did not sign on to participate in an assassination. Speaking to reporters Thursday, Colombian President Iván Duquesaidthat regardless of individual levels of insight into the operation is true intent, all would be held responsible for Moïse is killing. To Isacson, little about the kind of training the alleged assassins experienced with the US military stood out as particularly unique given the long-standing relationship between the US and Colombia: In any random sample of some two dozen mid-level Colombian military veterans, it is more likely than not that some amount of US training would turn up. “They are not training every recruit or every private, but they are training a lot of people at that level,” Isacson said. “So it is very likely they would have received us trading just through sheer statistical probability.”Still, Isacson argued, the fact that the mercenaries’ training was not unusual does not mean there is not reason for concern. “I worry about the USs being associated with or even increasing the lethal skills of military and police units around the region that are either abusive or corrupt or undemocratic, and of course that is always been a huge risk in Colombia, given its human rights record. So it does require a lot of scrutiny to make sure that we are not associating ourselves with or improving the lethal skills of people who end up doing what we just saw in Haiti, but also people who end up doing what we just saw in Bogotá and Cali since late April,” he said, referring to recent and violent crackdowns by Colombian security forces on protesters. “We do not want to be associated with that.",1,1,The Intercept

AdvertisementAccording to the latest study, an abundance of methane-hungry microbial communities on the bottom of the ocean are responsible for keeping much of that methane locked up in marine ecosystems. Without these microbes, scientists surmise Earth is atmosphere would host more methane -- making it even warmer than it already is. When scientists surveyed microbe communities surrounding seven geologically distinct seafloor seeps, they found the group colonizing carbonate rocks was responsible for the highest rates of methane consumption ever recorded.""The microbes in these carbonate rocks are acting like a methane bio filter consuming it all before it leaves the ocean,"" senior study author Peter Girguis, professor of organismic and evolutionary biology at Harvard University, said in a press release. Though carbonate rocks are common on the ocean floor, they only sometimes form the kind of porous, chimney-like structures found rising from the seabed at a deep sea site just off the coast of Point Dume, California. That is where scientists found the record-setting microbes.""We measured the rate at which the microbes from the carbonates eat methane compared to microbes in sediment,"" said Girguis. ""We discovered the microbes living in the carbonates consume methane 50 times faster than microbes in the sediment.""Advertisement""We often see that some sediment microbes from methane-rich mud volcanoes, for example, may be five to ten times faster at eating methane, but 50 times faster is a whole new thing. Moreover, these rates are among the highest, if not the highest, we have measured anywhere,"" Girguis said.""These rates of methane oxidation, or consumption, are really extraordinary, and we set out to understand why,"" co-author Jeffrey J Marlow, former postdoctoral researcher at Harvard, also said in the release. By efficiently capturing methane as it seeps out of seafloor vents and converting it into bicarbonate, microbes help construct these unusual carbonate rock chimneys. Scientists suspect the carbonate chimneys they call home -- and their mineral surroundings -- are key to their unprecedented metabolic capabilities. Researchers found some of the microbial communities colonizing carbonate rocks are surrounded by pyrite, which is electrically conductive. Efficient electron exchange, the researchers hypothesized, may explain why these microbes can eat so much methane so quickly.""These very high rates are facilitated by these carbonates which provide a framework for the microbes to grow,"" Girguis said.""The system resembles a marketplace where carbonates allow a bunch of microbes to aggregate in one place and grow and exchange -- in this case, exchange electrons -- which allows for more methane consumption,"" Girguis said. AdvertisementGirguis, Marlow and their research partners recently recreated a diversity of seafloor environs in the lab and are now studying how microbes metabolize methane under varying conditions. Researchers hope their ongoing experiments will reveal how different characteristics of the carbonate environment influence metabolic rates among the methane-eating microbes.""First, we need to understand how these microbes sustain their metabolic rate, whether they are in a chimney or in the sediment. And we need to know this in our changing world in order to build our predictive power,"" Marlow said.""Once we clarify how these many interconnected factors come together to turn methane to rock, we can the n ask how we might apply these anaerobic methane-eating microbes to other situations, like landfills with methane leaks,"" he said.",2,2,UPI
173,Pandemic 2.0: Amazon Deforestation Could Unleash A Wave Of Pandemics Sooner Than We Think,-19.0,39.67,https://therealnews.com/columns/pandemic-2-brazil-coronavirus-bolsonaro-amazon-indigenous-people,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-news-network-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-09,23,"Picture the scale of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the novel coronavirus spread from Wuhan, China,global deaths from COVID-19have surpassed 400,000. Economic loss estimates range from an optimistic$3.3 trillion up to $82 trillion in case of a depression. And social norms changed overnight as people adjusted to self-isolation, face coverings, and social distancing. Now imagine the world coping with a new pandemic every month. This is not a prophecy or a piece of dark fiction, and surely not a plot for an upcoming Hollywood flick. This is what the world is leading climate scientists are warning will happen when, not if, the planet is ecological balance with microorganisms tips over, unleashing waves of pandemics of varying severity.:At the heart of this cataclysmic scenario is the loss of global ecological reservoirs, such as the Amazon rainforest, which maintains the delicate balance between the natural world and the human colony. But despite the recent fires that ravaged the rainforest and drew global calls for action, Jair Bolsonaro is right-wing government is encouraging rapid deforestation to facilitate agribusinesses owned by political establishment figures with links to Brazil is military and police. Antonio Oviedo, a research erat the Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA), a nonprofit defending indigenous rights in Brazil,told The Real Newsthat deforestation in the Amazon in the first three months of 2020 was 51% higher than in the corresponding period last year. “And it shot up by a whopping 170% in April compared to April 2019, and about 90% of this deforestation is illegal,” Antonio added worryingly. Terra Brasilis, another Brazilian organization, estimates the current year (Aug 2019—Jul 2020) is the worst ever for deforestation, with almost 6000 km2of the Amazon chopped down. That is almost twice the area cleared last year. According to Greenpeace, the present waves of deforestation “pose a serious and imminent threat to the roughly one third of indigenous land that has not yet been demarcated by the state, and will encourage even greater deforestation.” Bolsonaro is government has tried to pass legislation in recent weeks to legalize huge land seizures, mostly comprising indigenous territories. The proposed law is still before Brazil is congress and is expected to go to a vote in the coming weeks. Dismantling of Environmental Institutions and SafeguardsTo facilitate large-scale agribusinesses and other commercial use of the Amazonian forest, Bolsonaro is government has employed tactics such as de funding regulatory bodies and relaxing environmental safeguards through executive orders. A number of indigenous lands in Brazil await formal approval from the president is office for their protected status. On April 16, the government agency which implements policies relating to indigenous people, FUNAI, received instructions that those lands can be made available for agribusiness. Claudio Angelo, spokesperson for the Climate Observatory organization in Brasilia, estimates some 90 indigenous territories out of more than 700 lands are awaiting the president is signing, the last step in a lengthy bureaucratic land claim process. The pressure on federal regulatory agencies to relax rules has emboldened illegal operators who have reportedly moved inside protected lands. Oviedo says an estimated 20,000 illegal gold miners are inside the Yanomami lands alone—the largest of indigenous tribes located in the north of Brazil, with lands equaling the size of Portugal—“and they are within 5 kilometers of local tribes.” He added that in March FUNAI enacted a law forbidding outsiders from entering the protected lands, “but illegal miners are crossing over freely, increasing the risk for native populations’ exposure to COVID-19.”Despite the attempts by native tribes to self-isolate and move deep inside the forest, COVID-19 has spread to indigenous communities, causing the deaths and suffering forewarned by experts. According to theSpecial Secretariat for Indigenous Health(Sesai), Brazil is federal body for providing healthcare for the native peoples, 2085 indigenous people have tested positive for COVID-19, and 82 have died so far. But theBrazilian Indigenous Peoples’ Association(APIB), which tracks all indigenous cases, has reported 2600cases and 247 deaths among 94 ethnic groups. APIB claims the actual count is likely much higher due to underreporting. And health provisions are nauseatingly inadequate because of the budget cuts that severely constrain Sesai and its suboffices from delivering healthcare to the native people. Problems caused by Sesai is shoestring budget are compounded by low staffing and a dearth of ventilators, and the nearest healthcare units are located nearly 200 miles from native communities,reportssuggest. “Medical facilities are working as hubs for spreading COVID-19 because of untrained staff and indigenous people have reportedly contracted COVID-19 after visiting the re,” Oviedotold The Real News. “Also, food security is becoming another problem and indigenous people are told to go to cities for food assistance, which serves as an invitation to get the virus and take it back to the community,” he added. A Pandemic A MonthThis systematic dismantling of regulatory bodies and healthcare systems that protect the Amazon and its native people has already resulted in massive deforestation and created conditions for environmental catastrophe of epic proportions. In an exclusive interview with The Real News,Dr. Carlos Nobre, the leading environmental scientist in Brazil, said all new COVID and SARS viruses that cause epidemics and pandemics are generated by the lack of ecological balance with microorganisms.“There are hundreds of species of coronavirus present in the Amazon and there are hundreds of thousands of other types of viruses found the re,” Dr. Nobre said. “If we disturbed this most diverse sanctuary of biological diversity that would mean disturbing the ecological balance of millions of species of microorganisms. If we moved beyond the tipping point in the next few decades, we have to be prepared for one pandemic a month.”Dr. Nobre adds the native people of the Amazon survived in the forest for 11,000 years because of their sense of maintaining a balance with the natural world. “Given the number of microorganisms existing in the forest, you can be certain that a virus or bacteria would have exterminated them. But they are very smart and they evolved the vision of living with the forest. And for 11,000 years there was not a single pandemic across the indigenous communities.” He lamented that the number of indigenous people in Brazil fell from 10-15 million to a mere 70,000 in the 1940s. “We are the ones to cause that imbalance and bringing viruses to these native tribes.”Dr. Nobre is three decades of research also warn of the Amazon reaching a tipping point in the face of growing deforestation, urbanization and global warming. “Those three factors happening simultaneously are driving a very large portion of the forest becoming a dry savanna (a drier forest compared to tropical rainforest where it rains all year). In our estimates, we are seeing 50%-60% of the Amazon almost at the edge of suburbanization and the tipping point almost being crossed because the forest in those areas are becoming drier.” He warned that if global warming and deforestation is not halted, most of the Amazon will irreversibly begin the transition to savanna, inevitably disturbing the ecological balance. The Right-Wing Orchestration of Death and DestructionDr. Nobre blames the right-wing government of Jair Bolsonaro for encouraging illegal activity inside the Amazon. “The political discourse the president has been issuing since he came into office in January 2019 has been encouraging environmental criminals because they feel there will be no punishment.” He observed that Brazil is law-enforcing agencies have shrinking budgets, and some of the heads of divisions were fired because they were acting lawfully. “So, the message that went to the Amazon criminals was, we are never going to jail anymore because we have a president who supports what we are doing, who supports opening up more areas, who supports invasion of indigenous territories for illegal mining for illegal selective logging.”Christian Poirier of Amazon Watch echoes Dr. Nobre is sentiment. In an interview with The Real News, Poirier said the Bolsonaro regime has been an abject disaster for the Amazon, its peoples, and for the planet. “When we saw essentially fascists come into power last year with a package of regressions, regressive actions to cut down hard-fought human rights and environmental protections, we saw a process that has led us to the catastrophe we are seeing to day, which is actually not being talked about enough.” He lamented that not enough is being said about the catastrophic impact the Amazon is destruction will have on the climate crisis, and that “all of this is being spurred simultaneously by this recklessly, this criminally irresponsible regime.”Highlighting the mitigation actions Amazon Watch is undertaking, Christian Poirier said: “We helped spearhead a moratorium on all industrial activities and criminal activities in and around indigenous territories during the COVID crisis that were signed onto by more than 200 global organizations and endorsed by all of the principal indigenous federations and organizations in the Amazon areas in which we work.” He said this action calls on governments to fulfill their duties, and for companies to be mindful of the consequences of their actions in the Amazon. “These businesses should know their activities are exacerbating this crisis gravely and they need to respect the moratorium at this critical moment,” he asserted.

Below the text, two electoral maps of the US show that a vote count update appeared to grant the former Vice President 138,339 votes and not a single one to his rival President Donald Trump. The tweet was deleted with an apology, but the same maps were shared tens of thousands of times onTwitter,Instagram,Facebookand i nan article that pointed to a discrepancy of 138,339 votes in Michigan. Most posts denounced the numbers as proof of fraud by Democrats in the Midwestern state. However, the maps actually show a 138,339 drop in Biden votes after a correction due to human error. Caroline Wilson, county clerk for the central Michigan county of Shiawassee, told AFP by phone, “I added an extra zero accidentally,” the reby reporting 153,710 votes for Biden instead of 15,371.“The minute it was discovered, it was corrected, probably within 20 minutes, so I am amazed how fast this spread,” Wilson added. She said the state of Michigan alerted her office of the mistake “because we do not even have that many voters.”The central Michigan county only has55,612 registered voters. When Biden is 153,710 votes were lowered to 15,371 votes in a correction, 138,339 votes were removed from the Democrat is total tally without any changes to Trump is numbers.“The information contained in the graphic is entirely false,” Michigan Department of State spokeswoman Tracy Wimmer told AFP in an email about the map on Twitter. The image in the tweet showed two screen shots of the interactive vote results map from election data analystDecision Desk HQ(DDHQ). The two screen shots were taken at different times in the early hours of November 4. At 4:59 am, DDHQ reported results for Michigan that indicated 153,710 votes for Biden in Shiawassee county, promptingTwitteruser @ENGOLD to point out a mistake. DDHQacknowledgedthe mistake later on November 4, calling it a “clerical error” from the Shiawassee County data, and updated results on its web site to reflect the changes, giving Trump a victory in the county with 23,154 votes.

The Trump campaign said control of the Senate is at stake in the Georgia runoffs — which would only be true of Kamala Harris was vice president. The Trump campaign on Thursday tacitly admitted that President-elect Joe Biden won the 2020 election, even as Donald Trump himself is pushing lies about the outcome and trying to overturn the results to steal a second term. The admission came in a statement about Biden is upcoming campaign trip to Georgia, where Biden will stump for Democratic nominees Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff — who are locked in competitive runoffs against two GOP senators.“Control of the US Senate is at stake,” Trump campaign manager Bill Stepiensaidin the statement, arguing the importance that Republicans win those two runoffs. Of course, the only way control of the Senate is at stake is if Biden is sworn in. That is because Republicans will hold at least 50 seats in the Senate when the new Congress is sworn in. If Democrats win the two Georgia Senate seats — ousting GOP Sens. David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler — the Senate is partisan split would be 50-50, with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris serving as the tie-breaking vote to give Democrats a majority. Stepien is inadvertent admission that Biden will be president comes as Trump is refusing to accept the reality that he lost reelection. Not only is Trump refusing to accept reality, but he is tweeting a steady stream of lies that falsely say mass voter fraud led to Biden is victory, and that Trump is the actual winner.

The division used the guidelines ""to protect its bottom line,"" Spero wrote in his order this week. United Behavioral Health (UBH) ""lied to state regulators"" to conceal misconduct, the judge wrote, and executives responsible for the guidelines ""deliberately attempted to mislead the court at trial in this matter.""""The harm that UBH caused by applying overly restrictive guidelines to make coverage determinations goes beyond the money spent by class members who could afford to obtain the treatment that UBH refused to cover,"" Spero wrote.""Rather, it was the unfair adjudication of claims that was experienced by all of the class members (and for some deprived them of much-needed treatment that should have been covered by their health plans) ...,"" he added.

So what does it look and feel like the day after its fall?The Taliban are everywhere, at the checkpoints which used to be official police or army barricades. There is not much panic in the city to day, as there was yesterday. The Taliban are controlling traffic, they are searching cars, and they are especially searching those vehicles which used to belong to police and the army, all of which they have confiscated. If there are Taliban fighters the mselves driving those vehicles now, they are stopped at checkpoints, too. They told us that they checked these vehicles to make sure they were not looters and thieves disguised as Taliban. The scenes at the airport were catastrophic. On the road there were families, children, young, old, all walking along the 2km (1.2 miles) road. People are struggling to flee this country. Most are just waiting, on the green belt in the middle of the road. I am talking about more than 10,000 people at the airport. At the approach to the main entrance gates, there were Taliban with heavy weapons trying to disperse people by shooting in the air. People who wanted to get in were climbing the walls, the gates, even the barbed wire. Every single person was pushing to get in. We spoke to an eyewitness who was stuck at the airport on Sunday. He had a flight to go to Uzbekistan, but it did not happen. Officials the n abandoned the airport. People had arrived without any tickets or passports - they thought they could get on any plane and be able to fly to anywhere else in the world, the eyewitness said. Thousands of people were stuck inside the airport, without food or water. There were many women and children - and disabled people, too. But if you go into the city centre, life appears to be normal. There is a lot less traffic, most of the shops are closed. But people look much calmer than yesterday - yesterday, everybody was furious. There was a big traffic gridlock. I have only seen a few women on the street - some single women as well, without escort. Some were wearing blue burkas, but I also saw some wearing surgical face masks and headscarves. And the Taliban seemed alright with them. There is no music on the streets at all. They used to play background music at the hotel, but it has stopped. Staff are scared. The city, however, is still carrying on. It is calm. I have not spoken to many residents, but the local taxi driver I use was kind of alright with the takeover. Surprisingly, I have seen people greeting Taliban militants - saying ""hello, more power to you, best of luck"", that sort of thing. Taliban fighters seem happy, too - I have spoken to a couple of the m, ground soldiers on patrol. We tried to get into the presidential palace but they did not let us in. They said we needed permission from the high command. But the militants I saw were friendly to us. I was scared yesterday a bit, fearful there was going to be violence and things like that. But luckily nothing happened. It was so quiet and calm. I could not believe that the capital had changed hands after 20 years and it was all so quiet.

According to the Washington Post isJames Hohmann, Cotton “suggested” that “Republicans should be willing to keep racking up debt to maintain power.” But Cruz vehemently disagreed, declaring “What in the hell are we doing?”Cotton, Hohmann notes, “argued that the full conference needs to focus on protecting their most vulnerable members. Cotton postulated that Democrats would spend more money if they win the Senate majority in November — and the refore, it is cheaper in the long run to allow the size of the spending package to grow with more goodies to benefit incumbents who are up for reelection.”It remains to be seen whether or not President Donald Trump will win a second term in November. Many recent polls have shown Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — in some of the m, by double digits. But whether Trump leaves the White House in January 2021 or January 2025, Republicans will eventually have to debate what a post-Trump GOP will look like — and as Hohmann sees it, the clash between Cruz and Cotton could foreshadow a clash between the Republican senators in 2024.“Cruz and Cotton are among the small clique of ambitious Republican senators in their forties who have been laying the groundwork to run for president in 2024, along with Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Josh Hawley (Mo.),” Hohmann explains. “The dueling stances Cruz and Cotton staked out behind closed doors offer an early taste of the ideological battles we can expect as Republicans increasingly vie to take the torch from President Trump. These fights will flare up faster and hotter if the president loses in November. Others outside the Senate, such as Vice President (Mike) Pence and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, are also expected to compete for the nod.”",1,0,AlterNet

Recent declassifications of FBI documents show that not only did the FBI know the sub source of the dossier could not vouch for the information in the document, but the FBI interviewed Christopher Steele in September of 2017 and found Steele was biased and, “had statements that conflicted with explanations from two of his sub-sources about their access to Russian officials.” It is important to note, the FBI had been unable to verify anything in the dossier up to this point, despite sending multiple warrants to the FISA Court stating the opposite. What would happen if any “normal” citizen falsified documents and lied to a court?Here was another chance for the FBI to admit it was wrong and fell for a scam. But once again, it doubled down and continued to investigate innocent citizens hoping for a process crime. Does that sound like the actions of a law enforcement agency with integrity? The actions of the FBI during the Mueller Investigation drew further questions about the ethics of the agency. Take the case of Roger Stone, an unofficial advisor for President Trump. Stone was also caught up in the Russia Collusion hoax. Stone spent hours in front of Congress and the FBI during the congressional hearings and investigations. When all was said and done, he was eventually charged with a process crime. Stone had been cooperating with Congress and the FBI and showed no threat. Yet when he was charged, the FBI used an ungodly amount of force to arrest the senior citizen with no criminal record for a nonviolent crime. TheFBI sent over two dozen agent sin tactical gear and vehicles… and a boat. All this for a man with no criminal record or history of violence. To keep this in perspective, the FBI sent more people after Roger Stone than they did for mass murdererWhitey Bulger. The FBI was also kind enough to alert media unfriendly to Stone so the entire arrest could be documented for political purposes. Here, the actions of the FBI seem more inline with politics than justice. Yes, participating in a coup is bad enough, but perhaps the worst of recent FBI conduct was its action or lack of action during the USA Gymnastics sexual abuse scandal. Larry Nassar was a former USA Gymnastics team doctor and professor at Michigan State University. Over the course of Nassar is almost two-decade career, he sexually abused at least 265 young girls. Nassar has since been arrested, tried, and sentenced for his heinous crimes, but dozens of young girls could have been spared had the FBI been bothered. Between the time the FBI was first notified of Nassar is actions in July of 2015 to his arrest in November of 2016, he continued to see dozens of young girls. What was the FBI doing for almost a year and a half, while young girls were being abused?Olympian Aly Raisman told Savannah Guthriewhen she was finally contacted by the FBI, she asked them “what took so long?” She was told “we wanted to wait until the Olympics were over.” No one from the FBI has come forward to refute her claim. Supposedly, there is aDOJ OIG is investigation into what happened, but to date it is unknown what has been done or if anyone has been held to account for the FBI is failure. This is par for the course, as the FBI and DOJ like to discipline the mselves nor do they like to let Congress know when they make mistakes. Now the institutionalists on Capitol Hill and the media will say this is only a sampling of the FBI and not representative of the 99%. The problem with that theory is that the FBI tree is rotten from the core. Everyone involved in the Russia Collusion hoax was at the top of the FBI hierarchy. Everyone that lied to the FISA Court and knowingly signed documents that were false, were supposed to be the “best of the best” at the FBI One must the n ask the question, how did so many unscrupulous people get into the FBI, the n advance up the ranks to lead the agency? Is that what the FBI looks for in leadership?The FBI has become what it spent the Cold War fighting. The FBI has become an agency that investigates its political opponents, covers up its crimes, believes it is unaccountable to the people, and acts with impunity. The FBI has become the KGB.",0,0,Daily Torch
183,“F--k Him”: Rupert Murdoch Reportedly Made the Call to Bury Trump is Election Night Dreams in a Shallow Grave,-10.0,35.33,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/07/rupert-murdoch-donald-trump-arizona-2020,https://adfontesmedia.com/vanity-fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,25,"In the early-morning hours of November 4, the day after the 2020 election,held a news conference in the East Room of the White House in which he falsely claimed that the fact that he had been ahead in the early tallying of votes, and the n later behind, meant that the election had been stolen from him. “This is a fraud on the American public,” hedeclared. “This is an embarrassment to this country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.” Obviously that was not true at all—Trump had not won anything because not all of the votes had been counted yet. Still, in some states it had become clear that he was very likely going to lose, hence Fox News is decision to declareArizona forJoe Biden. At the time the call from the right-wing outlet, made before any other major network, shocked the country—and according to a new book, it wasRupert Murdochwho gave it the greenlight, with some less-than-charitable things to say about Trump!Insiderreportsthat is forthcoming book,includes a scene in whichLachlan Murdoch,the nonagenarian billionaire is son, got a call from Fox is election desk saying it was ready to announce Biden had won Arizona, which he the n took to the to p:The book [notes] that the Murdochs—who spearhead a vast right-wing media empire—had “every reason” to delay calling Arizona at the time, given Fox is steadfast allegiance to Trump and the fact that no other network had made the call yet. “Lachlan got his father on the phone to ask if he wanted to make the early call. His father, with signature grunt, assented, adding, ‘F--- him,’” Wolff wrote. The book [says] that Fox News anchor the n called Trump is lead social media strategist,Jason Miller,to let him know the network was going to call Arizona for Biden. “Miller involuntarily rose from his seat. ‘What the f---?’ he said out loud, looking around and seeing the still-merry and untroubled faces in the Map Room”... Wolff wrote. Hemmer reportedly replied: “That is what they are doing. That is what they are going with.”“Who?” Miller asked.“The election desk,” Hemmer said, adding that the network is decision was going to be aired imminently. The decision to call Arizona for Biden was a pivotal moment on election night, indicating the Democrat was poised to win the traditionally Republican-leaning state and complicating Trump is ability to declare an early victory in the overall race. In a statement, a Fox News Media spokesperson told the Hive: ""This account is completely false.who leads the FOX News Decision Desk made the Arizona call on election night and FOX News Media PresidentJay Wallacewas the n called in the control room. Any other version of the story is wildly inaccurate.” Regarding Bill Hemmer is call to Miller, a Fox News spokesperson insisted “This never happened and is completely untrue.”Trump was unsurprisingly livid about the Arizona decision and, as my colleague reported at the time, personally called Murdoch “to scream about the call and demand a retraction. Murdoch refused, and the call stood.” (Jared Kushneralso reportedly tried to convince the Fox News founder to withdraw the call, a “desperate” plea that fell on deaf ears.)Biden ultimatelywonArizona by roughly 10,000 votes. But if anyone thought Fox is (and Murdoch is) decision to momentarily refrain from serving as a right-wing propaganda machine suggested the network had changed its ways, they were deeply mistaken.the politics editor at the time, was fire din January. And the network is hosts have, of course,perpetuatedthe lie that Trump won the election, while pushing bullshit conspiracy the ories about the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Insaneopen carry laws? A ban on abortions after six weeks?Anti-trans legislation? The potential disenfranchisement of millions of people? “Gelatinous tubeworm”? The Lone Star State has got it all. Per:Republican lawmakers in Texas on Thursday launched their second effort this year to pass new voting restrictions after Democrats blocked them in May with a dramatic walkout at the state Capitol. The legislature convened Thursday for a special session called by Governor(R) to enact a laundry list of conservative priorities, including a ban of transgender athletes on youth sports teams and beefed-up border security. But Abbott has made clear that “election integrity” is a top priority, and Republicans filed bills in the House and Senate that include many of the same voting provisions they sought to enact earlier in the year. The new election proposals include a number of restrictions championed by former presidentThe measures would ban several election programs implemented last year to help people vote during the coronavirus pandemic, including drive-through voting and 24-hour and late-night voting. Voting rights advocates noted that voters of color used these programs disproportionately, meaning they could disproportionately feel the impact of the restrictions. In May, after Democratic lawmakers staged a walkout to stop a piece of legislation viewed as one of the worst voter-suppression bills in the country from becoming a law, Abbott threatened to cut off funding for the Texas Legislature,tweeting, “I will veto Article 10 of the budget passed by the legislature. Article 10 funds the legislative branch. No pay for those who abandon their responsibilities. Stay tuned.” He also vowed to pass the scuttled bill—which would restrict polling hours, make it harder to vote by mail, give more power to partisan poll watchers, and increase punishments for mistakes made by election officials—in a special session. The so-called election-security proposals are “based on a lie that there was rampant fraud in our elections, and on the ‘big lie’ that Donald Trump actually won the last election,” state Representativewho urged Texas Democrats to walk out on May 30, told the.“That is what this is all about—so they can curry favor with Donald Trump and his supporters. That is exactly what is going on here.”This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.

""If I die from catching COVID-19 from being forced back into Pinellas County Schools, you can drop my dead body right here!"" shouts one demonstrator in my new video. But schools rarely spread COVID-19. Studieson tens of thousands of people found ""no consistent relationship between in-person K-12 schooling and the spread of the coronavirus.""Even Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, encouraged schools to reopen, saying ""close the bars and keep the schools open.""Heritage Foundation education researcher Lindsey Burke points out that studies in 191 countries find ""no consistent link between reopening schools and increased rates of COVID transmission.""She says schools are not COVID-19 hotspots.""But it is logical that they would be,"" I push back. ""Kids are bunched together.""""Positivity rates in schools are generally below those in the broader community,"" she says. Closed schools hurt low-income students most because they have fewer learning alternatives. The privileged get around union restrictions. Almost all of California is government-run schools are closed, but California Governor Gavin Newsom is sends his kids to a private school that stayed open.""Choice for me, but not for the e!"" quips Burke. Kids blocked from attending school suffer more than academic losses, she adds. ""Kids are social animals. A lack of their ability to interact in person, see their friends, see their teachers, is really having an impact.""That is not a good enough reason to open schools, say the unions. In my video, one San Antonio teacher argues: ""We understand that in-person learning is more effective than online teaching, but that is not the question. The question is what is safest.""""But that is really not at the heart of why unions are trying to keep schools closed,"" says Burke. ""It is really a question of politics.""Definitely. Uniondemandsinclude all sorts of things unrelated to teacher safety. The Los Angeles union demands: de funding the police, a moratorium on charter schools, higher taxes on the wealthy and ""Medicare for All.""""The Oregon Education Association ... said they wanted the state to halt any transfers to charter schools,"" says Burke. ""There is clearly no health issue in a virtual setting.""It is revealing that government-run schools fight to stay closed, while most businesses -- private schools, restaurants, hair salons, gyms, etc., fight to be allowed to open. Why is that? Burke points out that government schools ""receive funding regardless of whether or not they reopen.""So, union workers get paid even when they do not work. Not working seems to be a big union goal. At one point, LA teachers even secured a contract saying that they only are ""required to provide instruction ... four hours per day"" and they will ""not be required to teach classes using live video conferencing.""Nice non-work if you can get it. Yet, the teachers unions keep winning. They will win more now that Democrats control the federal government. Congress' last stimulus package forbids any funds to be used to expand school choice: no ""vouchers, tuition tax credit programs, education savings accounts, scholarship programs, or tuition assistance programs.""So, students lose. Parents lose. Taxpayers lose. America loses. Unions win. We asked 21 teachers unions to respond to the criticisms in this column. Not one would.

Don Jr., who is one of dozens of people in President Trump is inner circle who have caught COVID-19, apparently tested positive earlier this week, and a spokesperson told Bloomberg that he is asymptomatic and now self-isolating. His girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, tested positive for the virus over the summer. It is not clear how or where Trump Jr. was infected or if his case is linked to the earlier White House outbreaks. Also on Friday, White House aide Andrew Giuliani, who is Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani is son, revealed that he had tested positive for COVID-19 as well. The younger Giuliani had attended the bizarre conspiracy theory-saturated press conference in a packed room at the Republican National Committee headquarters where his father and other members of Trump is legal team held to make a case for overturning the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Trump legal adviser Jenna Ellis, who took part in the press conference, said Friday that both she and Rudy Giuliani had tested negative. Bloomberg News also reports that Hannah McInnis, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, also tested positive earlier this month, which may be another case linked to the earlier outbreak that struck Pence is team the week before the election, infecting several staffers including his top aides. That was one of at least three serious outbreaks linked to the White House in the last two months. Two weeks ago, numerous people who attended an indoor Election Night party at the White Houselater tested positive for COVID-19, including President Trump is chief of staff, Mark Meadows, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, White House political director Brian Jack, Trump campaign adviser David Bossie, and many others, including a large number of Secret Service agents. Two Republican senators, Florida is Rick Scott andIowa is Chuck Grassley, also reported positive tests this week. More than 193,000 new cases of the coronavirus were reported in the US on Friday, a new national record, as COVID-19 continues to rapidly spread across the country.

Some gave typically political speeches, but all had one goal in mind: electing Joe Biden as the 46th president of the USs. Not only was the focus on electing Biden but also on the continued destruction being carried out by “president” Donald Trump. Some gave powerful speeches in “no holds barred” fashion, including Governor Andrew Cuomo. He did a fantastic job with New York, and many believe he could do the same across the country, but last night was about Joe Biden. One of the most poignant messages came from Kristin Urquiza, whose father died from listening to “president” Trump is false messaging about coronavirus. One of her most powerful messages was: “His only preexisting condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that, he paid with his life.” Urquiza pledged to vote for Joe Biden in her father is honor. Her father is an unfortunate example of listening to Donald Trump. Democrats are working hard to reach those who fail to see the perils of listening to Trump, and we can only hope that their urgent calls shook some people awake. Bernie Sanders was extremely clear that he expects his followers to vote for Joe Biden. He pointed out that he and Biden do not agree on everything but that Joe is making moves in the right direction, and four more years of Trump will ensure that none of the progressive policies make it past their own thoughts. The speech of the evening, however, goes to Michelle Obama. Michelle was so convincing, so real, and at times, very emotional. She laid out from first-hand experience how challenging the job of president is and how the person in that office must rise to the occasion. One of the most compelling things Obama said was: “being president does not change who you are; it reveals who you are,” and that is certainly true when it comes to Donald Trump, a self-centered narcissist who does nothing unless it benefits him. He refuses to listen to science, preferring to listen to “my pillow man” and some doctor who has absolutely no experience in epidemiology and who believes we should all go out and infect each other to defeat the virus. As expected, Trump had to come back at Michelle Obama, and just like his plagiarizing wife, he had to use Michelle is words, claiming that she was “in over her head.” No, that is you, Trump, and it is glaringly obvious. The worst thing about Trump is inability to do the job he stole is his refusal to listen to those more knowledgeable to find a solution. He would rather kill us all with his stupidity. Face it, Trump: Just like Barack, Michelle showed you up, not that it is really that difficult to do. Anyone who believes his own hype more than the evidence pointing him in the face is headed for a downfall, and we cannot wait for Trump is to come.",1,0,Palmer Report

But seriously folks, Trump, who is the president of people with a nice set shot, has a whole lot of thoughts on basketball players kneeling during the national anthem because he knows it excites his base when he says something. Since the NBA restart, the majority of players and coaches have been locking arms and taking a knee during the playing of the national anthem to protest the over-policing of communities of color.“When I see people kneeling during the playing and disrespect ing our flag and national anthem, what I do personally is turn off the game,” Trump said Wednesday morning in a phone interview with,according to TMZ Sports.“I think it is disgraceful. We work with [the NBA], we worked with them very hard trying to get open. I was pushing for them to get open. Then I see everybody kneeling during the anthem. That is not acceptable to me. When I see them kneeling during the game, I just turn off the game. I have no interest in the game. Let me tell you this, plenty of other people out the re, too.”Trump also claimed, without proof, that NBA ratings are way down because Trump only gets his rating numbers from what white people are watching. According toYardBarker.com, “ratings are up 14 percent from when the season was suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.”This is not the first time that Trump has butted his orange-dusted nose in sports business. Miami Heat forward Meyers Leonard is president famously called NFL players’ moms “bitches” for kneeling during the national anthem in 2016. Since the season checked ball, only four people — two players (one being Leonard) and two coaches — have stood for the national anthem, YardBarker.com reports. Players have been wearing social justice buzzwords on the backs of their jersey, but as one person noted on Twitter, I have not seen one player with the jersey name “Stimulus Check.”",1,0,The Root

The news outlet -- which has chronicled the deeply divisive fight in Southlakeover how to teach race and racism in schools -- obtained an audio recording from a district meeting that included discussions about how to comply with a new Texas law, which lawmakers say was intended to bar “critical race theory” from classrooms. From the start, educators vehemently opposed the bill, saying it was vague and would have a chilling effect on their ability to have honest conversations about America is past and present. The new law -- similar to ones passed in other conservative states -- lists several broad topics that ca not be discussed and sets guidelines for talking about “controversial” subjects. It comes as conservative pundits and politicians have conflated critical race theory with schools’ diversity and inclusion efforts and anti-racism training, among other ideas. Receive our in-depth coverage of education issues and stories that affect North Texans. “Just try to remember the concepts of [House Bill] 3979,” Gina Peddy, a Carroll administrator, said in the recording obtained by NBC News. “And make sure that if you have a book on the Holocaust, that you have one that has an opposing, that has other perspectives.”A teacher responded: “How do you oppose the Holocaust?”The author of a similar Senate bill, Senator Bryan Hughes, denied that this was a proper interpretation of the new law. State Senator Kelly Hancock, R-North Richland Hills, wrote on Twitter that “Southlake just got it wrong.”“School administrators should know the difference between factual historical events and fiction,” Hancock wrote. “No legislation is suggesting the action this administrator is promoting.”Carroll ISD Superintendent Lane Ledbetter issued an apology to Southlake families late Thursday. He said the district recognizes that “there are not two sides of the Holocaust.”“As we continue to work through implementation of HB3979, we also understand this bill does not require an opposing viewpoint on historical facts,” he wrote. “As a district we will work to add clarity to our expectations for teachers and once again apologize for any hurt or confusion this has caused.”The comments stirred outrage. Texas Democratic Party Co-Executive Director Hannah Roe Beck condemned actions she called “terrifying.”“We are seeing books banned, educators reprimanded for teaching authentic history, and kids deprived of their right to learn about the world they are growing up in,” she said in a statement. “Texas Republicans are censoring education to pander to right wing extremists -- and putting Texas families and kids in danger while they do.”The DMN Education Lab deepens the coverage and conversation about urgent education issues critical to the future of North Texas.

The implication was that the only reason Love was selected was because of the color of his skin, and that the selection committee would somehow be uncomfortable with an all-black Olympic team roster. On Sunday, Rose “apologized” for his comments in a 42-minute Instagram video.“If I feel like Kevin Love should make the team or not, I am entitled to my opinion,” Rosesaid, as reported by Fox News. “You do not have to like my opinion, you do not have to like me. There is a lot of people trying to assassinate my character or whatever, but those people, some of the m, have been trying to for like 30 years … that is how it is when you have the nerve in a lot of peoples’ estimation to be outspoken.”“But you know why I am apologizing right now? To the game. Because I am what the game made me,” he continued. “I was raised by the all-time greats and you know what I would never want to do? Disappoint [Rose is late mother] Jeanie Rose or disappoint the all-time greats that raised me.”That is not an apology, but that is really not what we should be focusing on. While I did not like what Rose had to say, I am also against cancel culture, so firing Rose is not a valid option. The real crux of the issue is that Rose is comfortable saying racially charged words on a major show on the largest sports network around. Exactly, Jalen. But while we should all be able to disagree, this simply is not the case. If the roles were reversed, with a white person speaking about a black player in the same manner, he or she would be immediately removed — live on-air — and fired. That individual would never work in sports again. And yet — based on the history of ESPN and their handling of similar situations — it is doubtful that Rose even needed to apologize for his words. In fact, Rose made it clear in his video that no one pressured him to apologize. For example, in 2020, ESPN football analyst Domonique Foxworth went on Bomoni Jones’ pod cast and discussed why he rootsagainstBuffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen. I am fully aware that I have biases… And my biases are not based on Josh Allen, it is based on the people defending Josh Allen. I would be 100% lying if I said when Josh does something dumb, a little part of me does not get happy. It is not because I do not want Josh to succeed, it is because the people who are telling me that Josh is the ‘second coming’, and Josh is better than everybody, are people with American flags, and dogs, and skulls and crossbones in their avi is, and when you go take a dip into their tweet history the re is some really concerning retweets and likes. Foxworth is offensive comments were called out by Fox Sports’ Clay Travis, yet the backlash did not result in any punishment for Foxworth.“Statements like these are fundamentally unfair and unbelievably stupid, and not to mention racist, let is be honest here,” Travissaid. “If any white ESPN analyst said he roots against Lamar Jackson because of the people who root for Lamar Jackson he would be fired on the spot, and it would be a major national story…”Travis alluded to the hypocrisy of ESPN, allowing some to say whatever thought comes to mind while others constantly face pressure to to e the company line.“We ca not have a marketplace of ideas where some people are allowed to say whatever they want, and other people are not able to say whatever THEY want. If you are not going to condemn stupidity across the board, regardless of who is being stupid, the n you are fundamentally failing in your analysis of any argument…” Travis added. But we no longer live in a world where the rules are applied equally to everyone, regardless of race or creed. What Rose said is undeniably offensive. However, the real issue is that he felt comfortable enough to say it on ESPN in the first place. Joe Morgan is the Sports Reporter for The Daily Wire.

191,Pete Buttigieg among Joe Biden is new picks for key cabinet roles - find out who his choices are and why they matter,-5.67,45.33,https://news.sky.com/story/pete-buttigieg-among-joe-bidens-new-picks-for-key-cabinet-roles-find-out-who-his-choices-are-and-why-they-matter-12140564,https://adfontesmedia.com/sky-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-18,25,"Joe Biden has largely finalis ed the cabinet he wants to work with after entering the White House. Almost all have connections to the administration, with some having relationships with Mr Biden that date back many years. If all are confirmed, his picks will mark several firsts for America - including the first woman to lead national intelligence, the first Latino and immigrant to lead the Department of Homeland Security, the first black defence secretary, the first native American to serve in the cabinet and the first ever climate change envoy. But it may take time before they are all in place, as many have to be approved by the Senate, which is busy with other matters for the near future. In the meantime, Mr Biden has said he intends to appoint interim agency heads to lead cabinet agencies and departments while his nominees await confirmation. Here is who Mr Biden plans to bring on board - and more importantly, why they matter. John Kerry, the former secretary of state, will be climate envoy for national security issues. A statement released by the transition office said Mr Kerry ""will fight climate change full-time as special presidential envoy for climate and will sit on the National Security Council"". Mr Kerry is perhaps the most well-known of Mr Biden is appointments, with a lot of experience in global crises. On Twitter, he said he looked forward to working with ""young leaders of the climate movement"". Unlike others, this role does not need Senate confirmation. Janet Yellen is seen as a safe pair of hands at the tiller of the country is economy after one of the sharpest contractions in US GDP in history. She served as chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014 to 2018, when she placed a greater emphasis than previous Fed chairs on maximising employment and less focus on price inflation. Ms Yellen, if confirmed by the Senate, would be the first woman to serve as treasury secretary, after breaking ground as the first woman to chair the Fed. Mr Biden has also selected Wally Adeyemo to be Ms Yellen is deputy, which would make him the first Black deputy treasury secretary. California is attorney general has been nominated at a time when the US is grappling with one of the worst stages of the pandemic since it began. The 62-year-old Latino has been picked to lead the health agency as the daily number of dead in the US passes 4,000 and the country is aiming to vaccinate tens of millions. The former congressman will, if confirmed, will head up a team that will include Dr Rochelle Walensky to run the US Centers for Disease Control, Dr Vivek Murthy as surgeon general and Dr Anthony Fauci, as chief medical officer, in a signal of approval for an official who has faced criticism from Donald Trump. Gen Austin oversaw US forces in the Middle East under Mr Obama and would be the first black leader of the Pentagon if the Senate confirms him. He also served in 2012 as the first black vice chief of staff of the army, the service is number two ranking position. Having retired in 2016, he has been out of the military less than the required seven years, so would need a waiver from Congress to take the post. Mr Blinken has previously said Brexit was like a dog being run over by a car - a ""total mess"". He compared it to the rise of far-right leader Marine Le Pen in France. So,may have some persuading to do and some delicate conversations ahead. Like Mr Biden, expect Mr Blinken to be pushing hard on the sanctity of the Northern Irish peace deal in the aftermath of. He is widely viewed as a pragmatic centrist on foreign policy who has supported past American interventions and is well respected by some. Served as deputy homeland security secretary from 2013 to 2016. He'd be the first Latino to run the department if confirmed and will be tasked with implementing and managing the nation is immigration policies. He is a Cuban-born immigrant whose family fled the Castro revolution. He also worked as an attorney in. He will need to work on rebuilding faith in the department after President Trump, some critics say, turned it into a passive recipient of his most controversial policies. If confirmed, the former presidential nomination candidate would be the first openly gay person approved by the Senate to a cabinet position. At 38, Mr Buttigieg was one of the youngest in the large group of Democratic wanna bes who sought the chance to run for the White House in the early primaries. He had undergone a meteoric rise having only been the mayor of a small Indiana city before his presidential run. But the success he scored in some of the first contests to choose a contender to Mr Trump in January marked him out as unexpectedly popular. Likely to be working extensively with Mr Buttigieg and John Kerry will be Ms Granholm, who if confirmed will have the task of moving the country towards achieving the requirements of the Paris Accord, which Mr Biden has said he will rejoin as soon as he is inaugurated. The 61-year-old was Michigan is first female governor between 2003 and 2010 and was a strong supporter of Mr Biden is presidential bid, having worked with him in 2009 during the bailout of General Motors and Chrysler. Democratic governor of Rhode Island and a lawyer with a background in venture capital. Ms Raimondo has launched successful workforce training programs in her state. Ms Fudge has served in the House of Representatives since 2008, for Ohio is 11th congressional districtIf confirmed, she would be the second black woman to lead the department. Mr Walsh was elected mayor of Boston in 2013. He has backed both a $15 minimum wage and paid family leave and said he wants to expand union membership. After working as a federal appeals court judge since 1997, Mr Garland was nominated by Barack Obama to be a US Supreme Court judge in 2016. His nomination was blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Mr Cardona is currently the education commissioner for Connecticut. As a former teacher, his appointment would fulfil Mr Biden is pledge to choose a professional educator to lead the education department. Mr Vilsack led the US Department of Agriculture under Barack Obama, for both terms of his presidency. He was also Iowa is governor from 1999 until 2007. Mr Burns spent more than three decades as a US diplomat honing his specialities in Russia and the Middle East, including a period as ambassador to Russia. Under President Obama, he was deputy secretary of state. Mr McDonough was the White House chief of staff throughout the whole of Barack Obama is second term and also served as the president is deputy national security adviser. While he has a long history of working in national security roles, he would be the second non-veteran to head up the department. The US ambassador to the UN under President Barack Obama has been chosen to run the agency overseeing American foreign humanitarian and development aid. If confirmed by the Senate, UK-born Ms Power will head a US agency which has an annual budget of about $20 billion. Mr Biden called the 50-year-old, who was born to Irish parents and grew up in Ireland before becoming a US citizen in 1993, ""a world-renowned voice of conscience and moral clarity.""The graduate of Yale University and Harvard Law School worked as a journalist during the Balkan wars in the early 1990s and served as UN ambassador from 2013 to 2017. The former assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency will run Mr Biden is ambitious climate plans across federal government. She had previously worked for the Obama administration in the Office of Air and Radiation, and brought into action a plan to set national standards to reduce power plant carbon emissions. The plan was later discarded by Donald Trump. Mr Biden is nominee to become the next US ambassador to the UN served as Barack Obama is top diplomat on Africa from 2013 to 2017. In the role, she led US policy in Africa south of the Sahara during the West African Ebola outbreak, during which thousands of people died but many lives were saved by international intervention. She will take on a job that Mr Biden plans to restore to a cabinet level. The first black woman to occupy the role was Susan Rice, under Mr Obama. She'd be the first woman appointed to this position. Ms Haines served as deputy director of the CIA in the Obama administration before succeeding Tony Blinken as Mr Obama is deputy national security adviser. She, too, is a former aide to Mr Biden. Deb Haaland, a Democratic congresswoman from New Mexico since 2019, would be the first Native American Cabinet secretary. The member of the Pueblo of Laguna, would also be the Native American first to oversee the department, whose jurisdiction includes tribal lands. Kate Bedingfield, who Mr Biden has chosen as White House communications director, was his campaign spokeswoman. She will be part of a team that includes veteran Democratic spokeswoman Jen Psaki as press secretary. The economist at Princeton University has been nominated as chair of the Council of Economic Advisers. She would be the first black woman to lead the council, which advises the president on economic policy. She was a member of the council under Barack Obama from 2009 to 2011. Mr Biden has proposed the current chief executive of the liberal Center for American Progress think tank as head of the Office of Management and Budget. As a daughter of Indian immigrants, she would be the first Asian heritage woman to run the OMB She is expected to face a tough confirmation hearing process when it reaches the Senate.",2,2,Sky News
192,Biden Put Climate at the Heart of His Campaign. Now He is Delivered Groundbreaking Nominees,-10.33,44.67,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/17122020/biden-epa-interior-secretary-deb-haaland-michael-regan-climate/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,21,"President-elect Joe Biden rounded out his climate and environment team Thursday with ground breaking cabinet nominations at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior, agencies critical to his pledge to combat climate change and emphasize environmental justice. Michael S Regan, who has led a transformation of climate policy as North Carolina is senior environmental official under Governor Roy Cooper, was nominated to serve as EPA administrator. He would be the first Black man to run the agency that enforces such bedrock environmental laws as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, regulates power plant and tailpipe emissions and oversees cleanup of the nation is most toxic dumps. US Representative Deb Haaland, a 35th-generation New Mexican from the Pueblos of Laguna and Jemez, was nominated as the first Native American secretary of the interior, which would put her in charge of a department that manages vast federal land holdings and oversees programs that serve 1.9 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Both posts require Senate confirmation. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. A third key environmental official, Brenda Mallory, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, was chosen by Biden to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality, a key coordinating body that will oversee newly elevated councils on environmental justice. Mallory previously served as President Obama is top lawyer on the council. Biden is transition team had previously announced the nominations of other key climate and environment team members: former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm for secretary of energy, former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy as national climate advisor and Ali Zaidi, a former Obama administration official now serving as New York is deputy secretary of energy and environment, as deputy national climate advisor. Last month, Biden named former Secretary of State John Kerry, who helped negotiate the 2015 Paris climate agreement, as his global climate envoy and said he will also sit on the National Security Council. The Biden climate team faces what environmentalists describe as a Herculean rebuilding effort after four years in which the Trump administration has rolled back over 100 environmental regulations, withdrawn the nation from the Paris accord and promoted a fossil fuel agenda at about every turn. Biden put climate change near the center of his campaign, promising a $2 trillion climate and jobs plan for dramatically reducing carbon emissions and transition ing to an economy powered by renewable energy. But his political options will be limited even if he squeaks out a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate, with two wins in crucial runoff race sin Georgia on January 5. Democrats hold only a narrow margin in the HouseWith the loss of one seat in Georgia, Biden could be forced to rely heavily on federal rule-making, which requires deft leadership and executive orders, which are less durable and subject to legal challenge. If confirmed, Haaland will inherit an Interior Department after an aggressive push by the Trump administration to expand oil, gas and coal development on federal lands, along with the taint of a corruption scandal involving Trump is first Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke. Conflict-of-interest questions have also surrounded the office is current occupant, David Bernhardt, and legal uncertainty has hung over the controversial tenure of William Perry Pendley as acting director of the Bureau of Land Management. Haaland will face the challenge of undoing dozens of conservative policies only recently embedded in the department is energy, wildlife and tribal programs. A voice like mine has never been a Cabinet secretary or at the head of the Department of Interior. Growing up in my mother is Pueblo household made me fierce. I will be fierce for all of us, our planet, and all of our protected land. I am honored and ready to serve. Interior is portfolio also includes a mind-boggling—and contentious—array of duties, from managing one of every five acre sin the USs and more than 400 National Park Service units, to protecting endangered species and carrying out the scientific work of the US Geological Survey. Interior, with a record of suppressing the rights and taking the lands of Native Americans, also maintains programs for 574 federally recognized tribes through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Bureau of Education. In Haaland, the president-elect appears to be following through with campaign promises to elevate Indigenous leaders in his administration and to tackle climate change. The congresswoman, who made history two years ago as one of the first two Indigenous women to be elected to Congress, has experience in the fights for both climate and Indigenous causes. And advocates for the environment and for Indigenous rights applauded her nomination. The daughter of military service members, she spent four days in 2016 at the Standing Rock Sioux camps with activists protesting the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline.“Tribes came from everywhere to stand with the water protectors,” said Haaland, calling the effort in a article as “an environmental movement that was deep and meaningful,” especially among Native Americans. “It was significant that so many of us came together to protect water, our natural resources.”Haaland, 60, won reelection last month as one of three New Mexico Democrats in the US House of Representatives after having served as vice chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, chair of the national parks, forests, and public lands subcommittee and as a member of the Subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples of the USs. While her work includes keeping climate change at the forefront of the committee is agenda, she is also been known to press for clean energy policies that would help maintain jobs and paychecks in a leading state for fossil fuel energy. She has been a supporter of the Green New Deal and a f racking ban, which would put her at odds with Biden. With the Biden-Harris administration, federal climate action is back on the table,” said Zuni tribal member and New Mexico farmer Jim Enote, who is also CEO of the Native-led Colorado Plateau Foundation and soon-to-be board chairman of the environmental advocacy group, the Grand Canyon Trust. The American Petroleum Institute is Mike Sommers said in a news release that the oil and gas industry is ready to work with Haaland and the Biden administration on climate change.“In the year ahead, we will continue to advocate for policies that promote technological innovation, advance modern energy infrastructure and support access to natural gas and oil resources—both on federal and private lands—which will be critical to rebuilding our economy and maintaining America is status as a global energy leader,” Sommers said, emphasizing that the campaign made promises to the energy work force and millions of indirect jobs. Regan may be especially well suited to lead the EPA, an agency that has been downsized and demoralized under Trump, with his fossil fuel and deregulatory agenda. Regan took over the leadership of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality in 2017 under similar circumstances, following the administration of Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican, and his top environmental regulator, Donald R. van der Vaart, whom critics have described as a crusading idealogue.“They were taking climate change off websites,” Dan Crawford, director of governmental relations for the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters, said of van der Vaart is leadership. “It was not about science. It was about customer service and putting polluters first.”He said that “what Regan has done is phenomenal. Our loss will be the country is gain.”Regan has done “extensive work in the realm of retiring coal plants and addressing the issue of coal ash and legacy pollution,” added Jennifer Rennicks, a policy director with the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and a resident of North Carolina. She also credited Regan with carrying out Cooper is broad-based climate agenda that has included an in depth examination of how global warming is affecting North Carolina, and an ambitious climate action plan. Cooper is efforts have stood out in the South. There is been a big focus on “addressing climate change through clean energy and electric vehicles and transportation,” Rennicks said. Cooper is plan calls for transforming the state is electrical grid to save energy and make it more resilient; reducing the energy burdens of low-income residents; and cutting greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector by 60 to 70 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, while working toward zero emissions by 2050, among other steps. National groups expressed support for Regan as EPA administrator. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said that Biden “ran on the boldest, strongest climate policy—one that centers climate justice—in history. As he continues to build his cabinet, perhaps no pick thus far emphasizes this focus as much as Michael Regan.”In North Carolina, Regan is “attention to addressing environmental justice, cleaning up coal ash, and prio rit izing clean energy is exactly what the country requires as the Biden administration seeks to rebuild after the worst administration ever for our environment and the climate,” Brune said. A top energy lobbyist also praised Regan.“Michael Regan has had an impressive rise, from the EPA air program to the public interest community to heading the North Carolina state agency,” said Scott Segal, a partner at the Bracewell law firm who works with energy clients. “He has brought fresh thinking along the way.“Regan understands that tough environmental goals tempered with economic and technological reality produce the best approach on everything from climate change to more local problems,” Segal said. “We look forward to working with him in his new post.”Dennis McLerran, the former EPA Region 10 administrator who left the agency in 2017, said Regan will have to immediately tackle matters critical to returning the agency to its role as an environmental watchdog.“Those include addressing the regulatory rollbacks that have occurred during the Trump Administration and bringing good science forward as the fundamental underpinning of regulatory policies and decisions,” he said. Regan will need to address climate change by restoring programs that address methane emissions and tailpipe emissions along with setting the course for the US to achieve Paris-based emission levels, McLerran said. Bill Muno, former director of the EPA is Superfund program for the Great Lakes Region from 1995 to 2005, echoed the hope of renewed emphasis on environmental justice, especially near Superfund sites. A recent investigation by Inside Climate News, NBC News and The Texas Observer found 945 Superfund sites nationwide vulnerable to climate-amplified hurricanes, flooding, sea level rise and wildfires.“To the degree that there will be a renewed emphasis on addressing sites in EJ communities, that will be a big positive for the Superfund program,” he said. “Hopefully the new administration will provide the funding to support this new emphasis.”Regan was reportedly Biden is second choice for EPA After an uprising by environmental justice and progressive groups, Biden passed over the candidate who was long thought to be the favorite for the EPA slot, Mary Nichols, a former assistant EPA administrator and the outgoing chair of the California Air Resources Board. Nichols has deep knowledge and hands-on experience with what is likely to be Biden is top climate policy challenge at EPA, restoring strong fuel economy standards for passenger vehicles. After Trump jettisoned the single largest step that the Obama administration had taken to address climate, Nichols broker ed a deal with five auto makers to keep fuel economy improvements on track—an agreement that is thought to be a likely template for a nationwide auto industry deal. But 70 national and California environmental justice groups and other organizations sent a letter to Biden is transition team last week blasting Nichols as having a “bleak track record in addressing environmental racism.”At the center of their dispute is California is cap-and-trade program to cut carbon emissions. Minority communities who are already overburdened with pollution say it has allowed them to become sacrifice zones, as polluters take easier steps to meet their obligations, like purchasing offsets. Veloz, a nonprofit electric car advocacy group that Nichols was instrumental in getting off the ground, had an online tribute to her tenure at CARB that seemed designed to address the environmental justice groups’ concerns; they showed a slide of Nichols in the 1963 March on Washington for civil rights, and talked about her work in the 1960s registering Blacks to vote. But opposition to her appointment by the activist groups that had worked hard for Biden is election proved too difficult to overcome. The controversy shows how environmental justice and climate policy are becoming intertwined as never before, and as the Biden administration takes shape. It also shows how cap-and-trade, once thought to be the most politically viable climate solution, has fallen deeply out of favor. Biden has not talked about it as part of his plan, but activists were determined not to see a California-style cap-and-trade program emerge from Biden is EPA.“We are glad to see President-elect Biden listen to front line communities and pass over … Nichols,” said Lisa Ramsden, a Greenpeace senior climate campaigner. “In doing so, Biden gave himself the chance to choose an EPA administrator who will prioritize justice for the communities most impacted by fossil-fueled pollution.”",2,2,Inside Climate News
193,"Stock market at ‘risk of a melt-up, not a meltdown’, warns BlackRock is Larry Fink",4.5,36.25,https://www.marketwatch.com/story/blackrocks-fink-says-stock-market-at-risk-of-a-melt-up-not-a-meltdown-2019-04-16?mod=mw_theo_homepage,https://adfontesmedia.com/marketwatch-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-19,25,"This article was originally published on April 16.“‘We have a risk of a melt-up, not a meltdown here.’”BlackRock Inc. BLK,+0.39%Chief Exeuctive Larry Fink says that with stocks knocking on the door of records, a surge to the upside appears more likely than a market collapse. That is because so many investors still have lots of cash to put to work, the head of the world is largest asset manager told CNBCin a Tuesday interview.“Despite where the markets are in equities, we have not seen money being put to work,” Fink said. “We have record amounts of money in cash.”A melt up is often defined as a sharp and unexpected rise in the price of an asset class, driven largely by a stampede of investors who are more concerned about missing out on a big up move than by improving market fundamentals. Melt-ups are often followed by sharp market setbacks. After a steep fourth-quarter sell off that pushed the S&P 500SPX,+1.07%and the Dow Jones Industrial AverageDJIA,+0.35%into corrections but stopped just short of a bear market — defined as a 20% drop from a recent peak — stocks have roared back. For the year to date, the S&P 500 is up 15.9% and stands less than 1% below its all-time closing high of 2,930.75 set Sept. 20. Data from Lipper last week showed that US equity funds saw $4.3 billion in inflows through the week ended April 10, but that followed a $19.7 billion outflow from the end of last year through April 3. Individual investors finally turn bullish, as stock market nears all-time highsThe stock-market rally so far this year has been partly attributed to a dovish shift by the Federal Reserve, which abruptly paused its policy tightening effort in January to adopt a wait-and-see approach after delivering four rate increases in 2018. Fed policy makers have signaled they expect no rate rises this year. Meanwhile, the European Central Bank, which ended its bond-buying program at the end of last year, introduced a new round of bank stimulus in March in the face of renewed economic sluggishness. Fink said the dovishness of central bankers creates a shortage of “good assets,” which could serve as a trigger for a global melt-up in equity prices. BlackRock on Tuesday reported a fall in first-quarter profit due to a price-war that continues to ripple across the asset-management industry. Total assets under management rebounded to more than $6 trillion after slipping at the end of 2018.",1,2,MarketWatch
194,"“Family Life Coaches,” Private Jets, and the One Percent is Pandemic Economy",-13.0,37.0,https://newrepublic.com/article/158773/life-coach-private-jets-one-percent-pandemic,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,25,"A “family life coach” position in Aspen pays between $80,000-$100,000—the ideal applicant “wins,” is willing to make time for “overnight stays,” and possesses the “3G is: Grit, growth, gratitude.” Aprivate teaching position in the Bay Area for a backyard school will net you $120,000 (and a $2,000 UberEats bonus for referrals). Are you a nanny with experience as a camp counselor willing to oversee scavenger hunts and an obstacle course for a family is private summer camp? Then thisBeverly Hills position is perfect for you. The rich have always sought to create private worlds of their own, cordoned off from the rest of the country and insulated from the violence their resource hoarding inflicts on others. What the coronavirus has provided is a common denominator, a single ongoing event that has exacerbated every existing form of inequality and inspired among the elites a certain kind of brashness about getting what they believe is theirs to take: jumping to the front of the line to get tested, hiring concierge doctors, and organizing private drive-through testing sites. And now, a life uninterrupted by a pandemic while others struggle to secure the basics for the mselves and their families. Across the country, public school systems are trying to develop best practices for another semester of remote learning that will service the tens of millions of parents and kids who depend on these institutions beyond their educational services. This summer, teachers at public and private schools alike have organized against their administrations to ensure their school systems are doing everything possible to protect their students, their communities, and them. And they have done this while grappling with the fact that another remote semester will only further set back the students already disproportionately under served by the education system; in New York City, are cent review by the city is Independent Budget Office found that the Grab & Go program designed to help feed children at risk of going hungry only distributed a quarter of the meals it usually provided children during in-person schooling. As many schools have opted to pursue remote learning to start the fall, parents with the means to do so have begun shelling out for private “pod” teachers. A “microschool community” in San Francisco is footing the bill for registered nurses to conduct weekly Covid-19 tests for their hired teachers. Another group, also in the Bay Area, is looking for a Spanish-fluent teacher to keep up with their kindergartners’ language immersion program. In New York City, two parents are looking for a live-in “teacher nanny” to work 40 to 45 hours a week at their house in the suburbs. “You do not go home until Covid is better contained,” the job listing reads. “You have separate living quarters and you can leave the property whenever you like but on foot.” The pay for this year-round service starts at $70,000 but no worries: “You are welcome to give up your apartment and stay with them for the year and save money.”These are jobs in a country where millions of people need the m—the arrangements might even be an improvement for some teachers—but the dynamic is still a broken one. As of June, the unemployment rate in 20 states was above ten percent while the virus continues to hospitalize and kill a rising number of people in this country. Meanwhile, the main debate being had on Capitol Hill this summer concerned whether the government was distributing too much money to working and middle-class people suddenly out of a job—all while Congress breezily passed a $740 billion defense bill and left for a nice paid summer break. With the Paycheck Protection Program funds for small businesses from the spring beginning to dry up and the$600 unemployment stimulusexpired, thousands of locally owned restaurants now have to choose between closing up shop temporarily or going out of business—and putting their employees out of work—for good. Meanwhile, in Connecticut, a chief executive officer is offering a job for a personal chef at “one of his personal homes.” Bonus points if the candidate has “the ability and desire to organize, clean, and manage the dwelling.” Other, more health-conscious rich families have made compromises—like having their personal chefs cook in the pool house. These jobs servicing the elite are not random; they are the product of a system that has clearly been designed for one group and not the other. Doing its part to add to the misery, the best–or rather, most telling–plan the White House has been able to foist came in the form of the Ivanka Trump-led “Find Something New” campaign that debuted last month—a public initiative that tried to rebrand the widespread joblessness crisis as an opportunity to switch career paths. I am set to be an ecologist; others, like my editor, are destined to be interplanetary doctors (presumably for a wealthy family of four living in the Mars version of the Hamptons.)In this void created by federal inaction, the wealthy have chosen to help the mselves. The demand for private jets was so high in April that operators we rerunning out of planes. (It helped that Congress carved out multiple tax breaks for private jet companies, dropping both the federal excise tax and fuel tax.) For families looking to stay closer to home, many hauled their nannies to their summer homes, threatening to fire them if the at-risk workers refused to incubate the mselves. Martha Stewart now lives full-time with her gardener, driver, and housekeeper—her “three detainees,” she called the m—at her Westchester home. When some families went to hire replacement workers, they added stipulations includingCovid-19 antibodies. The sprawling systemic effects of this clear split in financial ability is not lost on everyone. Speaking withThe Colorado Sunabout the innately exclusive pod approach to education, Melissa Rich, a parent considering putting her child in one of these private settings for the school year, acknowledged, “This idea can replicate the white flight that we saw in the 1950s.” Katie Farnan, a Boulder parent committed to her childrens’ public school, laid out the ramifications more clearly: “I want my kid to come back to a school that has the funding needed for the community it serves,” she said. “And the re is a good chunk of community that will have never left that school but will come back to a school that may have fewer resources because families have divested.”As my colleague Jo Livingstonewroteon the phenomenon of microschools, “The problem is everywhere, not just in one Bay Area backyard.” The question now is “What do we do with all this information?” We knew well before the pandemic how imbalanced and cruel America was for most workers because the wealthy wanted it that way. The calls for the private chef, the micro school teacher, and the contracted nurse are not individual affairs. They are another attempt to permanently distance the select few from the rest of society while they continue to siphon the nation is wealth. You have to blow up the model this inevitably calcifies into. There will be no shortage of crises in our future—another pandemic or a climate emergency—and these private, parallel economies will only grow. Without the redistributive policies necessary to prevent it,our future will look more and more like the nation under pandemic: A society with an ocean-sized gulf between us and the m, with one side slowly drowning and the other remarking that the water feels just fine.",1,1,New Republic

Even though feeding yourself and your family is is the least you can do to survive, for many Americans it is out of their reality to do what for some of us is just the basics for the maintenance of our lives. To say 2020 has been a hard year is not enough. 2020 has been the toughest year in decades for several families around the country. Even during easier times, millions of American families battle hunger on a daily basis, and right now, times could not be farther from easy. That is what we are going totalk about today. We about to disclose some very disturbing data which points out that over 50 million Americans will face starvation by the end of this year. Keep tuned and do not forget to like and subscribe to our channel and to help spreading this very important message. From all the unsettling things we have seen so far in 2020, to witness a massive amount of families having to count their coins to find money to minimally feed the mselves is one of the most tragic situations America has undergone over the past few decades. Many Americans were forced to change their lifestyle dramatically, cutting their food budgets due to a lack of income, while many others are now only having one or two meals a day, and demands at food banks around the country are spiking like never before. Yesterday, Bloomberg has published a report that could only be defined as one of the most devastating situations this country has ever faced. It reveals the struggles of a number of rural workers that expend the day inside plantations amongst an abundant amount of food that they can no longer pay for. Jessica Traxler is one fo these workers. Surrounded by food that she could not afford, and “sitting in a faded-out Chevy sedan one July morning in southern Minnesota, she looked out at corn stalks, lush green, as far as the eye could see. A few miles to the east, a mill was pumping out flour. Just beyond it, a farm grew peppers, beans, and berries. To the north, there were dairies, one after the other. To the south, a huge pork plant. Grain elevators, poultry yards, cheese plants—all stood just a short drive away,” describes the article authored by Catarina Saraiva, Carolina Gonzalez, and Peyton Forte. If there is a place that portrays how atrocious America is hunger problem has become during the sanitary outbreak, it is both sadly and ironically in the middle of the breadbasket that supplies food from coast to coast. It is being projected that the ranks of Americans fighting hunger are going to increase by 45% this year, meaning that over 50 million are likely to face starvation or at least severe food deprivation until the end of 2020. The story describes that “Traxler, her husband, and six children are among them. She had come to this spot, an empty school parking lot in the town of Mankato, to collect free boxes of food staples: milk and apples and carrots. Hundreds of Minnesotans waited in line ahead of her for hours.“It is been hard,” she said. “We have had to dramatically change how we eat.”According to Feeding America, the nation is largest hunger-relief organization, about one-third of those relying on food shelves, large-scale and emergency food distributions at this moment are in such situation for the first time in their lives, just as Traxler and her family, after losing her job due to shutdowns related to the health crisis. In some parts of Minnesota, that number can escalate up to 70%. Now, the roughest debate regarding deeply-rooted systemic inequalities is about one of the most basic divides: who will eat well and who will go hungry. Millions of families are already unassisted and do not have enough to eat. Over 60 million jobs were lost and every day it goes by this number only rises. Even though you might think that your job is safe, and hopefully it is, millions of others also thought their jobs were safe right before they were let go. With that said, we want you to know that our aim is not at all to discourage you. As Michael Snyder describes what is on his latest book “Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America”: “there is hope in understanding what is happening, there is hope in getting prepared” and we say there is hope in trusting that there is still a way out of this mess. Stockpile your food, gather your supplies, join forces with your friends and neighbors. Keep informed, and most importantly, protect yourself. To be prepared is to be able to face the harsh reality and still keep your mind strong enough to face hardships resourcefully.”For more economic collapse news visit our website:-○Viewer comment:Minnesota Prepper DIY,“I am sure it will be more like 100 million by the end of Winter.”I agree… – CP",0,0,Before Its News

197,The persuasion problem,-2.67,46.0,https://montanafreepress.org/2020/12/29/the-persuasion-problem-pandemic-health-officials-try-to-change-minds/,https://adfontesmedia.com/montana-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-29,15,"It had only one known COVID case until July. But that changed as the nation moved into its third surge of the virus this fall. By mid-December, Hill County had recorded more than 1,500 cases — the vast majority since October 1 — and 33 people there had died. When Larson hears people say pandemic safety rules should end, she talks about how contagious the COVID virus is, how some people experience lasting effects and how hospitals are so full that care for any ailment could face delays.“In public health, we have seen the battle before, but you typically have the time to build your evidence, research showing that this really does save lives,” Larson said. “In the middle of a pandemic, you have no time.”Public health laws typically come long after social norms shift, affirming a widespread acceptance that a change in habits is worth the public good and that it is time for stragglers to fall in line. But even when decades of evidence show a rule can save lives — such as wearing seat belts or not smoking indoors — the debate continues in some places with the familiar argument that public restraints violate personal freedoms. This fast-moving pandemic, however, does not afford society the luxury of time. State mandates have put local officials in charge of changing behavior while general understanding catches up. Earlier this month, US Surgeon General Jerome Adams stood next to Montana is governor in Helena and said he hopes people wear masks because it is the right thing to do — especially as COVID hospitalizations rise.“You do not want to be the reason that a woman in labor ca not get a hospital bed,” Adams said, adding a vaccine is on the way. “It is just for a little bit longer.”He spoke days after state lawmakers clashed over masks as a majority of Republican lawmakers arrived for a committee meeting barefaced and at least one touted false information on the dangers of masks. As of December 15, the Republican majority had not required masks for the upcoming legislative session, set to begin January 4. And now a group opposed to masks from Gallatin and Flathead counties has file da lawsuit asking a Montana judge to block the state is pandemic-related safety rules. Public health laws typically spark political battles. Changing people is habits is hard, saidLindsay Wiley, director of the health law and policy program at American University in Washington, DC Despite the misconception that there was universal buy-in for masks during the 1918 pandemic, Wiley said, some protesters intentionally built rap sheets of arrests for going mask less in the name of liberty.“In public health, we have seen the battle before, but you typically have the time to build your evidence, research showing that this really does save lives. In the middle of a pandemic, you have no time.”She said health officials realize any health restrictions amid a pandemic require the public is trust and cooperation for success.“We do not have enough police to walk around and force everyone to wear a mask,” she said. “And I am not sure we want them to do it.”Local officials have the best chance to win over that support, Wiley said. And seeing elected leaders such as President Donald Trumprebuffhis own federal health guidelines makes that harder. Meanwhile, public shaming like calling unmasked people selfish or stupid can backfire, Wiley said, because if they were to give in to mask-wearing, they would essentially be accepting those labels. In the history of public health laws, even rules that have had time to build widely accepted evidence were not guaranteed support. It is illegal in Montana to go without a seat belt in a moving car. But, as in13other states, authorities are not allowed to pull people over for being unbuckled. Every few years, a Montana lawmaker, backed by a collection of public health and law enforcement organizations, proposes a law to allow seat belt traffic stops, arguing it would save lives. In 2019, that request did not even make it out of committee, squelched by the arguments of personal choice and not giving too much power to the government. Main opposition points against public health laws — whether it is masks, seat belts, motorcycle helmets or smoking — can sound alike. When Missoula County became the first place in Montana to ban indoor smoking in public spaces in 1999, opponents said the change would destroy businesses, be impossible to enforce and violate people is freedom of choice.“They are the same arguments in a lot of ways,” said Ellen Leahy, director of the Missoula City-County Health Department. “Public health was right at that intersection between what is good for the whole community and the rights and responsibilities of the individual.”Montana adopted an indoor smoking ban in 2005, but many bars and taverns were given until 2009 to fall in line. And, in some places, debate and court battles continued for a decade more on how the ban could be enforced. Amid the COVID pandemic, Missoula County was again ahead of much of the state when it passed its own mask ordinance. The county has two hospitals and a university that swells its population with students and commuters.“If you have to see it to believe it, you are going to see the impact of a pandemic first in a city, most likely,” Leahy said. Compliance has not been perfect and she said the need for strict enforcement has been limited. As of early December, out of the more than 1,500 complaints the Missoula health department followed up on since July, it sent closure notices to four businesses that flouted the rules. In Hill County, when the health department gets complaints that a business is violating pandemic mandates, two part-time health sanitarians, who perform health inspections of businesses, talk with the owners about why the rules exist and how to live by them. Often it works. Other times the complaints keep coming. County attorney Karen Alley said the local health officials have reached out to her office with complaints of noncompliance on COVID safety measures, but she has not seen enough evidence to bring a civil case against a business. Unlike other health laws, she said, mask rules have no case studies yet to offer a framework for enforcing them through the Montana courts. (A handful of cases against businesses skirting COVID rules were still playing out as of mid-December.)“Somebody has to be the test case, but you never want to be the test case,” said Alley, who is part of a team of three. “It is a lot of resources, a lot of time.”Larson, with the Hill County Health Department, said her focus is still on winning over the community. And she is excited about some progress. The town is annual live Nativity scene, which typically draws crowds with hot cocoa, turned into a drive-by event this year. She does not expect everyone to follow the rules — that is never the case in public health. But Larson hopes enough people will to slow down the virus. That could be happening. By mid-December, the county is tally of daily active cases was declining for the first time since its spike began in October.“You just try to figure out the best way for your community and to get their input,” Larson said. “Because we need the community is help to stop it.”The Montana GOP uninvited a planned convention speaker amid US Senate drama. The Helena City Commission is considering whether to ask voters to approve added taxes to pay for a new fire station and additional police officers and firefighters. Health care providers, patient advocates and state lawmakers continue to hammer the administration of Governor Greg Gianforte for removing more than 120,000 people from state Medicaid programs between April and November of last year, including many residents who say they remain eligible for coverage.

Indonesia closed its borders to foreign travelers some 18 months ago. Vaccinated tourists from 19 countries — including China, India, Japan, South Korea and New Zealand, as well as parts of Western Europe and the Arabian Gulf — can now travel to Bali and Indonesia is Riau Islands. Travelers are subject to a five-day quarantine and Covid-19 testing. The plans are seen as a milestone for the Southeast Asian country is tourism-dependent islands, which have been crushed by ongoing travel restrictions. Yet several major feeder markets for foreign tourism — includingBali is Number 1 market of Australia, and neighboring Singapore — were omitted from the list. Speaking to CNBC Thursday, Indonesia is Minister of Tourism and Creative Economy Sandiaga Uno said the current policy was based on scientific data and guidance from a panel of epidemiologists.

Indonesia — burned by a lackadaisical approach to quarantines which led to a spike in Covid-19 cases in July — is taking a more cautious approach. They have reason, too. The country is gearing up to host the G-20 summit on Bali in 2022.""It will be purely scientific, making sure that this process will be smooth in terms of the next 18 months as we host G20 events here,"" said Uno. In addition to quarantines, which Uno said would be revised in time, the islands are implementing new safety measures, such as hotel certifications and vaccine boosters.""We are making sure Bali is prio rit izing the whole island to be 100% vaccinated with boosters... in the Q1 of next year,"" he said.

Will a $12B plan put a dent in it?",-0.67,47.33,https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2021/06/13/california-homeless-crisis-los-angeles-gavin-newsom/7421329002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/usa-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-13,22,"Tent-lined streets with belongings scattered everywhere. Infected wounds with bugs living inside. A man who has not showered in over a decade. An 80-year-old woman who ca not feed herself. People who ride the metro rail lines because the trains are a safer place to sleep. California is homeless problem has been out of control for decades. Then cameCOVID-19. The result has been a deadly combination of medical crisis, human hopelessness and bureaucratic red tape as the state, reeling from the effects of the virus, tries to rebound with a plan for the 160,000 homeless people. That number eclipses any other state – and accounts for half of the country is entire unsheltered population. A severe shelter and housing shortage is becoming not just a social services problem but a political one as well, unlike anywhere in the country – thrusting the problem before the eyes of Californians who see people suffering and dying on the streets each day.""There is not real clear leadership, there is not clear accountability,"" says John Maceri, who heads The People Concern, one of the largest homeless relief organizations in the Los Angeles area, the epicenter of the crisis. ""You have this very fractured system. It really is like herding cats.""The state is at a crossroads in its post-pandemic attempt to curb homelessness, and the rest of the nation is watching. Governor Gavin Newsom has set aside $12 billion in what he called a historic budget to combat homelessness. COVID-19 protections are nearing an end, meaning evictions will soon be allowed and could worsen the problem. And all of it is happening while a lawsuit threatens to reshape how Los Angeles – and perhaps the state – has tackled homelessness after a federal judge issued a scathing rebuke of the decades of failed plans, leadership and promises to fix the problem. Solving the cycle of homelessness has befuddled policymakers for decades. Money is thrown at it, as are new ideas. Yet more people end up living on the streets. For about 30 years, Karen Barnes has worked to help people experiencing homelessness in the state. Many of those she and her team have worked with suffer from extreme mental illness and other illnesses, from out-of-control diabetes to sexually transmitted diseases and wounds and abscesses that went untreated for such a long time that maggots have infested them.""The fact that people are somehow able to survive out there for that long is you know, amazing, but they have to be really tough,"" said Barnes, who helps lead an outreach team at PATH (People Assisting The Homeless) in Los Angeles aiming to help those experiencing homelessness on transit lines. ""These are humans and we ca not lose sight of that.""California tops list of states with the most unsheltered homeless peopleShe told stories from those living on the streets and the successes she has seen with finding a person shelter or care, including one man who had a severe mental illness and was later found with terminal cancer. They helped him get into hospice care, where he died.""We went to give him a birthday cake and had a little birthday party with him right before,"" Barnes said. ""At least the end was not, you know, what it could have been. He was happy at the end. That made it worth it.""It can take years to get someone into stable housing because of the distrust within the homeless community and concerns about being burned by a system that has failed the m, she said. Many shelters are rough places and come with rules that include curfews. Instead, some choose to stay in a place they know, even if that means sleeping outside, without a bed or any shelter – something California is climate makes more possible than in other areas of the country. The state accounts for more than half of the country is unsheltered population, according to a report released in January from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. While New York has a large number of people experiencing homelessness, the state offers shelter to 95% of those people. In contrast, about 70% of those experiencing homelessness in California lived outside or in vehicles. At its core, experts, advocates and state officials say a handful of issues have made tackling homelessness even harder: a high cost of living, lack of affordable housing, scattershot efforts with too many agencies, too much red tape and an unclear direction. The state is one of the most expensive to live in, a problem only worsened with a shortage of about 1.3 million affordable rental homes, according to the California Housing Partnership. The lack of affordable housing has not been easy to solve. New housing ventures take years, sometimes decades, to complete. And they are not cheap. The Los Angeles Timeschronicled one affordable housing project is decad elong path, identifying the various issues that led to the project shrinking to about half its size and growing to more than double its cost – about $1 million per unit. Layers of bureaucracy require developers to navigate a labyrinth of departments and funding sources that drag out the process, all while strict rules on labor and environmental standards drive up costs. Along with lack of funding, such projects are often met with opposition from the community. Advocates and experts have watched public officials roll out various plans over the years only to eventually see money dry up or a lack of meaningful progress.""What happens is we roll out a new pilot program only to have to ramp it down when the problems are still mounting and people are still needing help,"" said Jennifer Hark Dietz, deputy chief executive officer at PATH. ""We really need an ongoing commitment from the state and local level to kind of dig us out of this hole.""A report by the nonpartisan state auditor this year found the state is approach was fragmented and hindered efforts to house people. It noted California had spent $13 billion over three years through various agencies and programs to address the problem, yet it lacked a centralized way to oversee efforts or track progress and spending. The office of State Auditor Elaine Howle said California continues to have the largest homeless population in the nation “likely in part because its approach to addressing homelessness has been disjointed.”Since the report,the state has rolled out a new database that tracks homelessness and those who seek help across the state, aiming to identify best practices and where money should be spent.“You ca not fix what you ca not measure and having a statewide data system will help us determine what is working and what is not,” Newsom said in April when the database was unveiled. The crisis in California has left a trail of death. Some come from drug overdoses, violence or untreated illnesses that compound over time. Others come from suicide. These people die under freeways, along sidewalks and in alleys, hospitals and vehicles. More than 1,300 died last year in Los Angeles County alone. An additional 1,200 died the year before that. Some, like Joshua Ray Williams, are never reunited with their families even after death. He was found dead last year of a drug overdose outside a Jack in the Box along bustling Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. A manager of the restaurant found him and called first responders after seeing his face was blue. Crosstown, a local news outlet in Los Angeles, wrote about his death and others who died last year, deaths they say are largely forgotten. A homeless family of four dressed in pajamas died in a parked van outside a CVS in Garden Grove, about 30 miles outside Los Angeles, in 2018. Both children were in diapers. Sheets covered the windows, aiming to keep the sunlight out. They'd been living in the van for a long time. Authorities said carbon monoxide was to blame. While California is typical warm weather makes living outside more feasible than in other regions, it is not safer. Greg Tarola was found dead in November after cold temperatures and batch of storms hit the Sacramento area. The father of two who suffered from diabetes and epilepsy was found wrapped in wet blankets, according toSacramento Loaves & Fishes, a homeless organization that serves the area. Those experiencing homeless in California range from someone riding the metro to sleep to those who have set up tent communities that feature everything from forms of government with elected leaders, security mirrors and bee hives set up to act as protection against unwelcome visitors. Many have mental illnesses. Others suffer from physical ailments.""I have done this work and similar work in Boston, in New York, and I think I see the most vulnerable people that I have ever seen on the street in this community,"" said Ciara DeVozza, who helps lead outreach in the skid row community for The People Concern. The pandemic cast a new spotlight on the state is homelessness crisis, laying bare the danger of living in such unsanitary conditions. Even without the pandemic, people experiencing homelessness die each day in Los Angeles County. Last year, the county is medical examiner documented more than 1,300 deaths, a number advocates say is probably much higher. Homelessness groups rushed to house people while also getting people access to coronavirus tests and vaccines once they were available. After losing jobs and homes, more people are living in cars and RVs and it is getting worseHomeless people were put in hotels to keep them safe. Now they are being evictedTent encampments are typical sights under freeways and in areas such as skid row – a pocket of downtown Los Angeles known for its vast homeless population – but the pandemic, shutdowns and quarantines caused them to spread across the city. Encampments popped up in parking lots, neighborhood parks and outside schools, not only in Los Angeles but other parts of the state. In San Francisco alone, tent encampments grew by 70% and became more visible across the city, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. California Governor Gavin Newsom to face recall vote as petition drive hits signature goalLast month, Newsom proposed a $12 billion investment to fight homelessness using a budget surplus and federal dollars passed to help COVID-19 recovery efforts. The proposal includes $8.75 billion over two years to create an estimated 46,000 housing units, expanding on a program launched during the pandemic to convert motels and other properties into housing. It also includes $3.5 billion on rental subsidies, new housing and shelter resources with the aim of ending family homelessness within five years. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti similarly made homelessness a centerpiece of his budget, setting aside about $1 billion for the city is homelessness crisis. But as state and city leaders pitched their plans, a lawsuit filed last year by residents, business owners and developers aiming to force the city and county of Los Angeles to house those on skid row was working its way through the courts. A federal judge ordered in April that the city and county must provide shelter for the nearly 5,000 unhoused people living on skid row by October, an order that is being appealed.“All of the rhetoric, promises, plans, and budgeting cannot obscure the shameful reality of this crisis – that year after year, there are more homeless Angelenos, and year after year, more homeless Angelenos die on the streets,” Judge David Carter wrote in a scathing 110-page order that documented the history of the area is homelessness crisis and chastised elected leaders for their efforts. He noted the systemic racism that has also played a major role. While African Americans amount to less than 6% of the state is population, they account for about 31% of those who access homelessness services. Carter wrote the city had “lost its parks, beaches, schools, sidewalks, and highway systems due to the inaction of city and county officials who have left our homeless citizens with no other place to turn.”State and local leaders, along with some advocates, said they worried that the order, which included forcing Los Angeles to put $1 billion in an escrow account, would just warehouse the problem and halt progress on permanent solutions. Benjamin Henwood, a licensed clinical social worker, an associate professor and director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the University of Southern California, noted this could mimic a similar system that was created in New York after aland mark case argued the city should be required to provide some form of shelter for those experiencing homelessness. While such a system creates more sanitary and humane living arraignments, Henwood said in many ways it merely removed the crisis from the eyes of New Yorkers without a clear path to helping solve it.""I think essentially, it created a huge shelter system that, while it got people off the streets, it did not get them out of homelessness,"" he said. ""In fact, it just sort of created a cycle of homelessness because the way the system set up, you get in, you have to get assigned, you move around. It does not it does not really facilitate an exit from homelessness.""Those behind the lawsuit argue immediate action is needed to prevent deaths. They say going through the courts was a last resort but something that could provide a broader precedence helping to house those experiencing homelessness in other areas.""Even in these very interesting political times we are living in, homelessness is like the one issue that cuts across all demographics, where everyone basically agrees it is terrible and something needs to happen,"" said Daniel Conway, a policy adviser for the LA Alliance for Human Rights, the coalition of residents, business owners and developers behind the case.""With this lawsuit, we were kind of trying to force that decision making process. And also recognizing that anything you did in LA could set a set a model, a precedent for the rest of California, if not the rest of the western US""",2,2,USA Today
200,Hollywood is Other Foreign Censor: Saudi Arabia,8.67,33.67,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/hollywoods-other-foreign-censor-saudi-arabia/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-29,25,"China and Saudi Arabia have outsized influence in Hollywood today. Money from their repressive governments is influencing American culture, including our films, and thus our representation around the world. It is also leading to widespread censorship, against our cherished freedom of expression. America must regain the pen of our cultural narrative. Culture, including film, is a valuable tool in the international relations theory of“soft power,”or the ability of a country to persuade others to do what it wants without force or coercion. The film industry is a highly profitable one,valued at over $2 trillion in 2019 box office revenue alone, and it wields significant international influence. I grew up as an American expatriate in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saudi citizens have a dichotomous attitude towards Americans: They disdain our economic influence, yet they yearn for our freedom of expression. They consume American films in spite of the rampant censorship in their Kingdom. This attitude towards Americans is currently shared by China: Americans are a necessary evil for economic development, and pose an ideological threat to their dictatorship. However, China has intentionally circumvented Hollywood is influence over their population by strategically producing propaganda. The Chinese government censors every film shown in their country, from the top of the production chain: They manipulate the representation of the USs itself—not only in their own films, but in ours. American film companies increasingly cater to Chinese government ideology, including the American cultural icon Disney. In the credits of Disney isMulan, Disney gave special thanks to several government entities in Xinjiang, China, which operate internment camps that contain over a million members of the country is Uyghur minority. Former US Attorney GeneralWilliam Barr said, “Walt Disney would be disheartened to see how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day.”This year, Chinese director Chloe Zhao isNomadlandswept up the Best Film and Best Director categories at the Golden Globes, British Academy Film Awards, and the Academy Awards. Chloe Zhao is the daughter of a Beijing steel magnate and People is Liberation Army doctor, and two of her prior award-winning, American produced films (Songs My Brother Taught Me,The Rider) depict contemporary cowboys and Indians in the USs. The protagonists of the films are not traditional heroes; they struggle in criminal worlds only to give up on their dreams. In a similar vein,Nomadlandis set in an American city called Empire, and tells the story of an impoverished nomad who searches for employment, in veiled criticism of one of the largest American companies in the world, Amazon. Zhao is next project, the Disney/Marvel film,Eternals,depicts the reunion of an immortal race, after being in hiding for thousands of years, to protect Earth from the “Deviants.” According to these films, America is a world where you cannot fulfill your dreams; you can only fulfill Amazon—and to deviate from the norm will result in inevitable defeat. How did this happen, and how can America regain our cultural narrative?Money plays a significant role in American culture, a culture built upon a capitalist market economy that encourages competition and innovation. But the freedom of expression Americans fought for when we established the USs is paramount. The tension between these two priorities since 9/11 and subsequent economic recessions have led to short-sighted, profit-driven decision-making by American leadership, in both the private and public sectors. The American-Saudi partnership has been fraught with controversy and contradiction since the 9/11 attacks, which culminated in a 2016 Congressional vote to allow 9/11 families to sue the country for its alleged links to the attackers. Yet in 2017, the Trump administration signed a $350 billion arms deal with the Saudi government. According to the US Department of State, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is currently the USs islargest foreign military sales customer and one of our largest trading partners in the Middle East. The Kingdom is also taking notes from China. “They are the new Chinese,”stated one Hollywood insidertoForbesin 2018. Following Saudi King Salman is decision to lift a 35-year cinema ban, AMC Theaters declared intent to open up to 100 cinemas in Saudi Arabia by 2030. In 2020, the Kingdom invested about$500 million worth of shares in Disney. Penske Media (co-owner of theHollywood Reporter) took a$200 million investment from the Saudis. Netflix announced an eight-picture deal they would finance through a Saudi production company. Like the Chinese, the Saudis have a strategy to buy their way into Hollywood, and also like China, the Saudi General Commission for Audiovisual Media (GCAM) administers censorship—screening for what it deems to be inappropriate content. In 2019, Netflix pulled comedian Hasan Minhaj is “Patriot Act” episode on Saudi Arabia and Khashoggi after Saudi officials claimed that it violated the Kingdom is cy ber crime law. Thereis no evidenceNetflix tried to challenge the ruling or asked Saudi Arabia to explain how the episode was a threat to public order. The Saudi government is brutal assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 sent an anti-American message to the world: Do not stand up for freedom of expression. Brian Fogel is filmThe Dissidentmeticulously documented the Saudi murder of Khashoggi, who was employed by the Washington Post. The Dissidentwas blacklisted in Hollywood. Fogelstated in an interview that “there was a unified front among the major global media companies, distributors, that they were not going to touch this film.”“What I observed was that the desire for corporate profits have left the integrity of America is film culture weakened,”said Thor Halvorssen, the founder and chief executive of the nonprofit Human Rights Foundation, who financedThe Dissidentand served as a producer. Meanwhile, China has steadily accumulated US Treasury securities since 9/11. As of February 2021, China owns $1.104 trillion, or about 4%, of the $28 trillion US national debt, which is more thanan y other foreign country except Japan. It is also the world is largest country by population, and is predicted to overtake the USas the top box office market. A 2013Rolling Stonearticleobserved: “The hardball negotiators of Hollywood were willing to roll over, in terms of finance and even content, in return for access to the world is largest overseas moviegoing audience.”Disney is one of the biggest winners in China: The proud owner ofMarvelStudios sat on more than $1 billion from the country is box office in 2019. The version ofIron Man 3released in Chinafeatured added footage with Chinese product placements and Chinese characters saving Iron Man. Marvel is 2016 superhero filmDr. Strangechanged the appearance of a major Tibetan character for fear of jeopardizing the movie is success in China. American film studios, including Disney, also invite Chinese government regulator son film sets to advise “on how to avoid tripping the censors’ wires.”Prioritizing profit over freedom of expression has diluted the perception of American culture and weakened our international influence. As Frances Stonor Saunders detailed in her book,The Cultural Cold War, the most vocal exponents of intellectual freedom during the Cold War were instruments of American culture, and cultural efforts to win hearts and minds continue to be relevant today. However, a key difference between the Cultural Cold War of the mid-20th century versus today is the ability of other governments to finance cultural influence. The Russian Soviet Union could not compete with the American entertainment industry; China can. The Chinese government understands that culture stands upstream from policy and from politics, impacting the population. According to Matthias Niedenführ, vice director of the China Center in Tübingen, Germany,Chinese government censors do not want to see Chinese people portrayed as villains, and they do not want to see American powers portrayed as heroes. Hollywood is “often gleefully willing to speak truth to American political power” yet it takes the opposite approach to the Chinese government, which monitors their population with drones,AI-powered CCTVcameras, and systemic censorship. The Chinese government wants to maintain a relationship with Hollywood, which remains the most potent force for global storytelling—a power their government envies. The free speech nonprofit PEN America issued a 94-page report in 2020 titled, “Made in Hollywood, Censored by Beijing: The US Film Industry and Chinese Government Influence,” which recommends the following:The report concludes American decision-makers have a moral imperative to stand for freedom of expression, to resist the gradual encroachment of any government that attempts to dictate what stories may be told. Journalists covering Hollywood ought to be writing about this, and those who value freedom of expression should pay attention to its muzzling. As Americans, we have a responsibility for the evolution of our culture and representation in the world. We cannot allow the liberty we fought for when we established the USs of America to be sold: The freedom of expression is more valuable than money.

Bishop Garrison currently leads the Defense Department is Countering Extremism Working Group. On Thursday the Department of Defense said it is standing by Bishop Garrison, a senior adviser to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, despite attacks from Republican members of Congress and right-wing media outlets including Fox News. Garrison was appointed to his role at the Pentagon in February and currently leads the Countering Extremism Working Group, which was established by Austin in April to review and update department policies regarding extremism within the armed services. Garrison is a West Point graduate who served two tours in Iraq with the US Army, and worked as an adviser to former President Barack Obama is 2012 reelection campaign and to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is presidential campaign in 2016.“The Department has full confidence Mr. Garrison can lead the Counter Extremism Working Group as it carries out its mission,” Lisa Lawrence, a spokesperson for the Department,told the conservative Daily Caller.“The Department is focused on addressing the corrosive and potentially dangerous behavior that can be inspired by extremist ideology – behavior that harms good order and discipline and our readiness.”Garrison has been criticized by the right for his tweets about Donald Trump, in particular, tweets in which he said, “Support for him [Trump], a racist, is support for ALL his beliefs,” and “He is dragging a lot of bad actors (misogynist, extremists, other racists) out into the light, normalizing their actions. If you support the President, you support that.”Garrison made those comments following Donald Trump isattackon the late Representative Elijah Cummings (D-MD), who represented Baltimore, Maryland. Trump had tweeted of the majority-Black city, “No human being would want to live the re” and called it “a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.”But now, years later, the right, including GOP lawmakers, have latched on to those tweets, after they resurfaced in a right-wing hit piece published in an outlet called Revolver on May 5. The outlet called Garrison a “critical race theory loving, Trump Derangement Syndrome suffering, fake news spreading, 100% partisan hack,” citing his 2019 tweets as evidence. The report did not note the context of Garrison is commentary concerning Trump is racism. Fox News host Pete HegsethattackedGarrison the day after the piece came out, describing him as the Pentagon is “MAGA purge man” while discussing the Pentagon is anti-extremism efforts. And days later, another Fox News host, Tucker Carlson,described Garrisonas a “lunatic” for his criticism of Trump is racism. On May 19, during a House Armed Services Committeehearinginvolving recommendations from the National Commission Military, National, and Public ServiceRepresentative Matt Gaetz (R-FL)criticizedGarrison. Gaetz claimed he was “deeply troubled” by a tweet Harrisonwrotein January of 2020, as Trump is impeachment trial was underway, which stated, “Calls for civility, rather than shouting down falsehoods and misinformation, shall be the death of this nation.”Then, onMay 26,30 Republican members of the House signed a letter complaining of “creeping left-wing extremism” in the military, citing the “report” from Revolver that singled out Garrison is tweets. The letter, which was led by Representative Matt Rosendale and co-signed by members like Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Greg Steube (R-FL), Matt Gaetz (R-FL), and others, called on Sec. Austin to “fight back” against extremism from the left. That same day, Gosar (R-AZ)complainedon Twitter that, “Biden and Bishop Garrison are prio rit izing bigotry and anti-white hatred over national security,” sharing the Revolver piece. Notably, just two months earlier, Gosar w asa featured speak erat a conference of extremists alongside white supremacists. The attacks directed at both Garrison and the efforts by the Biden administration to combat military extremism follow years of the right downplaying the threat posed in military ranks. But research has shown that extremism continues to be a serious problem for the military.

202,America is Left and the Confiscation of Wealth,15.33,31.0,https://spectator.org/americas-left-and-the-confiscation-of-wealth/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-17,23,"America is conservatives should be those least amazed by our left is calls for wealth confiscation. The only surprise here is the flaunting. After all, wealth confiscation is what the left everywhere has always done. Once in power, it is the only way the left is policies can survive. As 2020 nears and the pursuit of increasingly restive radicals increases, the politicians courting them aggressively seek more extreme positions. The fear of the “liberal” label is long gone and the “socialist” sobriquet is all the rage among those who rage. With the Marxist moniker come the policies. Higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations are already passé. It is no longer enough to tax the wealthy more via their income. Now the target is their wealth directly. Calls for such blatantly confiscatory policies are still shocking to most Americans. However, as we have been repeatedly taught by the left globally, such sensibilities are hopelessly out of step with the new “progressivism.” In one sense America is left is right in its calls: The only shocking part is their explicit nature. Usually America is left does not admit it aims, pursuing them instead silently. The left pursues confiscatory policies not just because it supports them in its own right — though assuredly it does — but because it inevitably must. The left always starts with enemies. The question is how broadly it defines them and how stringently it pursues them. The answer depends on the amount of power the left has. Depending on place and parlance, the left is enemies range from “the rich” and corporations, to capitalists, the bourgeoisie, and “enemies of the state.” Confiscatory policies are aimed at them because, in the words of the bank robber Willie Sutton, “that is where the money is.” Initially these strike a blow, but they also stake the left is expensive spending policies. But the more the left is policies are implemented, the more they fall short. If implemented broadly enough, the economy itself falls short. Regardless, increased resources are needed to make up the shortfall. The phenomenon is akin to the Laffer Curve, albeit beyond tax revenue alone. The economist Arthur Laffer described how increasing rates of taxation, once they hit the inflection point, actually result in declining tax revenue. This creates the potential for reversal: Cutting tax rates above their inflection point results in increased revenues. This observation can be applied to the left is policies. Entitlement programs continue to escalate — either through increasing benefits, increasing utilization, or both — until they become unaffordable, requiring additional resources or rationing. Subsidies become utilized until too costly and the product subsidized goes into short supply or is rationed. Regulations mount to an extent that the activity regulated becomes less available or less desirable. Given sufficient power, the left can inflict this across an entire economy. There is no shortage of examples of this happening in individual programs here, and no shortage of this happening economy-wide abroad. It is an economic tenet that resources are limited. It is a political tenet that the left is reach is unlimited. The only way to square this circle is to take more through confiscation. Of course, even compulsion can swim only so long against the economic tide — as the drownings of so many socialist and communist countries prove. The left has never been able to solve the question why those being increasingly confiscated from would indefinitely consent to producing more. The overall effect is analogous to a farmer eating his seed corn. Faced with a disappointing harvest, instead of curtailing consumption the farmer decides to dip into the stock he should set aside for next year is planting. When spring comes, he sows less, and when harvest time comes, his yield is even shorter. Repeating the cycle, each year falls shorter and shorter. Eventually, he has only enough to eat, but none to plant. So it is with the left. It must make up its shortfall from others — confiscating what it lacks — until all fall short. If this sounds preposterous, look back to the left is own past — the Soviet famine of 1932-33 and Communist China is Great Leap Forward — or simply look at its present in Venezuela and North Korea. Or take its programs in isolation and see their inability to meet demand or be self-sufficient. Without external subsidization, they fail. This is only new to America. Here, the left is programs are subsidized from the general budget and the budget shortfall is borrowed. Hidden from view, there has been a quiet truce: The left pursues its course in incremental steps, accepts its subsidies, and in return does not explicitly call for confiscation. However, America is New Left reject this historical accommodation and its incrementalism. Emboldened it seeks bigger prizes — a Green New Deal, Medicare for All — and its needs (and wants) bigger prey. Confiscatory policies are now explicit. To the rest of the world — particularly those who have endured the left — such confiscatory calls are all too familiar. Far from new and novel, they are very old indeed — both chronologically, and in the sense of being worn out. They trace back to the 19thcentury and were tried repeatedly in the last century. Each time they were miserable failures — literally — leaving those subjected to them in misery. Far from being “progressive” — to day is trendy attempt at rebranding — they are actually regressive. These policies are throwbacks in time, just as they are throwaways philosophically, economically, and politically. America has not known this in the sense of living it. Knowing it intellectually, that it actually occurred elsewhere, is not the same. To America is collective mind, it has remained a foreign affliction — like leprosy or the plague — that does not, cannot, actually occur here. America is only real encounter has been the momentary quadrennial contact with some crank running for president as a communist or socialist. At best, such candidates pick up a comparative handful of votes and curiosity. They are the crazy aunt who mercifully shows up only for major family gatherings. Only this time, she has brought friends. We have emotionally felt that socialism and its wealth confiscation could not happen here. It can, of course. These policies now being so candidly bandied about are exactly what it would look like. And these proposals are just the beginning of what the left will do, if given the chance.",1,0,The American Spectator

Reagan Stevens, 45, a deputy director of the Mayor is Office of Criminal Justice busted in April 2018 on charges of possessing a handgun, had all the charges against her dismissed and won a $100,000 settlement last month in a lawsuit over her arrest, the Daily News has learned. Stevens — a single mother of an adult daughter — said she is happy to leave the humiliating episode in her past.“I just feel fortunate that it is behind me, and that my daughter and I are both working and well, and can look forward,” Stevens told The News on Friday.“I do not [have any resentment] because I do really think everything happens for a reason and I just want to move on with my life. I really believe that holding resentments would hurt me ultimately.”Stevens was arrested after cops said they found a gun in a car in which she was riding with two men in Queens. Her arrest was prominently played in the news media. Stevens went from deputy director of the Office of Criminal Justice — where she worked on implementing a law to raise the age at which juvenile suspects are treated as adults in courtrooms — to jobless and without insurance. Her troubles began in Queens, as she rode in the back seat of a 2002 Infiniti that also carried two men on her way to play basketball. When the men, Ceasar Forbes and Montel Hughes, stopped for cigarettes on 106th Ave. near 177th St. in Jamaica, cops approached the car and began searching it. Shortly before the stop — at about 10:20 p.m. — a nearby NYPD ShotSpotter microphone system had picked up the sound of five gunshots, cops said at the time. During their search of the car, officers found a 9mm handgun in a green velvet bag in the glove compartment, as well as a spent shell casing by Stevens’ feet. Cops arrested Forbes, Hughes and Stevens when none of them admitted the gun was theirs, according to a criminal complaint. But Stevens denied the two officers asked her any questions about the weapon and said she did not know of the gun is presence until the charges in the case were read to her in Queens Criminal Court.“I did not know about the gun being in the car,” Stevens said Friday. By that time, the news media had caught wind of the arrest, and Stevens found out from news stories that she was suspended without pay or benefits from her city job, she told The News. A month after her arrest, Stevens gave a DNA sample, which did not match DNA on the gun, according to her lawsuit.“There was not any evidence tying her to the gun so the charges were all dismissed,” a law enforcement source with knowledge of the case told The News. Finally, in November 2018 — after Stevens had spent seven months trying to pick up the pieces of her life — the case was dismissed and sealed, according to a certificate of disposition viewed by The News. In December 2018, Stevens sued the NYPD officers on the case in Brooklyn Supreme Court for false arrest and illegal stop and frisk. One of the arresting officers in Stevens’ case, Justin Ellis — a defendant in Stevens’ lawsuit — subsequently lost his gun and shield after getting arrested in 2020 for shooting his wife is physical trainer outside the cop is Seaford home during a fight.

204,"Doctor, Lawyer, Insurrectionist: The Radicalization of Simone Gold",-14.33,32.67,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/05/doctor-lawyer-insurrectionist-the-radicalization-of-simone-gold/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-06,25,"When rioters broke into the US Capitol on January 6, chants of “Fuck the police!” “USA!” or “Treason!” echoed in the marble halls. When Dr. Simone Gold got inside the rotunda, she stepped over a velvet rope and announced to anyone who would listen, “I am a Stanford-educated attorney!”Thus she distinguished herself among the motley crew of Proud Boys, MAGA types, and the QAnon shaman who paraded through the Capitol to overturn the 2020 presidential election, an event that left five people dead. Not only is Gold a Stanford-educated lawyer, she is also a board-certified emergency room physician. Neither qualification prevented the FBI from coming to her Beverly Hills house on January 18 and arresting her. Nor did it make a federal grand jury think twice in early February before indicting her on five criminal counts, including entering a restricted building and obstructing an official proceeding. The arrest marked the end of one chapter in her Icarian trajectory into right-wing fame. Before April 2020, Gold had been just another over-achieving Beverly Hills doctor. But with the arrival of the pandemic, she donned her white lab coat to protest lock downs and promote President Donald Trump is favorite unproven COVID treatment, the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. It seems that is all it took to find an enthusiastic audience among the MAGA faithful, putting her on a glide path to a certain kind of right-wing stardom. Conservatives who love to bash educated, liberal elites as out of touch quickly embraced Gold and gleefully touted her impressive credentials to support their attacks on public health measures designed to combat the pandemic. She sailed into their well-funded ecosystem, snagging speaking gigs, appearances on cable talk shows, and robust opportunities to fundraise. Simone Gold, with John Strand (left) uses a bullhorn to address protesters in the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Saul Loeb/AFP/GettyWithin days of her first media hit, she had teamed up with tea party groups working with the Trump reelection campaign to demand that governors reopen the economy. Fox News put her on national TV to publicly denounce lock downs and mask mandates as overblown responses to a disease she insisted was not fatal to most people. In July, her new right-wing friends ushered her to meetings with members of Congressand Vice President Mike Pence. The sudden fame seems to have propelled her right up the steps and into the Capitol on January 6. Her arrest highlights the role of conservative media in fomenting an insurrection, but Gold is personal experience also illustrates what experts on extremism have long known: Education is no defense against radicalization. “If you think of who is susceptible of extremist ideology, people tend to think it is people who do not have much education,” says Don Haider-Markel, a University of Kansas political science professor who has studied extremism and radicalization. “That is not the case at all. It tends to be more middle class and upper class. Those who have spent more time educating the mselves tend to think they know better than other people.”In fact, much like the tea parti ers of the Obama era, the Capitol insurrectionists were by and large an aging, middle-class mob. Researchers at the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago have dug into the demographic profiles of hundreds of people charged with crimes related to the Capitol incursion. They have found that about 30 percent of the arrested rioters are white-collar professionals like Gold. Only about 13 percent were affiliated with traditional far-right militias or extremist groups like the Proud Boys, and only 7 percent were unemployed. Even so, Gold still stands out from that well-heeled crowd, and not just because she is a woman. (Women make up only about 15 percent of the Capitol defendants.) Of the more than 420 defendants the Chicago researchers studied, she is one of only two lawyers and the only doctor. That is why it is hard not to look at Gold is CV and wonder: How does someone go from medical school to Stanford Law School to an FBI wanted poster?Gold is resume does notscream budding far-right revolutionary as much as it reflects unusual precocity and ambition. Raised in a wealthy section of Long Island, New York, Gold, 55, likes to say that she trained as a physician at her father is knee. Reuben Tizes, her father, was a doctor, a medical school professor, and even served as the Orange County, New York, health commissioner in the early 1970s. Her mother, Carol Tizes, was an elementary school teacher. After graduating from the City College of New York at 19, she claims she was the youngest person in her graduating class at the Chicago Medical School in 1989. She obtained a California medical license in 1990 but the n enrolled in Stanford Law School, graduating in 1993. “That was my idea of rebellion,” she told a religious broadcaster in August, explaining that her father had wanted all his children to be doctors. (They are.) Her legal prowess did not stand out much in Palo Alto, however. I reached out to a host of her Stanford Law classmates, but none of those who responded could recall much about Gold aside from her red hair. Stanford Law School class photoThe intervening decades between law school and her indictment were unconventional only in the ambition of her professional endeavors. In January 1997, she was admitted to the New York bar and the n completed a residency in emergency medicine at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University. That same year, according to her LinkedIn profile, she served as a congressional fellow in DC and wrote speeches for the late Vermont senator James Jeffords, who famously left the Republican Party to become an Independent in 2001. (Susan Boardman Russ, who served as Jeffords’ chief of staff for 25 years before retiring in 2004, does not remember Gold.)Over the past three decades, Gold has practiced emergency medicine at various hospitals in the LA area, but the lure of Washington seems to have endured. According to her LinkedIn page, in 2009, she worked in DC as an assistant to Michael Oren, the n Israel is ambassador to the US, who credited her in print for stories she helped him research for the andNew Republic. Oren told Mother Jonesthat he had no memory of her working for him, nor did anyone on his staff. In Los Angeles, Gold married businessman Larry Gold and had two children. Active in the Los Angeles Jewish community, she and her husband once provided a glowing testimonial for a local mohel for the br is he performed for their son. A 2003articlefeatured Gold and her the n two-year-old son in a story about “Shalom Time” at a local bookstore. She and her husband donated thousands of dollars to their children is private, conservative Jewish day school in Beverly Hills, where Gold volunteered on the PTA, managing the shabbat swap one year. But by 2010, Gold had filed for divorce. Los Angeles County court records suggest that her relationship with her ex-husband was somewhat contentious. In 2017, a judge ordered them to attend mediation over child custody and visitation issues. (Larry Gold declined to comment for this story other than to say that he was “shocked” to learn about his ex-wife is participation in the events at the Capitol.)In her October 2020 bookGold writes, “I have always worked with the poor and underserved,” treating ER patients in places like Inglewood, California, which she describes as a “low-income, gang-ridden majority-minority city that provided the setting for the tough 1991 dramaBoyz N the Hood.” She does not, however, include any mention of her services as a pricey “concierge physician,” which she advertised on hernow-defunct personal website: “As a C-Suite Physician, Dr. Gold works the same way as a highly effective Fortune 100 CEO…all with an eye toward fixing her client is exact problem.” Gold charged $5,000 for an initial appointment and between $25,000 and $50,000 for ongoing consultations. The concierge medical practice is just one of several business enterprises she attempted to launch over the years—including, a short-lived lifestyle magazine for doctors that launched in 2006 and folded in 2008. (“Confessions of a Hospital Fundraiser,” teased one cover mockup.) In 2017, Gold started a company called Gold Healthcare Solutions that advertises assistance to hospitals facing government audits. Until recently, the company web site listed as CEO the venture capitalist Howard Sherman, who is married to the actress Sela Ward and who ran in the Mississippi Democratic primary for the US Senate in 2018. When I asked Sherman about his role at the company, he replied in an email: “I have ZERO relationship with Dr. Simone Gold is company. I work in the medical device world and at one time she approached me with an idea she had that I vetted with some of my contacts. I was not able to achieve the kind of interest she wanted so we stopped talking about the project.” His name and photo were subsequently removed from the company website. Lots of people flame out in business, get divorced, and do not end up storming the Capitol. But Haider-Markel says that those who do become radicalized are searching for broader meaning in their lives or a sense of identity. “Oftentimes there is a precipitating event. They lose a partner. They have a financial crisis,” he says. “They develop some grievance around that and connect that to a broader social movement.” If Gold was looking for a mid-life reboot, the heady mix of the pandemic, President Trump, and right-wing media provided the perfect catalyst. The moment that “changed my life completely,” she told a California KGET TV reporter in January, took place in April 2020. She had been treating COVID patients in Los Angeles emergency rooms with President Donald Trump is favorite unproven COVID cure, hydroxychloroquine, just a few weeks after the president had announced that the FDA would be fast-tracking emergency use authorization for the drug for COVID treatment. Trump called it “a game changer,” despite warnings from the FDA that the anti-malaria drug may cause heart rhythm problems in some people. Gold was enthusiastic about the drug is treatment possibilities. In her book, she describes how, after extensive research, she had used hydroxy chloroquine to cure a woman suffering from mild COVID. “I had expected to get kudos,” she writes. “Instead I was met with hostility.” The hospital medical director challenged her independence and dressed her down for prescribing a drug that was not indicated for outpatients. Gold argued she had science to back her up, and cited the drug is long safety profile. Unpersuaded, the medical director threatened to fire her if she ever prescribed the drug to an outpatient again. For most of her life, Gold does not seem to have been politically active. She donated $1,000 to the campaign of Senator Susan Collins (R-ME) in 2019, but before that, the only other federal candidate to whom she gave money was a Democrat—California Representative Raul Ruiz—in 2011. “I have never considered myself a political person. I have supported both parties at various times in my life,” she says in her book. “I’d fall in the middle of any partisan test. I do not believe in the right-left distinction…That is the trouble with being in the middle of the road. Sometimes you get run over.”But after the hospital threatened to fire her over her prescribing practices, Gold picked a lane. On April 14, she called Dennis Prager is radio show. Prager has been broadcasting in LA since 1982, but he has become an important though underappreciated part of the modern right-wing infrastructure thanks to his online Prager University. Popular with young people and the alt-right, Prager U publishes five-minute tutorials on everything from climate change to economics. The videos are designed to promote “Judeo-Christian values.” (A sampling: “The Dangers of Islam” and “Just Say Merry Christmas.”)Identifying herself as an ER doctor, Gold described her success at treating patients with hydroxy chloroquine and voiced dismay that medicine was becoming so politicized that a perfectly safe drug could not be dispensed by doctors without controversy. “The science has taken a backseat to the hatred of the president,” Prager commiserated. A week later, Gold made a series of Twitter videos, a platform that she had rarely before used, to share her experience “practicing emergency medicine in this era of the COVID-19 crisis.” Standing in her white lab coat in front of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center—a hospital she did not work at—Gold panned the camera over the quiet grounds. “It is really quite empty. The emergency department volume is down,” she says. “The patient census is down.”Gold was not entirely wrong about the hospital census but her causality was off. Hospitals all over the country, including in California at that time, were relatively empty because elective surgeries were canceled and fear of the virus kept people out of the ER Doctors and nurses would soon be laid off. In her book she describes how her own hospital hours were cut by 30 percent. She does not say how much this may have hurt her bottom line, but in June, her medical practice received more than $150,000 in federalbailoutloans, suggesting the lock downs caused a personal budget deficit large enough to turn many a doctor into an activist. Subscribe usingApple Podcasts,Spotify,Stitcher, or your favorite pod cast app. None of her videos garnered more than 12,000 views but they hit a certain zeitgeist, as conservatives and conspiracy the orists alike pushed the idea that virus cases were overblown and some people in the government were using COVID to take away individual freedom and undermine President Trump. Three weeks earlier, Fox News radio host Todd Starnes had gone to a Brooklyn hospital and made a video claiming that the emergency room was empty. “I am afraid that the mainstream media has been overblowing the coverage here,” he narrated. “There is been a lot of fear mongering going on.” With help from aQAnon enthusiast, the videos pawned the hashtag#filmyourhospital and prompted a host of right-wing figures like failed California congressional candidate DeAnna Lorraine Tesoriero to rush to their nearest hospitals to make their own “empty hospital” videos weeks before Gold did. Even in such a climate, Gold is white coat stood out, and she managed to catch the attention of one particularly influential audience member:Jenny Beth Martin, the co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. One of the largest of the original tea party groups that arose to oppose President Barack Obama, Tea Party Patriots encompasses a trio of nonprofit groups funded by wealthy conservatives and conservative foundations like Donors Trust. A Tea Party Patriots super-PAC also raised $1.2 million to help reelect Trump in 2020. Martin was dialed into the Trump White House—so much so that she would later join Trump is Georgia legal team to help overturn the 2020 presidential election, even though she is not a lawyer. Early in the pandemic, she was working with a newly formed Save Our Country Coalition to help oppose lock downs and defend Trump is handling of the pandemic, along with powerful conservative organizations such as the Heritage Foundation and the American Legislative Exchange Council. She is also the executive committee secretary of the Council for National Policy, a secretive but powerful religious-right organization that was working with the Trump reelection campaign to find doctors to help burnish the president is approval ratings. Gold was just the sort of surrogate they had been looking for. “I reached out to her and said, ‘Hey, I am working on this effort and I’d like totalk to doctors,’ and we started em ailing and talking, and as things have developed and she watched the virus, things have evolved,” Martin later explained to. The pair met in April, and Gold asked Martin to deliver a letter she’d written to Trump, calling the lock downs a “mass casualty event,” which she’d been urging other doctors to sign. More than 400 had. With lightning speed, Martin put Gold on the ready-made conservative media grievance circuit. On May 19, Tea Party Patriotshosted a conference call with conservative media luminaries, including Fox News’ Ed Henry andBreitbart News, featuring Gold and a handful of other doctors who had signed Gold is letter to Trump. On the call, Gold described the hidden victims of the lockdowns, including a woman she’d treated who’d fallen and broken her hip and shoulder while trying to color her own hair because she could not go to a salon. “I just feel that is the re is a very big disconnect between what the average American thinks is going on and what is actually going on,” Gold said. The call sent Gold on a grand round of media hits with all of the biggest names in the MAGA firmament—former Trump White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, Glenn Beck, Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk—and ultimately with some of the major stars of Fox News. In early July, Fox host Laura Ingraham had Gold on her show to promote her favorite drug as an over-the-counter COVID cure. “This is like a medical cancel culture applied to this particular medication,” Ingraham said sympathetically, conflating some cherished conservative points of fury.“Should not you as a practicing physician with a medical degree be allowed to express your views on science as you practice it without being censored?”It is probably hard to overstate just how much of a role conservative media played in nudging Gold towards insurrection. University of Maryland psychology professor Arie W Kruglanski is a co-author of the bookThe Three Pillars of Radicalization. In his research on extremist networks across the globe, he identified three crucial factors in political radicalization: a need to feel significant, a narrative to follow, and a network that supports and validates that narrative. “It is difficult to become very glamorous or glorious as an emergency room doctor,” Kruglanski told me. Gold is splash into right-wing media, he says, probably fulfilled all three of the pillars. “This is sort of an overnight stardom. She has the narrative, and she now has the network that supports her.”Gold really hit the big time in July. After brainstorming with Martin, Gold helped Tea Party Patriots convene an “America is Frontline Doctors” summit in DC, an event that resembled the “white coat” protests Martin had organized back in the tea party heyday to oppose the Affordable Care Act. The two-day summit garnered almost no media attention until the very end, when Gold and about a dozen white-coated physicians appeared on the steps of the Supreme Court totalk about “medical cancel culture” and spent nearly 45 minutes making misleading claims suggesting that COVID can be prevented and cured with, no surprise here, hydroxychloroquine. Most of them had never treated a COVID patient; ophthalmologists were overrepresented in the group. And one was really out the re: Stella Immanuel, a Houston doctor who believes that some gynecological problems are caused by having sex with demons. “You do not need masks. There is a cure,” she said. “Nobody needs to get sick.”President Trump and his son Don Jr. retweeted a video of the event and it went viral, receiving more than 16 million views in a matter of hours before Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter took it down for spreading misinformation. Twitter even blocked Don Jr. from using his account for most of the day. Simone Gold is summer media splash included big names: Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and Ed Henry, plus Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk, Glenn Beck, and conservative talk radio host Dennis Prager. Gold has claimed that the California hospital she worked for promptly fired her for appearing in the video, and says she has not practiced medicine since. But the episode provided her with instant celebrity as a victim of Big Tech censorship, a credential even more beloved by conservative media than her white coat and fancy law degree. The next day, Gold accompanied Martin to meet with Vice President Mike Pence to press for emergency-use authorization for hydroxy chloroquine and talk censorship. The day after that, she appeared on Tucker Carlson is Fox News show, one of the most watched prime-time cable news shows, with more than 3 million regular viewers. On the show, Carlson expressed outrage that Gold is hospital had fired her. “Should not you as a practicing physician with a medical degree be allowed to express your views on science as you practice it without being censored?” he asked. Gold agreed and the n seized the opportunity to make her case for hydroxy chloroquine to Carlson is millions of viewers. “Look, I majored in Russian History. I do not know anything about hydroxychloroquine,” he told her in response. “I do know about the way the country is supposed to work, and physicians should be allowed to explain their experiences, their clinical experiences, treating patients and you are not allowed to because Joe Biden getting elected is more important, and that is scary.”In a sign of how far down the far-right rabbit hole she’d already gone by the n, Gold told Carlson that because of “some negative things” people had said since the video aired, she had retained attorney and conspiracy the orist L Lin Wood to put “to rest anything people want to say that is defamatory.” Wood would later join with Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani to file a host of baseless lawsuits to try to overturn the presidential election. By early fall,it was clear that Gold is original analysis of the pandemic was mostly wrong. The virus spiked across the country and researchers declared hydroxy chloroquine useless for treating COVID Even Trump did not take it when he got sick. As her prospects in medicine dimmed, Gold seems to have become too toxic even for Fox News, which has not had her on the air since July. She had turned America is Frontline Doctors into a more traditional nonprofit organization, complete with website, spokesperson, and white papers decrying various alleged flip-flops by Anthony Fauci. But in her quest for publicity, Gold had to dive even deeper into the far-right fever swamp. For the next few months, Gold gave interviews to or public speeches with QAnon conspiracy the orists, white nationalists, B-list talk show luminaries, and a few politicians, including Representative Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), a “stop the steal” movement promoter affiliated with far-right militia groups that were part of the Capitol riots. She even went on the Patriot Radio show hosted by Matt Shea, a former Washington State legislator who has been involved in a number of armed federal standoffs, including the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016 led by Ammon Bundy. Associated with Christian nationalists, Shea has written a manifesto calling for a fundamentalist holy war, in which non-Christian males would be killed if they did not submit to Biblical law. The Jewish doctor chatted happily with him about vitamins and the value of exercise in preventing COVID. “Before I was called a quack and a fraud, people used to clap for me for working out there on the front lines,” Gold lamented, before encouraging people to give up masks and to freely gather for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. But Gold found her most loyal audience among evangelical Christian prosperity preachers, many of whom had refused to close their church doors during the lock downs and were vaccine skeptics. After big tech companies pulled down the doctors’ video in July, it was rebroadcast by Daystar, the second-largest Christian TV network in the country. Since the n, Gold has made at least six different appearances on the network founded by tel evangelists Marcus and Joni Lamb—and those visits have paid off. In mid-August, when she headlined the Lambs’ program “Ministry Now,” along with the anti-vaccine activist Robert Kennedy Jr, Marcus Lamb made a surprise announcement: He was issuing a $10,000 matching challenge from Daystar for donations on Gold is behalf. “I know that you lost your job and now it may be that God has placed something else in your heart to where you are gonna make a stand,” Joni Lamb told Gold. “It is going to take money to do that.” In October, Gold returned to chat with the ladies of “Joni Table Talk,” Daystar is tel evangelical version of “The View.” Over coffee with the hosts, Gold thanked “the whole Daystar family for being so generous,” and talked about the small donations from viewers she’d received. “It really adds up,” she said gratefully. “It gave me some breathing room to keep fighting for advocacy.”“I know that you lost your job and now it may be that God has placed something else in your heart to where you are gonna make a stand. It is going to take money to do that.”Evangelical churches were especially receptive to Gold is anti-vaccine advocacy, which she pivoted to as hydroxy chloroquine faded as a right-wing cause célèbre. Three days before the Capitol riot, Gold appeared ata religious revival e ventin Tampa, Florida, billed as an “open air mass healing and miracle service,” run by Rodney Howard-Browne. A conspiracy the orist, Howard-Browne has appeared on Alex Jones’ far-right siteInfoWarsand has called the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, a “false flag” operation. He was arrested in March for holding religious services in violation of a stay at home order. Gold took the stage before a room full of people without masks and gave an hour-long speech, where she decried the evils of the “experimental biological agent,” better known as the COVID vaccine. She said it is being tested on minority communities that have been prioritized for vaccines, which she dubbed “pure racism.”“They are making an overt and covert attempt to push this heavily on Blacks and browns,” she warned. “If you take the vaccine, you are signing up to be in a phar maco vigilance tracking system.”For most of 2020,the formerly apolitical Dr. Gold was able to separate her personal crusade for “health freedom” from the presidential election that provided the backdrop to the fight over lock downs and hydroxychloroquine. She rarely touched on the subject in public other than to suggest that“Orange Man bad”and not science drove opposition to the anti-malaria drug. But whether Gold realized it or not, the battle over the drug was less about health care policy and more of a proxy war over Trump and the future of democracy. Trump is loss to Joe Biden in November was a blow to Gold is cause, as polls showed voters resoundingly rejected his handling of the pandemic, which embraced much of what Gold advocated. It also put her on a collision course with the “stop the steal” movement that metastasized after the presidential election, as her tea party and evangelical benefactors quickly backed Trump is effort to brand the election as illegitimate and overturn the results. Gold is Stanford law degree suggests she is smart enough to know a big lie when she sees one, but “stop the steal” was where the action was, not to mention the speaking gigs and fundraising ops she now relied on for her livelihood since her medical career cratered. Once she started down the MAGA path, there was no turning back. When Trump supporters first converged in DC on November 14 at the “Million MAGA march” to contest the election results, Gold was right there with the m, along with other Trump die-hards like Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy who helped bankroll the march; Sebastian Gorka, and Representative Marjorie Taylor Green, the Georgia congresswoman who’d expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory. “You do not give up your inalienable rights just because the re is an epidemic,” Goldshouted from the Supreme Court steps, warning that the government was using an “age-old tactic” to seize power by scaring people with a disease that she said causes mostly mild illness. “Do not live in fear. Be joyful, be happy, go forward!”The event was advertised on the neo-Nazi website, theDaily Stormer, and drew hordes of militia outfits and white nationalist groups like the Proud Boys and Nick Fuentes’ Groypers. The rally descended into violence; 21 people were arrested on assault and gun charges, and one person was stabbed. That did not stop Gold from coming back to DC to speak with many of the same people at the January 5 “stop the steal” rally at Freedom Plaza—the warmup to the main event at the Capitol, organized by Ali Alexander, a convicted felon and conspiracy the orist. Speakers represented a parade of far-right figures ranging from anti-abortion activists to former Trump adviser Roger Stone. Standing under an umbrella held by a man in a “Baby Lives Matter” shirt, Gold said to the crowd, “I am here to ask you a personal question: Why are you here?…I believe the reason you are here is the same reason I am choosing to be here. Because we all have recognized a blatant assault on the rule of law… We are sick and tired of being lied to.”Kruglanski is not surprised that Gold would move from promoting a bogus COVID cure to joining with people who thought the election had been stolen. “In many cases the radical groups first shower you with love without you even accepting their ideology,” he explains. “But once you are accepted by the group, to maintain your good standing in that community you have got to accept their narrative.”The next day Gold was scheduled to speak again at the“Wild Protest”organized by Alexander near the White House, along with Tea Party Patriots’ Jenny Beth Martin and Brandon Straka, founder of the Walkaway Campaign that urges Democrats to quit the party. (Straka was also later arrested for entering the Capitol.) But the speeches were inexplicably canceled, and instead, protesters heeded Trump is call to march on the Capitol while Congress and the vice president were certifying the results of the 2020 election. Gold joined them. She was accompanied by John Strand—an international underwear model who serves as the communications director for America is Frontline Doctors. Strand, 38, had been part of regular Beverly Hills “freedom protests” against the lock downs over the summer and now lives with Gold. On the steps of the Capitol, he tweeted, “I am incredibly proud to be a patriot to day, to stand up tall in defense of liberty & the Constitution, to support Trump & #MAGAforever, & to send the message: WE ARE NEVER CONCEDING A STOLEN ELECTION.”Lawyers generally know that after engaging in a potentially criminal act, it is best to stop talking publicly about it. But Gold apparently could not resist the siren call of an interview with the Washington Post. In aJanuary 12 story, Gold admitted to being inside the Capitol on January 6. “I can certainly speak to the place that I was, and it most emphatically was not a riot,” she said, explaining dubiously that she thought it was legal to go inside. “Where I was, was incredibly peaceful.”Simone Gold (top left), on the FBI poster that became fodder for internet sleuths, who quickly ID her and posted videos liketheseonline.“Peaceful” is not a word the FBI used in court filings to describe where Gold was that day. According to an FBI agent, Gold and Strand were photographed “in a large crowd attempting to push past multiple officers blocking the entrance to the Capitol, which had visibly broken windows at the time. One of the officers, who had been pinned near the doors to the Capitol, appears to be pulled down by someone in the crowd and lands near where Strand and Gold were standing.” Videos and still photos also show the pair pressed up against the door to the House chamber where law enforcement was trying to block them. Gold told thePostthat she worried that those photos and videos would impact her ability to advocate the America is Frontline Doctors. “I do regret being the re,” Gold admitted. Her regret is understandable. For days, an image of her standing in the Capitol Rotunda with a bullhorn appeared on an FBI wanted poster seeking help identifying people who participated in the insurrection. Five days after her interview with KGET, FBI agents went to her Beverly Hills house and arrested her and Strand. A DC federal grand jury indicted her on February 5. By the n, L Lin Wood was facing disbarment efforts in Georgia, where authorities have demanded a mental health evaluation after he called for Vice President Mike Pence to be executed. He was thus unavailable to defend Gold. So why did she do it?It is impossible to know what combination of impulse, exhilaration, and conviction led Gold to follow a mob into the US Capitol. She did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, but there are a few likely dynamics at work. Let is start with her own reflections on what happened, which were surprisingly uncomplicated: “When you are crossing the street and the light turns green, you go,” she said in an interview with KGET Shaking her head somewhat ruefully, she added that she came up with the “genius” idea to give the speech she had planned to deliver at the canceled rally. “I…I just wanted to,” she stammered. “Someone had a bullhorn. I asked to use it. Those of us who were there believe the election is completely fraudulent. We just kind of wanted to be heard.”“Someone had a bullhorn. I asked to use it.”Several months before her arrest, she foreshadowed her new militancy. “Not everyone can, or should, turn to political activism. I fully understand those who point out the negative consequences this approach can have for one is career and personal life,” she wrote in her book. “Going along with the crowd in times of fear and uncertainty present their own pitfalls, as we have seen. In Judaism we often ask ourselves, ‘What does God expect of me in this situation?’ It is this emphasis on action that is essential to the Jewish faith. Trust in God, believe in yourself, and courageous conduct will follow.”It is always perilous to engage in psychoanalyzing a relatively public figure, even one who seems to be having a mid life crisis in plain sight. And yet, Haider-Markel says that while most people do not react to personal existential crisis by storming the Capitol, it might not be that surprising that Gold did. Many people who have spent a long time investing in their own education and status tend to socialize with others—like, say, in the PTA of an exclusive Beverly Hills private school—who have the same or similar credentials. In these circles, they discover that the very qualities that once made them special, all those degrees and awards they worked so hard to attain, are just the ticket to admission. Where will their prestigious resume still stand out?Simone Gold poses as a hostage for av ideo she made framing her as victim of government persecution. With co-defendant John Strand (left) and former professional boxer and current Nevada cannabis lawyer Joey Gilbert, a member of the “legal eagle dream team” at Gold is America is Frontline Doctors. Few paths to fame are as reliable as switching sides. Conservatives claiming to represent “we the people” love to dump on professional expertise and fancy pedigrees in l atte liberals—just listen to Fox is Tucker Carlson repeatedly mock MSNBC host Joy Reidfor having gone to Harvard. But when someone with fancy degrees and professional credentials abandons their over-educated tribe and converts, the right-wing superstructure will shower them with love—and money. Others in right-wing politics share similar credentials as Gold is—think Texas Senator Ted Cruz (Princeton, Harvard Law), or Missouri Senator Josh Hawley (Stanford, Yale Law), both of whom worked to overturn the election of President Joe Biden. But as senators, Cruz and Hawley are still very much part of the establishment. Their extremism is checked by their need to fundraise and get reelected. Experts say that far-right radicalism of the sort on display on January 6 and elsewhere over the past year has strong parallels not in Cruz is “defund the IRS” agenda but in Islamic radicalism, which studies have shown is full of doctors, engineers, and other professionals, even in the USs. In 2017, the Chicago Project on Security and Threats studied more than 100 people in the US, mostly American citizens, who’d been prosecuted for perpetrating a domestic attack on behalf of ISIS or going to fight for the Islamic State in Syria. They discovered that, like the Capitol rioters,two-thirds of the defendant shad a college education. Kruglanski notes, too, that many of the leaders of the neo-Nazi “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville in 2017, which left one woman dead and scores injured, were college educated, including Richard Spencer, who has a BA from the University of Virginia, a masters from the University of Chicago, and spent two years working on a PhD in modern European intellectual history at Duke University before leaving to “pursue a life of thought-crime.”“You do not have to be poor and left behind to embrace these the ories,” Kruglanski told me. When it comes to real extremism, as opposed to political grandstanding, Gold much more resembles Stewart Rhodes than Ted Cruz. Rhodes is the founder of the Oath Keepers, the far-right militia group of which about a dozen members have been charged with crimes related to the Capitol riot. Rhodes was there that day, too, but unlike Gold, he was smart enough to stay out of the building. If he had gone in, he could have joined her in the rotunda and announced, “I am a Yale-educated attorney.”Gold is initial regret about her actions at the Capitol has given way to defiance as she returned to the lecture circuit, where she has reframed herself as a victim, and her prosecution as an assault on free speech. On their pod cast recently, she told sympathetic Newsmax hostsDiamond and Silkthat she looks forward to making her case to a jury. The vaccine rollout has also provided fresh opportunities for spreading misinformation in her ongoing crusade against “medical discrimination” through America is Frontline Doctors. Evangelical groups have continued to shower her with Biblical hospitality. At the end of March, Gold took her anti-vaccine schtick to Coeur D’Alene, Idaho, a hotbed of far-right extremism, where she spoke at the “Steeling the Mind” conference put on by Compass International, a Christian ministry founded by Bill Perkins. Perkins is part of the “young earth” creationist movement, ties reflected in the conference lineup, where Gold is fellow speakers explored such topics as whether “When God created the earth in six, 24-hour days, was that 7-day creation week God is template for 7,000 years of humans on earth?”The evangelical anti-vaccine circuit has put Gold back in close quarters with people who helped set the stage for the siege at the Capitol. In mid-April, Gold appeared at a two-day “health and freedom” conference in Oklahoma at the Rhema Bible College that ended with a mask-burning ceremony. There, she took the stage along with many others who’d been involved in the “stop the steal” efforts after the election, including Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell, and L Lin Wood. In her speech, Gold announced that her America is Frontline Doctors was setting up a legal task force to help people fight pandemic-related restrictions and vaccine passports. The audience cheered when she introduced her “legal eagle dream team” member Leigh Dundas. A Scientologist, an anti-vaccine activist, and far-right agitator from Orange County, California, Dundas also happened to be at the Capitol on January 6. She can beseen in videos not far from the QAnon shaman, yelling “Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!” at the police. After getting tear gassed outside, she went back to a nearby stage where she implored people to “stand the hell up! Because you are far better off fighting on your feet and being prepared to die on your feet than living a life on your damned knees. Fight on.”Like any good victim of cancel culture, Gold is also fundraising. For weeks after her arrest, the America is Frontline Doctors web site featured a pop up box that said, “Dr. Gold and her Communications Director were arrested by the FBI in an extremely aggressive manner. They need your support. This fight is not just for the m, but for you. Clearly this political persecution of a law-abiding emergency physician is designed to threaten and intimidate any American who dares to exercise their 1st Amendment rights. The legal pressures mounting against Dr. Gold require your urgent and generous donations to withstand such aggressive assaults from the ruthless enemies of free speech.”As of May 5, she’draked in $392,000.

The Jewish doctor chatted happily with him about vitamins and the value of exercise in preventing COVID. “Before I was called a quack and a fraud, people used to clap for me for working out there on the front lines,” Gold lamented, before encouraging people to give up masks and to freely gather for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. But Gold found her most loyal audience among evangelical Christian prosperity preachers, many of whom had refused to close their church doors during the lock downs and were vaccine skeptics. After big tech companies pulled down the doctors’ video in July, it was rebroadcast by Daystar, the second-largest Christian TV network in the country. Since the n, Gold has made at least six different appearances on the network founded by tel evangelists Marcus and Joni Lamb—and those visits have paid off. In mid-August, when she headlined the Lambs’ program “Ministry Now,” along with the anti-vaccine activist Robert Kennedy Jr, Marcus Lamb made a surprise announcement: He was issuing a $10,000 matching challenge from Daystar for donations on Gold is behalf. “I know that you lost your job and now it may be that God has placed something else in your heart to where you are gonna make a stand,” Joni Lamb told Gold. “It is going to take money to do that.” In October, Gold returned to chat with the ladies of “Joni Table Talk,” Daystar is tel evangelical version of “The View.” Over coffee with the hosts, Gold thanked “the whole Daystar family for being so generous,” and talked about the small donations from viewers she’d received. “It really adds up,” she said gratefully. “It gave me some breathing room to keep fighting for advocacy.”Evangelical churches were especially receptive to Gold is anti-vaccine advocacy, which she pivoted to as hydroxy chloroquine faded as a right-wing cause célèbre. Three days before the Capitol riot, Gold appeared ata religious revival e ventin Tampa, Florida, billed as an “open air mass healing and miracle service,” run by Rodney Howard-Browne. A conspiracy the orist, Howard-Browne has appeared on Alex Jones’ far-right site and has called the mass shooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, a “false flag” operation. He was arrested in March for holding religious services in violation of a stay at home order. Gold took the stage before a room full of people without masks and gave an hour-long speech, where she decried the evils of the “experimental biological agent,” better known as the COVID vaccine. She said it is being tested on minority communities that have been prioritized for vaccines, which she dubbed “pure racism.”“They are making an overt and covert attempt to push this heavily on Blacks and browns,” she warned. “If you take the vaccine, you are signing up to be in a phar maco vigilance tracking system.”For most of 2020,the formerly apolitical Dr. Gold was able to separate her personal crusade for “health freedom” from the presidential election that provided the backdrop to the fight over lock downs and hydroxychloroquine. She rarely touched on the subject in public other than to suggest that“Orange Man bad”and not science drove opposition to the anti-malaria drug. But whether Gold realized it or not, the battle over the drug was less about health care policy and more of a proxy war over Trump and the future of democracy. Trump is loss to Joe Biden in November was a blow to Gold is cause, as polls showed voters resoundingly rejected his handling of the pandemic, which embraced much of what Gold advocated. It also put her on a collision course with the “stop the steal” movement that metastasized after the presidential election, as her tea party and evangelical benefactors quickly backed Trump is effort to brand the election as illegitimate and overturn the results. Gold is Stanford law degree suggests she is smart enough to know a big lie when she sees one, but “stop the steal” was where the action was, not to mention the speaking gigs and fundraising ops she now relied on for her livelihood since her medical career cratered. Once she started down the MAGA path, there was no turning back. When Trump supporters first converged in DC on November 14 at the “Million MAGA march” to contest the election results, Gold was right there with the m, along with other Trump die-hards like Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy who helped bankroll the march; Sebastian Gorka, and Representative Marjorie Taylor Green, the Georgia congresswoman who’d expressed support for the QAnon conspiracy theory. “You do not give up your inalienable rights just because the re is an epidemic,” Goldshouted from the Supreme Court steps, warning that the government was using an “age-old tactic” to seize power by scaring people with a disease that she said causes mostly mild illness. “Do not live in fear. Be joyful, be happy, go forward!”The event was advertised on the neo-Nazi website, the, and drew hordes of militia outfits and white nationalist groups like the Proud Boys and Nick Fuentes’ Groypers. The rally descended into violence; 21 people were arrested on assault and gun charges, and one person was stabbed. That did not stop Gold from coming back to DC to speak with many of the same people at the January 5 “stop the steal” rally at Freedom Plaza—the warmup to the main event at the Capitol, organized by Ali Alexander, a convicted felon and conspiracy the orist. Speakers represented a parade of far-right figures ranging from anti-abortion activists to former Trump adviser Roger Stone. Standing under an umbrella held by a man in a “Baby Lives Matter” shirt, Gold said to the crowd, “I am here to ask you a personal question: Why are you here?…I believe the reason you are here is the same reason I am choosing to be here. Because we all have recognized a blatant assault on the rule of law… We are sick and tired of being lied to.”Kruglanski is not surprised that Gold would move from promoting a bogus COVID cure to joining with people who thought the election had been stolen. “In many cases the radical groups first shower you with love without you even accepting their ideology,” he explains. “But once you are accepted by the group, to maintain your good standing in that community you have got to accept their narrative.”The next day Gold was scheduled to speak again at the“Wild Protest”organized by Alexander near the White House, along with Tea Party Patriots’ Jenny Beth Martin and Brandon Straka, founder of the Walkaway Campaign that urges Democrats to quit the party. (Straka was also later arrested for entering the Capitol.) But the speeches were inexplicably canceled, and instead, protesters heeded Trump is call to march on the Capitol while Congress and the vice president were certifying the results of the 2020 election. Gold joined them. She was accompanied by John Strand—an international underwear model who serves as the communications director for America is Frontline Doctors. Strand, 38, had been part of regular Beverly Hills “freedom protests” against the lock downs over the summer and now lives with Gold. On the steps of the Capitol, he tweeted, “I am incredibly proud to be a patriot to day, to stand up tall in defense of liberty & the Constitution, to support Trump & #MAGAforever, & to send the message: WE ARE NEVER CONCEDING A STOLEN ELECTION.”Lawyers generally know that after engaging in a potentially criminal act, it is best to stop talking publicly about it. But Gold apparently could not resist the siren call of an interview with the. In aJanuary 12 story, Gold admitted to being inside the Capitol on January 6. “I can certainly speak to the place that I was, and it most emphatically was not a riot,” she said, explaining dubiously that she thought it was legal to go inside. “Where I was, was incredibly peaceful.”Simone Gold (top left), on the FBI poster that became fodder for internet sleuths, who quickly ID her and posted videos liketheseonline.“Peaceful” is not a word the FBI used in court filings to describe where Gold was that day. According to an FBI agent, Gold and Strand were photographed “in a large crowd attempting to push past multiple officers blocking the entrance to the Capitol, which had visibly broken windows at the time. One of the officers, who had been pinned near the doors to the Capitol, appears to be pulled down by someone in the crowd and lands near where Strand and Gold were standing.” Videos and still photos also show the pair pressed up against the door to the House chamber where law enforcement was trying to block them. Gold told the that she worried that those photos and videos would impact her ability to advocate the America is Frontline Doctors. “I do regret being the re,” Gold admitted. Her regret is understandable. For days, an image of her standing in the Capitol Rotunda with a bullhorn appeared on an FBI wanted poster seeking help identifying people who participated in the insurrection. Five days after her interview with KGET, FBI agents went to her Beverly Hills house and arrested her and Strand. A DC federal grand jury indicted her on February 5. By the n, L Lin Wood was facing disbarment efforts in Georgia, where authorities have demanded a mental health evaluation after he called for Vice President Mike Pence to be executed. He was thus unavailable to defend Gold. So why did she do it?It is impossible to know what combination of impulse, exhilaration, and conviction led Gold to follow a mob into the US Capitol. She did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, but there are a few likely dynamics at work. Let is start with her own reflections on what happened, which were surprisingly uncomplicated: “When you are crossing the street and the light turns green, you go,” she said in an interview with KGET Shaking her head somewhat ruefully, she added that she came up with the “genius” idea to give the speech she had planned to deliver at the canceled rally. “I…I just wanted to,” she stammered. “Someone had a bullhorn. I asked to use it. Those of us who were there believe the election is completely fraudulent. We just kind of wanted to be heard.”Several months before her arrest, she foreshadowed her new militancy. “Not everyone can, or should, turn to political activism. I fully understand those who point out the negative consequences this approach can have for one is career and personal life,” she wrote in her book. “Going along with the crowd in times of fear and uncertainty present their own pitfalls, as we have seen. In Judaism we often ask ourselves, ‘What does God expect of me in this situation?’ It is this emphasis on action that is essential to the Jewish faith. Trust in God, believe in yourself, and courageous conduct will follow.”It is always perilous to engage in psychoanalyzing a relatively public figure, even one who seems to be having a mid life crisis in plain sight. And yet, Haider-Markel says that while most people do not react to personal existential crisis by storming the Capitol, it might not be that surprising that Gold did. Many people who have spent a long time investing in their own education and status tend to socialize with others—like, say, in the PTA of an exclusive Beverly Hills private school—who have the same or similar credentials. In these circles, they discover that the very qualities that once made them special, all those degrees and awards they worked so hard to attain, are just the ticket to admission. Where will their prestigious resume still stand out?Simone Gold poses as a hostage for av ideo she made framing her as victim of government persecution. With co-defendant John Strand (left) and former professional boxer and current Nevada cannabis lawyer Joey Gilbert, a member of the “legal eagle dream team” at Gold is America is Frontline Doctors. Few paths to fame are as reliable as switching sides. Conservatives claiming to represent “we the people” love to dump on professional expertise and fancy pedigrees in l atte liberals—just listen to Fox is Tucker Carlson repeatedly mock MSNBC host Joy Reidfor having gone to Harvard. But when someone with fancy degrees and professional credentials abandons their over-educated tribe and converts, the right-wing superstructure will shower them with love—and money. Others in right-wing politics share similar credentials as Gold is—think Texas Senator Ted Cruz (Princeton, Harvard Law), or Missouri Senator Josh Hawley (Stanford, Yale Law), both of whom worked to overturn the election of President Joe Biden. But as senators, Cruz and Hawley are still very much part of the establishment. Their extremism is checked by their need to fundraise and get reelected. Experts say that far-right radicalism of the sort on display on January 6 and elsewhere over the past year has strong parallels not in Cruz is “defund the IRS” agenda but in Islamic radicalism, which studies have shown is full of doctors, engineers, and other professionals, even in the USs. In 2017, the Chicago Project on Security and Threats studied more than 100 people in the US, mostly American citizens, who’d been prosecuted for perpetrating a domestic attack on behalf of ISIS or going to fight for the Islamic State in Syria. They discovered that, like the Capitol rioters,two-thirds of the defendant shad a college education. Kruglanski notes, too, that many of the leaders of the neo-Nazi “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville in 2017, which left one woman dead and scores injured, were college educated, including Richard Spencer, who has a BA from the University of Virginia, a masters from the University of Chicago, and spent two years working on a PhD in modern European intellectual history at Duke University before leaving to “pursue a life of thought-crime.”“You do not have to be poor and left behind to embrace these the ories,” Kruglanski told me. When it comes to real extremism, as opposed to political grandstanding, Gold much more resembles Stewart Rhodes than Ted Cruz. Rhodes is the founder of the Oath Keepers, the far-right militia group of which about a dozen members have been charged with crimes related to the Capitol riot. Rhodes was there that day, too, but unlike Gold, he was smart enough to stay out of the building. If he had gone in, he could have joined her in the rotunda and announced, “I am a Yale-educated attorney.”Gold is initial regret about her actions at the Capitol has given way to defiance as she returned to the lecture circuit, where she has reframed herself as a victim, and her prosecution as an assault on free speech. On their pod cast recently, she told sympathetic Newsmax hostsDiamond and Silkthat she looks forward to making her case to a jury. The vaccine rollout has also provided fresh opportunities for spreading misinformation in her ongoing crusade against “medical discrimination” through America is Frontline Doctors. Evangelical groups have continued to shower her with Biblical hospitality. At the end of March, Gold took her anti-vaccine schtick to Coeur D’Alene, Idaho, a hotbed of far-right extremism, where she spoke at the “Steeling the Mind” conference put on by Compass International, a Christian ministry founded by Bill Perkins. Perkins is part of the “young earth” creationist movement, ties reflected in the conference lineup, where Gold is fellow speakers explored such topics as whether “When God created the earth in six, 24-hour days, was that 7-day creation week God is template for 7,000 years of humans on earth?”The evangelical anti-vaccine circuit has put Gold back in close quarters with people who helped set the stage for the siege at the Capitol. In mid-April, Gold appeared at a two-day “health and freedom” conference in Oklahoma at the Rhema Bible College that ended with a mask-burning ceremony. There, she took the stage along with many others who’d been involved in the “stop the steal” efforts after the election, including Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell, and L Lin Wood. In her speech, Gold announced that her America is Frontline Doctors was setting up a legal task force to help people fight pandemic-related restrictions and vaccine passports. The audience cheered when she introduced her “legal eagle dream team” member Leigh Dundas. A Scientologist, an anti-vaccine activist, and far-right agitator from Orange County, California, Dundas also happened to be at the Capitol on January 6. She can beseen in videos not far from the QAnon shaman, yelling “Traitor! Traitor! Traitor!” at the police. After getting tear gassed outside, she went back to a nearby stage where she implored people to “stand the hell up! Because you are far better off fighting on your feet and being prepared to die on your feet than living a life on your damned knees. Fight on.”Like any good victim of cancel culture, Gold is also fundraising. For weeks after her arrest, the America is Frontline Doctors web site featured a pop up box that said, “Dr. Gold and her Communications Director were arrested by the FBI in an extremely aggressive manner. They need your support. This fight is not just for the m, but for you. Clearly this political persecution of a law-abiding emergency physician is designed to threaten and intimidate any American who dares to exercise their 1st Amendment rights. The legal pressures mounting against Dr. Gold require your urgent and generous donations to withstand such aggressive assaults from the ruthless enemies of free speech.”As of May 5, she’draked in $392,000.

205,"What Trump is Facebook, Google and Twitter lawsuits really mean for his campaign",-10.0,41.33,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/what-trump-s-facebook-google-twitter-lawsuits-really-mean-his-n1273319,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-07,25,"In a move familiar to anyone who has witnessed a schoolyard bully react to being thrown out of a game for violating the rules, former President Donald Trump is lashing out. Trump is primary problem in this lawsuit is, well, the law. Trump on Wednesday announced that he issuing Facebook, Twitter and Google-owned YouTube, as well as their respective CEOs for, well, following their own rules and kicking him off their platforms. He is done so on behalf of himself and “similarly situated” people in an attempt to wage a class-action suit against the social media giants. Trump is primary problem in this lawsuit is, well, the law. The suit is predicated on the assumption that in booting Trump, these companies violated his First Amendment rights. TheFirst Amendmentprovides that “Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech.” This prohibition applies not just to Congress (and federal laws), but also to all government representatives and agents. This means that someone who is a member of any level of government — local, state or federal — cannot restrict your freedom of speech (with some limited exceptions). Trump is main difficulty here is that Facebook, Twitter and Google, while indisputably powerful, are private companies, not part of the government. When social media companies act, it is a private action, not government action. Facebook, Twitter and Google by definition ca not trample on your First Amendment rights because only the government, and not corporations, can do so. Surely, you say to yourselves, the former president of the USs and his lawyers must know about this fundamental flaw in their lawsuit? Well, yes — but Trump attempts to argue that the companies should be treated as state agencies who can, in fact, violate their individual users’ First Amendment rights. Namely, the suit claims because these companies benefit from the protections of a federal law, the 1996 Communications Decency Act, that Democratic legislators (who are, in fact, state actors) had special leverage over Facebook, Twitter and Google. Trump the n argues that because the companies “are vulnerable to and react to coercive pressure from the federal government to regulate specific speech,” they were coerced into “censoring the specific speech at issue in this lawsuit and de-platforming” him. And, the suit continues, making a reference to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that because the companies were “acting in concert with federal officials, including officials at the CDC and the Biden transition,” their “censorship activities amount to state action.”Facebook, Twitter and Google by definition ca not trample on your First Amendment rights because only the government, and not corporations, can do so. Unsatisfied after introducing just one erroneous legal argument, Trump the n specifically calls on the court to strike downSection 230 of the Communications Decency Actas unconstitutional. (It is not.)The act, which dates back to 1996 when the internet was in its infancy, largely protects online sites from liability based on what their users say on those sites and for their decisions about content moderation. None of this demonstrates that private companies have magically transformed into government actors. No, these arguments have enough holes to drive a Mack truck right through them. In effect, Trump has inverted the First Amendment argument here. Facebook, Twitter and Google have their own First Amendment rights to set the terms of their platforms’ use, free of government intrusion. Each company is also free to exclude users from its platforms for things like, oh, let is hypothetically say inciting an insurrection. Let is pause for a moment and remember that Trump was the leader of the federal government when he claims that the actions of private companies, who to ssed them off their platforms, violated his First Amendment rights. (That ringing you hear is the sound of irony calling.)In effect, Trump has inverted the First Amendment argument here. So, Trump is arguments are legally invalid and at times nonsensical. We have to ask ourselves: What is this lawsuit really about? It is not about the law — it is about politics. All 44 pages are just a political argument dressed in legal clothes. Facebook, Twitter and Google offered Trump a significant megaphone. In the span of a few days, he went from being able to broadcast his message with three of the world is most powerful bullhorns to being reduced to a whisper. His rallies, packed as they may be, are no substitute for the reach of social media. Trump is megaphone has not only been diminished, but perhaps just as important, his fundraising tools have also dulled. Social media platforms provided Trump with the easy ability to raise campaign donations directly and indirectly. Campaign rallies do not offer attendees the same ability to “click here to make a donation.”And if you wondered whether this is all really about raising political donations, take a gander at the fundraising pleas that GOP committees sent out moments after Trump filed his suits. We should all recognize that these suits are unmoored from any cognizable theory. They will not succeed in courtrooms. But will they succeed in further persuading Trump is base that Big Tech companies have engaged in a conspiracy against Trump and other Republicans? Maybe. And that is a problem that ca not be solved by a federal judge dismissing these suits. Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, is the host of the ""Passing Judgment"" podcast. She is also the director of the Public Service Institute at Loyola Law School, director of Loyola is Journalist Law School and former president of the Los Angeles Ethics Commission.",1,1,MSNBC
206,Private schools are the real college admissions scandal.,-6.33,41.0,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/06/private-schools-competitive-college-advantage-problems.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-14,25,"The Supreme Court kicked the can down the road today on the case of Students for Fair Admissions’ case against Harvard University, with an invitation to the solicitor general to write a brief expressing the view of the USs. The invitation is a delay, but the case will be considered again. SFFA attempts to argue that the nation is most famous college discriminates against Asian Americans in the admissions process, and even thoughit is lost twice in court, it is expected that this current court, packed with conservative justices, would rule in favor of the ast ro turf organization dedicated to killing affirmative action should it decide to hear the case. SSFA is leader, Ed Blum, has been trying for decades to eliminate affirmative action in college admissions. After he failed with Abigail Fisher is suit against the University of Texas (that one argued Fisher had been discriminated against for being white but failed to provide compelling evidence), Blum started courting Asian American students who were rejected by Ivy League institutions. It is unclear how many he found, since not one student testified on SFFA is behalf during the trial, but the organization is legal strategy relied on statistical arguments to claim that Harvard is admissions policies gave advantages to legacies, donors, athletes, and underrepresented minorities, which hurt Asian American applicants. In trying to claim an equivalence between providing unfair advantages to the already advantaged (legacies, donors, athletes) and taking race and racism into account during the admissions process, SFFA has cannily yoked its attack on race-conscious admissions to a critique of actually illegitimate advantages given to the white and wealthy. But the re is a clear tell in this strategy that reveals SFFA does not really care about unearned advantages: It said nothing about graduating from a private high school. Graduating from private high school is a far larger advantage at many top ranked colleges than playing sports or being a legacy or even having a connection to a donor are. (Viewed a certain way, a private school is almost a more reliable income source for an elite college than a donor.) While 10 percent of students admitted toHarvard is Class of 2018were recruited athletes and 12 percent were legacies,almost 40 percent of the class went to a private school. If we really wanted to get rid of the most glaring case of bias at prestigious private universities, we would target private high school students. Legacy, donor, and athletic preferences should be stripped out of college admissions too, but when it comes to tipping the scales away from fairness and equity, private schools outweigh everything else. Only 7 percent of high school students attended private high schools in the USs in 2019,according to Census Bureau data, but at many of the most selective colleges in the nation private school grads make up a third to half of freshman classes. This is the real scandal in college admissions: Wealthy families pay for their children to attend high schools that receive preferential treatment in the admissions process at highly rejective colleges. Defenders of private high schools’ overrepresentation at many highly ranked universities might claim the students have reaped the benefit of a more rigorous education in order to earn their spot. When you control for wealth, however, private school is academic and social-emotional benefits are basically wiped out. Historically, students from the nation is elite boarding schools “perform[ed] worse in the classroom [at Harvard] than other students over the entire 1924-1990 period” but went on to make more money than their peers by taking advantage of the connections they made in groups like final clubs, which largely exclude anyone who is not wealthy or white. St. Grottlesexstudents and their peers at old nondenominational private schools might be a little less white and little less wealthy than they were a century ago, but have no doubt: These schools still do not look like America. This year is graduating class of public high school students is the first projected to be majority-nonwhite, but almost70 percent of private school students are white. That is a product, in part, of along history of white people pulling their children out of public schools after desegregation, and private schools continuing to make an outsize contribution to school segregation in the USs. Most independent schools do provide some financial aid, but it often goes to a small share of students. At Marlborough, an independent school in Los Angeles where the cost of attendance is about $45,000, only 20 percent of families receive financial aid, and almost half of those who do still make more than $200,000 per year. About 6 percent of all the school is students come from families making less than $100,000,even though almost two-thirds of American households make less than that. Some independent schools enroll a number of low-income students on scholarship, and these “privileged poor,” to use Anthony Jack is term,account for half the low-income students at some highly selective universities, further evidence of the advantage granted to these schools in the admissions process. Private high schools can cost as much as$70,000per year. For those prices, students get not onlysingle-digit student-to-teacher ratios,teachers with PhD.s,better sports facilities than those at many colleges, anda rt museums, but also college counselors who work with a fraction of the number of students public school counselors work with. At Horace Mann, in the Bronx,180 seniors are served by eight college counselors. Fewer than 2 miles away,12 guidance counselors work with 750 seniors at Bronx Science. Both high schools are full of very talented students, but only one of them pays its director of college counseling $350,000 per year. That salary is an index of just how much emphasis the parents who pay for independent schools place on getting their kids into certain universities, which may be why the median salary for a college counselor at independent schools is $94,000 but the median salary for a teacher is $60,000, according to the National Association of Independent Schools. Many independent school counselors started in college admissions, often at highly selective colleges;one of the newest members of this rank was a dean of admissions at an Ivy League university just last fall. These high schools are paying not just for experts who know the rules of the game; they are paying for experts who know the referees. It is a cozy world, where private school counselors meet up with admissions officers at small invitation-only annual meetings, like the Fitzwilliam Conferenceheld in the woods of New Hampshire every May for three days, including a six-hour block for “golf, hiking, antiquing.” And the n the re is the annual Clambake Institute, where private school counselors and admissions officers get together every summer atSt. George is Schooljust outside Newport, Rhode Island—the perfect setting for cementing and perpetuating the special bond between rich high schools, rich students, and rich universities. That special bond is cashed in through one of the least-well-known rituals of college admissions:the counselor call. It is a decades-old tradition, in which school counselors and admissions officers review a list of students who have applied to a college, and counselors get a chance to make a case for their students. Swarthmore College put an end to the practice this past year after it discovered that more than 90 percent of their requests for counselor calls came from private high schools. This spring, USC began telling counselors requesting a call that any conversation would be informational, and asked counselors to “refrain from advocating for candidates.”But simply attending certain high schools can provide enough of an advantage that no advocacy is needed. Harvard is dean of admissions said as much under oath in 2018during the SFFA trial: “[Sometimes] we take somebody … lower in the class … and we have got some other very attractive people at the upper end of the class. Sometimes you can make an argument to take them both because they are both terrific.” The dean continued, “It is also a very good message to that school that you may be trying to develop that you are looking for all kinds of different people.”In other words, someone thought that a good way for Harvard to defend itself against charges that it unfairly advantaged underrepresented minorities was to say, no, no, do not worry, the unfair advantage goes to overrepresented wealthy students. The word gives away the game. Any head of admissions knows that he needs to build a reliable pipeline of customers from certain institutions. As Harvard is dean testified, “We are trying to create relationships with schools. … We are trying to create 100-year relationships with them.”Even as it feels counter to the endeavor of competitive admissions based on merit, it is perfectly logical for colleges and private high schools to pursue cozy relationships. To quote Willie Sutton, that is where the money is. A full-paying student at an Ivy League school is worth well more than a quarter-million dollars in revenue over four years, plus future donations. Some schools will send five or six students a year, which adds up to a million-plus in revenue, year over year for ideally a century or more, apparently. In return, the high schools gain a level of access that lets them charge more than what many Americans make per year. To be fair, super selective universities also cultivate these relationships with organizations likeQuestbridgeand some public school counselors to create a pipeline for high-achieving, low-income students, but the numbers suggest the re is a lot more pipe being laid on the Upper East Side of Manhattan than in the South Bronx or rural New York. There is little point in criticizing any of the individuals involved in this corrupt relationship between private schools and highly selective colleges. The parents who send their kids to independent schools and the counselors and teachers working in them are, in my experience, conscientious and caring individuals keenly aware of their students’ privilege and their own, and many of them work hard to increase equity and diversity at their school and in college admissions. Some of them ran into opposition this past year, as a few white parents bristled at schools’ efforts to introduce diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the wake of the anti-racist protests last summer as well asa string of affecting social media campaigns where Black students revealed the racism they routinely faced at school. If we are going to have an aristocracy, I guess it is better to have a woke one. But would not it be better to have no aristocracy at all?Short of eliminating private schools, we cannot eliminate the advantage families purchase by enrolling their children in them. We might, however, reduce some of that advantage by doing four things. First, all universities should end counselor calls. Second, universities should be required to report annually what type of high schools their first-time students attended, disaggregated by race. More than half of the top 75 institutions in the US News & World Report rankings do not publish this information, suggesting they either do not think the overrepresentation of private high school students matters or that they want to keep that fact out of sight. I am not sure which is worse. Third, universities should stop asking school counselors for letters of recommendation. How can a counselor responsible for 200 seniors possibly write each one a letter as effectively as one with only 30 students can?Fourth, admissions offices should redact the name of the school during the admissions process and stop assigning applications by region, as most highly selective colleges do. Context is essential for admissions officers to consider applicants’ merits rather than their accomplishments. A file could still contain relevant information about a high school, such as the number of students on free lunch programs, or its student-to-counselor ratio.

Thank you for checking on me. This is horrifying.”Like the rest of America, I watched the chaos unfold on TV Although I was about a mile away from the Capitolbuilding, I feared for the safety of my colleagues and friends who were in the complex, as well as the thousands of staff — especially the Black and brown support workers — who dutifully keep the sprawling Capitol complex humming every day. AdvertisementWe never pass without a smile and sometimes a gentle nod that signals, “I see you, brother, I see you, sister.” This exchange is spiritually familiar to every Black Hill staffer who is accustomed to going long stretches without seeing another Black face in their workday. I feared for them on Wednesday. I have had the honor of working in the Senate for Senator Elizabeth Warren for over six years. I am proud to be on her team. I am proud to be Black in this space and in these halls of power. It carries a profound sense of duty and responsibility to my community. One that I carry close to my chest, because that is how we work. One of the core philosophies of being a Hill staffer is to do the work quietly, in the wings of history. We are not in the spotlight. We support our bosses, whom the people elected, and help advance their priorities for the country and, in my case, for Massachusetts. The action is on the House and Senate floor. We are the supporting players, and most of us prefer it that way. But seeing staff fleeing a violent mob, hiding in barricaded offices, calling and text ing loved ones to say “I love you,” just in case — the tragedy had moved to the wings. It was almost too much to watch. AdvertisementThis is the image I ca not forget. I have walked this hall 100s maybe 1000s of times w/pride & sense of duty around being a Black staffer in this space. But this message is loud & clear. Spent yesterday text ing friends & fam I am ok. Seeing this picture I realize. No, I am not.pic.twitter.com/x7hGazMkHQThe image that shook me was the Confederate flag being carried confidently and brazenly through the halls of Congress. Historians have noted that not even during the Civil War did this violent symbol of white power and oppression penetrate the halls of our Capitol. And yet, a white mob had successfully and violently ushered this hate into the bowels of Congress. The chilling contrast between these images and the images of violence used against mostly peaceful protesters for Black lives last summer was profound. Growing up in Georgia, I saw that flag several times a week in front of homes, restaurants, and stores as a symbol of hate that carried a simple message:Youare not welcomed here. But this was the first time I’d seen that message on display at my place of work. I have walked the halls of Congress so often that I probably take for granted how my very presence in the building is a miracle — the result of years of hard-fought civil rights victories and justice work. And consequently, a threat to racists and white nationalists who wish to take us back to whenever they perceived America was “great.”I spent most of the afternoon letting friends know I was OK and safe, but this photo made me realize, no, I am not. And the rioters in that mob did not intend for me or my colleagues to feel safe. AdvertisementMy native state of Georgia proved this week what our civil rights giants, including fellow Georgians the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Representative John Lewis, told us: Progress is not inevitable, but it is possible with lots of hard work. And this week is historic and momentous elections of the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff to represent Georgia in the Senate allow me to carry a well of hope that it is darkest before dawn. But January 6 was an ugly day for our democracy and for our nation. It was also traumatic for the countless public servants who proudly serve without recognition or glory to keep our country moving forward. We are resilient. We will heal from this trauma together. We will get back to the quiet, important work of the nation. We will keep marching forward.

208,Is There a Future for Fusionism?,12.33,30.67,https://reason.com/2021/02/10/is-there-a-future-for-fusionism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/reason-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-10,25,"There is a well-worn tale about modern American conservatism: It says that the movement as we know it came into being during the mid–20th century as a ""fusionist"" coalition of economic libertarians and religious traditionalists. These groups, whose goals and priorities differed from the start, were held together mainly by two things: the sheer charisma of founder William F Buckley Jr., and the shared enemy of global communism. As long as the Cold War endured, the story goes, each wing was willing to cede some ground to the other. In light of the threat posed by a rampaging Soviet Union—as militantly atheistic as it was militantly anti-capitalist—the differences between the libertarians and the traditionalists did not seem so great. Their interests, at least, were aligned. But the fall of the USSR meant the collapse of the common foe that had sustained the fusionist partnership. It was able to trundle on for a while, powered by a reservoir of goodwill, but it has long been running on fumes. In the last few years, the alliance is inherent tensions have come to a head. It is increasingly common to hear that, whatever value there may have been in cooperation during the '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s, the era of good conservative feelings is over. For many libertarians, the Trump years revealed their traditionalist allies to be hypocrites and opportunists, all too willing to sell out the ideals of fusionism in service of an aspiring dictator. Conservatives have commenced a not-so-slow descent toward authoritarianism, some in this group suggest; if the philosophy of liberty is to have a future, it must involve building bridges to the left, not the right. A number of traditionalists, meanwhile, have been tripping over each other in their rush to celebrate the end of fusionism. What the 21st century demands, they say, is a different, more ""muscular"" style of politics, practiced by a Republican Party that finally stops worrying and learns to love the state. By passing stronger laws, these ""post-liberal"" conservatives believe they can restore America is lost Judeo-Christian character and save their country from itself. This is quite a change from the Reagan Republicanism of a few decades ago. Back the n, most folks on the right insisted that limited government and personal responsibility were the watchwords of conservatism. That consensus has now broken down. From literature to philosophy to religion, it is hard to think of a the me less original than the seductiveness of power. That, after all, is the story of Frodo and the ring; of Lord Acton and ""absolute power corrupts absolutely""; of Satan and the third temptation of Christ. One of history is great recurrent lessons is about the importance of keeping that desire in check, in our hearts and our governments alike. Which is why it is exasperating to watch so many conservatives—self-proclaimed heirs to the axiom that ""example is the school of mankind,"" in Edmund Burke is phrase—succumb in real time to the fantasy that are the exception to this time-tested rule. As far as the post-liberal conservatives are concerned, libertarianism is preoccupation with protecting liberty has blinded it to the importance of promoting virtue (and a constellation of related values, including faith, family, community, and patriotism). The most moderate version of this argument suggests that libertarians have come to exercise too much influence over the right-of-center policy agenda and proposes a so-called rebalancing toward traditionalist concerns. A more radical version excoriates libertarianism as philosophically bankrupt and calls upon the keepers of the conservative flame to take a sledgehammer to the fusionist coalition once and for all. Hillsdale College is David Azerrad put the latter position starkly in a July 2020 essay for. ""The common enemy that justified an alliance with the free market fundamentalists is long gone,"" he wrote. ""Today, libertarians actively side with our enemies: they promote open borders and empty prisons, and strengthen China is hand through their consumer-focused economic policies. Ours is primarily a conservatism of countries and borders, citizens and families, none of which can take root in the barren libertarian soil of atomized individuals and global markets.""The post-liberal agenda is typified by a desire for more government involvement in people is lives. As' Ross Douthat wrote in 2019, this group seeks ""stronger state interventions in the economy on behalf of socially conservative ends."" Or, as Azerrad put it in his essay, ""the right must be comfortable wielding the levers of state power.""Economically, post-liberalism rejects the doctrine of ""unfettered"" free markets in favor of tariffs, an ""industrial policy"" intended to prop up American manufacturers in the face of competition from overseas, wage subsidies, and the like. On social issues, it supports everything from vice laws to a rollback of no-fault divorce to more robust speech restrictions on public morality grounds to (among a lively cohort of radical Catholics especially) the imposition of a confessional state and perhaps even a Christian monarch. There is little evidence that the post-liberals are speaking for the average Republican, let alone the average American. But the elite wind does seem to be at their backs. Fox News host Tucker Carlson was once an avatar of fusionism who supported Ron Paul for president in both 1988 and 2008 and told in 2010, ""I despise laws that tell people that they ca not do things for their own good."" By January 2019, he was delivering a 15-minute on-air monologue decrying the failures of capitalism. ""Does anyone still believe that cheaper iPhones or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy?"" Carlson asked. ""Libertarians tell us that is how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives,"" he continued, referring specifically to payday lenders. ""OK But it is also disgusting.""Two months later, the Christian journal published a manifesto, signed by 15 conservative intellectuals, inveighing against a ""dead consensus"" that favors ""individual autonomy"" at the expense of ""permanent truths, family stability, communal solidarity, and much else."" Four months after that, the political the orist Yoram Hazony organized an impressively attended conference promoting conservative nationalism. He took the opportunity on behalf of those present to ""declare independence"" from neoliberalism, classical liberalism, and libertarianism. In November 2019, Senator Marco Rubio (R–Fla.) raised more than a few eyebrows when he gave an address at Washington, DC is Catholic University rejecting ""the notion that, left unguided, the market will solve our problems."" He called instead for a system of ""common-good capitalism"" capable of restoring the ""balance between the obligations and rights of the private sector and working Americans.""This, Rubio argued, can be accomplished only through some measure of state direction. ""Promoting the common good will require public policies that drive investments in key industries,"" he said, ""because pure market principles and our national interest are not aligned."" Fortunately for us all, the senior senator from the Sunshine State came equipped with plans for, among other things, ""a national co-operative that guarantees investment"" in the rare-earth mineral sector. Rubio is fervor for a conservatism that has made its peace with a bigger, more powerful central government has been matched and exceeded by some of his colleagues. First-term Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, for example—until recently the Republican Party is brightest young thing—seems not to have found a meddlesome technology regulation or ""pro-family"" policy he does not like. ""We must put aside the tired orthodoxies of years past,"" he said in a May 2019 Senate speech. ""We need not just a bigger economy but a better society.""In spring 2020, a new think tank called American Compass came online—""an organization dedicated to helping American conservatism recover from its chronic case of market fundamentalism,"" as founder Oren Cass put it in an announcement published by. Among the group is favored policies are subsidies for American manufacturers, reducing ""toward zero"" the number of visas granted to Chinese college students, and legally requiring corporations to put the common good ahead of profit seeking—perhaps by ordering them to include labor representatives on their boards of directors, thus ""short-circuiting the default assumptions of shareholder primacy by including workers among those to whom management is accountable.""That last suggestion is striking in its similarity to a 2018 bill introduced by progressive Senator Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.), which would require US companies ""to consider the interests of all corporate stakeholders,"" including by giving workers the right to fill 40 percent of board seats. Warren has been a public enemy of the political right for nigh on a decade. Yet the conservative media have heaped acclaim on Cass' efforts and held him out as the future of the movement. This sentiment culminated last August in a lengthy essay by columnist David Brooks that contained glowing mini-profiles of Hawley and Rubio and that extensively quoted Cass. ""Over the long term,"" Brooks concluded, ""some version of Working-Class Republicanism will redefine the GO P.""In 2018, Samuel Hammond, a researcher at the centrist Niskanen Center, persuasively argued that Warren is proposal represented a ""corporate catastrophe"" in the making. Today, he is a contributor to the American Compass blog, where not long ago he urged readers to stand up and insist: ""Conservatives believe in supporting families directly. And if that involves a pinch of redistribution, so be it!""Is there a contradiction there? Hammond does not think so. ""I really urge you to separate Warren is specific proposal,"" he says, ""from the broader investigation"" that Cass is leading into how to help the working class. In the end, ""the right will have to take on an orientation that is more skeptical of trade, more skeptical of big business, and more curious about pro-labor, pro-family policies.""The post-liberal conservative movement is a twisted artifact of the now-conventional view of fusionism as a partnership of convenience between two groups that have divergent and even contradictory belief systems: libertarians, who prioritize individual freedom above all else, and traditionalists, who know better. This understanding is subtly—but crucially—mistaken. Fusionism, properly understood, is not a marriage of two groups. It is a marriage of two. A fusionist is someone who sees both liberty (in the classical sense of freedom from aggression, coercion, and fraud) and virtue (in the Judeo-Christian sense of submission to God is commands) as important. Fusionism is the refore a distinct philosophical orientation unto itself. What is more, it has historically been the dominant orientation on the American right. Conservatives going back at least to the country is founding have believed that virtue and liberty were mutually reinforcing—and that neither could survive long without the other. A free society depends on a virtuous populace. (""Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people,"" wrote John Adams. ""It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."") But the reverse is also true: Virtue, to be virtuous, must be freely chosen. As the late literary editor Frank Meyer, usually identified as the godfather of fusionism, eloquently put it: ""Truth withers when freedom dies, however righteous the authority that kills it; and free individualism uninformed by moral value rots at its core and soon surrenders to tyranny.""Post-liberals tend to see liberty and virtue as fatally at odds. To be a good person necessarily requires accepting some limits on one is choices, after all. Must not one of the two fusionist pillars ultimately trump the other?There is no denying that the demands of morality, traditionally understood, pull against a theoretical ideal of freedom from all constraint. Fusionism reconciles this tension by insisting that the state protect people is fundamental rights to be secure in person and property—thus leaving individuals, and the various associations they come together to form, with as much space as possible in which to pursue the higher things. Within the governmental sphere, liberty is indeed the ultimate end. But within the infinitely broader sphere outside of government, it is just the beginning: A life well-lived consists in using one is freedom to do what is right. The clear recognition that these are separate spheres, with separate roles to play for the common good, is the genius of the fusionist project. Today is post-liberal conservatives appear to think they are distinguished by the belief that virtue matters. They behave as if their core disagreement with fusionists is about whether human beings have moral obligations that go beyond leaving others alone to do as they please. This could hardly be more wrong. Anyone who holds to the Judeo-Christian tradition—as fusionists by definition do—accepts that we have manifold duties to one another. The disagreement is about whether it is the state is job to those moral obligations. For a fusionist, the answer to that question must be no, for pragmatic as well as deeply moral reasons. The weight of evidence through history is that concentrated government power in the best case leads to incompetence and waste, while in the worst case it degenerates quickly into tyranny. Whether your main concern is material enrichment or the protection of human rights, limited government has been shown on the proving grounds of experience to be the best available means to that end. Arguably even more important is the Judeo-Christian doctrine of human beings' equal inherent dignity. As the puts it, ""God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions."" And later: ""Every human person, created in the image of God, has the natural right to be recognized as a free and responsible being. All owe to each other this duty of respect."" That is why state power is such a grave matter, fraught with danger not just to society but to the souls of those who wield it. Only when absolutely necessary—say, to stop one person from initiating violence against another—is it morally justifiable to overrule someone is right to live his life as he chooses. Understanding what fusionism is—and what it is not—is more important than it may seem. An arrangement in which traditionalists and libertarians are merely allies can easily become a game of tug of war in which each side jockeys to ensure that, on balance, its own priorities predominate. If one side finds itself too often on the losing end of that jockeying, it might reasonably move to dissolve the alliance altogether. But if fusionism is a discrete philosophical worldview—and a pervasive one at that, with a pedigree that runs through the American founding and with roots in the Hebrew Bible—then post-liberalism looks infinitely more radical. Remember: The new conservatives do not just call for a collective recommitment to the pursuit of virtue in the private sphere; they explicitly insist that power be exercised in the government sphere, with a goal of forcibly reorienting society to the common good. Such a shift amounts to a rejection of one of the two pillars of fusionism—which is to say it is a rejection of fusionism itself. How supremely ironic that the people who flatter the mselves defenders of tradition have abandoned the hard-won philosophical inheritance of the American political right. All this leaves unanswered a serious question: If a free society requires a moral populace, what is a committed fusionist in an unvirtuous age to do?Traditionalists have plenty of evidence that we are living in such an age. American religiosity is in decline, with significantly fewer people attending weekly services (even before the coronavirus pandemic) than at any time in the last century. Addiction and suicide are through the roof, likely driven by a sense of alienation. Traditional teachings about sexual morality seem laughably antiquated against the backdrop of modernity. The divorce rate is down, but so is the marriage rate, and hundreds of thousands of abortions are performed each year. Some libertarians are less bothered by these concerns. Many prefer to focus on the ways market-driven technological advances have vastly improved our quality of life. Others go further, arguing that widespread acceptance of a greater range of lifestyle choices make this the best time ever to be alive., this cohort might say,or at least misunderstood—and if you are reading this magazine, you may be inclined to agree. If people are using more drugs (see, for instance, the cover oft his month is issue) while having fewer children, that is fine and dandy so long as it is their choice. These libertarians are not fusionists, though they can and do happily work with their fusionist brethren when it comes to protecting rights and liberties in the government sphere. At the same time, many libertarians uneasy about secularism and community breakdown. As a churchgoing Roman Catholic, I certainly fall into this category—grieving the scourge of abortion, suffering under a culture that feels overly sexualized and excessively consumerist, and fretting that modern man has grown unwilling to sacrifice on behalf of something bigger than himself. I am not the most stereotypical libertarian, but even within the liberty movement I am not alone. And on the wider political right, such fears are omnipresent. Faced with problems like the se, the allure of desperate measures is perhaps understandable. One common justification for the post-liberal turn is that culture and institutions, once broken, cannot be expected to repair the mselves. External help is needed. The state can provide it, through laws that constrain behavior but also teach the populace to value the correct things: faith and family, community and country. Alas, the lessons of history do not cease to be true just because they are inconvenient. You cannot impose virtue on people by force, and a coercive legal regime is no more likely in practice to instill good values than it is to make the underlying problems worse. For one thing, the re is no guarantee that the people actually in power—now or in the future—will agree with you about what the correct values are (or about how much power is required to enforce them). But beyond that, public policies come with unintended consequences. Even assuming a legal code that perfectly aligns with the true demands of virtue, we ca not know in advance what the effects will be. Perhaps citizens will absorb a better sense of right and wrong. Or perhaps, freed from the need to make weighty decisions for the mselves, their moral muscles will atrophy, rendering them less capable of pursuing the higher things in life. Before you guess which result is more likely, consider the impact that decades of well-intentioned welfare policy have had on poor communities. As the financial incentives for entrepreneurship and family formation evaporated, recipients of aid learned to see the mselves as lacking agency. Neighborly ingenuity, manifested through private charitable efforts and mutual aid societies, was crowded out by to p-down government ""solutions"" that solve very little. Despite ever-increasing state and federal spending, the official poverty rate has hardly budged, and small towns and rural counties increasingly join impoverished inner cities as economic disaster areas. All of which suggests that our best efforts have failed to address the causes of the problem and may have exacerbated them. The central insight of fusionism is that the common good is best achieved when the state stays focused on protecting rights and liberties, leaving individuals and voluntary associations to do the rest. To be clear, there is nothing easy about that answer. The post-liberal temptation is to believe that government power can be a substitute for the hard labor of institution building and cultural change. It is not. The solution must begin at home—on the front porch, around the kitchen table, and in the mirror. The law is not a magic wand. There are no magic wands, and there is no shortcut to the good society.",1,1,Reason

Keith Leader is lawyer, Robert Moran, strategically gave up his right to a preliminary hearing Thursday morning, paving the way for the case to be heard by a grand jury. (Leader was not present for his lawyer is brief court appearance.)Waiving a preliminary hearing is standard procedure in major felony cases because nothing related to trial can happen before an indictment. And it is extremely rare for someone charged with such a major crime to plead guilty before indictment because the re is no chance to challenge the prosecution is evidence. The only purpose for a preliminary hearing is to determine whether there was probable cause to arrest Leader and keep him jailed. That is a much lower burden than finding him guilty of crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case, Leader, 33, is facing two felonies: vehicular manslaughter and leaving the scene of a fatal crash in the 12:26 a.m. death ofMaida Brkanovic, 25. Under law, each of those crimes is punishable by up to 7 years in prison. If convicted at trial, a judge could add up those punishments at sentencing. The grand jury can also consider charges beyond what Leader was initially arrested on. Other charges often considered in fatal crash cases include manslaughter or, in the worst cases, second-degree murder (The drugged-up driver, Anthony Saccone, who killed three young people near Onondaga Community College in 2018, for example, was indicted on a murder charge. Helater pleaded guilty to lesser charges.)Brkanovic is friends say that the two had just met that evening in Syracuse. Leader was offering free rides to women outside the Alpine Gentlemen is Club on Butternut Street. Brkanovic loved motorcycles and took a ride, they said.

However, it is only been in the last year or three that his enormous influence has begun to be recognized. As we wrote last year, for example, “But now, after 28 years suddenly more perceptive observers are beginning to grasp that Justice Thomas has moved the High Court in his direction even as he has created a stable of young conservatives who are found everywhere in the pro-life Trump Administration and in the federal courts.”Here is another, quite current example of Thomas’ extraordinary insight and foresight. There is ensued tremendous controversy stemming from Planned Parenthood of Greater New York is decision to remove the name of Margaret Sanger, PPFA is “iconic” founder, from its Manhattan health clinic because of her ‘harmful connections to the eugenics movement. Reluctantly, at least some observers are recalling Justice Thomas’ prescient comments in Box vs Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky. In that 2019 decision, the Supreme Court voted to uphold one part of a 2016 Indiana abortion law while laying over for another day the second part—the portion of the law that prohibited “abortions done solely for reasons of race, sex or disability—in other words, for eugenic reasons,” as William McGurn reminded us in a piece that ran yesterday in the Wall Street Journal. Justice Thomas took the occasion to write 7,000-word history of how “From the beginning, birth control and abortion were promoted as means of effectuating eugenics.”His reward for being w aaa y ahead of the curve?MercatorNet aptly observedMost journalists ignored it or ridiculed it. Mark Joseph Stern at Slate said that Thomas had attacked women who have abortions as “callous and monstrous child-killers” – a slander which Stern made up out of thin air. Charles P Pierce, at Esquire, wrote that Thomas had gone “bananas.” Garrett Eps, in The Atlantic, said that Thomas was part of “the far-right wing of African American conservatism.”Adam Liptak, at the New York Times, barely mentioned it. The full decision in Box vs Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky [Thomas is concurrence begins on page 13] can be readhere. What follows are just a few highlights from his 20 page concurrence.*”This case highlights the fact that abortion is an act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation. From the beginning, birth control and abortion were promoted as means of effectuating eugenics. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was particularly open about the fact that birth control could be used for eugenic purposes. These arguments about the eugenic potential for birth control apply with even greater force to abortion, which can be used to target specific children with unwanted characteristics. Even after World War II, future Planned Parenthood President Alan Guttmacher and other abortion advocates endorsed abortion for eugenic reasons and promoted it as a means of controlling the population and improving its quality. As explained below, a growing body of evidence suggests that eugenic goals are already being realized through abortion.”*“Eight decades after Sanger is ‘Negro Project,’ abortion in the USs is also marked by a considerable racial disparity. The reported nationwide abortion ratio—the number of abortions per 1,000 live births—among black women is nearly 3.5 times the ratio for white women. And there are areas of New York City in which black children are more likely to be aborted than they are to be born alive—and are up to eight times more likely to be aborted than white children in the same area. Whatever the reasons for these disparities, they suggest that, insofar as abortion is viewed as a method of ‘family planning,’ black people do indeed ‘tak[e] the brunt of the ‘planning.’”*[This is crucial] “Enshrining a constitutional right to an abortion based solely on the race, sex, or disability of an unborn child, as Planned Parenthood advocates, would constitutionalize the views of the twentieth-century eugenics movement. In other contexts, the Court has been zealous in vindicating the rights of people even potentially subjected to race, sex, and disability discrimination. … Although the Court declines to wade into these issues to day, we cannot avoid them forever. Having created the constitutional right to an abortion, this Court is duty bound to address its scope. In that regard, it is easy to understand why the District Court and the Seventh Circuit looked to Casey [the 1992 Supreme Court decision] to resolve a question it did not address. Where else could they turn? The Constitution itself is silent on abortion.“Although the Court declines to wade into these issues to day, we cannot avoid them forever.”Life is full of ironies. Planned Parenthood of Greater New York could not possibly dislike anything more than the prospect of frankly acknowledging the truth of what McGurn wrote on Monday: “Planned Parenthood disavows her ‘racist legacy’ but continues carrying it out.”",0,0,Life News

Last week, Mississippi is Republican-controlled government cut off$500 million of COVID-19 jobless aid for nearly a hundred thousand of its citizens, joining a national GOP campaign to portray jobless workers as lazy layabouts who do not need assistance. At the same time, it was reported that the same Republican-run Mississippi government allowed$1.1 million worth of welfare cash to flow to Brett Favre for speeches he never gave — and he has yet to return $600,000 of it. But now, the Lone Star State is living up to the saying that everything is bigger in Texas, even greed and hypocrisy. In the last week and a half, Texas Republicansmoved to block$8 billion worth of pandemic unemployment benefits for 1.3 million people just days after voting to extend a corporate subsidy program that is enriching fossil fuel companies and has already cost the state$10 billion. Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott announced the end of the federal unemployment benefits on Monday. With his state facing a6.9 percent unemployment rate, Abbott said he wants the government “helping unemployed Texans connect with the more than a million job openings, rather than paying unemployment benefits to remain off the employment rolls.”The move follows Abbott is office spearheading the GOP is fight against a $15 minimum wage, saying it “would put a boot on the neck of small businesses.” Abbott alsopushedlegislationto shield corporations from liability if their workers get COVID on the job. Nine days before Abbott publicly decried benefits for the jobless and suggested Texans do not need the help, his fellow Texas Republicans in the state House advanced ab ill to extend the state isChapter 313 program, which subsidizes massive property tax breaks for corporations. The situation represents a big win for lobby groups such as the Texas Association of Business, which has been simultaneously de mandingan end to aid for jobless workers and calling forth e preservation of Chapter 313 is giant taxpayer handouts to its corporate members. The latter is also a win for the fossil fuel industry, whose donors have poured more than$58 million into Texas elections in the last five years.“The lion is share of the program is tax bounty —60 percent— goes to refineries, chemical plants, liquified natural gas facilities, and other fossil-fuel projects concentrated along the Gulf Coast,” the recently reported. “Oil and gas giants that have long bossed Texas, like Exxon Mobil, Chevron Phillips, Dow Chemical, and Enterprise Products Partners, have each saved hundreds of millions in property taxes thanks to Chapter 313.”The fossil fuel industry is not the only beneficiary of the program: Chapter 313 is slated to funnel tens of millions of dollars to Tesla, which is owned by the world is second wealthiest man, Elon Musk. Proponents of the tax subsidy program have argued that it creates jobs. But a recent investigation found that the program “now costs more than $1.1 million in tax breaks per new job” and reported that “by any metric, costs are rising — and the re is no telling how high they will go.” The newspaper also reported that “at least 30 companies failed to fulfill their job-creation promises since 2019 but faced no repercussions.”Meanwhile, an analysis by University of Texas Austin professor Nate Jensen found that “85-90 percent of projects would have located in Texas without the 313 program and 80 percent of the program is dollars are lost revenue for the state is school finance system.”The Republican legislation that just passed the Texas House extends the program to 2024 — at a projected cost of nearly $4 billion, according to are cent report from Texas is Republican comptroller. The legislation now moves to the state Senate. A separate bill to expand the program has been delayed. You can subscribe to David Sirota is investigative journalism project, theDaily,here.

214,"Lies, Damn Lies, and Inflation",-12.75,33.0,https://inthesetimes.com/article/inflation-covid-mmt-austerity-economy-biden,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-05-18,25,"There are two basic ways to interpret economic news. One is the academic way, in which every development is weighed and scrutinized and plugged into various models in a more or less genuine attempt to intuit what is happening in the chaotic complex system we call​“the economy.” This is what honest economists do, and sometimes they develop new the ories that end up causing enormous shifts in global history, many years downstream. This is not the kind of economics we are talking about now, in2021. The other way of approaching economics is the political way, in which each new piece of economic data is hammered and squeezed and molded into a form that serves a preexisting political agenda. This is economics as an instrument to serve politics, not vice versa. This is, unfortunately, the way that most people experience​“the economy”: not as something to be understood, but as something to be either squeezed for all its worth, or something that is squeezing you for all you are worth. Karl Marx and Adam Smith may have been honest economists in the first category, but most of their disciples in governments have been firmly in the second. It is important to understand this distinction when we discuss economics, lest the discussion go off in two different directions. While academic economists and journalists peer at the past year is bizarre economic contortions — a historic collapse followed rapidly by a historic government-fueled rebound leading to an uncertain future — and conclude (honestly) that they do not really know what is happening, political actors are already sharpening their knives to go to war over what happens next. In terms of political economy, the question now is whether we are poised to enact a new New Deal — a huge increase in government-funded social spending to finally try to turn the tide on inequality that has been building for more than40years — or whether we are instead poised to swing back towards austerity, a brutal budget-balancing to​“make up for” the large spending bills enacted during the past year is lockdowns. Despite the fact that the trillions of dollars the government spent in several relief bills has successfully staved off what would have been another Great Depression (and has caused a boom in financial asset prices that is making rich people richer), the institutional preference of the Republican Party is, always, for austerity. The political case for austerity is going to be made no matter what. And inflation is going to be the primary tool used to make it. The honesty of this analysis is beside the point. Along with the contentions​“raising the minimum wage destroys jobs” and​“raising taxes hurts the economy” canards, a key part of the right wing economic gospel is that increasing government spending is bad because it leads to dangerous levels of inflation. Never mind the fact that right-wing economists have been steadily predicting this outcome since the recovery from the2008recession, and it has never come true. They will continue to predict it. Now, inflation is actually here. Never mind the fact that the Fed believes that inflation can be kept under control, and that more government spending is in order — all popular media coverage of inflation occurs in the frame of fear. A little evidence of inflation combined with a lot of fear of inflation will be the formula for turning inflation into a political weapon in service of austerity. You should get ready to hear two primary messages. The first, with each passing month of inflation, will be:​“OUT OF CONTROL government spending is causing inflation that will EAT UP YOUR SAVINGS and cause prices to SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL and we must immediately STOP all new spending and also CUT ENTITLEMENTS.” In this way, longstanding Republican priorities — namely, cutting government spending on everyone except the rich — will be shoehorned into a prescription for to day is (mostly imaginary) problems, without mentioning that the GOP was pushing the same prescription a decade ago when the problems were the opposite. The second message you will hear, which may be a bit subtler, will be:​“This is caused by Modern Monetary Theory, a wacky theory that Democrats embrace, and all this inflation proves that the theory is a failure.” Political speech is about caricatures. The caricature of MMT is:​“These fools think the government can print as much money as it wants with no consequences, but we all know that that will cause runaway inflation.” If you know a little about MMT, you may object to this characterization by understanding that, in fact, MMT specifically focuses on inflation as the signal to tell us how much the governmentspend. That does not matter. It is too nuanced for the caricature, and in politics, the caricature can become far more important than the reality. What percentage of Republicans who hold strong opinions on​“Critical Race Theory” do you think have actually studied critical race theory outside of the caricature? Exactly. It will only take a shift of a single seat in the Senate and a small handful of seats in the House to make the idiotic Republican economic caricatures into the reigning economic orthodoxy of the USs Congress. At that point, the opportunity for transformative change is finished. And even if Republicans do not manage to win back control of Congress in the midterms, there is the danger that the caricature becomes influential enough to scare Democrats back into the deficit-fearing hole where they have spent most of the past half century. Every last thing happening right now counsels strong, fast action. Get the money out the door now or risk losing any chance at major debt-fueled government spending programs in the foreseeable future. That means the obliteration of any hope for turning around the rise in economic inequality, the single most damaging trend in America in my lifetime. Most Americans are economically illiterate. This is not an insult to them. It is just an observation of fact, and the completely predictable outcome of our nation is unwillingness to engage in any widespread form of economic education that is not soaked in free market jingoism. For political purposes, nobody knows what MMT is. But they do know enough to fear inflation, because inflation makes stuff cost more, and nobody likes that. Therefore the weapon i zed rhetorical power of inflation will tend to overwhelm whatever it is being deployed against. And we know that it will be deployed with full force against the possibility that the American welfare state could be permanently expanded. That always makes rich people scared that they will have higher taxes, and the refore they will wage war against it. We are now in a race to give people new government benefits before they get tricked out of wanting them. Every month that inflation ticks up, the lies will get louder, and the task will get harder.

215,Lollapalunacy? Experts split on whether jammed music fest is ‘bad idea’ or ‘basically OK’ as COVID-19 cases quadruple,0.0,44.33,https://chicago.suntimes.com/coronavirus/2021/7/23/22590809/lollapalooza-coronavirus-chicago-illinois-case-spike-covid-19-july-23,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"COVID-19 cases have almost quadrupled across Illinois over the past month, nearly a quarter of counties have hit a coronavirus warning level, and more patients are filling hospital wards. Troubling figures released Friday by the Illinois Department of Public Health suggest the state is latest coronavirus surge is showing no signs of letting up days before daily crowds of 100,000 and up descend on Grant Park for Lollapalooza. City officials have insisted the massive festival will be safe — and Governor JB Pritzker has saidhe will be there himself— but University of Chicago epidemiologist Dr. Emily Landon called it “a bad idea” to move forward with the jam-packed event, especially with the more infectious Delta variant looming.“Lolla is too crowded. That is the bottom line,” she said, acknowledging odds are slim Mayor Lori Lightfoot would pull the plug on the lucrative attraction.“It is about harm reduction. You have to make the decision for yourself. These cases that happen because of Lolla are not likely to be a huge drag on the health care system. But will we see a bump? Yes, and Delta will probably make it higher,” Landon said.“A bunch of people are going to get COVID at Lolla, but a lot of people are getting it from other places now, too.”Fans attend Day 2 of Lollapalooza in Grant Park in 2019. They are getting it across the state, especially in downstate counties with lower vaccination rates. Cases started rising a few weeks after the state fully reopened June 11. Nearly 8,000 Illinoisans tested positive over the past week alone, an average of 1,140 new cases every day. The state was logging just 294 cases per day at the start of the month, and 238 per day in mid-June. Since the n, the average statewide case positivity rate has increased fivefold, from a pandemic low of 0.6% up to 3.3% — the highest it is been since the first week of May Hospitals were treating 670 coronavirus patients Thursday night, the most they have seen since early June. Graphic by Jesse Howe and Caroline Hurley | Sun-TimesSource: Illinois Department of Public HealthGraph not displaying properly? Click here. State public health officials on Friday singled out 25 of the state is 102 counties for being at a coronavirus warning level. DuPage is the first Chicago-area county to land on that list in several months, due to an increase in hospital visits for COVID-like symptoms. Most of the other warning-level counties are in central and southern Illinois, where vaccination rates are sometimes less than half the statewide rate. About 72% of all Illinoisans have gotten a shot, with about 56% fully vaccinated. Counties marked orange are considered at a COVID-19 warning level. Even though Lollapalooza takes place in the heart of Chicago, it could have a devastating impact on far-flung areas, said Landon, who urged attendees to “assume you have been exposed” and get tested afterward.“It can amplify the spread in areas with low vaccination rates. The people who go home to some south suburbs, to central Illinois, to Missouri — they are going to set off little wildfires,” she said. But as far as personal risk, Lollapalooza “can be done safely,” according to Dr. Vishnu Chundi, chairman of the Chicago Medical Society is COVID-19 Task Force.“Outdoors is the safest place you can do it,” Chundi said. “If you are vaccinated, you are safe. If you are vaccinated and masked, you are really safe. If you are not vaccinated and not masked, you are not safe.”Attendees at the four-day music festival, which opens Thursday, have to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test from within three days of entrance, according to Lollapalooza. Anyone who is unvaccinated will be required to wear a mask while attending the event. And even those who got the shot are urged to consider masking up. Chundi said the check-in process could actually result in more transmission than other parts of the fest.“The bathrooms the mselves are porta-potties, the vendors, they are open-air — that all is basically OK It is getting huge crowds of people in and the n getting them out of these choke points that causes concern,” he said. Thousands of music fans arrive in Grant Park for the first day of Lollapalooza in 2019. Still, Chundi said the likelihood of Lollapalooza turning into a super-spreader event “is very low.” He expects cases to keep rising in the short term no matter what.“You have got 30,000 people going to Sox games, Cubs games and soon Bears games. In the US, we have decided the decision about getting vaccinated is your personal responsibility and your right. That is getting us into some trouble,” Chundi said.“If we could get everyone to just mandate vaccination, we could get out of this whole mess. But that needs to happen at a national level. … It is not rocket science. Everyone knows how this works by now.”",2,2,Chicago Sun-Times
216,Was the Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the Mother of All War Crimes?,10.25,34.5,https://www.fairobserver.com/more/international_security/hans-georg-hiroshima-nagasaki-dresden-hamburg-bombing-war-crimes-history-news-15001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-observer-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-11,21,"This year marks the 75thanniversary of the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is reason enough to mull over its meaning and its implications. In a recent article for Fair Observer, Peter Isackson has made a strong case that the annihilation of the two Japanese cities by American bombers represents the “mother of all war crimes.” Given the long history of atrocities committed during times of war, I find this a rather bold statement that should not go unchallenged. The case for the defense rests on two claims. First, the demonstration of American nuclear capabilities heralded in a period of stability, which quite likely saved Western Europe is nations from being overrun and conquered by the Soviet Union and subjected to its rule. Second, Hiroshima and Nagasaki are far from exceptional as war crimes go, if indeed the bombing of the two cities was a war crime at all. In my younger years, in a very different world, I served for a couple of years in the German air force. I never flew a plane. I spent most of my time on duty in a tower close to the border to what at the time was the Czechoslovakian Socialist Republic (CSSR), a member of the Warsaw Pact and a satellite of the Soviet Union. We did electronic surveyance of the CSSR airspace, following Czech and Slovakian fighter planes as they performed their exercises as best as they could (more often than not they could not, lacking basic motivation). It was a tedious job, boring as hell, particularly when the weather was bad and the pilots were grounded. Excitement, however, surged once a month, when we waited for the arrival of Russian long-range bombers. They took off from Minsk in what at the time was the capital of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. Their mission: attack the towers along the West German border with the CSSR and the German Democratic Republic. We saw them coming, small dots on our radar screens. When they were in front of our tower, there was a small red blip, a fleeting flicker, and we knew if this had been— an actual real-life attack — we would all be dead, gone up in smoke in a small nuclear mushroom. At the time, we did not think much of what had just happened. It was part of a game, along the lines of MAD magazine is “Spy vs Spy” — inane, a waste of time, and somehow not very real. It was not until the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the regime in Prague and the unraveling of the Soviet empire that we learned that the game had been much more serious and potentially deadly than what we suspected. There were plans on the other side of the border to overrun West Germany, conquer Western Europe and subject it to Soviet rule. Among the scenarios was a nuclear attack on Bonn, West Germany is sleepy capital, designed to decapitate West Germany is political elite. What prevented the Soviets and their to adies from carrying out their plans was not human compassion but a realist assessment of the distribution of military forces and the resolve of the Western allies to use them. At the time, this was called MAD — mutually assured destruction. It was grounded in the notion that any attack on the part of the Soviets would immediately trigger a full response of Western nuclear forces, resulting in the complete annihilation of the Soviet Union. The leadership in Moscow was fully aware of this logic. They did not like this “balance of terror,” but they ultimately submitted to its logic. Others, by the way, did not. Andrey Gromyko, the Soviet Union is long-term foreign minister,claimsin his memoirs that at one time, Chinese leader Mao Zedong tried to get the Soviet Union to launch a nuclear attack on the USs, arguing that “his country could survive a nuclear war, even if it lost 300 million people, and finish off the capitalists with conventional weapons,” thus guaranteeing the triumph of communism. Unsurprisingly, the Soviets were not convinced and increasingly distanced the mselves from Beijing. The logic of mutually assured destruction fundamentally altered the behavior of great powers, at least with respect to each other. It is to be hoped that the logic of the “balance of terror” is going to be enough to keep the US and China level-headed in the future, despite rapidly growing tensions between the two. Unfortunately enough, war crimes are the norm rather than the exception when it comes to armed conflict. The claim that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are ontologically different rests on a technological assumption. For some reason, nuclear weapons are fundamentally different from conventional ones. I am not sure what constitutes the basis of this assumption. Take the fire bombings of the German cities ofDresden and Hamburgduring the Second World War, which cost the lives of tens of thousands of ordinary people — women, children, the elderly. Take the massacre ofBabi Yar, in Ukraine, where in two days nearly 34,000 Jews were killed by German. Or, going back further in history, take the death toll during the Thirty Years War, which cost the lives of half of the population of what is today Germany. Massacres of the most atrocious form are hardly an invention of the 20thcentury, as Goya is renditions of the barbarities visited on his fellow countrymen during the war against the French between 1808 and 1814, depicted in most horrifying detail. This was a war against an enemy that invaded the country in the name of the Enlightenment and revolutionary fervor. Or, as the Germans would say,— If you do not want to be my brother, I will smash your skull. For the victims of war crimes — more often than not civilians — it probably does not really matter how they were killed and why they were killed. It is quite understandable — human all too human, as Nietzsche would say — that horrendous deeds provoke retribution. The firebombing of German cities, the rape of German women caught be advancing Soviet armies — both are understandable given the atrocities committed by Germans during the war, in the name of Hitler and the Third Reich. Most Germans, or so most recent research suggests, were more than comfortable supporting a regime that guaranteed them a modicum of prosperity. Few asked where it came from. For that, Germans were punished in the most horrendous fashion. Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden and Cologne and many other towns and cities went up in flames, leaving behind a landscape hardly different from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The bombing of Hamburg was named Operation Gomorrah, after the Biblical city destroyed by “sulfur and fire” for its sins, and,according to historian Keith Lowe, was on completely different level than the German raids on Coventry and London, “comparable with what happened in Nagasaki.” It was a just retribution for the crimes committed in their name, a retribution for the tens of millions of victims who paid with their lives for Hitler is ambitions to conquer the world. I would suggest that the annihilation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the retribution for the crimes committed by Japanese forces, in the name of racial superiority hardly different from Nazi ideology, against the peoples subjugated during the war. I have grave doubts that the victims of the Nanjing massacre or of the hundreds of young Asian “comfort women” pressed into sexual slavery by Japanese forces would consider the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a war crime, but rather than an act of just retribution for Japanese atrocities committed during the war. Whether or not the USs was justified in meting out redistribution is a different question. After all, given America is self-declared status as a leading Christian nation, it should perhaps have heeded the words of the Bible exhorting believers not to take revenge, “but leave room for God is wrath, for it is written: ‘It is mine to avenge; I will repay,’ says the Lord” (Romans 12:19). But the n, Americans have a tendency to pay lip service to the scripture while doing the opposite in real life. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was one of these turning points in history that define a whole epoch. It demonstrated, once and for all, humanity is ability to destroy itself. Had Hitler been in a position to get hold of “the bomb,” he surely would have used it to obliterate London, Moscow, perhaps even New York. The same goes for Stalin, only this time it would have been Berlin that would have gone up in a mushroom. If the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a war crime, it was nothing more than another episode in a long history of atrocities committed in the course of wars, not more, not less — an episode which reaffirms once again the sad reality that the veneer of civilization is merely skin deep.

217,"As Herschel Walker eyes Senate run, a turbulent past emerges",-2.67,43.33,https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"ATLANTA (AP) — At first glance, Herschel Walker has a coveted political profile for a potential Senate candidate in Georgia. He was a football hero at the University of Georgia before his long NFL career. He is a business owner whose chicken products are distributed across the US And he is a Black conservative with backing from former President Donald Trump, a longtime friend. But an Associated Press review of hundreds of pages of public records tied to Walker is business ventures and his divorce, including many not previously reported, sheds new light on a turbulent personal history that could dog his Senate bid. The documents detail accusations that Walker repeatedly threatened his ex-wife is life, exaggerated claims of financial success and alarmed business associates with unpredictable behavior. Walker, now 59, has at times been open about his long struggle with mental illness, writing at length in a 2008 book about being diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, once known as multiple personality disorder. But it is unclear how he would discuss these events as a candidate. Walker did not respond to requests for comment. Multiple em ails went unanswered, although his executive assistant confirmed they were received. AP also sent em ails and left a message with his long-time attorney, who did not respond. The Georgia seat is a top target for Republicans as they try to take control of the US Senate in next year is midterm elections. Walker is potential bid is a wildcard. He might easily win the GOP primary with Trump is help, setting up a general election fight against Democrat Raphael Warnock, who became Georgia is first Black senator after a special election in January. But Republican leaders in Washington and Georgia are concerned that Walker is history might haunt his campaign. Walker “certainly could bring a lot of things to the table,” Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican, said in a recent interview. “But as others have mentioned, the re is also a lot of questions out there.”Walker has yet to announce his intentions, but he has been consulting with political advisers in Georgia. A native of tiny Wrightsville, between Atlanta and Savannah, the former Dallas Cowboys star retired after the 1997 season and now resides in Texas. In a video posted to Twitter last month, he revs the engine of a sports car and says, “I am getting ready, and we can run with the big dogs,” before revealing a Georgia license plate. The Twitter tease intensified buzz about the potential for a celebrity candidate. But it also helped surface details about Walker is troubled past, many first disclosed by Walker himself in his 2008 book, “Breaking Free.”His account details years of struggles and an eventual diagnosis in 2001. Walker describes himself dealing with as many as a dozen personalities — or “alters” — that he had constructed as a defense against bullying he suffered as a stuttering, overweight child. In an AP interview at the time, Walker emphasized his purpose was to help others with similar disorders. “People say, ‘Herschel is just trying to write something to make money,’” he said. “I say, ‘Guys, why would I write something like this to make money?’”The National Alliance on Mental Illness describes dissociative identity disorder as “alternating between multiple identities,” leaving a person with “gaps in memory of everyday events.” It notes men with the disorder “exhibit more violent behavior rather than amnesia.”In his book, Walker acknowledges violent urges. He writes that he played Russian roulette and recounts sitting at his kitchen table in 1991 pointing a gun, loaded with a single bullet, at his head. “I was not suicidal,” Walker explained, but “just looked at mortality as the ultimate challenge.”The book is framed as a turnaround story. He describes it as cathartic and casts himself as someone on the path to “integration” because of therapy and his Christian faith. A watershed moment, he writes, came in February 2001, when he drove around suburban Dallas, hunting for a man who he said was avoiding his calls after being days late delivering a car Walker had purchased.“The logical side of me knew that what I was thinking of doing to this man — murdering him for messing up my schedule — was not a viable alternative,” Walker wrote. “But another side of me was so angry that all I could think was how satisfying it would feel to step out of the car, pull out the gun, slip off the safety, and squeeze the trigger.”Ultimately, Walker wrote, he had a change of heart after seeing a “SMILE. JESUS LOVES YOU” bumper sticker on the man is car-hauling truck. He decided to seek professional help.“I’d been running for most of life, from what only I really knew but seldom talked about. It was time to stop running and face some harsh realities,” he wrote. Walker is threatening behavior continued well after the 2001 revelation, according to court records obtained by AP that have not previously been reported. Four years later, in December 2005, Cindy Grossman, Walker is ex-wife, secured a protective order against him, alleging violent and controlling behavior. Grossman has said she was long a victim of Walker is impulses. When his book was released, she told ABC News that at one point during their marriage, her husband pointed a pistol at her head and said, “I am going to blow your f’ing brains out.” She filed for divorce in 2001, citing “physically abusive and extremely threatening behavior.”In seeking protection from a judge in Dallas County, Grossman filed an affidavit from her sister, which described Walker as unwilling to accept that his former wife had begun dating another man. Grossman told the court she got calls during that period from her sister and father, both of whom had been contacted by Walker. He told family members that he would kill her and her new boyfriend, according to Maria Tsettos, Cindy Grossman is sister. In an affidavit, Tsettos claimed Walker once called looking for his ex-wife while she was out with her boyfriend. Tsettos took the call and said Walker became “very threatening” when told of Grossman is whereabouts. In Tsettos’ recollection, Walker “stated unequivocally that he was going to shoot my sister Cindy and her boyfriend in the head.”On another occasion, Tsettos said she talked to Walker “at length” after he’d reached out to her online. He “expressed to me that he was frustrated with (Cindy) and that he felt like he had ‘had enough’ and that he wanted to ‘blow their f------ heads off,’” she recalled of the December 9, 2005, exchange. Two days later he called again and told Tsettos that he possessed a gun and planned that day to act on his threats, which he repeated in graphic language, she said. Later that day, Walker confronted his ex-wife outside a mall when she was picking up their son from a party, according to her petition for a protective order. In her account, she said Walker “slowly drove by in his vehicle, pointed his finger at (her) and traced (her) with his finger as he drove.”When officers in Irving, Texas, contacted Walker, he denied that he’d made the threats, according to a police report the AP obtained through a public records request. But the sister is account was concerning enough to police that they took for “safe keeping” a gun Walker had on the floor of his car, the report states. A judge agreed, finding “good cause” to issue a protective order. He also barred Walker from possessing guns for a period of time. Grossman, her divorce lawyer and Tsettos did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the AP Walker is unpredictable behavior has carried into his chicken business, now known as Renaissance Man Food Services, according to court filings. His book itself was a shock. The primary distributor of his products considered severing their relationship after Walker is book came out. Kristin Caffey, the n a poultry manager for the food distributor Sysco, said the revelations in the book, as well as Walker is effort to publicize it, created “havoc” for the company.“We were not aware that it was coming out, and we were blindsided,” Caffey, who worked directly with Walker, said in a 2019 deposition. “We had all kinds of people calling in about it, and we did not have answers to it,” she added, saying, “it was problematic for us being engaged with him at the time.”Ultimately, the company chose to stick with Walker after the negative publicity died down, Caffey said. More recently, Walker has made outsize claims about his business record. In repeated media interviews, Walker claimed his company employed hundreds of people, included a chicken processing division in Arkansas and grossed $70 million to $80 million annually in sales. However, when the company applied for a federal Paycheck Protection Program loan last year, it reported just eight employees. (It received about $182,000 in COVID-19 aid.)In a recent court case, Walker gave far more modest revenue figures, indicating that the company averaged about $1.5 million a year in profit from 2008 to 2017. Meanwhile, Walker is business associates testified in the same case that he does not own chicken processing plants, as he claims. Instead, they described him as a licensing partner who lends his name to the enterprise — not unlike the kind of deals his friend Donald Trump has used to expand his brand for decades. A wrongful termination lawsuit filed in 2018 by a friend and former manager of Walker is company created an extensive record of Walker is leadership. Although a judge ruled against the employee, John Staples, emails, documents and depositions in the case present Walker as a temperamental and unreliable business partner. Walker persistently complained that his business partners were trying to cheat him out of money, the documents say. And they indicate he repeatedly fought with his associates over his focus on branching into frozen waffles, which he believed would be a future moneymaker for the company. In 2017, an executive for the company that supplied chicken to Walker sent a concerned email, inquiring about $7,200 in expenses he said Walker had incorrectly tried to bill the company from his efforts to secure the waffle deal. The executive, now Simmons Foods Chief Operating Officer and President David Jackson, also cited “concerning comments” he’d heard that “raise questions about how the business is being operated.” The email does not detail the comments that raised alarms. Staples did not respond to requests for comment. Jackson is office did not make him available for comment, and a message left with a spokesperson for Simmons Foods was not returned. In a deposition, Walker dismissed Staples as a “puppy.”“I am a big dog. I do not play with puppies,” Walker said. Since the n, another business venture tied to Walker could also face trouble. Last month, a Texas bank sued Walker and another business partner over an unpaid $200,000 debt secured to help finance a pizza restaurant. According to court filings, Walker personally guaranteed the loan. Walker has not yet filed his response to the suit. Slodysko reported from Washington; Bleiberg reported from Dallas.",1,2,AP

220,"How Hurricane Ida is path, climate change, and Covid-19 made the Gulf vulnerable",-8.33,42.67,https://www.vox.com/22648189/hurricane-ida-new-orleans-louisiana-flood-climate-change-covid,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-30,25,"Hurricane Idamade landfall in Louisiana on Sunday, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, as an enormousCategory 4storm with sustained winds of 150 miles per hour and gust sup to 172 mph. The storm to re roofs off buildings, flooded homes, and left the entire city ofNew Orleans in the dark. Ida will likely be one of the worst extreme weather events of 2021, a year already swelling with heat waves, wildfires, droughts, and storms. “Hurricane Ida is one of the strongest storms to ever hit Louisiana,” Governor John Bel Edwards said in a statement on Sunday. The storm is still churning and turning east through Mississippi. Though Ida has been downgraded to a tropical storm, more devastation is likely in store. The nation will learn more about local impacts as communities regain access to electricity and spotty communications. Even after the winds die down, the towering storm surge will likely linger for days and impede rescue and recovery efforts. So will the coronavirus pandemic: Less than half of Louisiana is population is vaccinated, and 2,600 patients were hospitalized for Covid-19 as Ida made landfall. The size and uncanny timing of Hurricane Ida makes it impossible to avoid comparisons to Hurricane Katrina, the 2005 storm that killed at least 1,170 people and tied 2017 is Hurricane Harvey as the costliest disaster in US history. While levees appear to have protected much of the state from Katrina-level flooding so far, some similarities are likely to emerge: Structural inequities and vulnerabilities remain, and communities of color are still at high risk from hurricanes like this. But much of Katrina is toll in human suffering and devastation became visible in the days and weeks after the storm, in part due to a botched relief effort. It will take time to figure out whether Louisiana, the city of New Orleans, and the US as a whole learned the lessons of Katrina in advance of Ida. Related“People think of a few common the mes when they think about hurricanes in New Orleans,” including levees and the legacy of Hurricane Katrina, Lamar Gardere, executive director of the Louisiana nonprofit the Data Center, wrote to Vox on Sunday, shortly after evacuating the city. “But every hurricane boils down to a story about infrastructure, inequity, and climate change/coastal land loss.”“These are the same stories that affect much of our country, but they come into acute focus with immediate and dramatic effect during these events,” Gardere added. Cities along the Gulf Coast have spent billions over the past decade and a half building up their defenses — levees, sea wall, flood control mechanisms. But populations have grown, the oceans have risen, and the planet has warmed. The threat of extreme weather is growing, and it is becoming harder to adapt. Millions of people live in the US Gulf Coast, which is one of the country is fastest-growing regions and stretches across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. Between 2000 and 2016, the population in the region grew by 25.4 percent, compared to 14.8 percent across the US as a whole. That in turn has fueled a construction boom of homes, businesses, infrastructure, and industrial facilities, particularly for the oil and gas sector. Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, an oil and gas hub that experienced some of the storm is most extreme winds and storm surges. Much of the new construction is in low-lying areas prone to coastal inundation, with some places lying below sea level. Parts of theGulf Coast are sinking as the soft ground settles beneath heavy construction and changes in land use, a phenomenon known as subsidence. The coastline itself, which can serve as a barrier against storms, i swearing awa yas rising seas erode the shore. Changes to waterways like the Mississippi River have also diminished vital sources of sediments for replenishing the coast. All this means that lots of people and property are in harm is way when disasters occur. And Ida took an especially destructive course through major population centers. The risks, however, are not distributed equally. Many lower-income communities and those populated by people of color have less protective infrastructure like levees and sea walls, leaving them vulnerable to storms and rising water. The people in these communities also often have the most difficulty getting out of the path of the storm as they struggle to find adequate money and shelter to evacuate. In May, the NOAA forecasted that the US Atlantic hurricane season, which runs from late May until the end of November, had a 60 percent chance of being “above normal.”So far, that prediction has come to pass. “After a record-setting start, the 2021 Atlantic hurricane season does not show any signs of relenting as it enters the peak months ahead,” said Rick Spinrad, NOAA administrator, in anAugust statement. This year is season is below the record-breaking season last year, which was the busiest on record. But there are several factors this year that are fueling a more active year for tropical cyclones. Ordinarily, a key factor is sea surface temperature. Hurricanes need water to be at least 26 degrees Celsius, or 79 degrees Fahrenheit, and the warmer water gets, the more energy is available to form storms. Water temperatures in the Gulfspiked ahead of Hurricane Ida, but sea surface temperatures in the North Atlantic this year have generally been near average levels. Still, forecasters are anticipating a strongerWest African monsoon, which helps birth hurricanes. Meteorologists are also expecting less vertical wind shear in the atmosphere, which are changes in wind speed and direction that can rip apart hurricanes before they form. Another factor that favors more active hurricane seasons: Since 1995, the Atlantic Ocean has been in the warm phase of a decades-long ebb and flow in ocean temperatures, known as the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation. The planet is warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. That amplifies the raw ingredients of hurricanes and can worsen storms. While researchers are still parsing the climate signals in Hurricane Ida, scientists have known for decades that climate change worsens hurricanes for several reasons. Sea surface temperatures are rising, which infuses storms with more energy and can increase their intensity.“As the climate warms, we expect that the upper bound of how intense a hurricane can get ... goes up at a certain rate with warming and that is been known for 33 years,” Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmospheric science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Vox last year. Another way climate change makes hurricanes more destructive is by increasing their rainfall. Air soaks up about 7 percent more water for every degree Celsius the air warms, so warmer air means more moisture is available for precipitation. Extreme rainfall events are on the rise, and Ida drenched parts of Louisiana with as much as24 inches of rain. Rising sea levels due to the melting of ice caps and the thermal expansion of water are leading to larger storm surges, too. This coastal flooding, driven by a storm is winds pushing water inland, is often the deadliest and most destructive element of hurricanes. Ida created a storm surge as high as16 feet. Climate change is also causing the rapid intensification of more hurricanes. NOAA defines rapid intensification as a gain of 35 mph or more in wind speed over 24 hours. Ida strengthened from category 2 strength (with winds up to 110 miles per hour) to category 4 strength (with winds to pping 150 mph) in less than a day. Hurricanes tend to rapidly intensify when they pass over a patch of water that is warm, deep, and calm. These changes in wind speed can make the difference between a building surviving a hurricane and being obliterated by it. Experts have been warning for more than a year that a hurricane striking during a pandemic would pose unique challenges, and health officials are worried more difficulties may arise in the wake of Hurricane Ida.“We are having a situation where even when you are stretched to the limit — to superimpose upon it what will likely be a historic weather environmental catastrophe — is going to do nothing but make things much, much worse,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told CNN on Sunday. Hospitals are contending with power outages, and many are unable to relocate their patients because other medical facilities in the region are already full of Covid-19 patients. For evacuees in shelters, it is proving hard to maintain social distance. The risk of further transmission is high, given relatively low vaccination rates across the Gulf Coast and the spread of the more-transmissible delta variant. Hurricane Katrina took a devastating toll on communities of color, and advocates fear these communities will again suffer some of the worst impacts of Hurricane Ida. Indigenous communities in the bayou have been hit by catastrophic flooding, said Donny Verdin, a member of the tribal council of the United Houma Nation. “We have people who stayed behind whose houses were flooding and roofs were blown off as they were in the m,” Verdin, who evacuated to Texas on Saturday, told Vox on Monday. The United Houma Nation is typically overlooked by federal relief, Verdin said, because it is not a federally recognized tribe. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, he said, his community relied on donations and nonprofit organizations instead of support from the federal government. “We are just left to fend for ourselves,” he said. “The community usually pulls together and we build back. It is what we have done forever.”Storms and sea-level rise fueled by climate change have been pushing tribes further inland, away from their traditional territories. The majority of Verdin is community used to live right on the coast: “We are people of the water,” he said. After Katrina, three-quarters of them moved inland, Verdin told Vox.“The community is not as close as it once was because people are more scattered,” he said. “The best-case scenario is that we are able to relocate our communities. The worst-case scenario is that they wash away.”Relocating communities who have lived in coastal Louisiana for generations comes at a steep cost. “Our access to the natural resources and food security has been everything for our sovereignty,” said Monique Verdin (no direct relation to Donny Verdin), another member of the United Houma Nation who works with the community group Another Gulf is Possible. “When you take the people away from the bayou you are literally taking them away from their ability to feed the mselves.” Plus, at the end of the day, she told Vox, “you ca not run from climate change.”It is hard not to draw ties between Hurricane Ida and Hurricane Katrina, one of the most expensive storms in US history. The storms landed on the same day of the year and in roughly the same spot. They had similar wind speeds. They even gained strength by passing over a similar patch of warm ocean water in the Gulf that fuels hurricanes,the AP reported. There are some important differences in the storms the mselves — Ida caused a weaker storm surge but had stronger winds, for example. But even if all things were considered equal, Ida is likely to be far less devastating than the 2005 storm. Katrina was destructive in part because of structural issues with the region is system of levees — many of which failed — and a botched government response to the crisis, as Vox is German Lopezpreviously reported. Here is how Lopez put it:The government response was so wildly incompetent that it allowed the worst of the catastrophe to continue and sometimes created entirely new, unnecessary problems. People will always have to deal with unavoidable natural disasters, but a poor government reaction and preparation can lead to many more deaths and untold costs. The US government also failed to evacuate tens of thousands of people who could not afford to leave Louisiana before the storm hit, Lopez reported. The levee system is much stronger to day, after a $14.5 billion investment in storm protection authorized by Congress in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The Army Corps of Engineers has since constructed hundreds of miles of levees around New Orleans,Reuters reported, some of which are30 feet tall. They appear to be working, with only a small number of levee failures reported outside of the city. The governor said on Monday that the state is storm protection system performed “extremely well,” after stating earlier that they were “built for this moment.” (His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)The details of Hurricane Ida is devastation will trickle out for days to come, as officials survey the damage and conduct search-and-rescue operations. “I fully expect [the] death count will go up considerably throughout the day,” the governor told MSNBC on Monday. And if past hurricanes are any guide, the government is ongoing response to the storm — including its long-term follow-through — will shape the region is recovery and its resilience to future hurricanes. There will be more storms, and in a warming world, they will get worse. ",1,1,Vox

Very few people on the planet need no introduction. Even fewer are known by just their first name.

Many have been downright cruel at times since his breaking health news.

That is how Biden would summarize Rush is proliferating contributions and impact on society?Then Biden finished by saying, ""I do not think he understands the American code of decency and honor."" That coming from a politician who just denigrated a broadcasting mogul who has 10 times his popularity and influence and has just been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer? Is that Biden is idea of an ""American code of decency and honor""?Advertisement - story continues belowTrue decency and honor were demonstrated in the fitting tribute President Trump and first lady Melania Trump gifted Rush at his State of the Union speech this past week by awarding him with the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom, or PMF For those who do not know, the PMF is awarded to those who have ""made exceptional contributions to the security or national interests of America, to world peace, or to cultural or other significant public or private endeavors,"" according to the White House website. According toBusiness Insider,Trump has awarded 14 other PMFs, including to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Babe Ruth and Tiger Woods. It is fascinating to note that, in 2017, Joe Biden himself was awarded the PMFby former President Barack Obama. Obama lauded Biden as ""the best vice president America is ever had"" and a ""lion of American history."" So, Biden is worthy yet Rush unworthy to receive the PMF?Republican lawmakers declared their answer to that question by giving Rush a standing ovation while Democratic lawmakers remained seated and stunned as if Trump just awarded the Medal of Freedom to an ISIS imam. Again, how tacky would those Democrats' reactions be to any PMF recipient, let alone a ginormous American patriot like Rush?Advertisement - story continues belowIn his State of the Union speech, the president described Rush as ""a special man, beloved by millions of Americans … the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet.""

His daily radio show averages a listening audience of 27 million people. Regarding Rush is landmark pioneering in radio broadcasting, the Washington Postexplained:Limbaugh remade all the rules of talk radio. Before him, the norm in talk radio, in the major markets where it existed, was local hosts who rarely aired their views, and whose programs centered around interviews and interesting callers, on a full range of topics. Limbaugh changed that, demonstrating that a market existed for edgy, boundary pushing, nationally syndicated talk that centered around the host is opinion. Advertisement - story continues belowWithin a few years Limbaugh had shot to superstardom, broadcasting on hundreds of stations and reaching millions of listeners per week. Restaurants even launched ""Rush rooms"" in the early 1990s, where people could come eat lunch and hear their favorite show. Limbaugh is success catalyzed a series of decisions by radio executives that, over the next decade, not only led to an explosion of talk radio, but conservative radio, with most talk stations broadcasting all conservative, mostly syndicated, political talk formats by the early 2000s. …This model soon expanded to television, as it directly shaped Fox News. By the late 2000s, it also extended to conservative digital sites like Red State, Breitbart and Townhall, which would explode in number in the 2010s. Speaking of Fox News, Gena and I first met Rush at the home of Roger Ailes, the former CEO for Fox News. In person, Rush is down to earth and a no-nonsense type of guy who you ca not help but love and like. Just a single minute after beginning to converse with him you are convinced that this man cares for you and everyone else in addition to the fact that he is a genius. He might flare with showmanship on air, but let there be no doubt he has and does contribute more to the preservation of the American republic than just about anyone.

Even more, we also join his beloved wife,Kathryn,and millions across this country in praying that God is hand would work through medical technology and advances to heal Rush. Rush, if you are reading this, Gena and I have always been and will always be your fans. Thanks for always fighting the good fight of faith as well as truth, justice and the American way.

222,Bill to Subsidize Sustainable Agriculture Is a “Prime Contender” for Reconciliation Package,-3.33,42.33,https://theintercept.com/2021/07/21/agriculture-carbon-credit-markets-reconciliation/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-21,25,"A bipartisan measure to boost carbon credit markets is a “prime contender” to be in the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion reconciliation package, Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, told The Intercept. But its inclusion in the simple-majority process would put Senate Budget Committee Chair Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and other critics in the awkward position of supporting a bill they already voted against. The Growing Climate Solutions Act, or S. 1251, aims to help farmers and foresters more easily participate in carbon credit markets. It would establish a program at the Department of Agriculture to certify technical experts who can assist landowners implementing carbon capture, emission-reduction measures, and other sustain ability methods by planting fast-growing crops such as hemp. Championed by Whitehouse and Senator Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., the Growing Climate Solutions Act has received the endorsement of the American Farm Bureau Federation and Environmental Defense Fund and passed the Senate in a 92-8 vote just last month. Sanders, along with Sens. Cory Booker, D-NJ; Ed Markey, D-Mass.; Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.; and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., voted against the bill. Broadly speaking, opponents argued that the measure was at best a distraction from the necessary work of reducing emissions and at worst could prolong the strength of the fossil fuel industry. “I do not believe that an offset system that subsidizes corporations’ continued pollution in front-line communities is the best strategy,” Merkley said at the time of the vote. “Let is set incentives that reduce pollution in both agriculture and front-line neighborhoods.”Advocates of the bill argue that time has run out, and Democrats ca not afford to leave any tool that could reduce carbon concentration on the sidelines. Carbon concentration has reached 418 parts per million, well over the 350 ppm that scientists say is a threshold the planet needs to remain under. Whether portions of S. 1251 and other climate crisis bills are eligible to pass with just 51 votes, including the vice president, is ultimately up to the Senate, but both parties have out sourced their responsibility over the years to a parliamentarian, who is hired to give advisory opinions on whether legislation complies with the rules of reconciliation. Those opinions, however, have been taken by Senate Democrats as final rulings, empowering Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough to have control over what makes it into the party is bill. The reconciliation process is restrictions, coupled with the pressure of maintaining every Democrat is support, may leave Sanders and other S. 1251 critics no choice but to end up supporting the measure when they vote in the $3.5 trillion package is favor. Meanwhile, the Growing Climate Solutions Act is not the only proposal to tackle the climate crisis that lawmakers seek to pass in the reconciliation bill. With trillions at their disposal, Democrats may not be in an either-or situation. “I am hoping that reconciliation produces much stronger climate measures,” Whitehouse said, without providing specifics. S. 1251 “would be a part of it.”Anthony Pahnke, vice president of Family Farm Defenders, said there are other agriculture bills lawmakers have introduced that could be more effective to defend the environment. His organization was one of more than 200 farming, environmental, and animal rights groups that signed a letter to Congress in October urging members to oppose the Growing Climate Solutions Act, arguing that carbon markets fail to reduce emissions overall and worsen conditions in low-income communities located near industrial polluters. Pahnke pointed to bills like Booker is Farm System Reform Act, which would crack down on concentrated animal feeding operations, or New York Democrat Senator Kirsten Gillibrand is Relief for America is Small Farmers Act as better legislation.

Death Valley soared to a blistering 128 degrees, and Denver saw a rare hat trick of three 100-degree days in a row. Tucson saw eight straight days of temperatures 110 degrees or higher, breaking the record for the number of consecutive days above that barrier and making it the city is hottest week. Phoenix endured a record-setting six straight days of temperatures 115 or higher. All of this heat contributed to a high fire danger which came to fruition over the weekend when multiple blazes broke out in several Western states including California, Colorado, Arizona and Oregon. The Willow Fire in Monterey County, which forced evacuations Friday, continued to burn over the weekend sending smoke billowing into the Bay Area. The Cow Fire in Shasta County also prompted evacuation orders, and at one point Sundayrequired a large air tanker to be diverted off the Willow Firefor increased firefighting efforts. On Monday, 7 million people were under red flag warnings across six Western states where the combination of hot temperatures, wind gusts to 40 mph and bone-dry humidity lead to a critical fire threat. Las Vegas was included in the risk zone for the fire danger. The most recent heat wave was focused over portions of the Four Corners, desert Southwest and Southern and Central California. Next week, however, the area of most exceptional heat could park over northern California and the Pacific Northwest. This will lead to another week with a high risk of wildfires due to the already desiccated landscape void of much precipitation whether falling from the sky or locked in the mostly-melted snowpack. Withground fuels already sitting at highly flammable and record-dry levels, all experts can do is warn people of the impending danger and hope for the best in what has already proven to be an early and destructive start to the Western wildfire season. With climate change making heat waves three times more likely compared to 100 years ago and contributing to the current 22-yearmegadrought, wildfire seasons are starting earlier and lasting longer into the year. As the gap closes, experts say there is not so much a defined wildfire season in the West anymore, but instead it lasts year round.

226,Explainer: Title IX change for transgender students after Bostock,-7.0,46.33,https://19thnews.org/2021/06/the-19th-explains-what-did-title-ix-changes-just-do-for-trans-students/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,25,"Last week, the Department of Educationissueda new interpretation of Title IX, extending protections to transgender students and rejecting the direction that had been taken by the Trump administration.“The Department makes clear that all students — including LGBTQ+ students — deserve the opportunity to learn and thrive in schools that are free from discrimination,” US Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement. The federal-level interpretation comes as statehouses have passed legislation discriminatory and sometimes harmful toward transgender youths, but its effects might not be immediately noticeable. The 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one. Here is what the new guidance means for transgender students and school administrators. Title IX of the Education Amendments, enacted in 1972 and signed into law by former President Richard Nixon, prohibits discrimination on the “basis of sex in any education program or activity offered by a recipient of federal financial assistance.”Erin Buzuvis, associate dean for academic affairs and professor of law at Western New England University, said that Title IX is a statute, enforced by regulations. And the n one level below that, there are interpretations. You have been subscribed!Submitting…Uh-oh! Something went wrong. Please email[email protected]to subscribe. This email address might not be capable of receiving em ails (according toBouncer). You should try again with a different email address. If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected].“In terms of interpreting Title IX, that is the purview of the administration in power,” Buzuvis said. “It is a matter of saying, ‘This is how we are exercising the statute.’”The Education Department is recent interpretation stems from Bostock vs Clayton County, a case the US Supreme Court decided last year. The ruling upheld the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and protected employees against discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity.“The Supreme Court has upheld the right for LGBTQ+ people to live and work without fear of harassment, exclusion and discrimination — and our LGBTQ+ students have the same rights and deserve the same protections,” Cardona said. But interpretations can be reversed from one administration to the next, leaving protections shaky. A change to a statute is regulations, Buzuvis said, would have a more lasting effect — but also take a longer period of time to establish. The Trump administration is regulations related to sexual assault, passed in 2018 and enacted in 2020, were the first Title IX guidance to go through a formal notice-and-comment process since 1997. Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, the deputy executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality, said that it was already illegal to discriminate against transgender people, but that the particulars of who was protected under Title IX were heavily contested.“This announcement now means that transgender youth know definitively that it is illegal for schools to discriminate against the m,” Heng-Lehtinen said. “It is a very big deal and puts a harder point on it. It means that they know the federal government has their backs.”LGBTQ+ students often face disproportionate bullying, harassment and victimization — which has been exacerbated during COVID-19. While learning remotely, students have not had access to school-based mental health services and other supports. Over the past year,42 percent of LGBTQ+ youth seriously considered suicide and 94 percent said politics has also impacted their mental well-being, according to the Trevor Project, an organization dedicated to suicide prevention among LGBTQ+ youth.“If you are a transgender student in school right now and a teacher is harassing you because you are trans or the school is shutting you out of certain programs, now you will be able to file a complaint against that and be in a much stronger position to win against the school,” Heng-Lehtinen said. With the protections no longer ambiguous, Heng-Lehtinen said, schools that do not reinforce protections for transgender students face a greater chance of losing federal funding. Heng-Lehtinen said he anticipates many schools will update their policies in response to the new interpretation.“There is still a lot more to do to make sure schools are really safe,” Heng-Lehtinen said, “but this is a big step forward.”Under the Trump administration, the Education Departmenthad issued guidance saying that the Supreme Court ruling did not offer protections to transgender students. Title IX, the administration argued, did not apply to discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. In fact, the Trump administration threatened last year to wit hold federal aid from schools that allowed transgender athletes to participate in sports. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in April, and under Biden, the Department of Justicerevoked support for a lawsuit challenging the rights of two Black trans track runners in Connecticut to compete. David Hinojosa, director of the educational opportunities project at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, said that protections for transgender students had been in limbo for the past four years and that the new guidance would instruct school districts on what to do.“Having worked for school districts, albeit briefly, I know that school districts pay attention to guidance from the Education Department,” Hinojosa said. “It could have far-reaching implications as school districts revisit, revise policies or face potential complaints.”About a dozen states this year introduced bills that would limit trans health care for kids, and at least 19 states are also considering bills that would limit trans youth participation in sports. The clarification does not have an immediate legal impact on undoing any of those state laws. What it does, though, is signal to the states that there will be consequences if they try to test the protections of Title IX, Buzuvis said. Most school districts and colleges and universities receive some kind of federal money. The new clarification puts many of them at risk of having to decide whether to receive federal funding or break state law. The Education Department “has never revoked funding under Title IX,” Buzuvis said. “Infractions are usually one-on-one with institutions, not entire states. And institutions typically adjust their policies moving forward to avoid that kind of sanction.”If the federal government does revoke funding to an entire state, that would be unprecedented, she said.“Honestly, what is going to rock my world is when an actual enforcement matter comes up,” she said. It appears so. The majority of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation was introduced in majority-Republican statehouses, including in Montana, Utah, Arizona, Texas, Missouri and Tennessee. Meanwhile, mostly Democratic lawmakers in more than 10 states have filed at least 20 bills that would add protections for LGBTQ+ people. Politics, more than legal implications, appears to be driving these bills, Hinojosa said.“These legislators do not care,” Hinojosa said. “They just want to rally their political bases. They are not writing the checks that have to defend against the civil rights violations. The taxpayers do.”Transgender rights, specifically those relating to transgender girls’ participation in school sports, have largely become a litmus test for Republicans running for office. Many conservatives have voiced concerns that trans women will have an unfair advantage against cis gender women. Idaho was the first state to pass legislation barring transgender women from joining women is sports teams (though its enforcement was halted by a federal judge). Mississippi, Arkansas and Tennessee followed suit. And according to are cent poll conducted by Politico and Morning Consult, about 74 percent of Republicans and 40 percent of Democrats support this type of ban. Some states receive a significant amount of federal funding, up to hundreds of millions of dollars in some cases, Hinojosa said. Even the loss of that funding might not be enough to incentivize a change in state laws.“I do not know how much these states are willing to dig their heels in,” Hinojosa said. “They seem to have a no-holds-barred approach to these issues, so the re is no real way of telling.”From the Collection",2,2,19th News

ByMatt CraigandLivia Albeck-RipkaSANTA MONICA, Calif. — As the sun began to burn through the morning marine layer, patrons of the Third Street Promenade in Santa Monica, Calif., were still adjusting to the new normal, which was pretty much the old normal — an order fromLos Angeles County to w ear masks indoors in businesses and public places. Most customers dutifully took their mask son and off at the entrance of shops, where signs wereposted to remind them of the policy and where, in some cases, complimentary masks were offered. Out-of-state tourists found the mselves wearing masks for the first time in months, sometimes annoyed but largely compliant, and one restaurant employee who forgot about the mandate was able to secure a mask by running across the street and asking employees at the Starbucks if they had extras.“Some people think it is a punishment,” said Lisa Liu, 38, who said she was fully vaccinated. She was shopping on Sunday and was interviewed outside a clothing store called Tazga. “But for me it is a mask — it is not a big deal.”It was not what people expected when the previous mandate was lifted a month ago, but for the most part people inLos Angelesseemed to react with resigned acceptance, sometimes even weary approval, figuring that risingCovid-19rates made the policy tolerable, if not welcome.

228,Greg Hansen: Arizona is old way of recruiting did not work. Maybe Sean Miller is new approach will.,0.0,37.33,https://tucson.com/sports/greghansen/greg-hansen-arizonas-old-way-of-recruiting-didnt-work-maybe-sean-millers-new-approach-will/article_4a88aba6-5f1e-5425-bb9b-fcff77d0b7a2.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/arizona-daily-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,25,"Take your pick for college basketball 2020-21: Remy Martin or Alex Barcello? As Arizona State football coach Herm Edwards would say “Hello?”In the Rivals150 Prospect Rankings of 2017, Arizona point guard signee Barcello (Number 118) was ranked ahead of Martin (Number 128), who is an AP preseason All-American and has become the presumptive Pac-12 MVP for the coming season. Barcello averaged 9.3 points per game at BYU last year. Under any author, analyst or group dynamic, college basketball is recruiting rankings are imprecise. Is not that a much gentler term than, say, “full of holes?”Over the last five years, Arizona signed five-star recruit Emmanuel Akot, who was more like a 2½, and five-star guard Justin Simon, who could do everything but shoot, which is like signing a quarterback who could not hit a dump-off pass. Kaleb Tarczewski arrived at Arizona as a five-star center and left as a EuroLeague player. Rawle Alkins was a five-star signee. Once the lights came on at McKale Center, it took about five minutes to realize Alkins lacked the size, scoring ability, ball-handling and general excellence to be anything more than a three-star player. But he did dunk with authority whenever the rim was left unguarded. Unfortunately, ranking 18-year-old basketball players with a star system — one through five — is the best we have got. It is more aptly a 2-U system: unreliable and unconvincing. When Duquesne signed point guard TJ McConnell to the Class of 2010, he was not given a rating byRivals.com, which meant he was a no-star prospect. Wildcats guard TJ McConnell kisses the floor before leaving it for the last time in the second half during a game against Stanford on March 7, 2015. By the time McConnell played his final game for Arizona in 2015, he was one of the few who reached a five-star level under Sean Miller. It was not the star system that mattered; it was that McConnell was a winner — an achiever — in a category with some of the previous hugely underrated Wildcats such as Jud Buechler, Steve Kerr and Solomon Hill. It is under such qualifications that I report Arizona is men is basketball Class of 2021 is, in an Arizona context, historically low. Worrisome? Yes. Since the evaluators/scouts atRivals.combegan their ranking system 19 years ago, Arizona is Class of 2021 is rated lower than any previous UA team in the Pac-12. And do not forget that Arizona is three signees all basically play the same position — shooting guard. Arizona and most schools already have them in excess. Arizona is recruiting class is ranked Number 27 nationally byRivals.com. That is not a colossal failure, but it is sixth in the Pac-12 and, as Miller likes to say, not “Arizona good.” As I researched two decades ofRivals.comrankings, I cannot find another Arizona team ranked worse than Number 3 in the league. The Pac-12 is 2021 rankings are a jolt of reality to many UA fans. The top half looks like this:1. Oregon (seventh nationally);2. Stanford (12th);3. UCLA (15th);4. Colorado (19th);5. USC (20th);6. Arizona (27th). Not only that, the Wildcats do not have a player ranked in the Pac-12 is top nine. The conference is 10 highest-rated players are these guys:1. Harrison Ingram, Stanford (ninth nationally);2. Peyton Watson, UCLA (17th);3. Nathan Bittle, Oregon (19th);4. Isael Silva, Stanford (26th);5. Will McClendon, UCLA (37th);6. Reese Dixon-Waters, USC (49th);7. Lawson Levering, Colorado (57th);8. Quincy Allen, Colorado (68th);9. Jackson Grant, Washington (71st);10. Shane Dezonie, Arizona (84th). More? Gonzaga has two players ranked higher than Dezonie, according toRivals.com. Do what you want with this data, but the re is a growing feeling that Arizona is decline in recruiting can be traced to the September 2017 morning when the FBI knocked on the doors of Miller and assistant coach Book Richardson and began a reputation-staining investigation into the UA is recruiting practices. According toRivals.com, the UA is Class of 2020 — players who are college freshmen today — included just one of the Pac-12 is 10 leading recruits: guard Dalen Terry, who was ranked Number 51 nationally. The list begins with USC is Evan Mobley, Stanford is Zaire Williams, ASU is Joshua Christopher and the Sun Devils’ Marvin Bagley. That is right, two Sun Devils. That has not happened since the 1970s. It follows another unusually low-ranked UA Class of 2018, led by Number 34 Brandon Williams, which put him behind Oregon is Bol Bol and Louis King and USC is Kevin Porter. Williams was the only Wildcat in the Pac-12 is top 10 in the Class of ’18. Brandon Williams averaged 11.4 points per game for UA in the 2018-19 season, the n spent last year wearing street clothes to Wildcats home games after having surgery for his longtime knee issue. Miller was surely the first to understand Arizona is recruiting influence has diminished in the USs. He creatively went to Europe and, with the clock ticking, brought in prospects from Estonia, Turkey, France and Lithuania. Those prospects are not routinely rated by the American recruiting services, or at least not with much accuracy. Lauri Markkanen, for example, was given a four-star ranking once he appeared on the UA is Class of 2016 list. That was below Arizona is five-star recruits Alkins, Simon and Terrence Ferguson. And Ferguson chose not to play college basketball. Oops. Miller has tried to combat the lack of an Arizona-good freshman class by being one of the most prolific coaches in the transfer market, acquiring Nevada is Jordan Brown, Georgetown is James Akinjo, Seattle is Terrell Brown and Kentucky is Jemarl Baker. The only trouble with that is Miller is previous transfers have mostly been fill-out-the roster types: Stone Gettings, Ryan Luther, Chase Jeter, Max Hazzard, Justin Coleman, Dylan Smith and Mark Tollefsen. Many fans are seduced by anyone Miller recruits, whether it be a big man from Duke or a point guard from Alabama. But as much as anyone in college basketball, Arizona has found that the quality of the transfer pool is often strained. To his credit, Miller recognized that the “old way” of roster management in college basketball was no longer sustainable. The one-and-dones, the two-and-outs and the quick-to-transfer players impacted Arizona as much as any school in the country. So Miller has gone mostly to Europeans and to transfers. Some of his critics will be pleased to know that the three players in Arizona is Class of 2021 — Shane Nowell, KJ Simpson and Dezonie — do not appear to be one-and-done prospects bound for early entry to the NBA For the past few seasons, critics have implored Miller to recruit those who will stick in the program for three or four years. More Christian Kolokos and fewer Stanley Johnsons. More Nick Johnsons and fewer Nico Mannions. At its highest level, college basketball in 2020 requires a new model of roster management. While the UA is Class of 2021 is ranked below nontraditional powers Colorado and Stanford, it is a move in a new direction. And that is good. The UA has won just two NCAA Tournament games since 2015. The old way was not working.",1,2,Arizona Daily Star

The lack of masks and 6-foot distancing at the meeting, held indoors at the Green Bench Brewing Company, drew fire from St. Petersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman. Desantis, Department of Business and Professional Regulation Secretary Halsey Beshears, and the other participants sat just a few feet from each other at a V-shaped table.“Here is an example of what not to do, especially in Pinellas County and St. Petersburg, where our mask mandate & policies have led the way in the fight against COVID,” Kriseman wrote next to a photo of the event. “Indoors, no masks, no distancing. We believe in science here, governor. We also believe in leading by example.”DeSantis did not say when he would allow drinking at bars, which has been suspended by Beshears since June because of multiple cases of crowding.“We really want to get to ‘yes,’ so we are working hard on it,” DeSantis told owners. DeSantis also said it would ultimately be his decision to reopen bars, not Beshears.’ DeSantis has repeatedly described the June decision to close bars as one made by Beshears and not himself.“He was getting inundated with stuff,” DeSantis said of Beshears’ attempts at regulating bar capacity after the initial reopening in early June. “And there was just no way to be able to play whack-a-mole. … But I have told him, I want every business in Florida operating. And we pretty much have 99%. You guys are kind of the last step.”The lack of masks and social distancing fit the tone of the discussion Thursday, during which DeSantis and bar owners repeatedly expressed frustration over coronavirus rules and questioned some of the limited capacity restrictions in place since the spring.“Somehow it slipped [from] ‘slow the spread, protect hospitals’ to ‘we could never have another case again,'” DeSantis said. “So it really turned into something that was not how it was sold originally to the country.”The governor continued, “I just worry that when we talk about things like social distancing, all this stuff, how long of a period of time is that natural for people to do?”When a bar owner said people concerned about the virus should just improve their own health and lifestyles, adding they should get more Vitamin D, DeSantis responded that was something to consider.“There is a new vitamin D study I have not had [the chance] to look through, but it purports to show a decline in ICU hospitalizations in people who have had significant vitamin D,” he said. “So so we will have to see.”slemongello@orlandosentinel.com",2,2,Orlando Sentinel

Brianna Keilar just to re him apart after nearly every sentence he spoke, because each needed to be corrected and fact-checked in real time so that his advice did not actually kill CNN viewers. Come to think of it, maybe as a Trump campaign lackey, that was a goal of Murtaugh is, but Keilar did her level best to take him down, executing her role as truth-teller journalist in stellar fashion. Here she is smashing his assertion that the only reason the media did not advocate hydroxy chloroquine was that Trump ""expressed optimism"" about it. MURTAUGH: Yes, and everybody embraced a study that it was a failure, and the n that study had to be withdrawn. And now there is another study that shows that it can actually cut deaths by as much as 50%. KEILAR: Are you talking about the study that also using -- the study that also includes corticosteroids which are helpful in coronavirus? It is not hydroxy chloroquine that helps patients. I am not a doctor, clearly,MURTAUGH: So, now you are, again you are cherry picking. KEILAR: I am not cherry picking. Tim, I talk to scientists and doctors. Clearly you do not. Here is Keilar tearing him down for swearing up and down that Dr. Fauci himself would prescribe hydroxy chloroquine for COVID-19. He tries to claim that because it is been used for 65 years, it is safe. She tries to explain how it is safeHe pretends not to get it because he is a cynical *sshole. MURTAUGH: It is been used for 65 years. How dangerous could it possibly be? It is a known -- it is a known --KEILAR: It is an anti-malarial drug. MURTAUGH: It is been used for six-and-a-half decades, so how dangerous could it be? You just said it is a dangerous drug but yet you admit it was used for 65 years. KEILAR: To prevent malaria, not for people who are potentially dying. MURTAUGH: Well, is it dangerous or not? Will it kill you or not? You just said it was dangerous yet you admit that people take it for malaria. KEILAR: I do not think people on their deathbed are given an anti-malarial medication to prevent them getting malaria. You know what, Tim? No, we are done with this part. MURTAUGH: So it is only used by people on their deathbed. Is that what you are saying?Then she just cuts him off and ends the conversation, like a mother telling her pre-teen child that their arguments are not going anywhere, and they are still punished. Cementing her spot at the top of the journalistic class, she asks Murtaugh to wait as she brings in an actual doctor to comment. MURTAUGH: There is a lot to be said for this interview, you are right. KEILAR: Actually stand by. I want to bring in Dr. James Phillips standing by and maybe he could shed a little light when it comes to hydroxychloroquine. Dr. Phillips, you are the expert. I feel like I am talking about this until I am blue in my face and I have spoken to a lot of doctors like you about this, and you just react when it comes to hydroxy chloroquine and I want to be so clear to the people who are watching this, because this is a health issue. DR. PHILLIPS: Thanks for having me on, Brianna. I prepared totalk about recent studies and some other things but this most recent interview is absolutely just unbelievable. So, we have got to get all of the politics and the craziness out of there. Hydroxychloroquine has not been proven safe or efficacious in the treatment of this disease to any degree that doctors should be prescribing this to any patients outside of a clinical trial. The clinical trials that have been performed so far for the most part do not show any efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. In addition it can cause serious illness. It can cause heart problems, it can cause dysrythmias. So to say it is not dangerous is not necessarily true. It has been studied in the setting of patients with malaria. Those are patients with a particular type of symptoms and and a very particular type of disease. Different drugs respond and they work in different ways depending on the situation of the patient. And the studies that have been done in patients with COVID-19 are certainly not conclusive enough to be able to say this is totally safe. Studies have shown that patients probably have died because of the dysrhythmias that occur. So I agree what was just recently said was irresponsible and being said for political reasons and I completely disagree with it. WOULD YOU LIKE TO GUESS WHETHER OR NOT TIM MURTAUGH HUNG AROUND TO COMMENT AFTER THAT?Yeah, he did not. But trust that Dr. Phillips went on to express disbelief, and explain why just because the FDA has ruled one drug safe for a certain use, that does not mean it is safe for other uses. You would not give a hemophiliac a blood thinner, right? Murtaugh is asinine and childish arguments were just ripped apart by Dr. Phillips, and no one should be surprised that he did not hang around to hear it happen.",1,0,Crooks and Liars
231,Whitmer: Indoor and outdoor sports allowed; Michigan gyms can reopen,0.0,49.0,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/09/03/whitmer-indoor-outdoor-sports-allowed-while-michigan-gyms-can-reopen/5686314002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,25,"— Gyms can reopen at limited capacity and organized sports can resume in Michigan under new executive orders that Governor Gretchen Whitmer released Thursday, but one directive clashed with a recommendation by the state Department of Health and Human Services. The long-awaited orders, Nos. 175 and 176, allow for organized sports with limitations on mask use and crowd size, despite guidance from Whitmer is health department recommending against contact sports, including football, soccer and wrestling. They came on the same day the governor extended through October 1 the state of emergency, which is what gives her the ability to make unilateral actions to combat the virus, such as closing businesses or penalizing those who do not wear masks. The order allowing for contact sports in spite of the health department is recommendation concerned at least one epidemiologist, who opined it would almost surely lead to further virus spread. The orders would allow Michigan gyms and pools to reopen at 25% capacity starting Wednesday with strict protocols in place, including mask use at all times and distancing of 6 feet between workout stations and individuals participating in classes. Gym patrons must provide their name and phone number, or they will be denied entry. Saunas and hot tubs must remain closed. Indoor pools will be capped at 25% capacity, while outdoor pools remain capped at 50%.“I urge everyone who plans to hit the gym after these orders go into effect to take these precautions seriously and do everything in their power to protect the mselves and their families,"" Whitmer said in a Thursday statement. ""Be smart, and stay safe.”Indoor organized sports also can resume, but guests will be limited to two per athlete. Outdoor organized sports would be limited to up to 100 guests. Athletes will be required to wear masks, except when swimming, and should maintain 6 feet of distance when ""compatible,"" according to Whitmer is order. Bowling and ice rinks may only open for organized sports, according to the order. The executive orders were followed closely by an announcement from the Michigan High School Athletic Associationthat reinstated the fall football season after it had been postponed to the spring. Games can begin Sept. 18, the league said. The association also noted competitions could start immediately for boys soccer and on Wednesday for girls swimming, diving and volleyball. There is no mention in the orders of the reopening of movie the aters or banquet facilities in lower Michigan, where they have been shuttered since March. The state Department of Health and Human Services rules that were issued in tandem with the orders recommend against contact sports such as football, wrestling or soccer at schools and universities. But the department said the guidance could be adjusted with updated epidemiological data. The health department is guidance recommends frequent hand-washing, proper disinfecting of facilities or shared equipment, avoidance of shared items such as to wels or water bottles, avoidance of post-game high fives or handshakes, and limitations on carpools. There have been at least 30 outbreak investigations in recent weeks linked to sports teams, clubs and gyms, according to the state health department. The outbreaks can easily spread beyond the team and to the community.“Individuals can now choose whether or not to play organized sports, and if they do choose to play, this order requires strict safety measures to reduce risk,” Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldun said Thursday. ""Based on current data, contact sports create a high risk of COVID-19 transmission and MDHHS strongly recommends against participating in them at this time.""The orders do not detail exceptions for ancillary activities such as marching band or cheerleading, but noted the ""elevated risk"" that accompanies “shouting, singing or breathing forcefully.”So long as gyms adhere to the restrictions in Whitmer is order, the activity should be ""part of the universe"" of openings that can occur with controlled risk, said Nigel Paneth, a professor at Michigan State University is Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and Pediatrics and Human Development. But Paneth was less confident about the order allowing organized sports, calling it a ""mistake"" that has been proven to lead to virus transmission among athletes in contact sports.""I am with the health department,"" said Paneth, referring to the department is recommendation against high school sports. ""These kind of group activities just are not working.""Even mask use is no guarantee that the virus would not spread among athletes, he said.""Helmets fall off. Shoulder pads fall off. You think a mask is going to stay on?” Paneth said. ""I think it is a step too far because it really is going to almost surely promote the spread of infections.""Whitmer is administration has been hinting at the reopening of gyms and other shuttered businesses for about three weeks as calls to reopen the facilities have mounted. Most businesses in Michigan closed abruptly March 23 when Whitmer issued her Stay Home, Stay Safe order in an attempt to control the spread of the virus. She gradually loosened the restrictions, allowing 17 northern Michigan counties and the Upper Peninsula to reopen restaurants, bars, gyms and movie the aters in May She re-tightened bar restrictions there in July. Lower Michigan restaurants reopened in June. Last month, Whitmer allowed Detroit is three casinos to reopen at 15% capacity. The Michigan Fitness Club Association said Thursday it appreciated the reopening and committed to the ""health and safety"" of members and the public.""We are well-prepared to ensure a safe, clean environment and we are excited to offer Michiganders the opportunity to resume their exercise routines,"" the group said. ""We look forward to working with Governor Whitmer and her administration to help build a healthy Michigan.”For others, the executive orders were lacking key permissions that struggling, still-closed businesses sought. The ongoing closure of banquet halls will decimate facilities across the state, said Alex Lozovoj, general manager of the Italian American Cultural Society in Clinton Township. Lozovoj has canceled weddings and events, run through a federal Paycheck Protection Program loan and is about to start construction on a 3,000-square-foot outdoor platform to hold events.""We have no end in sight on this,"" Lozovoj said. ""We are crying, we are begging the government to open us back up because we have already lost all our peak time.""If this does not end soon, I ca not imagine any of the banquet halls in the state being able to survive.”For Mike Lucente, owner of Harbor Lanes Bowling Center in St. Clair Shores, the news that he can reopen is well-timed.“This is our normal start-up time either before or after Labor Day,” he said. “I just had a league meeting (Wednesday) night. … They are ready to go. They want to bowl.”Lucente said that league play makes up 75% of his business. He missed the summer league, which would have run for about 14 weeks. Lucente has had concerns about losing business due to the closure.“I might lose these people forever,” he said. “Once they find other things to do, you ca not get them back.”Ken Welch, owner of Pointe Fitness and Training Center in Harper Woods, said Thursday he is relieved he will be able to reopen his gym. The decision is long overdue, he said.“If you design it in a more structured way to limit the crowd, we could have been doing this,” Welch said. The fitness center owner now needs to decide which approaches he will take to limit capacity, which could include an appointment-based system, shortened hours and limited session times.“We have a conscientiousness membership that is very aware of all of these things,” Welch said. “It is not going to be a hard sell.”Although Pointe Fitness and Training Center has lost clients, Welch said he has retained a core group of members he expects to return.“Financially, I think we are going to be OK,” Welch said. “We did get a little bit of government money. I am not going to go into detail, but that is helped us out to kind of weather this. All small gyms have that kind of thing. If you are not working another job or did not get your loans from the government, you are hurting.”Kathy Chester, owner of Disrupt Fitness Gym in Berkley, said she is excited to work out with her clients.“Our kids, our clients need to be physically moving for their mental well-being and everything,” she said. “I think it is so important.”Chester said she has concerns about the use of masks indoors. She is been doing card io workouts outside in the park. Some participants have worn masks, some have not.“That is incredibly difficult to be working out in masks,” she said. “And so I want them to be able to do that in a place where they can get enough airflow and not get so overwhelmed. I ca not imagine running on a treadmill.”She recommends clients purchase high-quality athletic masks. There likely will be more of a focus on personal training instead of fitness classes, Chester said.“I do not think clients are going to be able to go into a class…,” she said. “I think that will nerve them up.”",2,2,Detroit News
232,Black People Are 3 Times More Likely to Experience Pulse Oximeter Errors,-4.0,46.67,https://heavy.com/news/black-people-pulse-oximeter-errors/,https://adfontesmedia.com/heavy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-18,21,"GettyA pulse oximeter measures a person is blood oxygen saturation level and heart rate. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have purchased small devices called pulse oximeters for use in their home – based on well-intentioned recommendations from health care providers and the media. Pulse oximeters are devices, usually placed on a person is finger, used to noninvasive ly measure oxygen levels in the blood. Clinics and hospitals, for example, use them regularly to screen newborns for heart defects after birth. Yet pulse oximeter measurements are imperfect, particularly for Black patients. Our recent paper demonstrated that Black patients were three times more likely than white patients to have low oxygen levels that were missed by pulse oximeters. That could translate into as many as 1 in 10 inaccurate readings among Blacks. We areICUphysiciansandinternistswith expertise in health care research and policy. Our findings were guided by our personal experiences engaging with communities of color during the pandemic and seeing firsthand how easy it is for racial bias to affect health care. Low blood oxygen levels are harmful to patients and can indicate that they are seriously ill. Clinicians frequently use pulse oximetry measurements to decide whether a patient should receive oxygen therapy and how much oxygen a patient should receive. Health care workers may also use this information when deciding what type of care a patient needs, such as admission to a hospital, transfer to an intensive care unit or need for a ventilator. Pulse oximeters came on the market in the late 1970s and seemed to meet the need for an accurate measure of oxygen levels. Pulse oximeters use light that passes through the skin to measure oxygen levels. Blood with higher oxygen levels absorbs light differently than blood with lower oxygen levels. However, anything that slows the passage of this light, like nail polish or skin to ne, can cause inaccuracies. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic we started to recognize that these measurements seemed to be inaccurate for Black patients. Our study confirmed those suspicions, for example finding that sometimes when a pulse oximeter read 94%, the actual blood level of oxygen was much lower. A normal oxygen saturation is above 92%. Oxygen therapy is typically started when oxygen levels are consistently below 89%. In our study, we identified patients who had normal oxygen levels by pulse oximetry (between 92% and 96%) but low oxygen levels by blood oxygen testing (less than 89%). If low oxygen levels in Black patients are missed because of inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, Black patients may be less likely to receive appropriate oxygen therapy or other medical care when they need it. Some people with COVID-19 infection were encouraged to purchase pulse oximeters to monitor their oxygen levels at home as a tool to decide whether hospitalization was needed. These inexpensive home pulse oximeters may be even less accurate than the hospital pulse oximeters used in our study. The extent to which biased pulse oximeters may have delayed appropriate treatment for Black patients is unknown. It is also unclear just how these inaccuracies might affect other medical conditions where racial disparities in medical care have been previously identified. Thefirst pulse oximeter was developed in 1974. However, because early designers did not use a diverse group of test subjects, sources of error, like skin to ne, were underrecognized. Today is pulse oximeters might be better than the ones from the 1970s – the FDA requires all medical technology to be tested on a diverse population of patients, based on age, gender and skin tone. However, the agency defines skin tone diversity by having at least two “darkly pigmented” individuals in the entire testing sample. Our study shows to day is pulse oximeters are still not good enough and that the agency is guidelines for diverse testing remain insufficient. A study from the late 1980sbegan to show that pulse oximeters might be inaccurate based on skin to ne, and aseriesofpublicationsin the 1990s seemed to confirm these findings. Yet 40 years later, these findings have not been widely publicized, were not thoroughly investigated with additional clinical studies and are not routinely a part of medical school curricula at this time. Pulse oximetry will remain an important tool for clinicians, and our findings highlight the need to consider pulse oximetry data in the context of other information related to the patient. However, there are no other straightforward and noninvasive ways to estimate oxygen levels. Feeling short of breath poorly correlates with oxygen levels; skin findings, such ascyanosis, may be more difficult to identify in individuals with darker skin to nes; and using other locations of the body to measure oxygen levels noninvasive ly (like the ear) may not produce more accurate results than the finger. An alternative strategy might be to perform more invasive measurements of oxygen level, such as sampling arterial blood. However, arterial blood draws are painful and can lead to complications. They are also inconvenient and require specialized training. Requiring arterial blood for accurate measurements in Black patients but not white patients simply propagates a different form of racial bias. Medical technology developers should increase the number and diversity of test subjects, with device performance compared across groups to ensure the equity of their accuracy. In addition, prior testing was conducted only among healthy subjects, and our study suggests inaccuracies may be more prominent as oxygen levels decrease. Diversity, in this case, should include a range of patients, based on age, gender, skin to ne, and disability. Our recent conversations with device manufacturers suggest that engineering solutions may already be available. However, once new technologies are available, replacing legacy pulse oximeters with more accurate devices will be difficult, given the ubiquity of existing pulse oximeters and the expense associated with purchasing new devices. Health care providers and patient advocacy groups will need to demand updated technology when it becomes available. Recognizing this now may lead to improvements in medical technology, better medical care for Black patients, and greater recognition of structural racism within medicine.[Subscribe to The Conversation is new science newsletter.]By Thomas Valley, Assistant Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,;Michael Sjoding, Assistant Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,University of Michigan Medical School, andSusan Dorr Goold, Professor of Internal Medicine and Health Management and Policy,University of Michigan Medical SchoolThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

234,Here is what Republicans and billionaires really mean when they talk about ‘freedom’,-23.0,27.0,https://www.alternet.org/2019/03/heres-what-republicans-and-billionaires-really-mean-when-they-talk-about-freedom/,https://adfontesmedia.com/alternet-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-20,25,"America is having a heated debate about the meaning of the word. We’d be better served if, instead, we were debating the meaning offreedom. TheOregonianreported last week that fully 156,000 families are on the edge of homelessness in our small-population state. Every one of those households is now paying more than 50 percent of its monthly income on rent, and none of them has any savings; one medical bill, major car repair or job loss, and they are on the streets. While socialism may or may not solve their problem, the more pressing issue we have is an entire political party and a huge sector of the billionaire class who see homelessness not as a problem, but as a symptom of a “free” society. The wordsandlibertyare iconic in American culture—probably more so than with any other nation because they are so intrinsic to the literature, declarations and slogans of our nation is founding. The irony—of the nation founded on the world is greatest known genocide (the systematic state murder of tens of millions of Native Americans) and over three centuries of legalized slavery and a century and a half of oppression and exploitation of the descendants of those slaves—is extraordinary. It presses us all to bring freedom and liberty to allAmericans. But what do those words mean?If you ask the Koch brothers and their buddies—who slap those words on pretty much everything they do—you’d get a definition that largely has to do with being “free” from taxation and regulation. And, truth be told, if you are morbidly rich, that makes a certain amount of sense, particularly if your main goal is to get richer and richer, regardless of your behavior is impact on working-class people, the environment, or the ability of government to function. On the other hand, the definition of freedom and liberty that is been embraced by so-called “democratic socialist” countries—from Canada to almost all of Europe to Japan and Australia—you’d hear a definition that is closer to that articulated by Franklin D Roosevelt when he proposed, in January 1944, a “second Bill of Rights” to be added to our Constitution. FDR is proposed amendments included the to a job, and the right to be paid enough to live comfortably; the right to “adequate food and clothing and recreation”; the right to start a business and run it without worrying about “unfair competition and domination by monopolies”; the right“of every family to a decent home”; the right to “adequate medical care... to achieve and enjoy good health”; the right to government-based “protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment”; and the right“to a good education.”Roosevelt pointed out that, “All of these rights spell security.”He added, “America is own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these and similar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens. For unless there is security here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.”The other nations mentioned earlier took President Roosevelt is advice to heart. Progressive “social democracy” has kept Europe, Canada, and the developed nations of the East and South Pacific free of war for almost a century—a mind-boggling feat when considering the history of the developed world since the 1500s. Just prior to FDR winning the White House in the election of 1932, the nation had been treated to 12 years of a bizarre Republican administration that was the model for to day is GOP In 1920, Warren Harding won the presidency on a campaign of “more industry in government, less government in industry”—privatize and deregulate—and a promise to drop the top tax rate of 91 percent down to 25 percent. He kept both promises, putting the nation into a sugar-high spin called the Roaring ’20s, where the rich got fabulously rich and working-class people were being beaten and murdered by industrialists when they tried to unionize. Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover (the three Republican presidents from 1920 to 1932) all cheered on the assaults, using phrases like “the right to work” to describe a union-free nation. In the end, the result of the “horses and sparrows” economics advocated by Harding (“feed more oats to the horses and the re will be more oats in the horse poop to f atten the sparrows”—that generation is version of trickle-down economics) was the Republican Great Depression (yes, they called it that until after World War II). Even though Roosevelt was fabulously popular—the only president to be elected four times—the right-wingers of his day were loud and outspoken in their protests of what they called “socialist” programs like Social Security, the right to unionize, and government-guaranteed job programs including the WPA, REA, CCC, and others. The Klan and American Nazis were assembling by the hundreds of thousands nationwide—nearly 30,000 inMadison Square Gardenalone—encouraged by wealthy and powerful “economic royalists” preaching “freedom” and “liberty.” Like the Kochs’Freedomworks, that generation is huge and well-funded (principally by the DuPonts’ chemical fortune) organization was theLiberty League. Roosevelt is generation had seen the results of this kind of hard-right “freedom” rhetoric in Italy, Spain, Japan and Germany, the very nations with which we were the n at war. Speaking of “the grave dangers of ‘rightist reaction’ in this Nation,”Roosevelt told Americain that same speech that: “[I]f history were to repeat itself and we were to return to the so-called ‘normalcy’ of the 1920s—then it is certain that even though we shall have conquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad, we shall have yielded to the spirit of Fascism here at home.”Although right-wingers are still working hard to disassemble FDR is New Deal—the GOP budget for 2019 contains massive cuts to Social Security, as well as to Medicare and Medicaid—we got halfway toward his notion of freedom and liberty here in the USs:The billionaire class and their wholly owned Republican politicians keep trying to tell us that “freedom” means the government does not provide of the things listed above. Instead, they tell us (as Ron Paulfamously di din a GOP primary debate years ago) that, if we are broke and sick, we are “free” to die like a feral dog in the gutter. Freedom is homelessness, in the minds of the billionaires who own the GOP Poverty, lack of education, no access to health care, poor-paying jobs, and barriers to voting are all proof of a free society, they tell us, which is why America is lowest life expectancy, highest maternal and childhood death rates, lowest levels of education, and lowest pa yare almost all in GOP-controlled states. America—particularly the Democratic Party—is engaged in a debate right now about the meaning of. It would be a big help for all of us if we were, instead, to have an honest debate about the meaning of the wordsfreedomandliberty. Independent Media Institute.",0,0,AlterNet
235,"If Democrats Can, Should They Pack US Supreme Court?",-1.0,44.33,https://www.voanews.com/usa/all-about-america/if-democrats-can-should-they-pack-us-supreme-court,https://adfontesmedia.com/voice-america-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-20,24,"As Republicans rush to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump is pick to replace the late-Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the US Supreme Court before Election Day, some liberal Democrats are floating the idea of adding more seats to the court — beyond the current nine. The number of justices has changed over time, from six to as many as 10, but the number has remained steady at nine since 1869. In the 1930s, President Franklin D Roosevelt tried to pack the court to preserve his New Deal legislation, which kept getting struck down by the high court. He failed. If Democrats capture the White House and Senate, while retaining majority control of the House of Representatives, there is no constitutional impediment to following through on the idea.“There is nothing in the Constitution that says that the Supreme Court has to have one or two or five or 10 members,” says Calvin Schermerhorn, professor of history at Arizona State University. “It is silent on how many members there are on the Supreme Court. It only says that there shall be a chief justice, and Congress will have the power to shape the court and configure them in the best interest of justice.”Democrats would have to change filibuster rules in the Senate to lower the threshold for passing legislation from 60 votes to a simple majority of the 100-member chamber to change the number of justices on the high court. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has declined to say whether he would support an expansion of the Supreme Court if he wins election and the Democrats take back control of the Senate, but has promised to reveal his position before Election Day. Expanding the court for political reasons could damage the integrity of the Supreme Court, says Nicole Huberfeld, professor of law at Boston University.“People worry already about whether the Supreme Court is a political actor, rather than apolitical. I do think that adding justices so that one president can appoint a whole bunch of justices could affect the institutional integrity, or at least the perception of institutional integrity,” she says.“The authority of the court largely comes from respecting the decisions of the justices, and the court of itself does not actually have any way to ensure that its decisions are implemented,” Huberfeld adds. “If people stop thinking that is the law of the land, the n the court has an institutional integrity problem.”Most Americans trust the US Supreme Court to act in the best interests of the nation, according to public surveys, but an increasing number of people do worry justices are becoming too mixed up with politics. Although a politicized Supreme Court might be alarming to some to day, the scenario would be familiar to the nation is Founding Fathers, because the court was viewed as an extension of party politics in the 19th century.“The first generation of American leaders, by the so-called founders, used the courts as a creature of the legislature. And so, the federal judiciary, especially, was supposed to be subordinate to the will of democratically elected representatives,” Schermerhorn says. The Republican effort to fast-track Barrett is confirmation is particularly galling to Democrats still steaming because Republicans successfully blocked the 2016 confirmation of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama is pick to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, early in an election year. Now, the Republicans are rushing to confirm Barrett just days before another presidential election, which would create a solid 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. But again, Schermerhorn says, none of that would have fazed the nation is founders.“They would have understood this is as partisan combat and not as a matter of constitutional principle,” he says. “There would have been no hesitation for the party in power in doing exactly what Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has done in his tenure as leader of the Republican-controlled Senate. That is not to say that this is a model that ought to be followed, that just because the founders thought or did something means that it is worthy of emulation.”Huberfeld says it is important to remember that there is more to the high court is work than the few cases that draw the most attention and controversy, such as those dealing with health care, abortion or LGBTQ rights..“The way that the court decides cases is much more than the handful of cases that people tend totalk about in political conversation. There are many cases the court hears that are just basic statutory interpretation. There are many cases the court hears that are criminal procedure cases,” she says. “Typically, at least in the modern era, once people are appointed, they tend to take that appointment quite seriously and to sort of put politics behind them.”She points out that justices do not always rule as expected. For example, conservative Scalia is interpretation of the Constitution led him to be protective of the rights of criminal defendants. While Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion that gay and transgender workers are protected by the Civil Rights Act.“So, I think the question before the court is not always a matter of this political ideology that people ascribe to the justices. It is much more a matter of what the question is before the court and how the judges interpret it,” Huberfeld says.",2,2,Voice of America

The idea is that groups of people, sometimes pejoratively referred to as the ""woke mob,"" demand punishment of individuals that offend their sensibilities. Those who decry the existence of ""cancel culture"" do not provide data to prove it is a cultural problem. Instead, they rely on anecdotes of people who are unjustly punished to persuade and outrage the public. These anecdotes have convinced some of the country is most prominent voices — fromSenator Tom Cotton (R-AR)toformer President Barack Obama— that ""cancel culture"" is a real issue. A prototypical anecdote was featured on Tucker Carlson is show on Fox News on June 18. Carlson highlighted the plight of Melissa Rolfe, the stepmother of Garrett Rolfe, the former Atlanta police officer who shot and killed Rayshard Brooks. Carlson told millions of viewers that Rolfe was fired from her job as an HR Director at a mortgage broker because her stepson, a police officer, was charged with murder. Until to day, his stepmother, her name is Melissa Rolfe was the HR Director at a place called Equity Prime Mortgage in Atlanta, Georgia. But to day, she was let go. She is no longer in that role. Apparently, she was fired, and her only crime was being Officer Rolfe is stepmother. According to a source familiar with the matter who spoke to this program, Rolfe was promised that her job was safe. But today she was told, and we are quoting, ""We have to terminate our relationship with you."" No other explanation was offered, and honestly, no other explanation was needed. It was obvious what happened. Rolfe has already been scrubbed from the company is website, wiped away as the Bolsheviks did with those who lost favor with Joseph Stalin. That will keep happening until lawmakers decide to resist the mob and protect ordinary people from its predations. That night, Congressman Doug Collins (R-GA) embraced Rolfe is cause, claiming she was fired for the actions of her stepson. ""The 'Cancel Culture' and political correctness mob must be stopped before it destroys our country,"" Collins said. On June 30, Carlson invited Rolfe to be a guest on the show. She appeared with her lawyer, David Guldenschuh. Carlson asked Rolfe if she knew of any other possible reason for her firing, other than the actions of her stepson:CARLSON: Had you been in trouble with them? Was there any indication that they were going to fire you before you received the message saying you were terminated?ROLFE: Number I had received full support from the President and from my Direct Manager that my job was not in danger. But that does not appear to be the whole story. Adefamation lawsuit filed this week by Rolfe is former employer, Equity Prime Mortgage (EPM), alleges that Rolfe ""repeatedly violated company policy and created an uncomfortable and hostile working environment."" The complaint accuses Rolfe of making hostile, sexual, and ""blatantly racist"" remarks. All of the conduct allegedly took place prior to Garrett Rolfe is shooting. EPM accuses Rolfe and Congressional candidate Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) of organizing a ""smear campaign"" against the company, resulting in ""death threats, a boycott, and enormous reputation al and financial harm to EPM.""If the allegations in the complaint are true, it suggests that Rolfe was exploiting the concept of ""cancel culture"" to cover-up actual wrongdoing. Rolfe did not respond to a request for comment sent to her through her attorney. Another attorney representing Rolfe and Green, Lin Wood, called the allegations against Rolfe in the lawsuit ""damnable lies.""Rolfe claims she was fired because she stood up for her stepson, police officer Garrett Rolfe, who shot and killed Rashard Brooks. But the complaint alleges misconduct that began well before the June 12 shooting. Rolfe started working for EPM in February 2020. EPM says, less than a month later, on March 19, ""Rolfe was reprimanded because she had made inappropriate jokes via text message about conducting rectal temperature checks in the office."" On April 23, ""Rolfe was reprimanded again, this time for referring to employees as “savages,"" according to the complaint. On June 11, Rolfe was reprimanded a third time by EPM CEO Eddie Perez. According to EPM, ""two employees reported Rolfe for calling employees 'fucking bitches,' saying an employee had only been hired because she had 'big boobs,' and making racist comments.”Popular Information obtained a document from EPM memorializing the meeting between Perez and Rolfe. The ""Employee Warning Notice,"" dated June 11, cites Rolfe for ""gross misconduct."" According to that document Rolfe responded by ""saying that she does not see color, but that some people are 'idiots.'"" EPM says that Perez ended the meeting after Rolfe became upset but told her he would continue investigating. The next day, Garrett Rolfe killed Rashard Brooks, and Melissa Rolfe took a paid leave of absence. But according to EPM, the investigation continued, and employees came forward with claims of ""wildly unprofessional and hostile conduct"" by Rolfe, including:Rolfe told an employee that another employee was a “dumb bitch” and that the only reason a man would be interested in her was because she “must suck dick really good.”Rolfe told a Black woman who dates Black men that she needed “to get outside the box and upgrade [her] standards.”""We terminated Ms. Rolfe because, while in the workplace, she repeatedly made inappropriate and hostile comments to and about other EPM employees, which violated company policy, created an uncomfortable working environment, and resulted in a loss of confidence that she could perform her job as an HR director,"" EPM told Popular Information. The lawsuit filed by EPM also names the campaign of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican running for Congress, as a defendant. Greene won the Republican nomination on Tuesday night. She has gained notoriety for her embrace of QAnon, a conspiracy theory that claims liberal Hollywood actors and Democratic politicians are running an international child sex-trafficking ring, and Trump is the only one who can stop them. Facebook has removed several of Greene is advertisements for making violent threats against Black Lives Matter protesters. EPM is lawsuit notes that Greene repeatedly claimed that Rolfe was fired because of the actions of her stepson. The lawsuit alleges that Greene ""coordinated the planting of a false story with Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" but does not provide evidence to support that allegation. Greene has appeared previously on Carlson is show. On August 6, EPM sent Greene and her campaign a letter demanding a retraction. Greene responded by posting again on social media, claiming Melissa Rolfe was fired because she defended her stepson. Do we know why Rolfe was fired? Number That will be determined in a court of law. But we know enough to say the simple story presented on Tucker Carlson was reductive and misleading. It suggests we should be more cautious making broad conclusions about societal trends based on one-sided anecdotes. Another anecdote that has been widely embraced by critics of cancel culture is the firing of David Shor. We are told that Shor, a 28-year-old political data scientist, was fired from his job at Civis Analytics for tweet inga research paper that concluded race riots reduced Democratic turnout in the 1960s. This claim is repeatedagain, andagain, andagain. If Shor was fired for tweeting an academic paper, that seems unfair. But neither Civis Analytics nor Shor, who signed a non-disclosure agreement, has confirmed he was fired for the tweet. ""These rumors are incorrect and unsubstantiated. Civis was founded on the principles of free speech and the pursuit of truth through objective scientific research, and that has not changed. This is an internal personnel matter, and out of respect for our employees and alumni, we will not be commenting further,"" Civis Analytics told The Atlantic. Do we know why Shor was fired? Number But an unconfirmed anecdote is not evidence that our society has been turned upside down. This is important because the concept of ""cancel culture"" is being used to argue that ""protests for racial and social justice"" have gone too far because they have created ""a new set of moral attitudes and political commitments that tend to weaken our norms of open debate and toleration of differences in favor of ideological conformity."" We are told that ""institutional leaders, in a spirit of panicked damage control, are delivering hasty and disproportionate punishments instead of considered reforms.""Many people are treated unfairly. But there is little evidence that unfair treatment is now disproportionately impacting, for example, supporters of the police rather than minority groups. Free speech is a bedrock principle of American democracy. But free speech is not inconsistent with being held accountable for your words and actions.

239,Hurricane forecasters are monitoring two tropical waves far in the Atlantic for possible development,0.67,44.67,https://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/weather/hurricane/fl-ne-two-tropical-waves-20200827-mlxtwvbynzd35b3ut7htse5nfm-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/sun-sentinel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,21,"The fifth hurricane of the 2020 season is likely to form by Wednesday night as Tropical Storm Nana makes its approach toward Belize, the National Hurricane Center said. The storm is forecast track projects that Nana will continue west across the Caribbean Sea, passing near but north of the coast of Honduras on Wednesday. It will likely approach the coast of Belize on Wednesday night and early Thursday, according to the NHC is public advisory. Nana is expected to make landfall over Belize as a Category 1 hurricane, and wind shear is expected to limit its intensity, according to a forecast discussion. Nana, the season is 14th tropical storm, formed Tuesday about 120 miles south-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica. As of 8 a.m., Nana was about 150 miles northeast of Limon, Honduras, moving west at 18 mph with top winds of 60. A Category 1 hurricane forms when sustained winds are in the range of 74 to 95 mph. Tropical storm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles from Nana is center, the hurricane center said. Northern Honduras and coastal Guatemala are under a tropical storm watch, the southern Yucatan Peninsula is under a tropical storm warning, and the entire coast of Belize is under a tropical storm warning and a hurricane watch. There have been four hurricanes so far in this busy Atlantic season: Hanna, Isais, Laura and Marco. Laura was the season is first major hurricane, making landfall in Cameron, La., as a Category 4 on August 27. Hanna, Isias and Marco were Category 1 hurricanes that made landfall in Padre Island, Texas; Ocean Isle Beach, NC; and at the mouth of the Mississippi River, respectively. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Omar is weakening over the open Atlantic. Omar, the season is 15th tropical storm, formed about 225 miles east of Cape Hatteras, NC, on Tuesday, about five hours after Nana, according to the NHC Tropical Storm Omar was about 350 miles northwest of Bermuda, the NHC said Wednesday in its 5 a.m. advisory. It was moving east-northeast at 14 mph, with 40 mph winds and higher gusts. It is not expected to strengthen much and it is likely to significantly weaken throughout the day on Thursday, becoming a remnant low by Thursday night, the NHC said in its outlook. The system is expected to continue its curve away from land, moving in a northeast to eastward motion off the US East Coast. An area of the Atlantic midway between the Windward Islands and the west coast of Africa is bustling with activity from two tropical waves. One is an area of low pressure with showers and thunderstorms that is slowly becoming better organized, the hurricane center said. The other is expected to move off the coast of Africa on Wednesday and merge with a disturbance a couple hundred miles southeast of the Cabo Verde Islands, the hurricane center said. If and when the disturbances merge, the system will develop and could become a tropical depression by the weekend as it moves slowly westward over the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean. This is the time of year when storms tend to form in the open Atlantic, particularly near the Cabo Verde Islands. Those storms, which grow in size and intensity as they make the long trek westward across the Atlantic Ocean, are historically the most powerful and destructive hurricanes. The remaining monikers for named storms this season in the Atlantic are: Paulette, Rene, Sally, Teddy, Vicky and Wilfred. In August, the federal government issued an updated forecast for the season,predicting as many as 25 storms, which is more than the agency has ever forecast. The tropical weather experts at Colorado State University predicted that 2020 could possibly be the second-busiest season on record, behind only 2005, the year that produced Katrina and Wilma.",2,2,Sun Sentinel

Biden was bullish on his prospects as he addressed the nation Wednesday afternoon, saying “it is clear that we are winning enough states to win 270 electoral votes” even as the Trump campaign mounted legal challenges to the vote counts in several states.“I am not here to declare that we won,” Biden said in his remarks. “But I am here to report when the count is finished, we believe we will be the winners.”Biden also claimed he was on track to “win more votes than any” presidential ticket in the nation is history.“Only three presidential campaigns in the past have defeated an incumbent president,” Biden, who served two terms under former President Barack Obama, said. “When it is finished, God willing, we will be the fourth.”The Associated Press called Wisconsin for Biden at 2:16 p.m., putting a state Trump won in 2016 in the Democrat is column and edging him closer to 270 electoral votes. At 6 p.m., the AP called Michigan for Biden. But the Trump campaign said earlier Wednesday it would ask for a recount in Wisconsin, where Biden was up by a little more than 20,000 votes early in the afternoon. In Wisconsin, candidates can request a recount if the margin is less than 1%. Trump won the state by fewer than 23,000 votes in 2016.“Wisconsin has been a razor thin race as we always knew that it would be. There have been reports of irregularities in several Wisconsin counties which raise serious doubts about the validity of the results,” Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien said in a statement. “The President is well within the threshold to request a recount and we will immediately do so.”The Trump campaign said it would file suit in Michigan to halt ballot counting until “meaningful access” is granted to “numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process.”His campaign also said it is “moving to intervene” in an existing case before the US Supreme Court over Pennsylvania is extended deadline that allows mail-in ballots to be accepted through Friday as long as they were postmarked by November 3. And the president is re-election campaign is suing to temporarily stop the vote count in Pennsylvania over claims of “transparency” issues. Stepien said in an afternoon press call that the campaign had “a high degree of confidence” that Trump would prevail in Pennsylvania.“In fact, we are declaring a victory in Pennsylvania,” Stepien said, even though the AP and major news networks have not called yet called the race. Earlier in the day, Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon projected confidence about Biden is chances in most of the remaining swing states after the former vice president flipped Arizona and one of Nebraska is congressional districts from Trump, according to the AP.“Joe Biden is on track to win this election and he will be the next president of the USs,” O’Malley Dillon said in a briefing with reporters late Wednesday morning. “We believe we are on a clear path to victory. By this afternoon, we expect the vice president will have leads in states that put him over 270 electoral votes.”A handful of battlegrounds remained in play as ballot counting wore on Wednesday. Even as the AP called Wisconsin for Biden, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia remained up for grabs, and the Trump campaign pushed back on Arizona being called for the Democrat. The Biden campaign said it expects to “win” Nevada, Michigan and Pennsylvania, while O’Malley Dillon listed Georgia as a “toss-up” and said North Carolina was currently leaning toward Trump. Stepien, the Trump campaign manager, offered a different view of the map during a press call Wednesday morning as officials said they are “confident” in the president is paths to re-election. Stepien said Trump is “in a very good position” — showing restraint just hours after the president addressed supporters and the nation from the White House in the wee hours Wednesday and said, “Frankly, we did win this election.”“If we count the legal ballots, the president wins,” Stepien said. But O’Malley Dillon countered, “If Donald Trump got his wish and we stopped counting ballots right now, Joe Biden would be the next president of the USs.”After losing several swing states the campaign had made plays for, including Florida, Texas and Ohio, O’Malley Dillon said, “We did not believe the race was in that wide margin we were seeing in the national polling numbers.”She said the campaign “definitely saw a number of states become more in play than we had even anticipated. Obviously some of those went to Trump. But those are swing states, so we are not surprised.”O’Malley Dillon said the former vice president would likely address the nation sometime later Wednesday. Millions of ballots remained outstanding in Pennsylvania late Wednesday morning, where Governor Tom Wolf said, “We may not know the results even to day, but the most important thing is that we have accurate results, again, even if that takes a little longer than we are used to.”Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson said in a press conference “we hope” the first unofficial tabulation “will come sometime within the next 24 hours” as ballots remain outstanding in major population centers. Massachusetts GOP Governor Charlie Baker, who “blanked” his presidential ballot, released a statement with Lt. Governor Karyn Polito Wednesday morning needling the president as they called for “every vote to be counted.”“Every American, regardless of political affiliation, especially the President and every candidate on the ballot, should be united in supporting this process,” the Republican leaders wrote, adding, “When the results are finally determined, we are hopeful that all candidates, especially the two running for the most powerful office in the world, set aside partisanship to improve the lives of all Americans.”",2,1,Boston Herald
241,Can Hierarchy Be Justified?,-33.0,29.0,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/08/can-hierarchy-be-justified,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,25,"The history of all hitherto existing societies is the history of some assholes telling everyone else what to do. There are people “at the to p,” who rule, and there are people “at the bottom” who have to clean up those people is shit. The people at the top always come up with some reason why they deserve to be at the to p. Their powers were bestowed by a divinity. They have the correct blood. They worked the hardest. They are Great Innovators whose wisdom and creativity is the source of all wealth. They are Atlas carrying the whole world on their backs, and if they disappeared, society would fall apart. All of these justifications, needless to say, are myths. They are exactly what you say if you were a person in charge who did not want to feel any guilt. And nobody wants to feel like a bad person, even the assholes giving the orders, so they need to come up with some picture of reality in which they are right for reasons beyond their might. As Max Weber put it,rightto his good fortune. He wants to be convinced he ‘deserves’ it and above all that he deserves it in comparison with others… Good fortune thus wants to be legitimate fortune.”There are a million stories you can tell to legitimize your status, using everything from cranial science to graphs showing a strong statistical correlation between “you having all the power” and some imaginary measure of social well-being (e.g. “GDP”). The explanations do not have to be very convincing, because one of the nice things about being in charge is that few people in your circle will dare to call you out when you are talking rubbish. Some people will be afraid to get on your bad side, while others will be looking to flatter you into dispensing favor. But hardly anyone is going to rudely pop the sycophancy bubble by pointing out that your rationalizations for having more than everybody else are blatantly fallacious. For instance, King James, of Bible fame, anonymously published a book in 1598 called the which laid out what seemed to him like a sound argument for the Divine Right of Kings. He argued that “the state of monarchy is the supremest thing upon earth” because kings are “God is lieutenants upon earth and sit upon God is throne,” and thus, while “a good king will frame all his actions to be according to the Law; yet is he not bound the reto but of his good will.” The relationship of the king to the people was, James thought, like that of the head to the body, and he pointed out that while sometimes we cut off a limb here and there if it gets gangrenous and unruly, few diseases lead us to cut off our heads:The phrase “motivated reasoning” comes to mind when considering James’ treatise arguing in favor of his own absolute power and exemption from the law. The British people were evidently not persuaded, as James’ successor Charles I was indeed treated as an infirmity curable by the removal of the head. But the king was not the only one with a fixed position in the hierarchy. A Great Chain of Being ordered all matter, living and nonliving, from top to bottom. God, of course, was the Supreme Being. Next came angels, but all angels were not created equal, and there was a hierarchy of sub-angels; St. Thomas Aquinasdivides them into 9 “choirs”: “angels, archangels, virtues, powers, principalities, dominations, op h anim [alias thrones], cherubim, and seraphim.” After the angelic choirs came the humans, where kings stood highest, followed by princes, nobles, etc., with peasants taking their place at the bottom. The other animals followed us, and had their own rankings of greatest to least, with immobile do-nothing creatures like oysters at the bottom. (There were sub-categories within sub-categories, with worm-eating birds the superior of seed-eating birds, possibly due to winning a worm-eating bet.) Plants and vegetables followed animals, in a descending order from oak trees to moss. Lowest of all were the minerals, which had their own ranking from gemstones down to soil, dust, and sand. All of this may sound rather risible, but before we laugh, we should reflect on just how much of this mindset we have retained into the present day. Animals are still considered lesser beings, most of whom can simply be slaughtered at will, without any moral calculus whatsoever. Factory farming, despite the scale of suffering it inflicts, does not trouble most people is consciences enough tos pend much time thinking about it. And the hierarchical orderings of human societies are still so accepted as to seem like natural law. 44 countries are still outright monarchies, but even the Chief Executive of the supposedly democratic USs is endowed with such huge power that most of our political discourse seems to revolve around a single person is conduct. Workplacesare often strict hierarchies, the justice and propriety of which cannot be questioned by those at the bottom, even though the justifications for the difference in power betweenJeff Bezosand Amazon fulfillment center workers are little more persuasive that appeals to the Great Chain of Being. Anarchist thinkers have always put “hierarchy” at the center of their diagnosis of what is wrong with everything, because so much of what is unjust about every society does seem to boil down to this one simple fact: there are some people who give the orders, and some people who have to take the orders, and the people who give the orders are generally cruel, stupid, and/or greedy. Sometimes they got their position by birth, but even when they got it by “merit,” the main “merit” that usually distinguishes them is that they were more willing to trample on everybody else. Noam Chomsky describes the core of anarchist thinking as being based around a “presumption of illegitimacy” toward hierarchies, a principle that says if a hierarchy is based on tradition rather than reason, it needs to be gotten rid of:Peter Kropotkin, too, put hierarchy at the center of his analysis, saying that anarchism meant “refusing hierarchical organization” and authority, while embracing cooperative social customs:Hierarchy is common to bad governments, bad workplaces, bad relationships, and bad schools. When we look at societies throughout history and feel disturbed, the reason is usually something to do with hierarchy: some people were priests doing human sacrifices, while other people had to the sacrifices. In our own country, some people have been slaves, others masters. Some people have been prisoners, others cops. Some are “non-citizens,” without basic rights, others are “citizens” who are Legitimate People. (Yes, the distinction between the citizens and non citizens should be thought of as a formal caste system, whereby some people are more entitled to rights than others. It is only because we are used to it that we do not comprehend how appalling it is to divide society into a hierarchy of “non-people” and “people” based solely on where they happened to be born.)Wherever you find distinctive ranked orders of social status, and some people with vastly more power and liberty than others, you find a situation that should be revolting to anyone who cares about universal justice. (That is, revolting to the sort of person who wants to be served by our social arrangements, rather than having categories of “winners” and “losers.”) A truly just world has to be a democratic and egalitarian one, where hierarchies are minimized. But is there a casehierarchy? According to a new book from the Princeton University Press (which previously brought you such elitist classics asAgainst Democracy), there is indeed. Just Hierarchyby Daniel A Bell and Wang Pei argues that while explicit racial and gender hierarchies may be bad, some hierarchies are Actually Good and worth preserving. Bell and Pei believe that hierarchy as a concept has been unfairly maligned, and they seek to show that there are circumstances in which it is not only morally unobjectionable, but “can and should govern different spheres of our social lives… including our relations with loved ones.”Bell and Wang list five kinds of hierarchies they seek to defend: hierarchies within intimate social circles, hierarchies amongst citizens, hierarchies of nations, hierarchies amongst animals, and hierarchies between human beings and robots. (We will note the curious absence of workplace hierarchies from this list: beyond a brief discussion of the relationship between employers and their nannies and housekeepers, the book does not discuss this topic at all, even though the workplace, for many people, is where petty tyranny is most keenly experienced.)Each subset of hierarchies is defended with different arguments. Hierarchies amongst “intimate persons”—that is, in relationships between partners, between parents and children, and between employers and domestics—are viewed as morally acceptable by Bell and Wang so long as there is some changing of roles over time. This would suggest something quite radical in the case of domestic workers—namely that the rich would have to take care of their nannies’ children sometimes—but Bell and Wang wriggle out of this by saying that this reciprocity “may be asking too much of the employer.” Instead, the only actual “changing of roles over time” they envision is generational: perhaps the housekeepers’ children will be rich and the rich people is children will end up housekeepers. (Extremely unlikely, but a good way for the rich to reassure the mselves that the hierarchy is fair.) Their ultimate conclusion is that it is fine to have a full-time housekeeper—who, notably, does not get to keep their children in the same house with your children—so long as you pay them well. Bell and Wang have a difficult time explaining why hierarchies within households are actually compared to the alternative of rough social equality. In the sphere of “intimate persons,” the justification for “hierarchy between partners” seems to boil down, laughably, to “it is cool to periodically switch who is on top during sex” (which sure, fine, maybe that is the kind of entry-level sex advice that people who read political science textbooks desperately need to hear), while the justification for the hierarchy between parents and children is based on the observation that elderly people are more appreciated in societies where elders are owed deference within the family structure. The authors seem unable to grapple with the fact that “hierarchy,” fundamentally, is about the right to command obedience from others by simple virtue of one is social role. That family members should appreciate each other, listen to each other, and divide difficult tasks fairly amongst the mselves is an obvious good, but why these characteristics should be optimally actuated by “hierarchy”—by investing certain people with some specific right of command, even a temporary one, over their loved ones—is not really explained. At best, hierarchy seems like a very roundabout manner of promoting warm familial feeling, and, at worst, a great way to keep people guiltily obligated to family members who don ot respect them. Meanwhile, although their examination of “hierarchy amongst citizens” emanates (by the admission of the authors, who are both professors at universities in China) from a specifically Chinese context—drawing on the “Confucian” principles of imperial Chinese bureaucracy and modern Chinese administration—it is nonetheless pretty much indistinguishable from the arguments in favor of meritocracy that are made by centrist commentators in the USs. The authors argue explicitly against democracy and in favor of governance by unelected experts. (Bell has written a separate book called defending the enlightened despotism of the Communist Party as superior to liberal democracy.) Too much democracy leads to populism, which is bad (cf. Donald Trump), hierarchical meritocracies are better because—once you get past pesky little problems like “nepotism” and “corruption”—they elevate people with talent and expertise, who are temperamentally suited for public life. Bell and Wang concede that this framework does exclude most human beings from formal political participation in decisions that affect them. But since the decisions that will be made on their behalf will be good ones, because wise rulers naturally know what they are doing, this will not matter. The authors suggest that people is resulting sense of disenfranchisement can be combated through a) grassroots efforts to influence policymakers through suasion, and b) encouraging people to feel fulfilled by “non-political” things, such as pictures of cute dogs exchanged on social media. (We shit you not, this was the actual example they used. There is even a photograph of a cute dog reprinted in the book, as an example of the sort of thing we can look at to distract ourselves from our political powerlessness.) Here, as opposed to Bell and Wang is flimsy justifications for hierarchy in the home, it is a little bit more obvious why the idea of hierarchy amongst citizens is at least, in a patronizing sort of way. Whowould notwant to sit around looking at pictures of animals all day while a group of highly virtuous public servants ingeniously and invisibly disposes of all boring policy matters?The only problem, of course, is that it is ludicrous: these Virtuous Policy Fairies do not exist in reality, and so what is in fact being proposed is not even a hierarchy between “good bureaucrats” and “indulged masses,” but fundamentally unchecked power in the hands of the sort of people who excel at standardized tests and subtle self-promotion. Hierarchy amongst nations—the third of the supposedly justified hierarchies—evidently involves major world powers politely paying “lip-service” to the sovereignty of smaller nations, while gradually drawing those smaller nations into their direct sphere of influence and control through the use of diplomacy and social ritual. This, Bell and Wang argue, is morally justified so long as there is some meaningful reciprocity and fellow-feeling in the relationship between the stronger and weaker nations. There is of course a strong element of “might makes right” here—big, powerful countries may justly rule because they are big and powerful. The recurring pattern we begin to see, in these justifications of hierarchy, is that the “morality” of these hierarchies relies heavily on the notion that the person or decision-making entity in the higher hierarchical position will not be incompetent, thoughtless, or sociopathic, but suggests no actual mechanisms for ensuring that this is the case. Like King James, they say that these hierarchical arrangements will be good for the least well-off, but also like King James the argument is less based on appeals to evidence than appeals to tradition and religious text (in his case, Biblical authority, in Bell and Wang is case, frequently Confucian ethics). The sections of the book on animals and robots are significantly weirder, which is saying something for a book that has already used sex positions as a philosophical justification for social dominance. The animals chapter aims to show that animals and humans are not moral equals and that there is a hierarchy of concern for different animals:It is not clear with whom Bell and Wang are arguing here, since few people (even among radical animal rights advocates) see killing a mosquito as equivalent to killing a human being, and distinguishing between animals on the basis of their capacity to suffer is broadly uncontroversial (though the deprioritization of “ugly” animals is obviously more questionable). Bell and Wang present a multi-page anecdote about the time Bell adopted a cat that ended up jumping out of a 22nd story window, after which he subsequently replaced the dead cat with another, which had diabetes, as part of an argument that people are morally permitted to regulate their pets’ activities so long as they treat them well—which is, again, a fairly widely-held position. But the re is a reason Bell and Wang include this strange chapter: by offering rigorous argumentation for a widely-accepted kind of “hierarchy,” they want readers to think that a general principle of hierarchy is justified. In other words, if we can show that people accept the “humans over animals” part of the Great Chain of Being, it will be easier to get them to accept the “humans over other humans” part. The robots chapter, similarly, argues for a hierarchy most people would agree with: that of humans over machines. Bell and Wang make the case that artificial intelligence should be made to serve human ends, rather than human beings being made to serve artificial intelligence. Then things take a turn: they suggest that the Chinese government alone is correct in its understanding of the purposes of artificial intelligence, that it is building a post-scarcity kind of communism in which robots will do all the labor. By contrast, Silicon Valley capitalists are reckless in their development of new technology: “the libertarian culture of Silicon Valley militates against any serious attempt to curb research that threatens to develop… malevolent AI.” The final sentence of the book (it has no formal “conclusion”) is: “If we are unlucky, the last war involving humans will be a clash between the Chinese Communist Party and Google is unfriendly creation, and for the sake of humanity we need to pray for the victory of the CCP.”Thus, the book does not necessarily offer the best material for inquiring into the question of when hierarchies are just, for there are parts that make one suspect it is mainly intended as an elaborate apologia for the Chinese Communist Party, published, again, by the Princeton University Press. (Possibly, we should have abandoned our review of this book once we realized how bizarre it was, but by that point we simply could not tear ourselves away.) Many of the hierarchies the book defends are China-specific, and the writing can be digressive and the examples off-the-wall. Most of the evidence provided is laughably unsound. For instance, the authors note that in a study, “an abstract diagram representing hierarchy was memorized more quickly than a diagram representing equality, and the faster processing led the participants to prefer the hierarchy diagram.” This might be a compelling case for the aesthetic superiority of pyramids over lines, but it has very little to do with justice, ostensibly the subject of the book. Bell and Wang also say that “the populist backlashes against elites empower strongmen such as Donald Trump” thus showing that “the effort to combat all forms of hierarchy will not only fail; it may lead to something worse from a moral point of view.” But surely if the backlash is against “elites,” what we have is an argumentagainsthierarchy; without a division into elite/non-elite, there is no grounds for a populist backlash to begin with. If people are resentful of “elites” who are above them and control the m, the n a more egalitarian society would help reduce resentments. If we are evaluating the main question, though, which is “have these five hierarchies been justified?” the answers would seem to be: 1) hierarchy between intimates—no, not at all, because sex positions do not legitimize the giving of commands to family and domestics; 2) hierarchy between citizens—also no, seems like a recipe for an unjust dictatorship; 3) hierarchy between nations—no, seems like proof by assertion; 4) hierarchy between humans and animals—sure, bugs are not people; 5) hierarchy between humans and robots—sure, but not so sure we can sign onto VICTORY TO THE GREAT CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY as a valid ultimate conclusion. So how we evaluate what the legitimate and illegitimate hierarchies are? It seems easy to say that there should be no “intimate hierarchies”: friends, partners, and family members should meet each other on equal footing, and should give and expect mutual respect as individuals. Trying to treat other people well is a dynamic struggle, and one always littered with daily failures. Hierarchical relationships and pre-assigned roles within households are not a realistic shortcut for avoiding these inevitable difficulties. That is not to say that people do not fall into patterns or roles in their close relationships, but this seems like something that people should figure out one-on-one with their loved ones, according to their needs and temperaments. (To the extent that “respectfully figuring out relationship roles on a case-by-case basis” is what Wang and Bell mean by “intimate hierarchy,” this does not really seem like a hierarchy at all, in the way the term is conventionally understood.) As leftists, we can also say with some confidence that global hierarchies in which wealthier states exercise authority over poorer client states are normatively bad, although it is much less clear how to stop that from happening (short of a revolution for disarmament and global labor reform, of course). But when thinking about smaller political units—workplaces, neighborhoods, municipalities, states and provinces, perhaps countries—the question of whether hierarchies are “good” or “bad” does start to feel more muddled. Certainly, there should be a high burden to justify the existence of hierarchies, which inherently involve one person having power over another, or over many others; certainly, bland appeals to tradition are not sufficient justification. But even if you are an absolute egalitarian, practically speaking, the re is a lot of shit going on in the world at any given time, and it simply is not possible to hold referenda on absolutely. The idea of a hierarchical system that elevates the most talented and trustworthy people to decision-making positions is one that many people find deeply attractive, and in the USs, we have often conceived of electoral democracy as the best way to achieve this end. In the US conception of political “meritocracy,” the general theory is to elect political leaders with the right “vision” or “values,” whom we the n trust to surround the mselves with people of appropriate “expertise.” Of course, as we all know, this frequently goes horribly wrong: the pool of candidates that voters choose amongst, and the pool of experts from which those candidates the n choose their advisors, staff, and other appointees, are both shaped by a whole host of factors that have nothing to do with goodness or talent, and a lot more to do with things like wealth, ambition, and luck. Elections produce better results on average than pure nepotism because they contain some limited element of randomness—the system undergoes a shake-up at fixed periods during which new people, potentially, can enter. But in this country, elections still have not managed to produce governments on the national or state level that resemble the composition of the general population in any way: lawmakers and executives are mostly rich (as well as mostly white, and mostly male), and their choice of expert staff reflects their own interests and biases. In this way, our governing hierarchies are static in form and also frequently static in content. Some people, admittedly, think that this is a feature, not a bug: the “steady hand at the wheel.” But if climate change, vast economic inequality, mass incarceration, and a precarious, unfranchised immigrant population sound like a bad status quo, the n these stable hierarchies in which power is always concentrated in the hands of the sam eof person, over and over, are clearly harmful. One way around this problem is to dismantle the hierarchy itself as much as possible, and create processes for participatory decision-making that involve the people affected by a given problem. However, the re is always a problem of scale: as the number of people affected by a single policy or decision becomes larger, direct participation becomes more and more unwieldy. In that case, to the extent we think that some decisions do need to be made at such a scale, it may be hard to get around having some hierarchy of decision-makers. Staffing these arguably necessary hierarchies through non-electoral “meritocracies,” as Bell and Wang suggest, means reposing a naïve level of trust in the goodness of unaccountable bureaucrats; but we also concede that elections (of nominal decision-makers, who the n choose bureaucrats that are accountable only to them) tend to not produce brilliant results, either. A third option, which we submit to be the least of these three evils, is to make the appointment of decision-makers as random as possible, with a strictly fixed term limit. We have previously written about “sortition”—random selection by lot—from the general population as being the best conceivable way to create a demographically representative senate, one that is slightly less susceptible to monied interests than previous elected senates. In the same way, sortition could be used to fill a variety of decision-making positions. But one reason hierarchy is so enduringly appealing is that the creation of effective non-hierarchical institutions is incredibly difficult, and even institutions that start off being egalitarian have a tendency to turn hierarchical over time (the sociological concept of the “iron law of oligarchy” is that an oligarchy always emerges no matter how much you try to do to prevent an oligarchy emerging). Occupy Wall Street, which operated on an anti-hierarchical structure, was in many ways phenomenally successful in the face of extraordinary state challenges and repression, but also struggled with the difficulty of trying to organize without leadership. Many of the internal disputes that have riven the left, like the conflict between Marxists and anarchists, have involved arguments over the legitimacy of hierarchy, and whether it is possible or desirable to pursue the socialist project without it. Yet while hierarchy is an enduring feature of societies, and it is not yet possible to envision a perfectly non-hierarchical world, a fair starting point is to treat social hierarchies as presumptively illegitimate. If we now recognize that King James was full of shit when he claimed a divine right to be exempt from the law, we should suspect that there are plenty of justifications for hierarchy in our own time that might fall apart under scrutiny. Bell and Wang is weird-ass book shows how empty many of the justifications for hierarchy are; they often come down to “the boss is the boss because he is the boss, do you think you could do a better job than the boss?” Hierarchical social orders are asserted to be superior without any examination of what the non-hierarchical alternative would look like, or much evidence (beyond anecdotes and a generalized terror of “the mob”) that such an alternative would be less functional. The hypothesis we should work under is that hierarchies tend to be great for people endowed with the power to give the commands, and less great for those whose job is to obey. The elimination of hierarchy would tend to improve the lot of the vast majority of us, but especially the millions of human “minerals” at the bottom of our present-day Great Chain of Being.",0,1,Current Affairs

I’d really hoped that at some point during the ceremony,Barack Obamahad stood up to speak, taking the mi c in hand as sometimes he liked to do. I wanted to hear him say, in his studied faux “urban” way: “My fellow Americans, the re is something I have wanted to share with you for eight long years. I think now is at last the moment.” He’d pull out a piece of yellowed paper, a government document. “You see this? It is myGood luck sortingthatout. Peace out!” Then he’d drop the microphone and saunter off stage, cackling to himself. So he would never have been constitutionally eligible for election. Had he ever really been president? American lawyers would have billed tens of millions of hours figuring out whether or not the laws he’d signed, theSupreme Courtappointees he’d picked, were in fact legitimate. Or would we need an eight-year “do-over”? That part would have been fun. The reason I can joke about the “birther” business is that it was never serious. Hillary Clinton isteam had disseminated or concocted it during the primaries, and a few Republicans grabbed it. But the Democrats never saw it as a serious threat, for lack of evidence. Most Republicans treated it as a ridiculous distraction. (Trump, by contrast, talked it up — primarily I think as a cynical way to attract a following. It worked.) So while a few race-hustlers tried to cast it as “racist” (in which case Hillary is team was racist), most people dismissed it. I used to joke about it, precisely because I knew it was not real. So did Obama himself. He laughed the “birther” story off because he considered it baseless. He took office in 2009 without a shadow of genuine doubt over his legitimacy. Yes, a lot of us felt like he was un-American, but not because of his race or his (rumored) birthplace. We felt that way because his politics were rooted inpost-colonialMarxist resentment. Because his long-time spiritual mentor (who performed his wedding and baptized his children) had said “God DAMN America!” (Here is newly “elected” senator Raphael Warnock of Georgiapraising that Jeremiah Wright speech.) And because he promised to “fundamentally transform” America. Which we did not think needed a sex change, as he did. Birtherism was a falsehood. But it encapsulated politics which were all too real. We saw them arise again in the attack on our nation is public monuments, and the deadly 2020 riots Democrats (almost to a man) excused or endorsed. You know what Obama did not do in 2009? What no Democrats did? There follows a list of measures the Democrats did not take in the build-up to Obama is inauguration:If the Democrats and their allies had done all those things and more, you know what we might have concluded? That there really was something to “Birthergate.” Why else were the Dems acting like a bunch of twitchy Mafiosi, shredding documents and running in circles at the first sight ofRudy Giuliani? That is not how innocent people and organizations act. So why are leftist elites so panicked about election 2020? Why are they treating the breach of the US Capitol like the 1933 Reichstag Fire, and effectively trying to crush any opposition and suspend the Constitution?The Democrats in 2008 did not try to block any legal scrutiny over Obama is place of birth, the n to disbar the lawyers who’d sued them. They did not use all their power to “cancel” and personally destroy those who spread the claim that Obama was born in Kenya. They simply provided what documents they had, and shrugged, with apparently clean consciences, at further doubts. From that fact alone, more than anything else, I personally came to believe them. That is not how they are acting now. The way Democrats (and weak-kneed NeverTrumpsurrender monkeys) have behaved since the 2020 vote tells a very different story. What it tells me, most crucially, is this: The Democrats cheated, know they cheated, and by it gained one-party rule in America. Our elites, including the media, know this too. But they are glad it happened. Anything, anything, to kick Orange Man to the curb. And to silence the Deplorable half of the country that supports him. AND to put everyone on notice thatThe Hivewill never tolerate a serious threat to its power again. The Democrats fully intend to cheat again next time — two years from now in Congress, the n four years from now for the White House. And they want to pre-emptively cow and silence anyone who dares to question their cheating. (“NiceIvy League degree you got there. Be a real shame if something happened to it.”)For decades Democrats dismissed any efforts at ballot security as evidence of “racism.” Now they can also call it “dangerous,” an “incitement to riot.” Some even will dare call it “treason.”If following the procedures in the Constitution for validating elections be treason, the n let is make the most of it. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich certainly is. He is not backing down under The Hive is concerted pressure. Goread his latestatThe key takeaway is here:Officials in virtually every swing state broke their states’ own laws to send out millions of ballots or ballot applications to every registered voter. It was all clearly documented in the Texas lawsuit, which was declined by the US Supreme Court based on Texas’ procedural standing — not the merits of the case. That is the election. In addition, it is clear that virtually every swing state essentially suspended normal requirements for verifying absentee ballots. Rejection rates were an order of magnitude lower than in a normal year. In Georgia, rejection rates dropped from 6.5% in 2016 to 0.2% in 2020. In Pennsylvania, it went from 1% in 2016 to .003% in 2020. Nevada fell from 1.6% to .75%. There is no plausible explanation other than that they were counting a huge number of ballots — disproportionately for Mr. Biden — that normally would not have passed muster. That is the election. So by all means enjoy the mock-inauguration of a corrupt, senile hack as the fruit of ballot-box stuffing and fake COVID panic. But remember that now we all live in a tinpotBananas Republic.

Oh, it is both of those things, but there are states that are much more conservative and much more pro-gun. Despite that, though, Texas has a reputation. Another part of that reputation is a love of law and order. They like their lawmen there. Lawmen are part of the mystique of the Old West, a mystique that Texas has embraced completely. Defunding the police is never going to fly there. Of course, that is not to say that Democrats would have fared any better without socialism or “defund the police” rhetoric.

But from resisting racist exclusion to building CIO unions in the 1930s, Mexican American workers have been central to left-wing politics in the USs. Workers Alliance leader Emma Tenayuca speaks to a crowd outside San Antonio City Hall, March 8, 1937. (UTSA Special Collections)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. On January 29, 1911, a coalition of Mexican revolutionaries and members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a US-based anti-capitalist labor union, crossed the border between California and the Mexican state of Baja California to launch what would come to be known as the Baja Insurrection. Many of the Mexicans belonged to the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM), which had announced its intentions of toppling Mexican dictator Porfirio Díaz, transferring the ownership of factories to their workers, and returning lands to Indigenous communities. Driven from Mexico to the USs by Díaz, the PLM had found solidarity with the IWW, which similarly advocated for workers’ control of production. Growing from a small band of less than two dozen revolutionaries to hundreds of PLM members, their supporters (including Indigenous tribespeople), and IWW members, the insurrectionists seized the towns of Mexicali, Algodones, Tecate, and Tijuana, opening an early northwestern front in the Mexican Revolution. The insurrectionaries were supported by arms and funds from US radicals, including the Socialist Party — which, combined with the prospect of thousands of US-based Mexicans joining the revolution, pushed president William Taft to act. Twenty thousand US troops sealed the border, while the US Navy secured access to ports in Baja California for Díaz is forces. The insurrectionists held out for six months, but, without any means of reinforcing or resupplying the mselves, ultimately quit the campaign. Some of them subsequently flocked to the banner of Francisco Madero, a centrist, US-backed opponent of Díaz, but those who had crossed the border were summarily arrested by US authorities for violating neutrality laws. While short-lived, the Baja Insurrection illustrates many of the characteristics that define the historic role of Mexicans in the US left: radical, transnational, and often targeted for steep government repression. Jacobincontributor Arvind Dilawar recently spoke with Justin Akers Chacón about his book on the history of transnational Mexican working-class struggle,Radicals in the Barrio, about how participants in the Mexican Revolution brought their experiences to the early US labor and civil rights movements, and the vital position that women occupied in Mexican radicalism. Their conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity. How would you define the barrio? What role did the USs play in creating the barrio both stateside and in Mexico?Barrios, within the context of early twentieth-century US history, refer to the formation of Mexican working-class communities that developed along migration corridors and in proximity to capitalist industries, particularly agriculture, mining complexes, railroad hubs, fisheries, and factories. Along the California coast, for instance, you have barrios dotting the road map of the multi billion dollar harvest corridor that stretches from the Imperial Valley [in southeastern California] to the San Joaquin Valley [part of the Central Valley]. Others took shape or expanded in proximity to fisheries and canneries (San Diego), near garment factories (Los Angeles, Dallas) and railroad hubs (South Texas, Chicago), and near the Cotton Belt in Texas (San Antonio). Historic Mexican barrios have stretched from Arizona mining towns to the Yakima Valley in Washington State, east across Colorado is hard and soft rock mining regions, near the sugar beet farm complexes spanning the Great Plains states, and into the environs of Chicago is transcontinental rail yards and beyond. Some of the oldest barrios in the contemporary Southwest actually predate US conquest and colonization. For instance, San Diego was established as a Spanish Catholic missionary project through the forceful colonization and attempted conversion of the original Indigenous Kumeyaay people beginning in 1769, and Los Angeles was founded as a land-grant concession to Mexican migrants (mostly Indigenous and African-descendent people from Mexico City) by the Spanish Colonial government in 1781. It is impossible to understand barrio formation without understanding the long and sordid history of US colonialism and imperialism in what is today the southwestern USs, especially in the second half of the nineteenth century. The US invasion of Indigenous and Mexican lands began with the uprising of slave holders in Coahuila y Tejas in 1835 and was followed in 1846 by full-scale military invasion. This opened up a period of more than half a century of conquest and settler-colonialism across the West and Southwest. Conquest the n continued in the form of economic imperialism, through which US capitalists exported vast stocks of capital and consolidated control over much of the Mexican economy. This induced widespread social and economic displacement within Mexico, as the exploitation and sale of Mexico is vast natural resources were repatriated as profits for US investors. This transformation of Mexico into a resource colony of the USs pushed over a million displaced Mexican people to migrate north over the first three decades of the twentieth century alone. US economic domination and political and military meddling was entrenched by the turn of the century, and the US state played kingmaker in Mexican politics, backed by US Marines. These factors contributed to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910. After the US invaded Mexico in 1846 and annexed its northern half in 1848 — to day is Southwest — the federal and state governments treated the conquered inhabitants the same way as it did other Indigenous peoples in the path of settler-colonialism: through violent dispossession from the land, disenfranchisement from the political system, and racialized proletarianization and segregation. Barrio, which means “neighborhood” in Spanish, now meant something different: poverty and underdevelopment. Indigenous people were forced onto reservations and Mexicans could only live within racially restricted neighborhoods that were systematically impoverished and marginalized, excluded from civil and political participation, and brutally over-policed to keep people subjugated. How did Mexican radicals fuse Indigenous traditions with European ideologies to arrive at their own unique politics? How did those politics differentiate Mexican radicals from their Anglo counterparts?Many radicals operating within Mexican territory in the early twentieth century were Indigenous people or had Indigenous roots, with ties and networks connecting to Indigenous communities. One cannot fully understand Mexican history — especially the deep-rooted resistance of the people and episodes of rebellion and revolution — without identifying the centrality of Indigenous people within that history. Indigenous communities resisted the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz in Mexico over its four-decade span (1876–1910), especially when the government began to sell off large swathes of their communal and ancestral lands to foreign investors in the 1880s as part of its drive to build Mexican capitalism following the US model. By the early 1900s, Indigenous radicals from different groups across the country had joined (and formed a large part of the ranks of) the proto-socialist movement founded in 1901 as the Partido Liberal Mexicano, under the leadership of the Flores Magón brothers: Ricardo, Enrique, and Jesús. In most cases, Mexican Indigenous people did not see the mselves as Mexican or part of the nation, but rather victims of it. In understanding the dynamics of revolutionary movement-building in Mexico, the radical socialist left developing around the Flores Magón brothers understood and embraced this in their internationalist framework. The Flores Magón brothers were radicalized while attending college in Mexico City, but also drew from their own cultural knowledge and experiences. Their father was an Indigenous elder in their hometown in the Mexican state of Oaxaca, and they came of age learning the important tenets of collectivism, reciprocity, other forms of communal obligation, and mutual well-being. They developed their radical philosophies by reading European texts available at the time (Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakunin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, etc.), while also following news stories and instances of Indigenous rebellion happening across the nation, which were becoming more widespread in the 1890s. They refracted their vision of communism through the Indigenous courage to act and power to resist, and the real-to-life models of how it could work within their Mexican Indigenous context. Unlike their Anglo and European counterparts, most of whom embraced the tenets of American exceptional ism and ignored the plight of Indigenous populations, the magonistasmade the Indigenous struggle a central component of the class struggle. They situated the importance and relevance of Indigenous liberation and struggle alongside those of the industrial and rural working classes. Aside from Indigenous people forming their ranks and providing bases of support, the magonist as supported and helped organize and coordinate revolt in defense of Indigenous lands, and returned ancestral lands to the people in the few instances when their insurrections were successful during the revolutionary period. The direct participation of magonist as in support of Mexican revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata and his Army of the South played an influential role in the development of the Plan de Ayala, in which the Zapatistas pledged to restore all stolen Indigenous lands over the course of the revolution. Mutualistas— mutual aid organizations — served as multipurpose vehicles for the Mexican working class, approximating labor unions during times of workplace strife and civil rights advocacy groups during periods of racial persecution. Why were mutualist as at the center of radical Mexican politics?The economy of late nineteenth-century Mexico was characterized by social underdevelopment, underwritten by imperialism. Unions were outlawed by the Mexican state to maintain low wages and a high rate of exploitation for foreign capital. Under these conditions, the working class had to develop its own means and methods of self-sufficiency, mutual support and reliance, and reciprocity to meet the basic needs that were not provided by the state or nongovernmental institutions. These included burial services, medical plans, support for destitute or disabled members, etc. In their initial self-help form, mutualist as were tolerated by the state since they posed no threat. They could even be co-opted by the state for political patronage purposes, trading demonstrations of political loyalty in exchange for benefits and rewards. Nevertheless, the class-based infrastructure of mutualist as — collectivist practices, reciprocal obligations, family and kinship relations, and overlapping memberships within the working classes in local industries — meant that they could also become mechanisms for organizing strikes and other actions at the point of production. By the turn of the century, economic and political crisis and growing social inequality led to the formation of explicit “labor mutualistas,” which represented the evolution from self-help to class-conscious, working-class defense organizations. In the USs, Mexicans brought their mutualist a traditions with them and reconstituted them across the Southwest. This practice continued as a response to the racism experienced by Mexicans and the systematic neglect and social underdevelopment of the barrios. Also, with some exceptions, most US-based unions, especially the American Federation of Labor, largely ignored or excluded Mexican workers, leaving them to their own devices. The mutualist a organizations that formed across western US states in the first three decades of the twentieth century formed the class base and functional networks for the growth and spread of the radical and revolutionary Mexican left in the US in that period, especially the magonist as of the PLM, as well as the IWW Later, the Mexican working-class rank-and-file members of these organizations were pivotal to the organization and growth of a new labor federation, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), in Mexican communities across the Southwest from the 1930s to early 1950s. What role did repression play in catapulting Mexican women in particular to the forefront of these movements? How did they overcome the machismo of Mexican culture and the early left more generally?It is important to recognize that machismo has been a feature and function of labor exploitation embedded in US capitalism from its inception, and has impacted women across all cultures. Not only have women historically been paid less for the same work, but racialized labor exploitation has meant that women of color are paid even less than white women. Mexican women, alongside black women, were paid the lowest wages within the formal economy. By the 1930s, Mexican women constituted a substantial part of the working class within the gendered divisions of labor that characterized industry and employment in the Southwest. For instance, women were the majority of workers in canning and packing, garment manufacturing, and nut-shelling, as well as in domestic service, laundry service, cigar-making, and a variety of other sectors. During World War II, Mexican women became a large contingent of the labor force in wartime industries. Mexican women were at the forefront of some of the most important episodes of militant labor organizing and strike efforts. From the barrios, they emerged as mass leaders, radical the orists, and national figures within the Communist Party and the CIO Their leadership at many junctures of the rising labor movement during the period impacted the thinking of many men, created the basis for wider discourse on gender and sex equality, and challenged the patriarchal structures of the unions and political organizations. For example, women cannery workers negotiated the first union contracts to guarantee equal pay for all workers regardless of sex, race, or nationality, paid maternity leave, and Spanish-language rights provisions guaranteeing bilingual publication of contracts, work notifications, and all other company documentation. In fact, you can see how the concept of civil rights first emerges in the hard-fought labor struggles and union contract guarantees won at the point of production at this time. Because of their resilience and militancy, Mexican women were brutally repressed alongside the men. There is a long history of police violence against Mexican people in the barrios, including women and children. Labor unions and worker-led civil rights organizations at the time, such as the Workers Alliance in San Antonio and the Congress of Spanish-Speaking Peoples in Los Angeles, organized their communities to battle strike-breaking police and to resist and oppose the racist brutality that they experienced on a daily basis. In numerous strikes, women were at the forefront of blocking and fighting scabs and squaring up against the police. They also protested and organized against la migra(immigration authorities), as people were routinely arrested and deported during the Great Depression, with agents directly targeting strikers, union organizers, and political radicals. In some instances, state repression of male workers led to circumstances where women carried a strike or struggle forward. From 1908 to 1911, during the Mexican Revolution, women in the PLM were leading and coordinating a transnational movement from the Southwest to the interior of Mexico, as the male leadership faced constant police harassment and incarceration. In the 1950 Empire Zinc strike in New Mexico (memorialized in the filmSalt of the Earth), the wives of striking miners took over after the corrupt local government declared the strike illegal and threatened the men with arrest if they maintained their picket lines. In crucial junctures of US labor and radical history, Mexican working-class people have often been at the forefront — with women in the foreground. What forces pushed Mexican workers to the forefront of both the labor and early civil rights movements? Why has their participation in these movements been under-acknowledged?It is important to understand the close proximity to Mexico and the particular conditions of conquest, imperialism, and migration that led to the substantial growth of a Mexican working class within and across the USs by the 1920s. Mexicans became the largest section of the working class across major industries — agriculture, mining, railroad, and, in many cases, urban manufacturing. They were systematically oppressed across the economy to the point where the lowest wage in sectors was colloquially referred to as the “Mexican wage.” Under these conditions, Mexican were often the first to down tools or to join others who did so. Their tendency toward explosive resistance and instincts toward organization and collective action was also a result of many workers’ participation in the Mexican Revolution. Many workers brought their experience in revolutionary armies and radical unions and revolution-era organizations with them into the farm, mining, and railroad camps. This experience, politicization, and accumulated knowledge was activated and deployed during periods of conflict and class struggle. The proclivity of Mexican worker militancy and leadership in class struggle was recognized by farsighted socialists, anarchists, and communists. These radicals learned and understood Mexican workers as an essential component of any radical labor movement or revolutionary transformation. There were various efforts by these radicals to recognize, document, and steer their organizations or unions toward understanding, supporting, and acting in solidarity with Mexican workers. Despite episodes of convergence between radical and revolutionary organizations with upsurges in Mexican labor struggle, these have been followed by massive state repression or ruptures and decline. This includes the growth of the IWW through its merging with the PLM in the Southwest between 1909 and 1916, which was crushed by a nationwide campaign of state terror and deportation; the building of Communist Party organizations in Mexican barrios across the Southwest in the 1930s, followed by federal and state anti-communist campaigns to repress and deport Mexican Communists and labor leaders; and the inclusion of tens of thousands of Mexican workers into the CIO by the late 1940s, followed by a full-scale mobilization by the state to destroy the predominantly black and Mexican CIO unions as part of the McCarthyite campaign to drive radicals out of the CIO and union movement altogether. In each of these episodes, Mexican and Central American labor leaders and Communists were deported en masse. McCarthyism represented a convergence of organized anti-communism and Jim Crow white supremacist reaction. The history and knowledge of these episodes of mass Mexican labor upsurges and radicalism have been erased and buried. Radical and Marxist Chicanas and Chicanos, politicized in the civil rights struggles of the 1960s and 1970s, began the process of reconstructing and reconnecting to this Mexican working-class history. The mass strikes, walkouts, and marches for immigrant rights and amnesty centered on May Day 2006 awoke a new generation to the power and transformational potential of the Mexican working class in the USs, as well as Central American and Caribbean workers.

249,The Polls Showed Democrats Poised to Reclaim the Senate. Then Came Election Day.,-9.25,46.0,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/05112020/senate-republicans-majority-over-democrats-climate-change/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-05,21,"The dreams of climate-concerned Americans who had hoped voters would hand Democrats control of the Senate—along with the power to act on a climate agenda—were all but dashed in the election, despite bitterly fought campaigns from Maine to Arizona. Democrats went into the election targeting half a dozen or more Republican incumbents, needing only to pick up three seats. Former astronautMark Kellyin Arizona and former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooperin Colorado took big early leads on election night, when it looked like that script might play out. But the n key Republican incumbents held off their Democratic challengers—Sens. Joni Ernstin Iowa,Lindsey Grahamin South Carolina,Susan Collinsin Maine, and most likelyThom Tillisin North Carolina andDan Sullivanin Alaska. We are hiring!Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. See jobsPlease take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. While there were still technically pathways for Democrats to pick up a couple of seats, they appeared late Wednesday to be long shots at best, leaving some climate activists distraught.“I have a really dreadful feeling about this election,” said Khadija Khokhar, an organizer for Zero Hour, a youth-led climate and justice organization. “There is so much work to do.”There was a lot at stake for the climate and the economy in an election year that produced record-setting hurricane and wildfire seasons. Across the West, energy and climate change was a leading issue for many voters. They lived through drought, heat waves and forest fires this summer. Some of them fretted over declines in the energy industry and the potential cost of clean energy. Democrats will still control the House of Representatives, where they are likely to continue to press for action on climate change. Expertshave said that in a Republican-controlled Senate, there still could be some less ambitious climate legislation. But Republicans have not so far put forward any comprehensive climate plans.“None of the Republican programs we have seen would get you anywhere near the emissions reductions required, given the science around climate change,” said David Konisky, a professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University. Scientistshave said that to keep global temperatures from rising beyond acceptable limits, the re is a global need to get to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Perhaps the most telling upset that never happened was in Kentucky, where Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnellkept his job, despite a fossil fuels agenda, his defense of Trump is anti-science and deregulatory policies and no plan for climate change. McConnell, 78, was rewarded with a seventh term by soundly defeating Democrat Amy McGrath, despite her $80 million warchest.“I am glad they decided our arguments were better than hers,” he said Wednesday. Anticipating the Senate race outcomes would go Republicans’ way, he said, “If my math is correct, I will still be the offensive coordinator.”The current Republican majority is 53. For Democrats to secure a 51-vote majority, they would have needed a net gain of three Republican seats plus a tie-breaking vote by a Democratic vice president, Kamala Harris, assuming a win by former Vice President Joe Biden in the presidential race. If President Trump wins, the Democrats would need to net four seats previously held by Republicans. But, by Wednesday evening, Democrats watched nearly all their hopes slip away. Senator David Perdue is continued to comfortably lead DemocraticchallengerJon Ossoff with 50.3 percent of the vote as the final ballots were being counted in Georgia, thus potentially avoiding a January 5 runoff election. In the race for Georgia is other Senate seat, Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock led a crowded field in a special election and will face incumbent Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler in a January 5 runoff, since neither collected more than 50 percent of the vote. Loeffler was appointed by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp to fill the seat vacated late last year by Johnny Isakson. Warnock, a vocal environmental and climate justice advocate, received considerably fewer votes than Loeffler and her main challenger, Republican Representative Doug Collins, illustrating the challenge Warnock will face in January. The widely respected Cook Political Report said Democrats’ “razor-thin hopes” of regaining control of the Senate would hinge on Georgia runoffs in January if the Perdue-Ossoff race also requires a runoff—and the n Democrats would have to defeat both GOP incumbents, Perdue and Loeffler. Going into Tuesday is election, climate voters revelled in the likelihood that a national climate policy might finally be on the near horizon as pollsters projected that Democrats had a good chance of winning the Senate majority and positioning Congress to reduce carbon emissions and advance clean energy. Nate Silver is FiveThirtyEight web site had given Democrats a 78 percent chance of flipping the Senate. And the Cook Report had concluded that Democrats were the clear favorites to take back the Senate with just days to go until Election Day. But on Wednesday, the Cook report had a new analysis. It called the outlook for Warnock “ominous” in the runoff, while noting the Democrats’ failures in “multiple avenues of flipping the Senate” and that, “in all likelihood,” Republicans would hold on. “In races that Democrats were bullish on and even Republicans sounded very wary about holding in the final days, everything came up red.”Republicans went on a roll. In Iowa, Ernst, who hash ada significant relationship with Big Oil, survived an embarrassing moment during a debate with Democrat Theresa Greenfield, where Ernst failed to know the break-even price of soybeans. In Maine, Collins, who has the strongest voting record on climate among Senate Republicans, won a fifth term by defeating Democrat Sara Gideon in what the Portland Press Heralddescribedas “an intensely negative contest.”Big environmental groups like the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters that hadabandonedCollins for Gideon now find the mselves in the position of having to rebuild their bridges with her. Republicans also took back the Senate seat in Alabama held by Doug Jones, with a victory by a former football coach, Tommy Tuberville, who argued that only God can control the climate. And one of most closely watched and expensive Senate races was inSouth Carolina, where Graham, a self-styled climate champion with little to show for his rhetoric, defeated a well-funded Jaime Harrison, a Democrat who had set fundraising records.“To those who have been following this race, I hope you got the message,” Graham said during his victory speech. “If you do not get this message, it is hopeless. The message I got: people like what I am doing and I am going to keep doing it. I am going back to the Senate with a purpose.”Part of that purpose, he said, was to “do everything I can to stop the radical agenda coming from Nancy Pelosi is House.”Coming into the race, most scenarios for Democrats taking back the Senate started with Hickenlooper beating Senator Cory Gardner and Kelly, a retired astronaut married to former Representative Gabby Giffords, defeating Senator Martha McSally in Arizona. They were able to do that. During his campaign this year, Hickenlooper—who some progressives had dubbed “Frackenlooper”—managed to transform his reputation as a fossil fuel-industry supporter into a candidate pledging to fight climate change. Gardner had sought to dodge the anti-climate label applied to the GOP.“From start to finish, the race for the Senate in Colorado has been about public lands and addressing climate change,” said Gene Karpinski, president of the national environment-focused political action committee, the League of Conservation Voters. Hickenlooper was also endorsed by the Protect Our Winters Action Fund, a climate action group led by outdoor athletes, which noted that “Colorado is winter sports tourism economy is in harm is way due to climate change.” The fund also backed Kelly, noting that he “has spoken favorably of a carbon tax.”In Arizona, Kelly told voters during the campaign how his views on climate and the environment were shaped by his experiences in space. He pledged to use science and data as tools to help tackle climate change and facilitate Arizona is transition to renewable energy. In Montana, a tight race went to incumbent Republican US Senator Steve Daines, who fought off a challenge by Democratic Governor Steve Bullock in an intense battle that left many Montanans eager for the campaign season to end. In Mississippi, Governor Tate Reeves said national political pundits and pollsters that had forecast a good night for Democrats got it wrong once again in the race between Republican Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy, a charismatic Black candidate and former Agriculture Secretary.“We are going to elect someone who is going back to Washington and still be in the majority,” Reeves said at a victory celebration for Hyde-Smith, who easily defeated Espy by 13 percentage points.“It was the Second Amendment that was on the ballot tonight,” said Hyde-Smith, who had tied her fortunes to Trump is agenda and supported production of Mississippi is and the nation is energy resources, including biofuels. “It was socialism that was on the ballot.”James Bruggers covers the US Southeast, part of Inside Climate News’ National Environment Reporting Network.

250,GOP senators push double-decker welfare program,20.75,18.75,https://www.conservativereview.com/news/gop-senators-push-double-decker-welfare-program/,https://adfontesmedia.com/conservative-review-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,12,"President Trump needs to be reelected in 2020, but the Republican Party makes it harder to do so when they mimic the lunatic Left. As a grassroots conservative, the most frustrating thing to have to deal with come election time is to promote a candidate or back a Republican for reelection to gain or maintain a majority, when you know darn well that candidate or incumbent could backslide into the stupid and inexplicable positions owned by the Left. We actually have a president who has identified the problem when he famously said, “America will never be a socialist country.” We are at a point in time where the Left is no longer hiding the fact that they are socialists and unfortunately too many of the American populace are already, or on their way to being convinced, that to p-down government control of their lives is exactly what they have been waiting for. But why oh why do we have to sit here and watch the Republican Party champion socialism while we have the winning message that socialism will destroy America?I could not believe my eyes when I read that Senators Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, actually proposed a paid family leave act with the acronym “CRADLE.” Who read that and did not think, “cradle to grave?” And as we are trying to point out how terrible socialism is, the senators, their aides and their mouthpieces in the media are trying to make the program less terrible by saying it is “revenue neutral.”It is no problem, they tell us. See, the money will come out of the person is own Social Security account and it will be like taking some vacation pay early, that is all. And besides, the American people want it so we should make sure we are out in front on this issue, you know, to show we care. They are going to build another socialist program off of another socialist program. A double-decker. And here I thought theSSA Trusteeshad been telling the American people that Social Security will be depleted by 2034 and Social Security Disability Insurance sooner than that? I thought that as conservatives we are supposed to encourage people to rely on the mselves and not the federal government? I thought that Social Security was the first big socialist program that the progressives foisted upon us and we are still trying to figure out how to keep the promises those lying progressives made? I thought that this socialist program was in trouble the minute people started living longer and the Boomer generation reached the age of 65?What about the fact that most people who would need the money are the ones least likely to have any to speak of?The example put forth to sell this plan discussed new parents in their 30s who would be able to draw from their Social Security for three months to be with their newborn. But would not it be more likely that the people in their late teens and early twenties would be the ones that would be less established and need the money? They would be the ones who also have not worked enough to build up much of a Social Security bank either. Provided there were such a thing as a “Social Security bank,” which there is not. The Washington Examinerpoints out that particular concern of mine is not going to be a problem for the couple in their teens and early twenties. So it is another welfare program. But I thought the Republicans are saying it is not another welfare program?Just saying, why do the people who put considerably less into the system automatically get more out of it percentage-wise?Why do Republicans do this? Does any of this help people take care of their own responsibilities? We already have numerous nutritional programs and healthcare programs to help the young parents who struggle. We, as Republicans, get beat on the head every single time the Left brings up our aversion to entitlements, but we never fight back with the fact that we have so many programs between the federal and state government intended to be used as safety nets when they are needed and the n gotten the hell off of when people can do it the mselves. But this whole program is a welfare program on top of an extremely shaky welfare program and some Republicans are gleeful because it does not start up a new tax. It will tax our Social Security system, which just last year became insolvent when the total cost of the program exceeded its total income. Yet Republicans think starting up another progressive social program on top of it will benefit future generations.

251,"In Trump is January 6 Recast, Attackers Become Martyrs, Heroes",-13.33,34.67,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2021/07/18/trump-capitol-insurrection/,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A cocktail of propaganda, conspiracy theory and disinformation — of the kind intoxicating to the masses in the darkest turns of history — is fueling delusion over the agonies of January 6. Hate is “love.” Violence is “peace.” The pro-Donald Trump attackers are patriots. Months after the the n-president is supporters stormed the Capitol that winter day, Trump and his acolytes are taking this revisionism to a new and dangerous place — one of martyrs and warlike heroes, and of revenge. It is a place where cries of “blue lives matter” have transformed into shouts of “f--- the blue.”The fact inversion about the siege is the latest in Trump is contorted oeuvre of the “big lie” compendium, the most specious of which is that the election was stolen from him, when it was not. It is rooted in the formula of potent propaganda through the ages: Say it loud, say it often, say it with the heft of political power behind you, and people will believe. Once spread by pamphlets, posters and word of mouth, now spread by swipe of finger, the result is the same: a passionate, unquestioning following. Techniques of glorifying your side and demonizing the other with skewed information, if not outright lies, have been in play at least since World War I, when the US government roused sentiment for the cause with posters depicting the German soldier as an ape-human with a willowy American maiden in his clutches. That paled next to what followed years later with Nazi Germany is terrifying use of propaganda for the slaughter and subjugation of millions. Whether the deception feeds warmongering or merely a defeated president is ego, some of the methods are the same, like telling the same fabrication over and over until it sticks. Trump perfected the art of repetition — about the “election hoax,” the “rigged election” and ”massive voter fraud,” with none of those accusations substantiated in the dozens of court cases and official post-election audits but engrained nonetheless among his supporters. Four years ago, Trump appeared to equate white supremacists and racial justice protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, with his comment that there were “very fine people, on both sides.”This time, in this telling, the very fine people on January 6 were on one side: his. For the other side — the police, overwhelmed for hours and bloodied in the insurrection — Trump only has an in-your-face question that doubles as a four-word conspiracy theory: “Who killed Ashli Babbitt?”Those words have become a viral mantra meant to elevateBabbittas a righteous martyr in the cause of liberty. They ricochet around the mainline social media platforms where Trump is banned for spreading misinformation but his followers still commiserate. The woman died from a police officer is bullet fired as she tried to climb through the jagged glass of a smashed window toward the House chamber during the riot. Babbitt has become the face of the insurrection — emblazoned on T-shirts and cheered in basement ballrooms at hotels around the country where conspiracy the orists gather to vent. In Washington is Georgetown neighborhood, flyers are plastered on street lamps and building facades telling of an unveiling of a statue of Babbitt in nearby Alexandria, Virginia, on July 27, at “high noon.”Trumpand many Republicans have cycled through various characterizations of the insurrection, each iteration wholly unlike the previous one. The attackers were said to be leftist anti fa followers in disguise. Then they were said to be overexcitedtourists. Now they are heralded as foot soldiers for freedom. Each iteration has required Americans to ignore the rage they saw on their screens, and some lawmakers to ignore that they were among the shocked targets of the attackers that day. The hunted now praise the hunters. Taken together, the revisionists and their believers are “swimming in a vast sea of nonsense,” said Brendan Buck, a former top aide to onetime House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. That sea is currents are familiar to historians who study what makes some conspiracy the ories and propaganda persuasive. Once people buy into the lies, there can be no convincing them they are not true, said Dolores Albarracin, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a coming book, “Creating Conspiracy Beliefs: How Our Thoughts are Shaped.”Despite the well-documented facts about what happened on January 6, believers often dismiss anyone who tries to set them straight by claiming they are either duped or part of the conspiracy, Albarracin said.“The belief contains a device that protects it,” she said. “Nothing can invalidate the conspiracy theory. Trying to refute the theory proves the theory and signals you as a conspirator.”DJ Peterson, an expert on authoritarianism and propaganda, is president of Longview Global Advisors, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm, and worked at the Eurasia Group and the RAND Corporation. He said that in an online world awash in information and a real world riven by polarization, “you pick and choose what you want to believe, including sticking your head in the sand.”Trump, Peterson said, excels at amplifying claims that galvanize his core supporters and turn them against other Americans.“That is where the power of Trump is,” he said. “He is good at picking up on these threads ... that lower the level of trust and create division.”Recent polls are consistent in illustrating the country is divide over Trump and his post-election histrionics. In essence, two-thirds of the population is against him; two-thirds of Republicans for him. In one of the latest,Quinnipiac found that 66% of Republicans consider President Joe Biden to have been illegitimately elected. That number and others like it in multiple polls represent tens of millions of people who were hoodwinked into believing allegations of election fraud that have been thoroughly investigated and refuted, including by Trump is own attorney general, William Barr. Trump is fabrications have stuck and now undergird the attempts by him and those closest to him to glorify the January 6 mob.“The consequence of lying is you kind of never get back to where you were before,” said Harvard historian Jill Lepore, whose podcast, “The Last Archive,” explores hoaxes, deceptions and what has happened to truth. “That is what is pernicious about our particular moment.”Of Trump, she said: “His method is generally to just create chaos so that people really do not know which way to look.”In the case of the insurrection, his followers looked away. An aggressive amnesia seems to have taken hold over how ugly it all was, even though the scenes that were broadcast and streamed in real time are forever. Swarming to the Capitol after a staging rally whereTrump told them to “fight like hell,”and vowed, falsely, that he would be right there with the m, the attackers beat the vastly outnumbered law enforcement officers, injuring scores of them. In one particularly awful case, an officer was crushed against a door by people pushing to get in, his mouth bleeding as the side of his face pressed against the glass of the door. Lawmakers inside ran for their lives, hiding for hours as the mob wandered the halls of Congress holding up Trump flags. The assailants called out for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and wanted Trump is vice president, who was the re, too. “Hang Mike Pence,” they chanted. Babbitt was part of the group that was trying to beat down the doors of the House chamber as Capitol Police officers were evacuating the House floor and as some members were still trapped in the upper gallery. The officers used furniture to barricade the glass doors separating the hallway from the Speaker is Lobby to try to stave off the attackers, who were breaking glass with their fists, flagpoles and other objects. Only three police officers were guarding the doors on the other side of the stacked furniture as at least 20 attackers tried to get in, screaming, “F--- the blue!” and “Break it down!” One smashed the door glass next to an officer is head; another warned the officers they would be hurt if they did not get out of the way. A Capitol Police lieutenant pointed his gun. “Gun!” “Gun!” the attackers shouted as the hysteria reached a fever pitch. They started to lift Babbitt up, to climb through the window. The officer fired one round. Babbitt was struck in the shoulder. She later died. The officer was cleared of wrongdoing, and his name was not released. Trump now states falsely — and with a stream of repetitions — that she was shot “right in the head.”“They were there for one reason, the rigged election,” he told Fox News a week ago. “They felt the election was rigged. That is why they were there. And they were peaceful people. These were great people. The crowd was unbelievable. And I mentioned the word love.

ByEileen SullivanUSs officials said Friday that the number of migrants arriving at the southwestern border last month was the largest in years, a sign that the surge this year may extend into the hotter summer months when numbers typically start dropping. According to new data released byCustoms and Border Protection, June also brought more migrant families to the border than any other month since President Biden took office. In all, border officials encountered migrants there 188,829 times, the largest number in a single month in recent history. The number of migrant children and teenagers arriving at the border increased slightly from May, but the influx has slowed since early spring, when a steep surge created Mr. Biden is first immigration crisis as president. On average, about 500 migrant children and teenagers arrived alone at the border in June, compared with about 600 a day in March. The up tick in family arrivals in June still falls well short of the record set in May 2019, when 84,000 families came. But the growing overall numbers, andMr. Biden is rejection of President Donald J Trump is hard-line tactics toward undocumented immigrants, will soon force the administration to grapple with vexing policy and political questions that the public health rule, known as Title 42, has largely allowed it to avoid. As of Friday, nearly 15,000 children were in government shelters overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services, according to internal data obtained by The New York Times. The number of times that single adults tried to enter the country last month was down slightly; they were turned away under the public health rule 82 percent of the time. According to Customs and Border Protection, 34 percent of all the migrants encountered in June had tried at least one more time to enter the country in the past 12 months. The number of new migrants to arrive at the southern border since October is just slightly lower than the last surge in 2019 during the Trump administration, the agency said. Republicans have seized on the surge in migration to the southern border — driven in part by violence and poverty in Central America, as it has been for years — and have turned it into a political attack on Mr. Biden. The party is hoping the issue will galvanize voters in midterm elections next year, when it will have a chance to recapture control of the Senate and the House.

253,Why the Georgia Senate Runoff Elections Are So Important,-13.67,40.0,https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a34692385/georgia-senate-runoff-elections-donate-volunteer-vote/,https://adfontesmedia.com/elle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-04,17,"Throughout election week, all eyes were on a handful of swing states that flipped blue and delivered a win for President-elect Joe Biden. One of those essential states? Georgia, where a Democratic presidential nominee had not won since 1992. The shift was thanks, in part, to the tireless work of Black organizers—women like Stacey Abrams andFair Fight, LaTosha Brown andBlack Voters Matter, and Nse Ufot andThe New Georgia Project—who registered, educated, and mobilized voters. But the fight for Georgia is far from over. This January, there will be two critical US Senate runoff elections, one between Republican Senator David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other between Republican Senator Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Reverend Raphael Warnock. The elections will not only decide the state is representation, but also which political party will have a majority in the US Senate, which could dramatically alter Biden is upcoming administration. Below, what you need to know about these races, including why they are happening in the first place, and how you can be involved, even if you do not live in the battleground state. And if you do? Read on, and get ready to vote. In Georgia, a candidate has to win a majority of the overall vote to win the election, a rule that was originally created in the 1960s to limit the power of Black politicians in the state. According to the, if no one breaks 50 percent, the n the two candidates who got the most votes move onto a runoff election against each other. In the last few decades, Democrats have rarely won these statewide runoffs. Now let is look at what happened in Georgia in November: There were two US Senate races in the state this year. One was a typical re-election race for Senator Perdue. The other race featured Senator Loeffler, who was appointed to the seat in 2019 after Senator Johnny Isakson retired; Loeffler was running this year in a special election to finish out Isakson is term. According toCNN, Perdue received 49.7 percent of the vote, while his challenger Ossoff received 48 percent of the vote; Loeffler received 25.9 percent of the vote, while her challenger Warnock received 32.9 percent of the vote. Therefore, there will be two runoffs on January 5th. If you are gearing up to vote on Tuesday, you can find your polling location here. Also, remember: If you are a Georgia resident that turns 18 years old before the runoff elections, even if you were not able to vote in the presidential election,you will be able to cast a ballo tin these races. Perdue, a former CEO, is finishing up his first year as senator. Hemade headlines earlier in 2020 for questions around his investments, including stocks purchased in a company that supplies personal protective equipment, which people use to avoid getting COVID-19, on the same day the Senate had a members-only meeting about the pandemic. Loeffler, another former CEO, was similarly scrutinized for suspicious stock trading tied to the pandemic earlier this year. (In May, it was reported the Justice Departmentdroppedits insider trading investigation into Loeffler.) She also co-owns the WNBA team, Atlanta Dream, though she received push back from players after saying the ""Black Lives Matter political movement"" does not align with the league, according to the. In their Senate careers, Perdue and Loeffler have voted in line with President Trump is position 95 percent and 100 percent of the time, respectively, according toFiveThirtyEight. On the Democratic side, the re is Ossoff, a documentary producer and former media company CEO, who is run for office before; he lost in a special election for the US House in 2017. He also previously worked as a national security aide for Representative Hank Johnson. Warnock, on the other hand, is a senior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church. He is also an activist, who was arrested at the state capitol a few years ago after the governor refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, according toIf he won, he'd be the firstBlack senator from Georgia. Find out more about all of their policy positions, here:PERDUEOSSOFFLOEFFLERWARNOCKAs it stands, following the 2020 election,the new US Senatewill consist of 46 Democrats, two independents who caucus with Democrats, 50 Republicans, and the n whoever wins these two races in Georgia. If Democrats win both races, they will have a majority in the Senate (the Senate tie breaker is the Vice President, or in this case, Kamala Harris), giving Biden increased power to pass legislation and move forward on his policy agenda. Otherwise, if even one of the Republican candidates wins in January, the GOP will have majority control. As the reports: “With judicial nominees, a stimulus deal, infrastructure and health care measures, and tax and spending policies all on the line, the Senate races in Georgia are likely to take on an intensity that mirrors the presidential race that just ended.”For Ufot, the CEO ofThe New Georgia Project, a civic engagement organization originally founded by Abrams, it is been critical to create ""super-voters,"" who come out for every election for which they are eligible, including the ones this January. She told ELLE.com, ""That has been a core piece of our organizing, making sure people understand the power of their vote and understand that it is literally Black people and it is young people that dragged us across the finish line in November and are going to drag us across the line in January, and they cannot give up faith and they cannot give up hope."" As for the races' importance, she said it is also an opportunity to make Vice President-elect Harris the ""most consequential Vice President in the history of the institution,"" teeing her up to be the tiebreaker on important pieces of legislation that activists have been fighting for for years. When it comes to getting voters out for the election—one that falls shortly after the winter holidays—Ufot noted that Democrats will need to invest aggressively in their base. ""What I mean by that is the multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual progressive majority that we have in Georgia and across the South. If you are thinking you are going to just turn white moderates out or you have your white suburban mom strategy, and that alone is going to carry you across the finish line, you are performing, as opposed to actually doing the things that are necessary in order for you to win. You have totalk to Black voters, you have totalk to Latinx and AAPI voters."" She added, ""There was a lot of concern about disinformation and white supremacist violence during the general [election], and while we certainly saw some of that, it is going to be concentrated on the march to January 5th. There is nothing else for them to focus on... All of the hate, the vitriol, the violence that people were concerned about across the country, we need to make sure the re is an apparatus in place to protect Georgia voters.""In early January, CNNreportedthat while a runoff election would typically see a ""massive decline"" in turnout, more than three million voters have already cast ballots in Georgia, exceeding all previous Georgia runoffs by about a million voters. Per the outlet, turnout in white rural areas of the state has been lagging while Black voters have ""consistently been making up 3 to 4 points more of voters through the early voting period than they did at the equivalent points in the general election.""When considering how the votes might swing, it is also necessary to examine President Trump is influence in the race. As NPRreports, he has been baselessly claiming that elections, like the presidential one, are rigged, while simultaneously encouraging Republicans to vote.""Will traditionally Republican voters who rejected Donald Trump return to the party to ensure the Biden agenda is tempered by Republican control of the Senate?""writes is Naaman Zhou. ""Or will Trump is insistence on continuing to campaign in Georgia on the basis that the election was a fraud–and tying the Senate candidates to that cause–again motivate Democratic voters to turn out in high numbers?"" We will have to wait until Tuesday (or later, depending on how close the race is) to find out.",1,1,Elle
254,The Lies Tearing America Apart,13.33,30.67,https://townhall.com/columnists/benshapiro/2021/01/13/the-lies-tearing-america-apart-n2583038,https://adfontesmedia.com/townhall-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-01-13,25,"Last week, the Capitol was breached by a group of fringe Trump supporters who had bought into a series of lies: the lie that President Donald Trump lost the election due to proven voter fraud and irregularity; the lie that the Electoral College results, legally certified state by state, could be overturned by Congress or the vice president; the lie that Trump would remain in office if only some sort of armed rebellion were to prevent the election certification by Congress. Those were lies. And those lies had deadly consequences. Thankfully, the vast majority of Americans do not believe those lies. Which means we should be able to unify around certain basic truths: that Joe Biden is legally president-elect of the USs; that violence in pursuit of political ends is a deep wrong and those who participate in it should be punished to the full extent of the law; that broad claims regarding invasion of rights ought to be backed by compelling evidence. But we will not. That is because while the Democratic Party and the political left agree that Joe Biden is president-elect, they absolutely disagree with both the fundamental precept that violence in pursuit of political ends is a deep wrong and the even more fundamental precept that claims require evidence. We saw that this summer when Democratic Party officials made light of riots spreading across the nation in the name of yet another lie -- the lie that America is systemically racist, rooted in slavery and Jim Crow, and replete with bigoted police dedicated to endangering black lives. Democrats demanded no evidence to support those claims; in knee-jerk fashion, they simply repeated ad nauseam untruths about the existential threat to black Americans in the USs. Which means that for the Democrats and the political left, violence is fine so long as it supports their narrative, and un-evidenced claims are fine so long as they support an agenda. In order to defend such violence, the political left has mobilized behind another convenient and advantageous lie: the lie that the Capitol riots represent all conservatives and Republicans. Paul Krugman of The New York Times suggested that the ""putsch was decades in the making,"" chalking up the rioting to ""Republican elites"" since before Ronald Reagan. The Washington Post amplified a nutty post from the chairman of the Nye County Republican Party in Nevada into a referendum on a ""long-festering struggle within the Republican Party over conspiracy the ories, purity tests and fealty to the rule of law."" Members of the media gleefully hunted for Republicans to blame for the Capitol riots, calling for the de platform ing of brand-name conservatives and cheering on social media crackdowns. Lies are dangerous. And double standards are perhaps the most dangerous form of lying: They grant the bravery of purity to those most willing to defy decency, prompting similar spasms of cruelty and malice from the other side. The solution to our national crisis of conscience is not bad-faith political purges or repetition of tiresome falsehoods about the nature of the USs. It is truth. But truth is more a shield than a sword. And we are now in the age of swords, wielded aggressively by those with little principle but an unending sense of their own moral superiority.",1,0,Townhall

US Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, right, talks with CTA President Dorval Carter on July 16, 2021, at the CTA 95th Street Red Line Station. US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg held up the long-discussed extension of Chicago is Red Line south to 130th Street on Friday as reason to get behind President Joe Biden is $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package. He was not alone. Jammed into the sweltering 95th Street station where the Red Line currently ends, Buttigieg was joined by Mayor Lori Lightfoot and nine members of Congress in a symbolic showing of solidarity behind one of the key items on Biden is domestic agenda — rebuilding the nation is roads, rails, bridges, airports and more. But in choosing to highlight a project that would expand public transit access to tens of thousands of low-income Chicagoans on the city is predominantly Black South Side, Buttigieg also contended the infrastructure package before Congress could help make the nation is transportation more equitable. The former South Bend mayor and presidential candidate displayed dismay at a fact CTA President Dorval Carter gave him on a tour of the station: It can take a Chicagoan living in Altgeld Gardens near 130th Street more than an hour to get downtown because of the lack of transit options.“We have a community next to us in South Bend called Roseland, Indiana. And I love Roseland, Indiana, but it should not take longer to get to a job in the heart of Chicago from the Roseland community of Chicago than it does (to drive) from the Roseland community in Indiana, 90 miles east of here. And this extension is going to change that,” Buttigieg said.“When you think about equity — both in terms of who has access to transit and transportation, and who has access to the jobs that are created by new transit and transportation projects — we know we have got to do better.”Lightfoot echoed the sentiments, saying the current CTA system “does not equally serve all of our South Side communities. She said the city stood ready to match federal dollars that might become available and to invest money along the planned four stops of the extension to improve the quality of life in those neighborhoods.“It takes partnership, and we have to have federal resources to do this, but I want to be clear: The city of Chicago will have skin in the game,” Lightfoot said to Buttigieg. “We are going to keep on lobbying and advocating, but trust that we will be doing the right things on behalf of our residents to make sure that those federal dollars have a catalytic and transformative effect on our city.”Buttigieg was careful not to assure the project would be built if the infrastructure deal passes Congress, but he said it is the type of project that likely would get priority from local officials in their use of federal dollars while also being eligible for federal transportation grants. Even with a massive influx of federal dollars, an extension of the Red Line remains years off into the future. The CTA spent $80 million on the first phase of design and engineering required by the federal government and is currently in search of the roughly $100 million needed to embark on the second phase, said CTA spokesman Brian Steele. The entire project — including the 5.3-mile rail extension, four stations and a rail yard — is estimated to cost $2.3 billion. With funding secured, the earliest construction likely could begin is 2025 with the project expected to take three years to build, Steele said. Asked about the long-term nature of the project, Buttigieg stressed that the infrastructure deal is envisioned as more than just an immediate boost of stimulus, but also a long-term improvement in the nation is long-neglected infrastructure.“This is about making sure we have a vision for the next 10, 20, 50 years. Some of the ideas we will fund with these dollars are shovel-ready,” Buttigieg said. “But this is not just about what is shovel-ready, it is about what is shovel-worthy.”While touring the 95th Street station, which was renovated and expanded under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Buttigieg also took note of the handicap accessibility of the station and viewed an electric CTA bus parked outside. US Senator Tammy Duckworth emphasized that CTAhas a plan to make all of its 145 “L” stations 100% accessible, with 42 stations still in need of the necessary elevators and escalators to come into compliance at an estimated cost of$2.1 billion. Biden is plan also is expected to bolster efforts to convert the CTA is fleet to all-electric buses by 2040. Following the CTA stop, Buttigieg visited a CSX rail yard in Bedford Park. He boarded a charter bus with Governor JB Pritzker, members of Congress, and rail and labor leaders to tour one of the nation is largest inter modal freight terminals. Pritzker has said his six-year, $45 billion“Rebuild Illinois”program, passed by legislators in 2019 and funded largely by an increase in the state gas tax, means Illinois will immediately have the money available to match federal funds made available through Biden is infrastructure plan. The state plan includes a slate of repairs and upgrades to roads, bridges, university buildings, state facilities and other infrastructure. Asked how the passage of the infrastructure package might accelerate the state is plans or what additional projects his administration could pursue as a result, Pritzker ducked the details.“There are projects people have been dreaming about, desiring that might not have started until 2028 or 2030 that we might be able to move forward,” the governor said. “We are looking at all those opportunities, but we do not want to get the cart before the horse here, but we are absolutely excited about the new projects we could take on as a result of this major, major infrastructure plan.”While the infrastructure package totals $1.2 trillion, about half of that money covers existing programs. The roughly$600 billion in new money includes spending on roads, bridges, electrical grids, passenger and freight rail, public transit, broadband access, airports, ports and waterways among other provisions. Buttigieg is visit came as the White House has ramped up its public relations campaign in a bid to push the package through Congress. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he will call the proposal for a vote before the August recess, including an initial test vote scheduled for Wednesday. Biden emphasized the importance of the bipartisan deal during avis it to the Chicago area last week while pushing for a separate, larger investment in “human infrastructure,” including making community college free, extending the additional child tax credit and creating universal pre-K programs across the country. The president also held an infrastructure meeting at the White House earlier this week with a bipartisan group of eight mayors and governors, including Pritzker. While the governor said there was not an opportunity to pitch specific projects, Pritzker said he made sure that Biden knew “Illinois is shovel-ready for those federal dollars and the matching dollars that we will need at the state level.”In Washington, a bipartisan group of senators has agreed upon a framework for the package, but questions remain over how to pay for the massive spending plan. The Congressional Budget Office is expected to find some funding mechanisms in the bill, which includes leftover COVID-19 relief money, will fall short of what lawmakers have projected, which means the bipartisan group may need to find other revenue sources while holding the support of the 10 Republicans needed to cross the 60-vote threshold for passage in the Senate. Republicans have refused to raise corporate taxes, and some conservatives, including anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, have embarked on a pressure campaign to remove a portion of the plan that would generate $140 billion by spending $40 billion to increase IRS enforcement on tax cheats. The White House and Democrats have been unwilling to increase the gas tax or consider a user fee on drivers, which they argue would hit working and middle-class Americans hardest. Asked Friday whether he thought the deal could come apart on Capitol Hill, Buttigieg exuded confidence it would pass, citing the urgency by Democrats and Republicans alike to fund infrastructure.“There will be more twists and turns, the re is no question,” he said. “What we know is Republicans are impatient. The president is impatient. And there is a bipartisan will to get this done.”bruthhart@chicagotribune.comTwitter@BillRuthhart",2,2,Chicago Tribune

During an appearance on “Good Morning Ozarks,” a program aired on Contemporary Christian station KLFC (88.1 FM) in Branson, Ashcroft said, “At some point, we need to just put our heads down and say we are gonna get through it, and we definitely need to send our kids back to school.”He continued, “I do not know a father alive that would not risk getting COVID, even risk dying to make sure that his children had the greatest foundation for success for their life they could have.”“If that is the trade-off — me being safe and my kids losing a year and a half of education — I am all in favor of taking that risk to make sure they can be the best they can be,” he said. “That is what a dad does.”Ashcroft is Democratic opponent in the November election, Yinka Faleti, pounced on Tuesday, calling the incumbent is statement “abhorrently callous” and “insensitive.”Yinka Faleti, St. Louis. Faleti is a candidate for Missouri Secretary of State in the 2020 election.“It is shocking that Jay Ashcroft would make such an abhorrently callous, insensitive and irresponsible statement, suggesting he is willing to risk the lives of parents, children, teachers and school staff so that children can be sent back to school,” Faleti said in an emailed statement. Ashcroft, in an interview with the Post-Dispatch, said, “It is ridiculous to say that I want people to die.”Asked if he regretted suggesting fathers risk death in order to send their children to in-person classes, Ashcroft rejected the premise of the question.“I did not suggest any other father do that,” Ashcroft said. “No I did not. I said I would risk that. And I did not know a father that would not. But I did not tell anybody else what to do. I just said we need to get schools going.”“I do not think it is fair to say that school automatically means death,” he said. “Now you may have to do school differently, and I think you should take precautions.“I want every parent to have the option to send their kid to school if they want,” Ashcroft said. “I am not telling parents what they have to do with their children. I think they ought to have that option.”The criticism marked the second time in recent weeks that a Republican statewide elected official has had to defend comments on kids returning to school. Governor Mike Parson drew national attention last month when he said kids going back to school would catch the virus, but that they will “get over it.”“These kids have got to get back to school,” Parson told a radio interviewer last month. “They are at the lowest risk possible. And if they do get COVID-19, which they will — and they will when they go to school — they are not going to the hospitals. They are not going to have to sit in doctor is offices. They are going to go home, and they are going to get over it.”Parson later said, in another radio interview, “I did not do a good job of explaining the point I was trying to make.”Ashcroft, asked if he could have done a better job making his point in the radio interview, said: “If someone had been asking me questions like you … yes, I probably would have explained it in more detail. But I was just saying — I want schools, I want our kids to get educated.”He the n said that he could filter everything he says so that political opponents do not “misconstrue” his statements.

257,Paris can learn others’ lessons in loss after Notre Dame fire,0.0,45.25,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2019/0416/Paris-can-learn-others-lessons-in-loss-after-Notre-Dame-fire,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"As dawn broke over Notre Dame on Tuesday, small fires still smoldered. Its ancient timber-framed roof and spire had gone up in smoke. But the cathedral stood firm, an imposing, massive presence that Monday is blaze disfigured but did not destroy. Parisians were in shock. The spectacular flames had come close to destroying one of their city is most precious icons and it will take years to restore the building. But the near-catastrophe has reminded a city shaken in recent months by violent social protests of what its citizens have in common: their history.“I have noticed that this has prompted a coming together, a sense of solidarity,” says Alain Meunier, who had stopped on his way to work to take a smart phone picture of Notre Dame. “There is a strong collective emotion.”The Notre Dame fire represents a major cultural loss for Paris. But communities around the world, from Warsaw to New York, offer evidence that recovery is possible. Other cities around the world, from Rio de Janeiro to New York to Warsaw, have lost symbolic cultural buildings over the years. How successful they have been in overcoming those losses seems to depend largely on how deeply they have been able to draw on what their residents have in common. French President Emmanuel Macron appealed to that sort of shared heritage on Monday evening, speaking in front of Notre Dame as it burned. “We were able to build this cathedral, and to enlarge and improve it over the centuries,” he said. “And we will rebuild this cathedral, all together; it is certainly part of French destiny.”Mr. Macron is announcement of an international donation drive to fund the cathedral is restoration met with quick success. Three of France is richest people, Bernard Arnault who owns LVMH, rival luxury goods magnate François Pinault, and L’Oreal owner Françoise Bettencourt Meyers have pledged 500 million euros between them and the Paris city government promised 100 million more. The authorities in Warsaw relied on similar patronage in the 1970s when they set about rebuilding the ancient Royal Castle, which had been “a symbol of Poland is independence and sovereignty” and a powerful element of Poles’ national identity, according to the castle is curator, Bozena Radzio. That, she says, explains why Adolf Hitler ordered that the fortress should be blown up during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, along with the city is Old Town that had already been badly damaged in fighting. After World War II, Poland is new Communist rulers also found the castle too symbolic to want to restore it; its associations with royalty and with a parliament that had drawn up Europe is first liberal Constitution in 1791 were too strong. They did, however, rebuild the old city in the 1950s, in approximate fashion: They based their plans partly on paintings by the 18th-century Italian artist Canaletto the Younger that had been saved from the castle before its destruction. But the reconstruction of a part of the city that had been almost completely obliterated during the war was very popular among Poles who saw it as new evidence of their survival skills. Only in the 1970s, when the government sought ways of appeasing popular unrest, did the authorities begin to reconstruct the castle in a project 90% funded by private donations from around the world. Again, the architects used a fairly free hand. “Neither the castle … nor the Old Town were rebuilt exactly as they looked before the war,” says Jaroslaw Trybus, former deputy director of the Museum of Warsaw. “The castle before the war seemed quite low and it had bad proportions. It is bigger today and workers used better construction materials.”Authentic or not, the building “has grown so strongly into the cityscape that it is difficult to imagine the place without it, says Ms. Radzio. “Many young people do not even know that it was destroyed during the war.”That is scarcely the case in lower Manhattan in New York, where the iconic World Trade Center towers collapsed on Sept. 11,2001, killing thousands, after Al Qaeda terrorists crashed passenger planes into them. But New Yorkers discovered – if only briefly – an unusual unity in the wake of that disaster, setting aside their normal differences.“We all worked together, we refocused. It felt like we came together as city dwellers, thinking of ourselves as being on the same team, on the same side,” says Edy Nathan, a therapist in New York who was just beginning to work with trauma victims at the time.“We were one, and it actually felt sadly amazing,” she adds. “What could we be if we all worked together regardless of our differences?”But such emotional experiences soon evaporated under the pressure of colossal turf fights and clashing opinions about how the Twin Towers site should be rebuilt. The governor of New York at the time, George Pataki, set up a panel to adjudicate between the competing interests jockeying for influence in one of the densest cultural and economic centers in the USs – and to distribute nearly $10 billion in federal funds. These experts ran a global competition for architects and urban planners to submit innovative ideas for both new buildings and new urban spaces on the site. These plans thrilled Tom Stoelker, who remembers the visceral reactions he felt when he was in lower Manhattan that September day, witnessing the burning towers and their collapse. “I immediately thought, ‘Will they rebuild it?’” he says, and was “so inspired” by the prospect of excitingly new buildings that he went back to school and later became a journalist covering architecture around the world.“Yesterday, I thought the same about rebuilding [Notre Dame], and what could be saved,” Mr. Stoelker says. In the end, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the private billionaire developer Larry Silverstein overruled an innovative plan to rebuild the site and chose a more traditional, and often very controversial, approach.“Paris might have an easier time of it … because they are going to be looking at a restoration,” says Mr. Stoelker. “At Notre Dame, they are going to be working with something that exists, and in an area steeped in history.”The National Museum of Brazil was steeped in history too. It was Latin America is largest museum and its biggest repository of archives. But it has not existed since a massive fire destroyed it and most of its contents last September. The museum was housed in a former royal palace amidst an extraordinary park, but it was a largely forgotten and poorly maintained institution. It could hardly be further from the high finance and high politics of Manhattan, or less like the global cultural icon that is Notre Dame. Few Brazilians, save a small group of academic anthropologists and natural science researchers who made the museum their home, appreciated the value of its collection and archives. Sitting in a working class district of Rio it attracted few wealthy visitors, though it was often the first museum that children from poorer areas visited. Underfunded and underappreciated, the National Museum went up in flames shortly before fiercely fought and deeply divisive presidential elections that Jair Bolsonaro won. Brazil had no time to digest its loss before the country was consumed by angry political battles that deepened social divisions and left little space for a common approach to the museum is possible rebirth.“We have thousands of problems,” says Antonio Carlos de Souza Lima, a professor of ethnology at the museum. “The fire was another tragedy of the numerous tragedies that we are suffering through now, and I do not believe that Cariocas [Rio residents] have got over it.”“So few people knew about the National Museum,” laments Thaddeus Gregory Blanchette, who earned his PhD there. “We still do not know if we will be able to rebuild everything and the world has moved on.”Dr. Blanchette. “Forty years from now, there is a good chance the National Museum will still be in ruins.”•Monika Rebala in Warsaw, Poland; Harry Bruinius in New York; and Kiratiana Freelon in Rio de Janeiro contributed reporting to this article.",2,2,Christian Science Monitor
258,The Air Force wanted to mothball over 100 planes. Here is what Congress says it will permit.,0.67,46.33,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/12/04/the-air-force-wanted-to-mothball-more-than-100-planes-in-its-inventory-heres-what-congress-says-it-will-permit/,https://adfontesmedia.com/defense-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-04,24,"WASHINGTON — Congress is seeking to block the Air Force from retiring any of its A-10 Warthog attack planes, KC-135 refueling tankers and RQ-4 Global Hawk surveillance drones this fiscal year. On December 3, the House and Senate Armed Services committees put forward the conference report of the fiscal 2021National Defense Authorization Act— a final version of the defense bill that includes input from both chambers. The bill is expected to be approved by Congress sometime next week and will the n move to the desk of President Donald Trump, who has threatened to veto it. This year is NDAA contained policy provisions on everything from the Pentagon is organizational structure to military bases named for Confederate officers. For the Air Force, the biggest concern was whether Congress would gre enlight the divestment of more than 100 aircraft, which service leaders said would free up funding for modernization priorities that include space technologies and the Joint All-Domain Command and Control concept (which was recently updated to Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control). Lawmakers have opted to let the Air Force retire some bombers, tankers and cargo planes, but they stridently protected others like the A-10 and Global Hawk from any reductions. Here is a breakdown of what the Air Force wanted to send to the boneyard, and how Congress responded:A-10:Congress’ battles with the Air Forceover the venerable A-10have been legion over the past decade, with the service seeking to retire the entire fleet in the mid-2010s. In FY21, the Air Force sought a more modest adjustment — the retirement of 44 A-10s, or about three squadrons worth of aircraft,leaving about 237 Warthogsto fly close-air support missions in the next decade. But Congress put the kibosh on that as well, stipulating in the NDAA that no funding be used to divest or retire any of the 281 A-10s currently in the Air Force is inventory. Bombers:The Air Force hoped to retire 17 of its oldest B-1s, which leaders said were putting strain on the fleet due to the manpower needed to keep them running. In the defense bill, Congress repealed an existing law that requires the Air Force to maintain at least 36 combat coded B-1 aircraft — essentially agreeing to a reduction to the B-1 fleet. However, lawmakers put several new stipulations in place: The Air Force must maintain 92 bombers of any kind in its primary mission aircraft inventory. The service must place four retired B-1s in storage so that they can be reclaimed if necessary. And it cannot remove any B-1 maintenance billets, ensuring that the B-1s that stick around will get the time and attention needed to keep them flying. ISR fleet:Congress also rejected the Air Force is plan to retire all the Global Hawk Block 20 and 30 surveillance drones — a total of 24 aircraft — which would have left RQ-4 Block 40s and the U-2 spy plane around to conduct the high-altitude surveillance mission. Over the past decade, the Air Force has tried multiple times to divest its Global Hawks and U-2s, with Congress refusing to permit the retirement of either aircraft. In response, Congress has stipulated a list of requirements the Air Force must meet before lawmakers consider that request. Specifically, lawmakers have asked for certifications from the Defense Department that the Air Force is developing a cost-effective way to replace the RQ-4 or U-2, or a waiver from the defense secretary stating that a better but more expensive capability is in development. Neither has been received, lawmakers wrote in the conference report.“The conferees understand and acknowledge that modernizing airborne intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities will necessitate divestment of legacy systems,” the conference report stated. “However, the conferees remain concerned about the Air Force is continued inability to execute an ISR acquisition and replacement plan that appropriately manages operational risk to the global combatant commanders, as well as the service is failure to comply with current public law.”Tankers:The Air Force wanted to divest 13 KC-135s and 16 KC-10s in FY21, but the NDAA sketches out an alternative plan — one that forbids any KC-135 retirements over the next three years. Congress will allow the Air Force to move down to 50 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY21, 38 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY22, and 26 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY23. The Air Force currently has 56 KC-10s that are considered primary mission aircraft, so the language would allow the service to retire six aircraft in FY21 and a total of 30 tankers over the next three years, a source familiar with the bill told Defense News in June, when the House Armed Services Committee released identical language. Cargo planes:The service hoped to retire 24 C-130Hs, most of which would be directly replaced by 19 C-130Js that are set to be delivered in FY21. While the NDAA does not address the issue directly, it sets a minimum airlift aircraft inventory at 287 aircraft, including 230 combat-coded cargo planes. The report also included a provision that would prohibit the Air Force from retiring only Air National Guard airlift assets. Valerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

And in these trying times, perspective is key. For those daily awaking to the societal harm caused by colored, interlocking plastic, I deliver relief at last. LEGO will no longer offer “Girls” and “Boys” toys. Per a statement dated October 11th, the company observes, “New research commissioned by the LEGO Group reveals that girls today feel increasingly confident to engage in all types of play and creative activities…”Now the unnerving news:[They] remain held back by society is ingrained gender stereotypes as they grow older. A probe is been performed, courtesy of a group founded byHollywood actressGeena Davis. The study was carried out by theGeena Davis Institutein recognition of the UN is International Day of the Girl and to mark the launch of a new LEGO® campaign, “Ready for Girls,” which celebrates girls who rebuild the world through creative problem solving. The study took place domestically, as well as in China, Czech Republic, Japan, Poland, Russia, and the UK The research findings show that girls are ready for the world, but society is not quite ready to support their growth through play. Girls feel less restrained by and are less supportive of typical gender biases than boys when it comes to creative play (74% of boys vs 62% of girls believe that some activities are just meant for girls, while others are meant for boys), and they are more open towards different types of creative play compared to what their parents and society typically encourage. As an example, “82% of girls believe it is okay for girls to play football and boys to practice ballet, compared to only 71% of boys.”LEGO laments “girls are typically encouraged into activities that are more cognitive, artistic and related to performance compared to boys who are more likely to be pushed into physical and STEM-like activities (digital, science, building, tools).”What is a maker of rectangles that click together to do? LEGO is “calling on parents and children to champion inclusive play.”To assist moms and dads, the company is developed “a fun 10-step guide and [invites] parents to share photos of their child is LEGO creations against a pre-defined…backdrop featuring the words ‘Get the World Ready for Me.'”Perhaps more potently, the toy titan is sockin’ it to stereotypes by lifting labels. Literally. As relayed byThe Guardian, LEGO is chief product and marketing officer — Julia Goldin — ensures it is “working hard to make LEGO more inclusive.”Hence:Goldin [says] Lego no longer labelled any of its products “for girls” or “for boys.” On LEGO.com, consumers cannot search for products by gender. Surely time-constrained parents will appreciate the assist. Instead, the web site offers the mes that it calls “passion points.”If you are still not convinced something must be done, the Geena Davis Institute “foundthat parents of both sexes rated men as ‘more creative,’ were six times as likely to think of scientists and athletes as being men rather than women, and more than eight times as likely to think of engineers as men.”With each passing day, headlines make it clear: Our unwoke days are over. Some might suggest a certain societal sect is not so much bothered by the sexes assuming different roles as they are intent upon forcing them intoones. Personally, I believe everyone should generally do what they wish — and we should not care what choices are made. But culture is new normal is one of colossal care. There once was a savage system in which men and women were not the same. Therefore, they were inclined toward dissimilar things. But that was (not) long ago.

The four teams in quarantine are men is basketball, women is softball, men is baseball and women is volleyball, UNO Chancellor Jeffrey Gold said Wednesday. UNO sent out a note to its campus community Tuesday saying that 13 athletes had tested positive, but that notice did not name the sports in which they play. The coronavirus continues to trouble large pockets of college students, such as those living in sorority and fraternity houses or playing on teams and those who frequent bars. Creighton University, which previously worked out a plan to use a local hotel to quarantine students if necessary, has begun using that hotel, a spokeswoman said Wednesday. She declined to name the hotel. Creighton has reported 119 cases through August 29, including 79 over the past couple of weeks. UNO is Gold said Wednesday that the Mavericks’ 13 athletes are not showing symptoms. He said two or more athletes on each of the four teams tested positive. The quarantine period is 14 days. UNO is note says the 13 athletes were tested Friday. The University of Nebraska-Lincoln has at least nine sororities, two fraternities and the third floor of the Eastside Suites in quarantine because some members in those houses have tested positive. Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds said at a press conference Wednesday that the rate of young adults testing positive for the coronavirus has rocketed in counties where there are large colleges. Last week, Reynolds closed bars in six counties, including Johnson and Story Counties. Johnson is home to the University of Iowa, and Iowa State is in Story County.

I am Amy Goodman, with Juan González. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Minnesota freshman Congressmember Ilhan Omar says death threats against her have spiked in number since President Trump tweeted a video juxtaposing her image with footage of the 9/11 attacks. Trump posted the 43-second video Friday with the caption, “WE WILL NEVER FORGET.” The president is tweet intercut video of the World Trade Center towers burning with video of Omar speaking about the increasing attacks on the Muslim American community after 9/11. Omar was speaking at a Council on American-Islamic Relations event last month. REP. ILHAN OMAR: Far too long, we have lived with the discomfort of being a second-class citizen. And frankly, I am tired of it, and every single Muslim in this country should be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11, because they recognized that some people did something and that all of us were starting to lose access to our civil liberties. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: CAIR was in fact founded in 1994. Omar is spokesperson later said she misspoke and, quote, “meant to refer to the fact that the organization had doubled in size after the Sept. 11 attacks,” end of quote. Congressmember Omar is comments were originally taken out of context and circulated by right-wing media, from The Daily Caller to Fox News. In a statement, Congressmember Omar said, quote, “Since the president is tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life — many directly referencing or replying to the president is video. This is endangering lives. It has to stop.” AMY GOODMAN: The hasht ag #StandWithIlhan trended as conservative voices continued to attack Congressmember Omar over the weekend. Trump said on Twitter Monday he is heading to Minnesota. Omar tweeted, “The Great State of Minnesota, where we do not only welcome immigrants, we send them to Washington #NoBanAct.” In New York City, Yemeni bodega owners responded to the attacks against Congressmember Omar by announcing they are boycotting the sale and purchase of the New York Post over its front-page attack on Omar. The Murdoch-owned daily paper featured an image of the burning Twin Towers on 9/11, referencing Omar is comment out of context, “9/11 Was ‘Some People Did Something,’” and the words “Here is Your Something” in large print over the photo. The Yemeni American Merchants Association said the cover “provoked hatred” and targeted people of the Muslim faith. To talk more about Congressmember Ilhan Omar, we are joined by Moustafa Bayoumi, the author of This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror, his recent Guardian piece headlined “Ilhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.” Moustafa Bayoumi is an English professor at Brooklyn College in the City University of New York, also the author of How Does It Feel to Be a Problem? Being Young and Arab in America. Welcome back to Democracy Now! It is great to have you with us. Talk about what others have said over time. This is the argument you make in your piece, “Ilhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.” Give us a few quotes. MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Sure. Well, I mean, if you think — if you just have even a short-term memory, I think you can remember that George W Bush, the former president of the USs, said something to the effect of — when referring to the 9/11 attackers, said something to the effect of, “Well, these folks committed this act.” AMY GOODMAN: Wait. Actually, we have got that clip. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: … full resources of the federal government go to help the victims and their families and to conduct a full-scale investigation to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act. AMY GOODMAN: “To find the folks who committed this act.” MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Yeah. So, that, in — to my ear, that sounds quite similar to what Ilhan Omar said. And, in fact, George Bush is saying it to the whole country, and he is not considered to be anti-American for that statement whatsoever. So, in fact, I think what Ilhan Omar is saying is completely within the boundaries of what is normal political discourse in this country. And we could go one. That is one example. Another example would be Ilhan Omar is now accused of claiming that — her detractors will say that she claims that Jewish people in the USs suffer from a dual loyalty campaign. Well, in fact, actually, she did not say that. So, I think it is important to qualify what she did say and what she did not say. She talked about questions of allegiance. And if we listen to your last segment and we talk about anti-BDS laws, in fact, those are in fact allegiance laws that are built into now the very system of the USs. However, somebody did say something that was in fact claiming dual loyalty for Jewish Americans, and that would be our president now, Donald Trump. AMY GOODMAN: Explain what he said. MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: He said something to the effect of — when speaking to a Jewish American group, he said something about — AMY GOODMAN: The Jewish Republican Coalition in Las Vegas last week. MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: In fact, that is right. And he said, “Well, let me talk about your prime minister.” So he referred to Benjamin Netanyahu as their prime minister. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: How do you account for this enormous campaign that has been launched against this freshman congress member in terms of by so many conservatives and right-wing groups in the country and by the president himself? In your sense, what is behind it? MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Well, on one level, it is very clear. Ilhan Omar is one of two Muslim women elected to Congress, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress. That gives her, I think, a certain level of prominence, along with a certain level of vulnerability. Not only that, but, of course, being openly Muslim, she wears hijab. She covers her hair. She is a refugee. She is an immigrant. She is a black woman. So she occupies all of those vulnerable positions in our society today. But it is not only that, I believe, if you ask me, because if she were a quiet black refugee woman from Somalia, Muslim who covered her hair, and all of that stuff, the n I think people would love to trot her out for the optics alone. But she is not a quiet congresswoman. In fact, I think that is a great thing. In fact, she seems to be a highly principled and highly effective politician, even just in the short time that she is been in Congress. So, I think that, in fact, she is a scary figure to a lot of people who are on the right, and even sometimes to the mainstream establishment of the Democratic Party, as well. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: That was going to be my follow-up. What about the reaction of the establishment of the Democratic Party to the threats against her and to the scapegoating of her? MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Yes. Well, you know, I think that what we saw was in fact, in some ways, a litmus test of where the Democratic leadership and also those vying for the presidency lie on one of the more important issues of our day, which is Islamophobia, fundamentally. What we saw with Nancy Pelosi is statement, for example, on Ilhan Omar was, I thought, extremely disappointing. I thought she was refusing to name Ilhan Omar explicitly, was not — did not come out in her defense, and in fact was backhandedly accusing her of sacral izing — or, desacralizing, I should say, the 9/11 territory, which was not the point of this controversy at all. So, I thought that Nancy Pelosi is response was, in fact, quite shameful. AMY GOODMAN: And now she is being attacked for criticizing Stephen Miller for his fierce anti-immigrant views, being told that because she is talking about Stephen Miller in the administration, she is singling out a Jewish member of the administration, which proves she is anti-Semitic. We had on Dr. David Glosser, who is Stephen Miller is uncle, his sister is son, who criticized his nephew for his extremist anti-immigrant views. MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Yeah, exactly. I mean, does that mean that Ilhan Omar can only criticize Ilhan Omar? That would be the natural result of that. She is not criticizing Stephen Miller for his Jewishness. She is criticizing Stephen Miller for the positions that he holds. And that is completely within the boundaries of American political discourse. AMY GOODMAN: So what does this mean for Muslims around the country? Ilhan Omar says she herself has faced this spike in death threats against her. President Trump pinning the tweet of the video where he is juxtaposed the 9/11 attacks with Ilhan Omar? We know about the attacks on the Tree of Life synagogue, the 11 Jewish worshipers that were killed, with the killer citing the same words that President Trump used — ”invaders,” “invasion.” President Trump is words and what he tweets has meaning. MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Absolutely. In fact, there was a study that was performed last year — that was published last year, that said that the re is a direct correlation with Donald Trump is anti-Muslim tweets and the rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes. So, Twitter and hate crimes, unfortunately, are connected. And they are not only connected in the USs, they are connected internationally, as well. That is what the study found. And, in fact, not only is what Donald Trump tweeted completely disturbing, but it is also coming within weeks of 50 people being killed in New Zealand in two different mosques by a man who also felt himself connected to President Trump and his ideology. AMY GOODMAN: And let is not forget what the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern responded to President Trump when he asked what can he do, when he called the prime minister, and she said, “Respect the Muslim community,” as she the n put on hi jab herself to comfort the families of those killed. We want to thank you, Moustafa Bayoumi, for being here, author of This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror, professor at Brooklyn College.

267,"Pfizer, Modena COVID vaccines and 5G wireless targeted by Russian disinformation, study finds",-1.67,46.0,https://fortune.com/2021/07/23/russian-disinformation-campaigns-are-trying-to-sow-distrust-of-covid-vaccines-study-finds/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"Russian propagandists and Internet trolls are increasingly targeting companies with disinformation campaigns that are intended to damage their corporate reputations and stir public animosity. That is according to new research published Friday by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), a non-profit that studies the spread of misinformation and deception on social media likeFacebookandTwitter. The report is findings are important because they highlight “a trend that disinformation is now being used as a means of economic warfare,” said NCRI lead intelligence analyst Alex Goldenberg. Traditionally, disinformation campaigns have been used “in the context of political warfare,” said Goldenberg. For instance, organizations with ties to the Russian government distributed fake news on social media before the 2016US presidential election. Some of it centered on race and politics as a way to divide the nation. The NCRI report said that some of the same groups that spread political misinformation during the 2016 presidential election, including Russia isInternet Research Agencyand the Global Research website, have been spreading and amplifying articles intended to “create distrust of US 5G technology.” Some articles repeat conspiracy the ories that5G wireless technology causes health problems and that it is responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak.“This proliferation of 5G conspiracy the ories, many of which are now intertwined with COVID-19 conspiracy the ories, now threaten US 5G infrastructure, associated companies, and their personnel,” the report said. “Last year, the Department of Homeland Security put the US tele com industry on alert about related potential cell tower attacks and risks to telecommunications workers.”Some of the biggest producers of anti-5G conspiracy the ories include Russian disinformation sources like the Russian state controlled television network RT Alternative health and wellness sites like Natural News and Children is Health Defense are also peddling anti-5G propaganda, the NCRI researchers said. Additionally, the report discovered that Russian troll outlets are spreading conspiracy the ories on social media that are intended to sow doubt about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines fromPfizerand Moderna. The goal is to promote the Russian Sputnik V vaccine at the expense of other COVID-19 vaccines, especially in African countries. Even if the propaganda campaign fails to convince US citizens to consider taking the Sputnik V vaccine, the spread of the basic idea that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are ineffective and perhaps dangerous is valuable to the Russian troll outfits, Goldenberg said. For the report, the researchers analyzed 4 million articles since January 2020 that mentioned US pharmaceutical companies like Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer and discovered that known-disinformation sources produced over half-a-million of those articles. The researchers also analyzed over 8 million Twitter posts and noticed a huge up tick of tweets containing the name Pfizer and words associated with conspiracy the ories like “plandemic,” “big pharma,” and “scandemic” over the past year and a half. Sometimes, up to 100 of these malicious tweets wereposted in a single minute, with surges occurring during the recent US presidential election and when the phase 3 clinical trials of Pfizer is COVID-19 vaccine were revealed. Retailer H&M was also subject to a recent disinformation campaign that the researchers said may be linked to the Chinese Communist Party. The disinformation campaign involved the spread of articles and videos of various Chinese citizens criticizing H&M after the retailer expressed concern about reports of forced labor inChina is Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Starbuckswas the victim of a disinformation campaign in 2018 that involved Internet pranksters creating a fake coupon that people of color could use to receive free coffee after an incident involving the arrest of two Black men at a Philadelphia Starbucks. The NCRI research said that the fake Starbucks coupon scandal ballooned to the point where political comment ers were referencing the incident as it if it were real, “reaching millions of viewers and promoting outrage on Twitter.”As for future potential corporate propaganda campaigns, Goldenberg suspects that if scientists determine that people need a booster shot of the COVID-19 vaccine as protection from the emerging virus variants, it is likely that disinformation sources will flood the Internet with anti-booster shot propaganda. NCRI CEO Adam Sohn believes that more corporate disinformation campaigns will continue as state and non-state actors have a solid playbook to spread misinformation across social media. He recommends that corporate marketers must have “an all-seeing eye for their brand on social media to get a sense of where the misinformation trends are in their industry.”“It might be Company A tomorrow, but it could be you the next day,” Sohn said.

269,Salvaging the Nuclear Deal Before It Is Too Late,-1.33,42.0,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/state-of-the-union/salvaging-the-nuclear-deal-before-it-is-too-late/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-21,25,"One of the early priorities of the new Biden administration has to be rejoining the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and they can expect to encounter stiff resistance from the Iran hawks that have been working overtime to destroy the agreement for the last five and a half years. Hard-liners have already fired off two salvos with anarticleinand anop-edinThe Wall Street Journalthis week. The first is supposed to be a “case against the nuclear deal,” but it might as well be titled “the case against diplomacy with Iran.” Michael Oren and Yossi Klein Halevi misrepresent what the JCPOA does, exaggerate the benefits that Iran is supposed to get (but has never actually received), and cling to an absurd maximalist demand of “zero enrichment” that Iran would never accept. It is very much the same tedious and disingenuous argument that we have heard before, and we can expect to hear it repeated many more times in the coming months. Robert Kaplan is piece is supposed to be an argument about countering China, but he starts it off by claiming that rejoining the JCPOA will “undermine key allies in Israel and Saudi Arabia” while “ignoring” the growth of Chinese influence. It never seems to occur to Kaplan that his call for countering Chinese influence is in direct opposition to his criticism of reentering the nuclear deal. If the US wanted to limit Chinese influence in the Middle East, giving Iran the promised sanctions relief as part of the JCPOA would be the obvious move. Thanks to “maximum pressure” cutting Iran off from Europe and many other markets, the ties between Iran and China have been increasing. Ending the economic war on Iran would allow Iran to rely less on China and it would reestablish trade ties that the Trump administration is sanctions had severed. Preserving the JCPOA is consistent with trying to curb Chinese influence, but Kaplan ca not or will not admit that because he is really just using fear of Chinese influence to support continued hawkish policies in the Middle East. This is why he begins by fretting over the possible “undermining” of “key allies” that are neither allies nor key. That is why he never tries to explain how rejoining a successful nonproliferation agreement would undermine countries that actually benefit from it. It is knee-jerk hawkishness against Iran masquerading as strategy. The first thing to understand about hawkish objections to the nuclear deal is that they really have nothing to do with the specific terms and requirements of the deal. These objections have never been about the nuclear issue itself. Iran hawks are alarmed by diplomatic engagement with Iran that reduces Tehran is international isolation. Their technical objections to provisions in the agreement are usually wrong or misleading, but they are also being made in bad faith. They harp on the nuclear issue when they can use that as a pretext for sanctions and conflict, and the n when that issue is resolved they harp on others at the expense of undermining the nuclear deal that successfully addressed the earlier issue. Before the deal was negotiated, Iran hawks insisted that it was pointless because the Iranian government would cheat. When Iran consistently complied with the agreement even after the US reneged on its commitments, they switched to arguing that Iranian compliance was proof that the deal was too favorable to them. When confronted with evidence that the nuclear deal had succeeded on its own terms, they tried to move the goalposts by whining about all the things that it did not and could not possibly address. No agreement that would satisfy their extreme demands would ever be acceptable to Iran, and no agreement that might be negotiated would ever be good enough for them. Having failed to destroy the nuclear deal during the Trump presidency, Iran hawks are now desperately fighting a rear-guard action to delay US reentry long enough so that hard-liners in Iran finally kill the agreement for them. Thearticle refers to recent Iranian actions to increase enrichment to 20% as proof that Iran is engaging in “nuclear blackmail.” The authors misrepresent this as an attempt to “intimidate” Biden, when it is really the result of the failed “maximum pressure” campaign that the authors support. In fact, the reason that Iran has been steadily reducing compliance with the agreement since 2019 is the failure of the other parties to honor their end of the bargain and the constant provocations from the US and Israel during this period. As any minimally informed observer knows, the most recent Iranian moves were a direct response to the Israeli government ismurder of Mohsen Fakhrizadehlate last year. Iran hawks cheered the murder, and now they seek to use the inevitable Iranian response as the latest pretext for scrapping the nuclear deal. It takes some gall to use the consequences of a terrorist attack that you supported as an excuse for sabotaging diplomacy with the victim of the attack. Iran hawks make a lot of noise about provisions in the JCPOA that gradually expire, but these provisions are a necessary part of any negotiated agreement. No government is willing to accept onerous restrictions in perpetuity, and there is no reason to require that such restrictions remain in place forever as long as the purpose of the agreement is still being served. These so-called “sunset clauses” are probably among the least understood and most often misrepresented parts of the agreement. To the extent that some restrictions end, that will be because Iran will have proven over the course of years and decades that it intends to keep its nuclear program peaceful. Some restrictions loosen as it becomes clear that they are no longer needed. The hawks also conveniently fail to mention the many provisions that never expire that will make it practically impossible for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon later on. Ali Vaezdiscussedthese several years ago:Assuming the other parties to the deal reciprocate by holding up their end of the bargain, Iran will ratify in 2023 the IAEA is Additional Protocol, which allows short-notice inspections of undeclared facilities in Iran and which it is now voluntarily implementing. To date, no country on earth has developed nuclear weapons under the watchful eyes of the IAEA is inspectors who are empowered by the access that the Additional Protocol affords them. The Biden administration has a chance to salvage the agreement in the next few months. If they do that and the US rejoins the JCPOA and lifts both old and new sanctions, the n we can expect that Iran will be ratifying the Additional Protocol in just a couple years. That will effectively eliminate the path to an Iranian nuclear weapon, and that will deprive Iran hawks of their main pretext for sanctions and conflict from the n on. The next two years will be a critical time for repairing and reviving the agreement so that its gains are locked in and secured, and the Biden administration will need to get started on that repair work at once. The first thing that Biden will have to do in starting that repair work is tune out the lies and bad faith arguments of Iran hawks.",1,1,The American Conservative

271,Amazon is Anti-Union Bullying Shows Why We Need the PRO Act,-13.33,40.33,https://truthout.org/articles/amazons-anti-union-bullying-shows-why-we-need-the-pro-act/,https://adfontesmedia.com/truthout-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,25,"Recently, Amazon won a closely watched National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election against the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) at a warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama. But it did so only after spending millions of dollars on harassing and intimidating its workers for two months before the vote. Now, the company is using the same strategy to bust a new independent union drive at its Staten Island facility in New York. Unions and worker rights advocates are pushing for legislation that would protect against these types of actions. The Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which has passed the House and is currently pending before the Senate, would limit the ability of corporate bullies like Amazon to interfere with workers’ choice to form a union. The anti-union campaign at Bessemer provided a stark lesson on why change is desperately needed. Powerful corporations such as Amazon must no longer be allowed to bully with impunity when their employees try to improve working conditions. Amazon is Anti-Union “Stalking” When she testified before the Senate Budget Committee in March, Amazon worker Jennifer Bates described the anti-union campaign at Bessemer as a form of “stalking.” Workers could not escape Amazon is anti-union message, even when they were in the stalls of the restrooms, where the company had displayed anti-union handbills. In addition to its high-paid union avoidance law firm, Morgan Lewis, Amazon spent millions of dollars on at least three different anti-union consultant firms whose job was to dissuade the Bessemer employees from supporting the RWDSU Weak reporting rules for anti-union consultants mean that we will never know exactly how much Amazon spent. The PRO Act would change that and bring greater transparency. Amazon forced Bessemer workers to attend hour-long, consultant-conducted, anti-union captive audience meetings — ominously called “education meetings” — multiple times per week; if they dared speak up, their ID badges were photographed and they were expelled from the meetings. The PRO Act would prohibit these fear-inducing forced listening sessions, which are already unlawful in most developed democracies. Powerful corporations such as Amazon must no longer be allowed to bully with impunity when their employees try to improve working conditions. Amazon workers were required to listen to one-on-one anti-union meetings, were exposed to anti-union posters throughout the facility and even endured human anti-union billboards walking through the facility. Bombarded with text messages attacking the RWDSU several times per day, workers could not even escape Amazon is anti-union message outside work. All of these anti-union messages — based on deliberate misinformation — came from Amazon management that has the power to hire, fire, promote, reassign and grant or deny leave. As President Biden is remarkable video calling out Amazon is intimidation made clear, this relentless corporate anti-union propaganda is inherently coercive. Anti-Union Bullying on Multiple Fronts Amazon is anti-union campaign was nearly as pervasive on social media as it was in the workplace. Amazon posted tweets attacking RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum and politicians who had voiced support for pro-union workers. Additionally, bot-generated tweets attacking the union were disseminated, until Twitter disabled them. Anti-union ads were also prevalent on Amazon-owned Twitch, until the gamer community revolted and insisted that they be removed. Some Bessemer workers might have been aware that Amazon had already sacked pro-union employees in both New York and Virginia, but faced no meaningful sanction. They probably did not know that Amazon — Bessemer is largest employer by far — had bullied the town into altering a stoplight outside the warehouse in order to stop union organizers engaging with workers as they left the facility; or that Amazon — the USPS is largest client by far — had bullied the postal service into installing a special mailbox outside the warehouse just before postal voting began and after the NLRB had rejected Amazon is pleas for an on site ballot; or that Amazon had hired off-duty law enforcement agents to harass union organizers and pro-union workers and prevent them from engaging with the majority-Black workforce. Corporate behemoths such as Amazon have virtually unlimited financial resources, and tremendous clout over the local community. The PRO Act would not change that, but it would at least limit their ability to engage in egregious anti-union bullying at the workplace. Collective Bargaining vs Individual “Take It or Leave It” Amazon repeatedly told its Bessemer workers that unionization would destroy their ability to negotiate with the management on an individual basis. In reality, so-called “individual bargaining” is a fantasy for most American workers; even elite movie and sports stars have strong unions to represent them. Without a union, workers face a stark choice: accept what is being offered — such as Amazon is decision last summer to rescind its $2 per hour hazard pay even as its pandemic profits skyrocketed, or its failure to act quickly or do enough to protect workers from the spread of COVID-19 — or get out. The PRO Act would instead promote collective bargaining, the reby giving workers real leverage over issues such as hazard pay or safety precautions for essential workers during a deadly pandemic. Exit or Voice? At present, if Amazon is nonunion workers feel they are being treated unfairly, they have little choice but to quit and find another job. But if the PRO Act were to pass, exit would no longer be their only option; they could stay put, form a union and have a real voice that would enable them to improve their conditions. Amazon workers were required to listen to one-on-one anti-union meetings, were exposed to anti-union posters throughout the facility and even endured human anti-union billboards walking through the facility. Amazon warehouses have enormously high turnover rates — double the industry average — because many workers cannot tolerate for long the brutal physical and psychological environment and they lack any meaningful voice with which to change it. They are constantly monitored by unregulated technologies, with management even recording how much “time off task” they take during visits to the restroom, resulting in some workers urinating into bottles out of a fear of being disciplined for failing to meet punishing daily production targets. The PRO Act would enable workers to have a voice and challenge these brutal working conditions. A Mountain and a Minefield: It Should not Be This Hard to Choose a Union American workers who try to form a union are required to run a marathon and negotiate a minefield: shenanigans by union avoidance law firms mean the union certification process takes too long, while dirty tricks by anti-union consultants means workers face too many perils along the way. The Amazon campaign demonstrated both problems clearly. Three thousand workers signed union membership cards; most of them wanted to remain secret out of an understandable fear of retaliation. After being exposed to unrelenting anti-union activities for over two months, only about a third of those card signers voted for the union. Workers were left fearful, as was the clear intention of Amazon is anti-union campaign. One Bessemer worker, a cancer survivor, told BBC News that she was afraid that she might lose her health insurance if the union were to win the election. In short, Amazon is brutal (and quite likely unlawful) campaign had a devastating impact on worker support for the union. The PRO Act would limit the ability of corporate bullies such as Amazon to intimidate, mislead and bamboozle employees. It would take some of the fear out of the union organizing process and restore some measure of basic fairness to the workplace. Now that Senator Joe Manchin of West Virginia has signed on, all but three Senate Democrats — the two senators from Arizona and Mark Warner from Virginia — are co-sponsors of the PRO Act. The legislation could attract the support of at least one Republican senator (Lisa Murkowski of Alaska), and President Biden strongly supports the legislation. Thanks to the RWDSU is audacious campaign at Amazon, more people than ever before understand the brutality of no-holds-barred anti-union campaigns such as the one conducted by Amazon at Bessemer. The nation is finally paying attention. The billionaires will fight to the end, but legislation for stronger labor protections is an idea whose time has come.",1,1,Truthout
272,"As Construction Continues Amidst Covid-19 in DC Area, Bezos’ WaPo Raises Few Objections",-16.5,30.5,https://fair.org/home/as-construction-continues-amidst-covid-19-in-dc-area-bezos-wapo-raises-few-objections/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-25,25,"“Insane.” That is what Marc Gunther thought as he looked out of the window of his downtown Bethesda, Maryland, apartment. Below him, cramped construction crews were building a headquarters and adjoining hotel for Marriott, the world is biggest hotel chain. The $600 million project, which has received $60 million in public funding, is scheduled to be completed in 2022, pandemic or not. Recently, two of the site is approximately 300 workers tested positive for coronavirus. After shutting down the site for deep cleaning and implementing enhanced safety measures, work was scheduled to res ume this week. Gunther called the resumption of work “nuts” in aMediumpost (4/3/20), headlined “Luxury Condos and Corporate Office Buildings Are Not Worth Dying For.”The day before his post, Gunther had a short letter to the editor published in the Washington Post(4/2/20), the dominant news outlet for the “DMV”—DC, Maryland and Virginia. Gunther is letter appears to be the only mention in thePostof the dangerous situation at the Marriott site. And it is not just Marriott getting a pass. Despite thePost is unique ability to bring about DMV-wide change, the paper has mostly kept quiet about the region is dangerous construction sites, the reby inviting human tragedy. In a rarePoststory (3/28/20) on the dangers posed by to day is construction sites, officials were given ample space to repeatedly claim all is well: “We can continue to operate safely,” said a spokesperson for general contractors, “and we should.”Workers, meanwhile, are less concerned with “the dangers of contracting coronavirus on the job” than simply having a job, said a union official. Besides, there have been no reports of coronavirus on any city project site, DC officials said, effectively claiming the pandemic miraculously leapfrogged over these potential hotspots.“I work on a construction job site with 150 to 200 others in an environment that is impossible to protect from the coronavirus,” wrote Mike Pitzer, a project manager in the DMV who is risking his job by refusing to work amid the pandemic. In aPostop-ed (4/17/20), Pitzer raised safety concerns thePosthas yet to condemn with its powerful editorial page, or even report on:Most of the workers on our job site are employed by contractors, whose crews include carpenters, plumbers, bricklayers, electricians, etc., and their helpers. Some of these subcontractor workers will have commuted in vans with seven or eight others. If the DMV does not follow the lead of other states and ban nonessential construction, the pressure to work will continue to run down the chain of command. If subcontractors do not work, Pitzer explained:Not only would they lose the revenue, but they also would probably damage important relationships with the bigger contractors who hired them. They also could be at risk for monetary penalties if they do not complete work by the schedule agreed upon in the contract. And their workers risk being fired if they do not show up. AnotherPoststory (4/12/20) warns about the “catastrophic” impact the pandemic is likely to have in Langley Park, Maryland, a densely populated, largely Latino community outside DC, where many are undocumented and the refore ineligible for federal stimulus checks or unemployment benefits. While thePostbemoans the harm the pandemic will inflict on Langley Park, the paper is loath to call out those who are exacerbating the situation, such as developers, who are placing profits ahead of the community is health. ThePoststory profiles Marcos, a 55-year-old who returns from his construction site each day knowing the risk of bringing the novel coronavirus home with him: home to his daughter with disabilities and a feeding tube in her stomach; home to a 7-year-old son with asthma; home to a wife without legal status and a household where the adults lack health insurance in a neighborhood packed with other vulnerable families. Marcos and his family all sleep together in their living room so they can earn extra money renting out their only bedroom, an arrangement that makes limiting the virus is spread among family members difficult. Despite “stay at home” orders being in effect throughout the DMV, where the virus death toll has now to pped 1,000, construction continues, thanks to its being deemed “essential.”“When restaurants, coffee shops, retailers, gyms, barbershops and movie the aters have been shuttered,” Gunther asked in hisMediumpost, “what makes construction so special?”When asked about the “essential” designation for construction, local officials point to federal guidelines that allow for it, or just as often say no comment. Not that a comment is needed. The writing is on the walls of the high-end buildings sprouting up.“Our ‘essential’ work,” wrote Pitzer, the project manager, “is constructing a new apartment building—not a bridge, not a road, not a hospital, but new, non-subsidized apartments.” Gentrification is the DMV is growth industry, and not even a pandemic can mess with profit margins and project timetables. And the DMV is most high-profile timetable belongs toAmazon, whose founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns the Washington Post. In northern Virginia, just outside DC, construction ofAmazon is massive second headquarters, HQ2,remains on schedule despite the pandemic. Alsoon schedule is construction of a new $390 million concourse at Reagan National airport, located just1,800 feet from HQ2 is Crystal City outpost. That is as the crow flies, although in a few years it will be walkable, thanks to a$40 million pedestrian bridgethat, once built, will connect Crystal City and HQ2 directly to the airport. The pedestrian bridge is part of$762 million in public subsidies Virginia is givingAmazon, a trillion-dollar company, for locating HQ2 in the state. (Amazonmay have ended up in northern Virginia regardless of subsidies, in order to be near the Pentagon and gain a leg up on a $10 billion military contract.)Elsewhere in northern Virginia, the construction of vast data centers is being fast-tracked, withAmazon Web Services(AWS) “lead[ing] the way, as it often does,”Washington Business Journal(4/17/20) reported. “There may be as many as a dozenAWSdata centers under construction now or in the near future in Loudoun alone.”Meanwhile, in DC, “A global pandemic and economic crisis is not slowing down” progress on a 323-unit building anchored by anAmazon-owned Whole Foods store (Bisnow,4/15/20). And in Maryland,Amazonis continuing its rapid growth, as it expands into another “massive new warehouse” (Washington Business Journal,4/17/20). In not calling for the shuttering of DMV construction, thePostis aligning itself with the interests of its owner, the richest person alive (whose wealth increased by $6.8 billion in just the past week). Across the Potomac River, in Maryland, construction also continues. The state is governor, RepublicanLarry Hogan, is not only pro-development, but is himself a real estate developer—a fact thePostnow tries to hide.“The governor offeredAmazon, our owner is company,$8.5 billion to locate HQ2 in his state.”Hogan “wasa suburban real estate developer before becoming governor,” thePost(3/19/20) recently reported (emphasis added). That is like saying President Trumpwasin the hotel business—a statement thePostwould never make, and rightfully so. Like Trump, Hogan has a company that is named after himself, not held in a blind trust, managed by a family member; also like Trump, he is continuing to make deals while he is in office, and potentially benefiting from his official actions (Washington Monthly,1/20). When Hogan designates real estateandconstruction(like the Marriott headquarters) essential, is this a conflict of interest? ThePostwill not ask, even as Hogan rakes in a small fortune from his company, around $2.4 million in just his first three years in office. While Hogan may have personal financial reasons for designating construction “essential,” the health consequences of doing so may be catastrophic. If thePosthighlighted this danger, it would pressure the pro-development governor to shut down construction sites. This appears to be what happened in New York. In stories on the danger of construction sites in the Big Apple, several news sites—unlike the Washington Post—prioritized the views of workers over officials. The difference was dramatic. Workers say “social distancing is a social myth,” read a New YorkDaily Newsstory (3/26/20) that included photos of workers “in dangerously close proximity.” The story quoted hardhats onTwitter: “Put a stop to this now,” said one worker.“Just riding the elevator to where you need to work is like an affront to the whole idea of social distancing,” another worker told The City(3/23/20). Like many industry whistleblowers, he remained anonymous, fearing possible retaliation from his employer.“I am essential to the pocketbooks of rich contractors and essential for spreading the virus, but that is about it,” electrician Kirk Gibbs told the New York Times(3/25/20). “They should really shut down these projects for two months…. I’d just hate to see more people die and get sick.”“Construction sites, even during normal times, are notoriously dirty,” theTimesreported. Workers often share a single portable toilet, which rarely has soap or hand sanitizer. Running water is not common…. They share tools, and procedures require that they closely watch over one another. In the wake of reports like the se, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo reversed himself and banned nonessential construction. If similar reporting is found in the Washington Post, the DMV could follow New York is lead and save lives.",1,1,FAIR

Khanna also added that while he will not be voting for the Democratic party isplatform, he will “do everything possible” to help elect 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his running mate California Democratic Senator Kamala Harris against President Donald Trump.“I believe that moving away from a profit-based healthcare system is the moral issue of our time. And in the final analysis, because of that belief, I could not vote for a platform that lacks a clear statement supporting Medicare for All,” Khanna wrote in his piece.“Harry Truman ran and won on universal healthcare in 1948, and it was part of Democratic Party platforms until 1980. Thirty-six years later, the 2016 platform merely called for lowering the eligibility age for Medicare to 55. The 2020 platform proposes raising the goal to 60. That is not incrementalism; that is moving backwards,” Khannacontinued. “I will be voting ‘No’ on the platform because when we say that healthcare is a human right, we must truly mean it—and fight for it.”Harris has previously saids he would like to get to universal health care coverage by growing Medicare.

The co-owner of the Mothership bar, at 2301 S Logan Ave. in Bay View, said he worried that interacting with customers coming from points far and wide could sicken him and his employees. And COVID-19 began hitting closer to home, as well.""With our friends getting sick and our friends getting positives — just the worry you see in your employees' faces every day before you turn on the open sign,"" he said, made him consider the risks of serving drinks in the bar. It reached what Ramirez called a boiling point in a weekly meeting with beer and spirits vendors: the concern that he would not be able to sell what he was buying, the speculation that the city might order a lock down because of the ballooning cases. “I am sorry, I just ca not do this right now,"" he recalled saying. So the Mothership made a pre-emptive move: It put itself on lock down last week, shutting down indoor seating and switching to carryout only, something that several other bars and at least one restaurant have done recently. It is reminiscent of the lock down ordered by Governor Tony Evers in March to flatten the curve, in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.""I think it is a good time for somebody to do something,"" Ramirez said. Namely, take a step back and figure out, as an industry, “what we can do to help each other stay alive this winter. It is going to get bad.""He is turned to online ordering of the Mothership is tiki and classic cocktails, prepared in batches of four drinks or so, and mixed six-packs of beer. Last week,Lucky Joe is in Wauwatosaclosed its dining room and lounge to return to takeout for a while because of the rocketing number of new cases. Co-owner Jarod Packard said his wife is a respiratory therapist at Froedtert Hospital.""Anything I can do to prevent her from getting any busier, is what I am trying to do,"" he said. He has not put an end date on the dining room is closure, instead waiting to see where the COVID-19 numbers go.""I think it is just a lot safer if we all do our part and close down and stay as safe as possible,"" Packard said, adding, ""Everybody else around me is who I do not want to affect.""The move to takeout-only comes at a cost, in a year when many restaurants and bars have taken big financial hits because of the pandemic. Lucky Joe is, at 1427 Underwood Ave., also shut down briefly in October, during protests over the decision by the Milwaukee County district attorney not to charge a police officer in the shooting death of Black teenager Alvin Cole in Wauwatosa.""Usually winter is our busier season,"" Packard said. The night before Thanksgiving traditionally is huge for bars, when people travel home for Thanksgiving and gather with friends the night before for a drink. Along with get-togethers leading up to Christmas and celebrations on New Year is Eve, the last quarter of the year is the big moneymaker for the hospitality industry.""It is a tough decision,"" Packard acknowledged. ""We are definitely not going to make any money through all this."" But he said he is hopeful Lucky Joe is will be able to hang on by taking phone orders for cocktails kits and menu items including dinners for two while trying to keep people safe. John Revord, owner of Boone & Crockett bar at 818 S Water St. in the Harbor District, has shifted toThe General Store at the bar, with online ordering of cocktail kits, beer, wine and cold-brew coffee.""It is not going to make us any money; it is not going to pay any bills,"" he said. But takeout will provide paychecks to a few employees he is able to keep on staff. ""That is better than nothing,"" he said. He worries what closings the coming months will bring if Congress does not pass relief bills, namely the Restaurants Act and Save Our Stages Act. Although government loans and grants in the early phase of the pandemic were effective, he said, ""there is a need for Round 2.""Bars like his were able to make it through the first lock down and tougher times of the pandemic thanks to a cushion from the 2019 holiday season, he said.""Everyone had their holiday nest eggs. Unfortunately, nest eggs are a rarity these days,"" Revord said. Boone might have been the first Milwaukee bar to revert to only takeout because of rising COVID-19 cases, on October 30. Snack Boys restaurant on the east side, of which Revord is a co-owner, began its temporary shutdown November 10.""The numbers in Wisconsin are so insane, there was no way we could justify staying open by any sort of metric,"" Revord said. As it was, he considers it lucky that Boone was already closed when he and a couple others there became ill with COVID-19, shortly after he tested negative twice within a week for the coronavirus. But many bars have to stay open because the owners simply ca not afford to close to patrons, an ""unfortunate side effect of the lack of aid,"" he said. ""For some folks that does mean life or death, and that is a really unfortunate position to be put in.""Revord said he was able to close Boone for the winter because of good weather in summer and a greatly expanded patio. The barroom itself was open for perhaps a month for service, in September and October; he estimated no more than a dozen people sat there in all that time. Everyone wanted to be outside, where the risk of catching the coronavirus was lower.""There is no question what a packed room full of drunk people does to a disease that is easily transmissible,"" Revord said, adding ""the quicker we get past this, the quicker we can get back to the people we want to see.""",2,2,Milwaukee Journal Sentinel

The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisisprobeseeks answers from Kabbage and BlueVine, online lending platforms that processed hundreds of thousands of government-backed loans to small businesses, as well as Celtic Bank and Cross River Bank, which frequently partnered with the web-based lenders. Although these highly automated lenders helped the Small Business Administration is $800 billion relief program reach small businesses that were not being served by traditional banks, they also became targets for cheaters.“I am deeply troubled by recent reports alleging that financial technology (FinTech) lenders and their bank partners failed to adequately screen PPP loan applications for fraud,” said subcommittee chair James E Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat. “This failure may have led to millions of dollars in FinTech-facilitated PPP loans being made to fraudulent, non-existent, or otherwise ineligible businesses.”The subcommittee is letters to the targets of its investigation cited stories published by Bloomberg, the Miami Herald, the Project on Government Oversight and ProPublica that found fin tech companies account for an outsized amount of the fraud that has plagued the PPP from its inception. Last week, ProPublicarevealedthat Kabbage processed 378 loans collectively worth $7 million to single-person businesses that do not appear in corporation records of their respective states. The overwhelming majority identified the mselves as farms, typically registered to residential addresses with no discernable agricultural activity.“The illegitimacy of these purported farms — including potato fields in Florida and orange groves in Minnesota — would have been obvious if even the bare minimum of due diligence had been conducted on the loan applications,” the subcommittee wrote in its letter to Kabbage, which was acquired by American Express last fall. The letter demands a long list of documents, including any records of potential fraudulent activity on the platform, documents describing what resources were devoted to fraud detection, and descriptions of how the company recruited PPP applicants and how it incentivized loan reviewers to process more applications. Read MoreThose questions mostly implicate Kabbage is conduct before it became part of American Express, which did not acquire Kabbage is loan portfolio or its servicing arm, which are now incorporated into a separate company. The new company, called K Servicing, continued to process new PPP applications as well as close out those from the first round. Kabbage is also reportedly under investigation by the Department of Justice over how it calculated PPP loan amounts.

By empowering private citizens to enforce cruel abortion bans that the state cannot, Texas Republicans have not only found a way to circumvent the Constitution, they have essentially given anti-abortion activists a green light to harass clinics, abortion funds, abortion advocates, and even friends and family members of abortion seekers. Like other bans on early abortion passed in Republican-led states, the unconstitutional ban will likely be challenged in the courts and blocked, but it is the latter provision that has most worried abortion providers and abortion advocates. They expect they will likely be the target of lawsuits by anti-abortion activists seeking to make them close their doors. As the Guttmacher Institute is Elizabeth Nash put it in a statement on the bill is private enforcement mechanism, “By allowing anyone, anywhere to sue people involved in providing or obtaining an abortion, this ban would open the floodgates for lawsuits, bury clinics under frivolous court cases and legal fees, and make it difficult for providers to remain open.”And while the ban on early abortion can and will almost assuredly be sued, the state is abortion providers and advocates will have to, as constitutional law professor Josh Blackmantoldthe Texas Tribune, “sit and wait to be sued” in order to challenge the private enforcement mechanism. As Blackman put it, organizations like Planned Parenthood “ca not go to court and sue Attorney General [Ken] Paxton like they usually would because he has no role in enforcing the statute.”That Abbott is signing comes on the heels of the Supreme Court is announcement that i twill take up an abortion case that is a direct challenge to is yet another sign that the ever-more radical and emboldened anti-abortion movement is winning, and that activists have become more honest about their end goal. And get ready for these kinds of bills to be introduced in your state. As Kamyon Conner, the executive director of the TEA Fund, a Texas abortion fund, told Jezebel in a previous interview, “If it happens here, it will happen in other places, because Texas is a place to watch when it comes to abortion access and abortion restrictions.”If the re is ever been a good time to donate to your local abortion fund, it is now.",1,0,Jezebel

He says they killed Sudanese women and killed our farmers and burnt the lands before, and they claimed that it is not Sudanese land and accused Sudan of entering their lands. Authorities in Sudan is al-Qadarif state say residents of at least 34 villages near the border have been displaced. Sudan and Ethiopia formed a joint committee in December to resolve the long-standing dispute over al-Fashaga, located where northwestern Ethiopia meets southeastern Sudan. However, the Ethiopian ambassador in Khartoum has accused the Sudanese military of taking advantage of the war in the Tigray region to seize disputed land. Yibeltal Aemero called on Sudan is military to withdraw from the border region and stop its military operations.“Very recently, in the first week of November 2020, we witnessed unprecedented military incursion by the Sudan while the joint special committee was still in progress and when the Ethiopian National Defense forces moved to Tigray region on November, 4, 2020 for the law enforcement majors, the Sudanese army took the advantage and entered deep inside Ethiopian territory, looted properties, burned camps, detained, attacked and killed the Ethiopians while displacing thousands,"" said Aemero. Many Sudanese condemned the ambassador is accusations and called on the military to take wider actions. Security observers think the conflict could have severe ramifications in the region. Military expert Sawarmi Kahlid says the recent escalation has very risky security impacts on the residents in the border area and the troops in both sides. Also the call of war is threatening large groups of people and tribes, especially in Ethiopia, where these tribes are already witnessing a famine. More than 50,000 Ethiopians recently fled the war in the Tigray region for refugee camps in eastern Sudan. The Sudanese government has moved many of them away from the border, citing the security situation.",2,2,Voice of America
280,Supreme Court ruling on student speech could impact Pasco school rules,0.0,46.33,https://www.tampabay.com/news/education/2021/06/23/supreme-court-ruling-on-student-speech-could-impact-pasco-school-rules/,https://adfontesmedia.com/tampa-bay-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,21,"A US Supreme Court decision upholding students’ First Amendment rights might change the way one Tampa Bay area school district deals with students’ off-campus comments. In an 8-1 ruling issued Wednesday, the court found that a Pennsylvania school district was wrong to suspend a student who made profane Snapchat statements about campus activities after she did not win a spot on the varsity cheer team. While schools have some room to discipline students for things said outside school, the majority wrote, they do not have blanket authority to control all student speech.“[T]he school itself has an interest in protecting a student is unpopular expression, especially when the expression takes place off campus,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote. “America is public schools are the nurseries of democracy. Our representative democracy only works if we protect the ‘marketplace of ideas.’”Pasco County school district officials had been keeping close tabs on the case. A year ago, the School Board amended its student code of conduct to include potential punishments for students on teams or clubs who make derogatory online comments while wearing school gear. Pasco students could face suspension or dismissal from their team, and in some cases teams could forfeit games or events. Director of student services Melissa Musselwhite said the rule was meant to target instances such as students in uniform posting TikTok videos that depict violence or making negative statements about school — particularly if they cause campus disruptions. Given the nature of the Pennsylvania case, and the court is support of the plaintiff is right to make general criticisms on her own time, Musselwhite said the district would reexamine whether its stance could hold.“We are definitely going to look at it,” she said. “We will not take very long.”School Board chairman Allen Altman favored the restrictions placed on students in uniform, saying they should positively represent their schools. He added, though, that if the district rule does not meet legal muster, it would be fixed. The board updates policies at least twice a year to reflect changes in state and federal law, and court precedents. Officials in the Pinellas and Hillsborough county school districts said they did not have rules in their codes of conduct that go as far as Pasco. Their regulations over student speech adhere more closely to the areas the court found permissible to govern, such as dealing with bullying, cheating, threats and safety concerns. Pinellas, for instance, has a policy on First Amendment freedom of expression, which states in part, “when a student exercises that right, the student must do so in a responsible manner that does not cause a disruption of the school or a school activity. A principal may impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on your exercise of First Amendment freedom of expression when there is evidence of imminent disruption of the school.”School Board member Nicole Carr, a former assistant principal, said she was pleased the court left intact schools’ ability to deal with threats and bullying that occurs off campus. She agreed that the Pennsylvania school district went too far in suspending the student because of her Snapchat tirade.“If someone expressed an opinion that does not negatively impact an individual or constitute bullying, you should be able to articulate your opinion,” Carr said. The Pennsylvania case arose from posts made by Brandi Levy, who was 14 at the time and just starting high school. One post pictured her and a friend with raised middle fingers and repeated use of a vulgarity to complain that she had been left off the varsity cheerleading squad.“F--k school f--k softball f--k cheer f--k everything,” she wrote. Now 18, Levy recently finished her first year of college. Levy is parents filed a federal lawsuit after the cheerleading coach suspended her from the junior varsity team for a year. Lower courts ruled in Levy is favor, and she was reinstated. The school district appealed to the Supreme Court after the broad appellate ruling that said off-campus student speech was beyond schools’ authority to punish. The dispute is the latest in a line of a cases that began withTinker vs Des Moines, the Vietnam-era case of a high school in Des Moines, Iowa, that suspended students who wore armbands to protest the war. In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court sided with the students, declaring students do not “shed their constitutional rights to freedom of speech or expression at the schoolhouse gate.”The court also held the n that schools retained the authority to restrict speech that would disrupt the school environment. Breyer wrote that Levy is case seemed less serious than its Vietnam-era predecessor, decided in 1969. In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that he would have upheld Levy is suspension. Pinellas School Board attorney David Koperski said he did not see any need to change the district is policies because of the ruling. He said the decision seemed to generally uphold 50 years of case law without breaking much new ground. He speculated that the court took up the case “not to make any new rules, but rather to essentially overturn the 3rd Circuit Appellate Court is statement that the seminal 1969 case ... did not appl yat all to off-campus speech.”That would have been a significant change, Koperski said. Jim Porter, the lawyer for the Hillsborough School Board, agreed that the ruling offered more of a clarification for school districts as they deal with student speech issues. The Hillsborough code of conduct does not spell out any specifics on student free speech.“I do not anticipate, based on this decision, we would have to change anything,” Porter said.

281,5 Essential Questions Teachers Should Ask During Job Interviews,0.0,37.0,https://www.edweek.org/jobs/5-essential-questions-teachers-should-ask-during-job-interviews/2021/06,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,25,"Interviewing for a teaching job can be a nerve-wracking experience. As a candidate, you can expect an onslaught of questions on everything including your strengths and weaknesses, classroom management strategies, and educational philosophy. But your job interview should not be a one-way street. Interviewers typically offer job candidates the chance to ask questions of their own. This year, the need to do so is more pressing than ever, as the pandemic begins to recede and everyone wants to know: Will schools return to “normal” in the fall? Will there be a “new normal” and, if so, what will that look like? Interviewing for teaching positions provides you with the perfect opportunity to find out. As you prepare to interview this recruiting season, make sure your list of inquiries for prospective employers includes the following:Will teachers be expected to teach in-person and remote learners simultaneously?As the worst of the pandemic began to recede and schools returned to in-person classes, many families chose to keep their kids at home. That often meant teachers were tasked with “hybrid teaching”—doubling up on their duties by providing instruction to both in-person and remote learners simultaneously.“It is nothing short of exhausting,” Jennifer Atkins, a 7th grade English teacher at Howell Middle School in Victoria, Texas,told Education Week last fall. “It is basically like teaching two different classes at the same time in one class period.”That seems to be the general consensus from teachers and others familiar with this demanding form of teaching. “We know for sure what does not work: doing both at the same time [teaching both online and in person],” said Jeff Plaman, online and digital learning specialist for the Minnesota education department. But, as late as this spring, some teachers still did not know if they would be required to continue hybrid teaching in the 2021-22 academic year. Before the interview ends, make sure you know if hybrid teaching could be in your future. What health and safety protocols has your district permanently adopted to minimize the risk of spreading COVID-19 and other contagious viruses?After the onset of the H1N1 flu in 2009, hand sanitizer dispensers began cropping up in schools and other public spaces; some of them remained years later. The COVID-19 pandemic, whose devastating impact has dwarfed that of the H1N1 flu, may come with its own set of lasting health and safety protocols. For teachers who come in contact with dozens or even hundreds of people in a given work week, such protocols may be of considerable interest. Whether the pandemic has left you weary of mask-wearing or willingly continuing to don one or even two masks when you leave your house, you will want to learn where a prospective employer stands on this and other health and safety policies. What resources has your district implemented or reinforced since the pandemic in support of students’ social and emotional learning needs?Even before the full impact of the pandemic had been realized, awareness of students’ social and emotional needs began to rise. In an exclusive survey by the EdWeek Research Center published in April 2020, 43 percent of respondents—principals, teachers, and district leaders—agreed that social-emotional learning is a “transformational way to improve public education.”A year later, educators continue to express the need to make SEL a priority.“The pandemic has made me realize that unless we find ways to focus on students as people and engage them as people and make the work we are doing important to them where they are now, everything is for nothing,” said David Finkle, a veteran language arts teacher in Florida is Volusia County school district. To find out how serious a prospective employer is about responding to the SEL needs of its students, ask specific questions like the following: Could you describe any initiatives and resources the school dedicates to SEL? How is SEL embedded in the curriculum? What types of training related to SEL do your teachers receive?How does your district support the mental health of its teachers?It is no secret that the pandemic has been hard on teachers; statistics bear this out. In a nationwide poll of K-12 employees published in February 2021, 63 percent of respondents reported that, during the pandemic, work made them feel stressed. More than half felt high levels of burnout/fatigue, while 47 percent said they experienced anxiety. Given the demanding circumstances surrounding the pandemic, preventing such negative feelings from surfacing may not have been possible. But how employers responded to their employees’ struggles during the pandemic—from simply acknowledging the challenges of teaching during the pandemic to making relevant resources available—can be revealing. To gauge a prospective employer is commitment to its teachers’ mental health, ask direct questions like: What did you do to support the mental health of your teachers during the pandemic? As a result of the pandemic, what new or expanded services have you added to support your teachers’ mental health?What did you learn about your school community is culture during the pandemic, and how will you apply that next year?The pandemic challenged school leaders in new and unforeseen ways; for instance, exposing deep equity gaps within and between school communities and shedding light on how rapidly social isolation can lead to student disengagement and academic failure. On the upside, the waning of the pandemic may afford school leaders time to reflect on the past year and a half, perhaps reinforcing or reevaluating their priorities. Find out by asking a prospective employer the following: What were the biggest challenges your school community faced during the pandemic? How did individual members of your school community demonstrate resilience in the face of the pandemic? What do you plan to do differently next year as a result?Listen carefully to the responses, both what is said and how genuine and confident the answers sound. If a prospective employer seems overwhelmed and defeated by what is taken place over the past 18 months, you may want to cross this school or district off your list.“You do not want to jump into a position that you do not feel capable of navigating,” said Jacqueline Rodriguez, the vice president for research, policy, and advocacy at the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education. After the year-and-a-half that educators have been through, Rodriguez is advice is more relevant than ever. Asking the right questions and getting clear answers in your upcoming job interviews is, too.",1,1,Education Week
282,Is DC statehood about fair representation or Democratic power grab?,12.33,36.67,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/4/21/22395777/dc-statehood-about-fair-representation-democratic-power-grab-romney-biden-lee-stewart,https://adfontesmedia.com/deseret-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-21,22,"House Democrats are poised to again pass a bill to make Washington, DC, the 51st state. But they will not get any help from Utah Republicans in Congress who see it as nothing more than a power grab. Though the margin might be slimmer this time, the House is expected to pass the Washington, DC, Admission Act for the second time in two years. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, DC is delegate in the House who can propose legislation but not vote on it, said proponents will make the case that Congress has the constitutional authority to admit the state of Washington, DC, and that it would meet all of the traditional elements lawmakers have considered in admission decisions. For the 220 years since the District of Columbia became the nation is capital, residents have always had all of the obligations of citizenship, including paying full federal taxes and serving in the armed forces, but have been excluded from much of American democracy, she said.“The citizens who live in our nation is capital have never had voting representation on the floor of either chamber of Congress, and Congress has always had the final say on their local affairs. This is uniquely un-American, and it is undemocratic,” Norton said. The bill would give residents full representation in Congress, while maintaining a federal district that would continue to serve as the nation is seat of government. Utah GOP Representative Chris Stewart said the push to make DC a state has nothing to do with whether the people of the District have fair representation. Democrats, he said, would not back the bill if DC were a reliably Republican area. DC residents voted 92% Democratic in the last presidential election.“This is about politics,” he said on KSL Newsradio. “This is about getting two solid Democratic members of the Senate. That allows them to pack the Supreme Court, allows them to break the filibuster, allows the Green New Deal, allows a whole bunch of incredibly progressive even radical legislation, and that is what they are trying to achieve by this.”Making DC a state would impact Utah in that it would make conservative principles espoused in the state harder to implement at the federal level, he said. DC residents chose to live there knowing they were living under “slightly different government accommodation, and they have known that for 200 years,” Stewart said. Making Washington, DC, a state is unconstitutional and not what the Founding Fathers intended, he said. It needs to remain autonomous and free from the influence of states and the federal government, he said. In 1788, the District of Columbia contained 100 square miles that were carved out of Virginia and Maryland. Thirty-one of those square miles were returned to Virginia in 1846, leaving the 69 that once had been part of Maryland. The District is 712,000 residents have no vote in Congress, but they do elect their own city council, mayor and school board. Senator Mitt Romney, R-Utah, does not favor DC statehood but suggested a compromise that would make the District part of a contiguous state and able to vote with that state.“My own view is that we should maintain the system we have and not try and pack the Senate, like the Democrats are trying to pack the Supreme Court,” he told reporters Tuesday. “But if there were a desire to provide greater representation for the people of DC, combining DC with Maryland, from which the land was originally taken, would make more sense.”Even if Norton is bill gets through the House, it would face obstacles in the Senate where it needs 60 votes to pass, meaning 10 Republicans would have to cross party lines.“Unequivocally, this about adding additional Democratic senators to the US Senate,” Senator Mike Lee, R-Utah, recently told the far-right cable channel One America News. “If people try to dress it up as anything other than that, I strongly disagree with them.”Lee said he understands residents’ arguments about representation but that the solution is not creating another state. He said there could be a state of Washington, DC, and a federal city that includes the Capitol, Supreme Court and White House.“I believe that there is a way to make it constitutional but it is still a horrible idea,” he said. If it is decided that DC does not need to be the nation is capital city and an independent district, the solution is to give it back to Maryland, Lee said. The Biden administration came out in support of Norton is legislation Tuesday. The Office of Management and Budget in a statement of administration policy called for Congress to “provide for a swift and orderly transition to statehood for the people of Washington, DC”“This taxation without representation and denial of self-governance is an affront to the democratic values on which our nation was founded,” according to the statement. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said last month that President Joe Biden “believes they deserve representation, that is why he supports DC statehood.”",1,2,Deseret News
283,"No, Tucker Carlson Did not Reveal Evidence of Mass Voter Fraud in Georgia",-2.0,48.33,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tucker-carlson-georgia-voter-fraud/,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"Six months after a disinformation campaign pushed by former US President Donald Trump and his supporters alleging mass-scale voter fraud incited a violent attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Fox News host Tucker Carlsontook to his show to again promote similar claims. In the lead-up to and aftermath of the 2020 election, Trump and his supporters falsely claimed the election was ""stolen"" by means of a massive voter fraud conspiracy, but never presented evidence for these claims that withstood scrutiny. Trump is own Department of Homeland Securitystatedthat the 2020 election, which took place during a pandemic, was, in fact, ""the most secure in American history."" Georgia is ballots have been counted three times. None of the lawsuits put forward by Trump or his supporters were successful in court and in fact, Trump is attorney in the matter, Rudy Giuliani, had his law license suspended for spreading election lies. Despite the fact that there is no evidence for claims of mass voter fraud and even though those claims have led to deadly violence, Carlson persisted in promoting them. The segment that aired on July 14, 2021, contained various claims that have either been already debunked, or are statements based on supposition and lack evidence. (We note that Carlson is employer, Fox News,arguedin a court case that Carlson is show should not be viewed as factual.)During his July 14 prime time show, Carlson stated, ""It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia last November."" He later added, ""That is not a conspiracy theory. It is true.""Carlson is July 14 segment cited the findings of an activist group called VoterGA The group supports Trump is false claims of massive election fraud and has embarked on a search for evidence of said fraud. Here is how Georgia Public Broadcastingdescribedthe group:The primary plaintiff is Garland Favorito of the group VoterGA, who has fought against Georgia is elections infrastructure for more than a decade, including a failed lawsuit against Georgia is old direct-recording electronic machines. Favorito has also questioned the authenticity of events surrounding 9/11, pushed conspiracy the ories about former President Bill Clinton and the assassination of John F Kennedyand is now serving as the latest vessel for false claims of fraud with the 2020 election. We will now look at the claims Carlson made on his show. The segment opened with a weeks-old piece of disinformation about an alarm sounding at an election warehouse in Fulton County. Carlsonstated:On a Saturday night in late May of this year, an alarm sounded in a big nondescript warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia. The warehouse was an unlikely place for a burglary. It was under round-the-clock surveillance by both private security and local law enforcement including armed deputies with the Fulton County Sheriff is Office. Any unauthorized person entering from the outside would have to get past a locked 100-pound steel door, as well as a maze of motion detectors -- not easy -- but someone tried to do it, anyway and at just the perfect moment, 20 minutes after the deputies in charge of guarding the warehouse left their posts. By the time those deputies returned to check out the alarm, someone had opened the 100-pound door to the warehouse. So, what happened that night? And why? We still do not know. In fact, we do know. Georgia Public Broadcasting reporter Stephen Fowler took to Twitter to point out that not only did Carlson use a photograph taken by Fowler without crediting him, the photograph was lifted from ast ory that explains why an alarm went off and what happened with the door. Fowlerreportedin June 2021 that the alarm did not come from the area where ballots were secured.""The source of the alarm was a motion detector in an upstairs office belonging to the Clerk of Superior Court in the warehouse, and the county said a test showed that alarm is audible from where the private security officers were stationed off property.""As for who opened the door, it was law enforcement. Fowler reported that two off-duty Douglas County Sheriff is officers in a marked patrol car approached the warehouse and found the outer door unlocked.""The officers opened it the mselves, and it was not 'left wide open,'"" as pro-Trump media had reported at the time, Fowler explained in the report. Carlson claimed VoterGA found double-scanned ballots accounted for more than 3,300 votes for President Joe Biden and 865 votes for Trump. But the re is no evidence thousands of double-scanned ballots were reflected in Georgia is official vote tally.""Surveillance footage obtained by VoterGA appears to show large numbers of ballots being scanned multiple times,"" Carlson stated. In this segment, Carlson directed viewers' attention to a woman wearing a yellow shirt in a video he said was obtained by VoterGA But that video does not prove that the state is election results were falsified by ballots scanned multiple times, and importantly, Georgia is election results were recounted after the election,including by hand. That means that if any ballots were scanned more than once, in order for it to end up in the final vote tally, those ballots would have needed to have been counted more than once in both the heavily-scrutinized machine recount sin the hand counts of the ballots. The video used by Carlson was from a surveillance camera at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, where ballots were being processed on the night of the election. Investigatorslooked into allegations of fraud at that time and found no evidence of wrongdoing. The closest Carlson came to offering an independent source for the figures he regurgitated from VoterGA was a July 13 report by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC). In doing so, not only did Carlson acknowledge that VoterGA is a problematic source on its own, he also misrepresented the Journal-Constitution is report. Carlson stated:Now before you dismiss [attorney] Bob Cheeley and Voter GA as dishonest partisan actors, keep in mind that the strongly left of center ""Atlanta Journal Constitution"" appears to agree with this at least in outline. The newspaper reviewed the available digital ballot images independently and concluded that hundreds of ballots were improperly duplicated. The AJC did not report that ""hundreds"" of ballots were improperly duplicated. Itreportedthat ""nearly 200"" ballots were scanned twice before a recount. An important part of the AJC report left out by Carlson was that there was ""no indication any vote for president was counted more than once in official results.""The newspaper, which offered readers the opportunity to look at ballot images the mselves, further reported:The ballots counted twice would have given Biden 31 extra votes. After a recount, official results reflected that Trump gained a total of 121 absentee votes in Fulton. Biden won the county with 73% of 524,000 votes cast. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also verified the duplicate ballots in ballot images obtained under the Georgia Open Records Act and posted online. Although it is true that a small number of ballots were duplicated in Fulton County, the numbers are nowhere near as large as Carlson claimed; and contrary to what Carlson stated, the amount would not have changed the outcome of the presidential election. The source for this assertion is a July 13news release posted by VoterGA which claimed that the group found ""7 falsified audit tally sheets containing fabricated vote totals for their respective batches.""This claim originated with a comparison made by VoterGA between ballot batches from the initial election machine count to ballot batches from the state is manual recount and audit, per Mark Niesse, reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution who has covered the election and its aftermath. But a discrepancy between those two numbers is not evidence of fabricated vote totals or even of wrongdoing. At this time, we do not know how election workers sorted and counted ballots. But Niesse pointed out that neither the initial count nor the audit were the the official, certified vote totals for the presidential race. Theofficial results came from the machine recount requested by Trump. He also pointed out that the official tally closely matched the initial count. Carlson cited a ""whistleblower"" who stated she saw mail-in ballots without creases on them.""That is strange because of course mail-in ballots need to be bent in order to be mailed in,"" Carlson observed. Georgia election official Gabriel Sterling explained this to The New York Times in an interview published January 4 about false election fraud claims being promoted by Trump and his supporters:TRUMP’S CLAIM: That officials improperly counted “pristine” ballots — meaning ballots that were not folded, indicating that they had not arrived in an envelope. STERLING’S EXPLANATION: “Pristine” ballots are not unusual, Mr. Sterling said. For instance, many military and overseas voters receive electronic ballots that they print out, complete and mail back. But these printed ballots are not the right size for scanners, so election workers have a standard process for transferring the votes to scannable ballots. A ballot that gets damaged and ca not be scanned may be transferred in the same way.""""Nearly 35,000 Georgia voters moved out of their county of residence more than a month prior to election day,"" Carlson said. ""They were ineligible to vote. And yet they did.""This claim comes from a July 12storypublished by the pro-Trumpwebsite The Federalist. Although the article cites an ""expert in voter data analytics and residency issues"" named Mark Davis, it does not link to his work. It only reports that he compared two different databases, the US Postal Service national change of address database and data from the Georgia Secretary of State is Office, and came up with a figure: 35,000 Georgians registered a change of address but voted in their old county. But The Federalist admitted the reason for this is not known and it may be perfectly legitimate in most cases:While some of those nearly 35,000 voters may have been students, members of the military, or may have only relocated temporarily—situations which do not affect an individual is residency for purposes of election law—everyone else in this group voted illegally under Georgia law. Now we are seeing from Davis’ further research that as of May 2021, more than 10,300 of those individuals have updated their voter registration to their new address, the reby confirming that the move they had previously informed the USPS of was permanent. Insinuating that there were 10,300 votes cast by people illegally is pure supposition, however. No evidence is offered that this number, if accurate, represents 10,300 illegally cast votes. About that, The Washington Postreportedthat ""If true — again, this is unproven third-party analysis — it is illegal in the sense that going 67 in a 65 is illegal, not in the sense that you are driving a stolen car.""",2,2,Snopes
284,John Pilger: The Most Lethal Virus is Not Covid-19. It is War.,-32.67,11.0,https://consortiumnews.com/2020/12/14/john-pilger-the-most-lethal-virus-is-not-covid-19-it-is-war/,https://adfontesmedia.com/consortium-news-bias-reliability/,2020-12-14,23,"Armed Services Memorial.(Geograph/David Dixon)ritain is Armed Services Memorial is a silent, haunting place. Set in the rural beauty of Staffordshire, in an arboretum of some 30,000 trees and sweeping lawns, its Homeric figures celebrate determination and sacrifice. The names of more than 16,000 British servicemen and women are listed. The literature says they “died in operational theatre or were targeted by terrorists”. On the day I was the re, a stonemason was adding new names to those who have died in some 50 operations across the world during what is known as “peacetime”. Malaya, Ireland, Kenya, Hong Kong, Libya, Iraq, Palestine and many more, including secret operations, such as Indochina. Not a year has passed since peace was declared in 1945 that Britain has not sent military forces to fight the wars of empire. Not a year has passed when countries, mostly poor and riven by conflict, have not bought or have been “soft loaned” British arms to further the wars, or “interests”, of empire. Empire? What empire? The investigative journalist Phil Miller recently revealed inDeclassifiedthat Boris Johnson is Britain maintained 145 military sites – call them bases — in 42 countries. Johnson has boasted that Britain is to be “the foremost naval power in Europe”. In the midst of the greatest health emergency in modern times, with more than 4 million surgical procedures delayed by the National Health Service, Johnson has announced a record increase of £16.5 billion in so-called defence spending – a figure that would restore the under-resourced NHS many times over. But these billions are not for defence. Britain has no enemies other than those within who betray the trust of its ordinary people, its nurses and doctors, its carers, elderly, homeless and youth, as successive neo-liberal governments have done, Conservative and Labour. Exploring the serenity of the National War Memorial, I soon realised there was not a single monument, or plinth, or plaque, or rosebush honouring the memory of Britain is victims — the civilians in the “peacetime” operations commemorated here. Strechters Bearer Sculpture.(Geograph/David Dixon)There is no remembrance of the Libyans killed when their country was wilfully destroyed by Prime Minister David Cameron and his collaborators in Paris and Washington. There is no word of regret for the Serbian women and children killed by British bombs, dropped from a safe height on schools, factories, bridges, towns, on the orders of Tony Blair; or for the impoverished Yemeni children extinguished by Saudi pilots with their logistics and targets supplied by Britons in the air-conditioned safety of Riyadh; or for the Syrians starved by “sanctions”. There is no monument to the Palestinian children murdered with the British elite is enduring connivance, such as the recent campaign that destroyed a modest reform movement within the Labour Party with specious accusations of anti-Semitism. Two weeks ago, Israel is military chief of staff and Britain is Chief of the Defence Staff signed an agreement to “formalise and enhance” military co-operation. This was not news. More British arms and logistical support will now flow to the lawless regime in Tel Aviv, whose snipers target children and psychopaths interrogate children in extreme isolation. (See the recent shocking report by Defense for Children,Isolated and Alone). Perhaps the most striking omission at the Staffordshire war memorial is an acknowledgement of the million Iraqis whose lives and country were destroyed by the illegal invasion of Blair and Bush in 2003. ORB, a member of the British Polling Council, put the figure at 1.2 million. In 2013, the ComRes organisation asked a cross-section of the British public how many Iraqis had died in the invasion. A majority said fewer than 10,000. How is such a lethal silence sustained in a sophisticated society? My answer is that propaganda is far more effective in societies that regard the mselves as free than in dictatorships and autocracies. I include censorship by omission. Our propaganda industries – both political and cultural, including most of the media – are the most powerful, ubiquitous and refined on earth. Big lies can be repeated incessantly in comforting, credible BBC voices. Omissions are no problem. A similar question relates to nuclear war, whose threat is “of no interest”, to quote Harold Pinter. Russia, a nuclear power, is encircled by the war-making group known as Nato, with British troops regularly “maneuvering” right up to the border where Hitler invaded. The defamation of all things Russian, not least the historical truth that the Red Army largely won the Second World War, is percolated into public consciousness. The Russians are of “no interest”, except as demons. The centrepiece of the Memorial comprises two large bronze sculptures, the work of Ian Rank-Broadley, representing loss and sacrifice.(Geograph/David Dixon). China, also a nuclear power, is the brunt of unrelenting provocation, with American strategic bombers and drones constantly probing its territorial space and – hooray – HMS Queen Elizabeth, Britain is £3billion aircraft carrier, soon to sail 6,500 miles to enforce “freedom of navigation” within sight of the Chinese mainland. Some 400 American bases encircle China, “rather like a noose”, a former Pentagon planner said to me. They extend all the way from Australia, though the Pacific to southern and northern Asia and across Eurasia. In South Korea, a missile system known as Terminal High Altitude Air Defense, or THAAD, is aimed point-blank at China across the narrow East China Sea. Imagine Chinese missiles in Mexico or Canada or off the coast of California. A few years after the invasion of Iraq, I made a film calledThe War You Do not See, in which I asked leading American and British journalists as well as TV news executives – people I knew as colleagues — why and how Bush and Blair were allowed to get away with the great crime in Iraq, considering that the lies were not very clever. Their response surprised me. Had “we”, they said – that is journalists and broadcasters, especially in the US — challenged the claims of the White House and Downing Street, investigated and exposed the lies, instead of amplifying and echoing the m, the invasion of Iraq in 2003 probably would not have happened. Countless people would be alive today. Four million refugees would not have fled. The grisly ISIS, a product of the Blair/Bush invasion, might not have been conceived. David Rose, the n with the LondonObserver, which supported the invasion, described “the pack of lies fed to me by a fairly sophisticated disinformation campaign”. Rageh Omah, the n the BBC is man in Iraq, told me, “We failed to press the most uncomfortable buttons hard enough”. Dan Rather, the CBS anchorman, agreed, as did many others. I admired these journalists who broke the silence. But they are honourable exceptions. Today, the war drums have new and highly enthusiastic beaters in Britain, America and the “West”. Take your pick among the legion of Russia and China bashers and promoters of fiction such as Russiagate. My personal Oscar goes to Peter Hartcher ofTheSydney Morning Herald,whose unrelenting rousing drivel about the “existential threat” (of China/Russia, mostly China) was illustrated by a smiling Scott Morrison, the PR man who is Australia is prime minister, dressed like Churchill, V for Victory sign and all. “Not since the 1930s ….” the pair of them intoned. Ad nauseum. Covid has provided cover for this pandemic of propaganda. In July, Morrison took his cue from Trump and announced that Australia, which has no enemies, would spend A$270 billion on provoking one, including missiles that could reach China. That China is purchase of Australia is minerals and agriculture effectively underwrote the Australian economy was “of no interest” to the government in Canberra. The Australian media cheered almost as one, delivering a shower of abuse at China. Thousands of Chinese students, who had guaranteed the gross salaries of Australian vice-chancellors, were advised by their government to go elsewhere. Chinese-Australians were bad-mouthed and deliverymen were assaulted. Colonial racism is never hard to revive. Some years ago, Iinterviewedthe former head of the CIA in Latin America, Duane Clarridge. In a few refreshingly honest words, he summed up “Western” foreign policy as it is ordained and directed by Washington. The super-power, he said, could do what it wanted where it wanted whenever its “strategic interests” dictated. His words were: “Get used to it, world.”I have reported a number of wars. I have seen the remains of children and women and the elderly bombed and burned to death: their villages laid to waste, their petrified trees festooned with human parts. And much else. Perhaps that is why I reserve a specific contempt for those who promote the crime of rapacious war, who beckon it with bad faith and profanities, having never experienced it the mselves. Their monopoly must be broken. This is a version of an address John Pilger gave to a Stop the War fund-raiser, Artists Speak Out, in London. In 2017, the British Library announced a John Pilger Archive of all his written and filmed work.

Although only five cases of the B.1.1.7 variant have been confirmed in Louisiana and the overall pattern of coronavirus cases is trending downward after a months-long surge, officials made grim predictions about the likelihood that vaccinations and distancing can keep up with the more easily transmissible version of the virus.“I believe we have another spike in our future before this pandemic is over for us” said Dr. Joe Kanter, interim assistant secretary of the Office of Public Health. “And I think that is going to be because of the B.1.1.7 variant.”The variant, first identified in southern England, has rapidly spread through the UK, Ireland and Denmark. Data from the UK suggests it is about 50% more transmissible. Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have predicted it will become the dominant strain in the US by March. The Louisiana Department of Health is doubling down on efforts to increase surveillance for new and more contagious variants of the coronaviru…“This number is going to keep going up and up and up,” said Kanter. “This variant is going to continue to circulate, it is going to continue to take hold in Louisiana and drive transmission.”The confirmed cases announced Tuesday highlighted the precarious position Louisiana and other US states find the mselves in amid a rollout of vaccines that is slower than initially hoped. As state and local officials rush to vaccinate residents, the transmissibility of the new variant threatens to outpace the effect of inoculations. The state has increased its surveillance of the faster-spreading coronavirus variant. Prior to January 25, the state sent just five samples every other week to the CDC for genome sequencing to identify variants. Since the n, the CDC increased that number to between 10 and 22 samples. But to understand how quickly the variant is hopping from host to host, the state would need to sequence hundreds of genomes, said Robert Garry, a virologist at Tulane University who has studied viruses for over four decades. None of the confirmed or suspected cases came from the CDC is genome sequencing. Those cases were flagged by a certain PCR test that also spits out data suggestive of a variant. That particular PCR test, manufactured by Thermo Fisher, is not used all over the state, according to health department officials. That may be a reason why the variant cases have so far only been identified in Region 1, which includes New Orleans, and Region 5, which includes southwest Louisiana. Mutations are the result of small copying errors that occur during the virus replication process. Most of those mutations are inconsequential, said Garry. But every so often, a mutation makes the virus more successful in accomplishing its goal: to infect cells and use them to replicate. When a certain group of mutations starts appearing in large numbers, that is an indicator that something about them is beneficial enough that it is increasing the spread. Scientists call this group of mutations a variant. The B.1.1.7 variant has 17 different mutations, the most concerning being a few that alter how easily the virus can slip into cells using its spike proteins. When Ricky Salvaggio signed up for the Moderna vaccine trial in July, he did not think it was a big deal. A retired pharmacist, the 66-year-old…With Mardi Gras approaching and restrictions relaxing at some businesses, experts who track the evolution of viruses worry it may create ideal conditions for the virus to hop from person to person.“We are giving the virus a free-rein playground to operate in,” said Garry. “There are not going be parades and things like that, we will not see people congregate the same way, but whenever people get together in a situation where they are not wearing masks and in a crowded space, that is an opportunity for this virus to infect a bunch more people.”Other more infectious variants, such as the South African variant and the Brazil variant, have not yet been found in Louisiana, but they have been detected in other states.",2,2,NOLA.com

He had good reason to tell the truth. His agreement with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said one lie, and it is go to jail. Still, the FBI had another take on the man. It appears that the agency may not have had Trump in its sights first. Almost a year before FBI agents raided Cohen is home, office, hotel, and bank deposit box the agency believed that the man was spying for a foreign government. The court has just released hundreds of pages of documents, including the numerous heavily redacted search warrants and related materials that led up to that raid. The agents had been interested in Cohen is business interests far earlier than indicated, since July 2017. That was what led to the Manhattan raids, not Trump is activities. The FBI obtained Cohen is Gmail accounts, and information within them gave the FBI the probable cause that justified the raid. Before a raid can occur, the FBI must give the judge enough proof of specific crimes to convince him or her to sign the warrant. The FBI covered itself by submitting eight different application, affidavits, and search warrants amounting to reams of related pages. The agency must also list the suspected crimes, and they did, according theCourthouse News Service:‘…the FBI had probable cause to justify the raid on the grounds of suspected bank fraud, money laundering, acting as an unregistered foreign agent and violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.’The FBI walked away with over four million electronic and paper files in their raid on Cohen, the Courthouse News Service reported:‘The FBI is raid on Cohen is home, hotel and office yielded more than 4 million electronic and paper files in the searches, more than a dozen mobile devices and iPads, 20 external hard drives, flash drives, and laptops.’Cohen is attorney Lanny Davis released a statement the night prior to the search warrants being served on his client. He wrote:‘Only furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump Organization to law enforcement and Congress.’The released documents revealed that the FBI was especially interested in Cohen is links to the Ukrianian-born Russian oligarch linked to President Vladimir Putin, Viktor Vekselberg. Cohen was not the only link to Ukrainian oligarchs. Davis was the co-counsel to this one, Dmytro Firtash. It appears that Trump is television attorney Rudy Giuliani had also been recently tied to the Russian mobster, Semion Mogilevich. The stew just keeps getting thicker and thicker, spicier and spicier. Davis claimed that Firtash was an “innocent man.” However, the Obama administration indicted him for playing a part in “an international titanium scheme,” the Courthouse News reported. Cohen had set up a shell company named Essential Consultants LLC He had also set up a bank account with a First Republic bank in conjunction with the shell company just one month prior to the 2016 presidential election. Earlier, Cohen said the company was involved in real estate. He lied. A FBI agent wrote this about Cohen:‘Specifically, the account was not intended to receive – and does not appear to have received – money in connection to real estate consulting work; in addition, the account has received substantial payments from foreign sources.’and other media encouraged US District Judge William Pauley III to release these documents with an open-records request in October. This was months prior to the judge sentencing the president is private attorney to three years in prison for a “veritable smorgasbord of fraudulent conduct. Then last month, Pauley wrote:‘These applications implicate the familiar tension between public access to judicial records and the integrity of law enforcement investigations —interests arguably magnified by the intense scrutiny of Cohen is criminal case by the media, the general public, and even the president of the USs.’attorney David McCraw wrote:‘Simply put, the public interest in knowing the underlying bases for the investigation could not be higher.’Judge Pauley let the government to release redacted documents, because there are ongoing investigations. Cohen has said that his was implicated in campaign finance crimes, as was Trump. No related posts.",0,0,Bipartisan Report

289,COVID-19 vaccine inequity: Inside the cutthroat race to secure doses,-5.0,46.33,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/18/covid-19-vaccine-inequity/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"PARIS — No one disputes that the world is unfair. But no one expected a vaccine gap between the global rich and poor that was this bad, this far into the pandemic. Inequity is everywhere: Inoculations go begging in the USs while Haiti, a short plane ride away, received its first delivery July 15 after months of promises — 500,000 doses for a population over 11 million. Canada has procured more than 10 doses for every resident; Sierra Leone is vaccination rate just cracked 1% on June 20. It is like a famine in which “the richest guys grab the baker,” said Strive Masiyiwa, the African Union is envoy for vaccine acquisition. In fact, European and American officials deeply involved in bankrolling and distributing the vaccines against coronavirus have told The Associated Press there was no thought of how to handle the situation globally. Instead, they jostled for their own domestic use. But there are more specific reasons why vaccines have and have not reached the haves and have-nots. COVID-19 unexpectedly devastated wealthy countries first — and some of them were among the few places that make the vaccines. Export restrictions kept the doses within their borders. There was a global purchase plan to provide vaccines for poorer countries, but it was so flawed and under funded that it could not compete in the cutthroat competition to buy. Intellectual property rights vied with global public health for priority. Rich countries expanded vaccinations to younger and younger people, ignored the repeated pleas of health officials to donate their doses instead and debated booster shots – – even as poor countries could not vaccinate the most susceptible. The disparity was in some ways inevitable; wealthy nations expected a return on their investment of taxpayer money. But the scale of the inequity, the stockpiling of unused vaccines, the lack of a viable global plan to solve a global problem has shocked health officials, though it was not the first time.“This was a deliberate global architecture of unfairness,” Masiyiwa told a Milkin Institute conference.“We have no access to vaccines either as donations or available for us to purchase. Am I surprised? No, because this is where we were with the HIV pandemic. Eight years after the rapeutics were available in the West, we did not receive them and we lost 10 million people.”“It is simple math,” he said. “We have no access. We have no vaccine miracle.”___The World Health Organization has duly updated its epidemic playbook after every outbreak, most recently with Ebola in mind. Then, as often in the decades before, an emerging illness was largely contained to countries lacking robust public health services, with poor sanitation and crowded living conditions and limited travel connections. For years, the WHO assessed countries’ readiness for a flu pandemic: The USs, European countries and even India ranked near the to p. The US readiness was 96%, and Britain at 93%. On January 30, 2020, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak in China to be a global emergency. It would be months before the word “pandemic” became official. But that same day, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations, or CEPI, was planning for the worst. CEPI announced “a call for proven vaccine technologies applicable for large scale manufacturing,” according to minutes from its scientific advisory group. CEPI said it would be critical “to support the strategy for global access” early in the game. CEPI quickly invested in two promising coronavirus vaccines being developed by Moderna and CureVac.“We said very early on that it would be important to have a platform where all countries could draw vaccines from, where the re is accountability and transparency,” said Christian Happi, a professor at Nigeria is Redeemer is University and a member of CEPI is scientific advisory committee. “But the whole idea was that we thought rich countries would fund it for the developing world.”Happi said officials never expected the pandemic would strike first and hardest in Europe and the US Or that their assessment of preparedness in the world is most advanced economies would prove horrifically optimistic. Global health experts would soon come to realize that rich countries “could sign a piece of paper saying they believe in equity, but as soon as the chips are down, they will do whatever they want,” he said. On March 16, five days after WHO first described COVID-19 as a “pandemic,” the novel mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna was injected into a trial participant for the first time. By the n, the disease was tearing through the elderly populations of Europe and the USs. Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech were the first companies to come out with an mRNA vaccine, devising methods of mass production almost on the fly. Scientists at Britain is Oxford University also came up with a vaccine with a more traditional platform, and Bill Gates broker ed a deal for them to partner with AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company with global reach but no experience in vaccine production. On April 30, the deal was confirmed: AstraZeneca took sole responsibility for the global production and distribution of the Oxford vaccine and pledged to sell it for “a few dollars a dose.” Over the next few weeks, the US and Britain secured agreements totaling 400 million doses from AstraZeneca. The race to make and secure vaccines was on, and the USs and Britain were leagues in front of the rest of the world — a lead they would not lose. Still, both countries would see life expectancy decline by at least a year in 2020, the biggest drop since World War II In the European Union, 22 countries saw their average lifespans cut short, with Italy leading the list.___But as grim as the situation was, all those countries had a major advantage: They were home to the pharmaceutical companies with the most promising vaccine candidates, the world is most advanced production facilities, and the money to fund both. On May 15, 2020, President Donald Trump announced Operation Warp Speed and promised to deliver vaccines against coronavirus by New Year is. With unparalleled money and ambition behind the project, Warp Speed head Moncef Slaoui was more confident than his counterparts in Europe that a vaccine was in the offing. He signed contracts almost without regard to price or conditions.“We were frankly focused on getting this as fast as humanly possible. If I had to redo it, I probably should have voiced more of a global dimension,” said Slaoui. “The operation had focused, which was frankly also part of its success, on staying out of the politics and making the vaccines.”The idea of including clauses to ensure that vaccines would go to anyone besides Americans was not even considered. At the same time, the US repeatedly invoked the Defense Production Act — 18 times under the Trump Administration and at least once under Biden. The moves barred exports of crucial raw materials as factories were ramping up production of the as-yet-unapproved vaccines — and eventually, of the vaccines the mselves. But it also meant those materials would run low in much of the rest of the world. The US stranglehold would lift only in spring 2021, and only partially. Operation Warp Speed supercharged the global race to secure vaccines, but it would still take another two weeks until COVAX — the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility — was formally announced as the entity to ensure equity, with the Serum Institute of India as the core supplier for the developing world. COVAX had the backing of the World Health Organization, CEPI, vaccines alliance Gavi and the powerful Gates Foundation. What it did not have was cash, and without cash it could secure no contracts.“Operation Warp Speed signed the first public deals and that started a chain reaction,” said Gian Gandhi, UNICEF is COVAX coordinator for supply. “It was a like a rush on the banks, but to buy up the expected supply.”Some involved in the COVAX project flagged India as a potential problem early on, according to minutes of meetings in late spring and early summer of 2020. India is government had blocked exports of protective gear, but many global health authorities who had not fully grasped the extent of pandemic nationalism found it unimaginable that the country would block vaccines when the world was counting on them. Also, India had so far been spared the waves of death that were sweeping across Europe and the Americas. A separate plan put forward by the government of Costa Rica and the World Health Organization to create a technology-sharing platform to expand vaccine production foundered. Not a single company agreed to share its blueprints, even for a fee — and no government pushed them behind the scenes, according to multiple people involved in the project. On the global scale, the one organization that could have pushed for more technology sharing was the Gates Foundation, whose money to WHO nearly matches that of the US government. Instead, Bill Gates defended stringent intellectual property rights as the best way to speed innovation. His foundation poured money and influence into the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, which also failed to generate the money or influence needed to ramp up production outside already existing hubs. In the USs, meanwhile, manufacturing and the trials went on in parallel, which is where taxpayers and the companies took enormous risks that paid off for both. But in retrospect, Slaoui said, given the sheer amount of taxpayer money involved, each time they signed new contracts the US and other countries could have pushed companies harder to share their knowledge, if only for the duration of the pandemic.“From a geopolitical standpoint, it is critical that they do that,” he said. Nowhere was the situation more dire than Africa. In February, WHO is African expert in vaccine development, Richard Mihigo, was among many who said the continent is experience with other pandemics had uniquely prepared it for a complex vaccine deployment. Five months later, contemplating the plight of a continent that gets 99% of its vaccines from abroad, Mihigo adds a rueful footnote: “One of the lessons we learned from this pandemic is how badly prepared we were in vaccine production in the region and how dependent we were on imports.”Those imports have only barely begun to materialize — and they are insufficient to meet even the limited goals of the COVAX initiative to vaccinate at least 20% of the population of 92 low- and middle-income countries by the end of this year.___From the start, the coalition of organizations that created COVAX found the mselves fighting the last war. The plan was designed as an international pool to spur demand for vaccines and treatment of diseases with a relatively small global footprint, said Winnie Byanyima, head of UNAIDS Something like Ebola. But the coronavirus pandemic looked nothing like an Ebola outbreak.“That itself was a structural weakness,” she said. Although the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund had between them set aside billions for vaccinating the developing world, that money was intended to go to countries and was out of bounds for a global vaccine sharing plan like COVAX, said Mike Muldoon, managing director for innovative finance at the Rockefeller Foundation. Meanwhile, governments competed to secure contracts for vaccines by the hundreds of millions. On December 8, Britain became the first country to formally authorize a start to widespread vaccinations, injecting 90-year-old Margaret Keenan with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Six days later, the USs started its own vaccinations. And on December 26, the EU followed suit. China and Russia had been vaccinating even before releasing data from their homegrown inoculations. The Western companies with the most promising doses, including Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca, had by the n been churning out vials for months before formal approval, based on pledges from the wealthy countries that an enormous market awaited. Those doses were stockpiled in Europe and North America and a small number of countries, like Israel, that paid a premium. COVAX pleaded for cash to do the same. Instead, it got pledges.“As time passed and it became clear which vaccine candidates were going to be the leading contenders and which were most likely to succeed, the governments that had resources went and bought the supplies,” CEPI chief executive Dr. Richard Hatchett told the AP. “COVAX was not in a position to do that.”Months later, when COVAX finally had the money to sign deals for global supplies, Hatchett acknowledged they were at the end of the line. The lack of capital available to vaccine makers to boost their capacity outside the small number of existing manufacturing hubs was also “a lost opportunity,” Hatchett said.“We approached the international financing institutions, including the World Bank and the (International Finance Corporation) about making those investments and they were not willing to do that,” he said. CEPI ended up investing about $1.5 billion, far less than what a major financial institution might have been able to commit. COVAX missed its own goal of beginning vaccinations in poor countries at the same time as rich ones. It finally delivered vaccines on February 24, to Ghana, a load of 600,000 AstraZeneca doses manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and transported by UNICEF planes. By that date, 27% of the population in Britain had been vaccinated, 13% in the US, 5% in Europe — and 0.23% in Africa, in countries that had secured their own bilateral deals after growing impatient with COVAX delays. The rift was growing by millions of doses every day. And pharmaceutical plants were beginning to crumble under the promises they’d made. AstraZeneca announced repeated delivery cuts to Europe. Pfizer is production briefly slowed. A fire at a Serum Institute construction site prompted a letter to Brazil warning that “supply to you cannot be guaranteed in the foreseeable months.” Moderna supply cuts soon followed to Britain and Canada. In the USs, officials to ssed millions of corrupted doses of vaccine from the Emergent Biosolutions plant in Baltimore after discovering that workers had inadvertently blended ingredients from the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. An untold number of doses were never produced because of new restrictions meant to prevent errors. Many of those vaccines were intended for export. So COVAX had to hope that the AstraZeneca vaccine being produced in India would come through, because it had secured few of the innovative mRNA doses that are now considered the most effective against the coronavirus variants. The initial refrigeration requirements were daunting, and the price was higher than the traditional vaccine candidates. The mRNA vaccines are widely considered a scientific and manufacturing triumph — and a risky bet. Never before approved for use against any disease, they are now considered a hugely promising medical innovation and a potential game changer against infection. But by the time it was clear the mRNA doses were a viable alternative, even in poor countries with limited cold chain, the available supply had been snapped up in Europe, the USs and Canada. And India, in the throes of its own COVID-19 surge, diverted its vaccines for its own use. According to the People is Vaccine Alliance, a grouping of human rights organizations advocating for broader sharing of vaccines and their underlying technology, the coronavirus has created nine new billionaires. The top six are linked to the successful mRNA vaccines. For Byanyima, of UNAIDS, this is a travesty and a sign that the world has learned little in the decades since the AIDS pandemic was brought under control in the USs, only to kill millions in Africa because treatments were unaffordable: “Medicines should be a global public good, not just like a luxury handbag you buy on the market.”COVAX has delivered only 107 million doses, and now is forced to rely upon uncertain donations from countries that may prefer to donate directly to the needy, so they can receive the credit. A readout from its June board meeting slipped in an acknowledgement that it needed to better interpret and respond to market conditions and “the reality that a higher risk appetite is needed in a pandemic setting.”___For the pharmaceutical industry, mRNA is the ultimate confirmation that hard work and risk-taking is rewarded. And those companies keep tight hold on the keys to their successful vaccines. When Moderna and Pfizer created new production lines, it was in the insular European and American manufacturing networks that had as much stake as anyone in both ensuring that the injections meet the highest standards and keeping promises not to abuse intellectual property. Many public health officials have pushed for technology transfer during the pandemic. Initially resistant, the Gates Foundation has changed its position in favor of sharing. Dr. Clemence Auer, the EU is lead negotiator for vaccine contracts last summer, said the question of compelling pharmaceutical companies to suspend their vaccine intellectual property rights to increase the worldwide supply of coronavirus vaccines never even came up.“We had a mandate to buy vaccines, not totalk about intellectual property, ” Auer said.“The global community should have had this discussion back in 2020 but that did not happen,” he said. “Maybe we should have done it last year, but now it is too late. It is spilled milk.”CEPI includes equity clauses in the vaccines that it invests in, among them the successful Moderna candidate, but has yet to invoke them during the pandemic. Some include requirements to make a vaccine available to populations in need at affordable prices, as is the case in CEPI is Moderna contract. But Moderna was first available exclusively in wealthy countries and even now only limited amounts are going outside Europe and the USs. A separate push to lift intellectual property restrictions on vaccines and medicines has also gone nowhere in the World Trade Organization. And WHO is reticent to criticize donor nations or the pharmaceutical companies. The UN health agency works by consensus and needs them for other aspects of global health — and for its own continued existence. The Biden administration has reversed Trump is decision to de fund and leave WHO, but the damage has been done.“A lot of these multinational organizations, these plans, these coalitions, they do not have teeth to enforce what they think is a fair and equitable way to distribute resources,” said Dr. Ingrid Katz, an infectious disease researcher at the Center for Global Health at Massachusetts General Hospital. She said the key question is whether vaccines and essential medications are a commodity or a right.“If it is going to be a commodity, we are going to keep walking down this road every time we have something like this,” she said. And if it is all going to rely on the generosity of rich countries, a lot of people are going to die. Four million have died already. In all, at the recent Group of Seven meeting of wealthy nations pledged to donate 850 million doses, compared with the 11 billion that WHO says will be needed to end the pandemic. A close look at the G-7 promises of donations shows that most are not expected to be delivered until well into 2022. The Biden administration fell short on its pledge to send 80 million doses abroad by the end of June: By mid-July, at least 44 million doses had been sent, including 2.5 million to Canada, which has already given at least one vaccine dose to more of its population than any other country. Africa has yet to receive its doses from the USs.___Oceans away from the deprivation of the developing world, 7-year-old Russell Bright and his 5-year-old brother went to Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans to get their shots — part of a trial for young children. Maybe they got the vaccine; maybe they got the placebo. Wearing a Spider-Man mask, Russell said he longs for a vacation trip to the water park and the n a return to school without having to wear masks and stay at arms’ length from his friends.“Both me and my wife are already vaccinated,” said his father, Adam, “and so the sooner I can get them vaccinated and to feel comfortable being outside, not having to wear a mask, I thought the easiest way to get it is to go through the trial.”Scientists agree that children are at low risk from COVID-19. But that has not stopped richer countries from stockpiling precious vaccine supplies to inoculate the young, even as poor countries have few or no shots to give. A recent meeting of WHO is vaccine allocation group disbanded with nothing accomplished, because there was no vaccine to allocate. “Zero doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, zero doses of Pfizer vaccine, zero doses of J&J vaccine,” said Dr. Bruce Aylward, a senior advisor at the organization.“Every single one of our suppliers is unable to supply during this period because others are making demands on those products, others who are vaccinating very young populations that are not at risk,” Aylward said. Both Trump and Biden administration officials reject the notion that the US or any country would share vaccines until they’d protected their own. And they both note that the US bore the brunt of the pandemic last year, to pping the world in confirmed cases and deaths.“We had a responsibility to what I say, ‘put on our own oxygen masks before helping others,’” CDC Director Rachelle Walensky said in May But a plummeting jet takes all passengers with it, whether or not they are wearing masks. And the failure to provide vaccines across the globe ensures that COVID-19 will continue to spread, and mutate, and sicken, and kill.“It speaks volumes about where we are as a globe when you have the source of decision-making sitting with very few people who have a lot of wealth and are essentially making life and death decisions for the rest of the globe,” Mass General is Katz said. “Every month that we lost put us further and further behind.”___Maria Cheng reported from London, and Aniruddha Ghosal from New Delhi.

290,"Reflecting the Authoritarian Climate, Washington Will Remain Militarized Until At Least March",14.33,35.0,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/reflecting-the-authoritarian-climate,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-26,16,"beginning the week leading up to Joe Biden is inauguration, when 20,000 National Guard troops we redeployed onto the streets of the nation is capital. The original justification was that this show of massive force was necessary to secure the inauguration in light of the January 6 riot at the Capitol. But with the inauguration over and done, those troops remain and are not going anywhere any time soon. Working with federal law enforcement agencies, the National Guard Bureau announced on Monday that between 5,000 and 7,000 troops will remain in Washington untilmid-March. The rationale for this extraordinary, sustained domestic military presence has shifted several times, typically from anonymous US law enforcement officials. The original justification — the need to secure the inaugural festivities — is obviously no longer operative. So the new claim became that the impeachment trial of former President Trump that will take place in the Senate in February necessitated military reinforcements. On Sunday,quoted“four people familiar with the matter” to claim that “Trump is upcoming Senate impeachment trial poses a security concern that federal law enforcement officials told lawmakers last week requires as many as 5,000 National Guard troops to remain in Washington through mid-March.”The next day,,citing“a US official,” said the ongoing troop deployment was needed due to “ominous chatter about killing legislators or attacking them outside of the US Capitol.” But the anonymous official acknowledged that “the threats that law enforcement agents are tracking vary in specificity and credibility.” Even National Guard troops complained that they “have so far been given no official justifications, threat reports or any explanation for the extended mission — nor have they seen any violence thus far.”what an extreme state of affairs it is to have a military presence in American streets. Prior deployments have been rare, and usually were approved for a limited period and/or in order to quell a very specific, ongoing uprising — to ensure the peaceful segregation of public schools in the South, to respond to the unrest in Detroit and Chicago in the 1960s, or to quell the 1991 Los Angeles riots that erupted after the Rodney King trial. Deploying National Guard or military troops for domestic law enforcement purposes is so dangerous that laws in place from the country is founding strictly limit its use. It is meant only as a last resort, when concrete, specific threats are so overwhelming that they cannot be quelled by regular law enforcement absent military reinforcements. Deploying active military troops is an even graver step than putting National Guard soldiers on the streets, but they both present dangers. As Trump is Defense Secretarysaid in response to calls from some over the summer to deploy troops in response to the Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests: “The option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire of situations.""Are we even remotely at such an extreme state where ordinary law enforcement is insufficient? The January 6 riot at the Capitol would have been easily repelled with just a couple hundred more police officers. The US is the most militarized country in the world, and has the most para-militarized police force on the planet. Earlier to day, the Acting Chief of the Capitol Policeacknowledgedthat they had advanced knowledge of what was planned but failed to take necessary steps to police it. Future violent acts in the name of right-wing extremism, as well as other causes, is highly likely if not inevitable. But the idea that the country faces some sort of existential armed insurrection that only can suppress is laughable on its face. Recall that, on January 11, citing “an internal FBI bulletin obtained by ABC News,”claimedthat “starting this week and running through at least Inauguration Day, armed protests are being planned at all 50 state capitols and at the US Capitol.” The news outlet added in highly dramatic and alarming to nes:The FBI has also received information in recent days on a group calling for “storming” state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings in the event President Donald Trumpis removed from office prior to Inauguration Day. The group is also planning to “storm” government offices in every state the day President-elect Joe Biden will be inaugurated, regardless of whether the states certified electoral votes for Biden or Trump. None of that happened. There was virtually no unrest or violence during inauguration week —except for some anti-Biden protests held by leftist and anarchist protesters that resulted in a few smashed windows at the Oregon Democratic Party and some vandalism at a Starbucks in Seattle. “Trump supporters threatened state Capitols but failed to show on Inauguration Day,” was the headline chose to try to justify this gap between media claims and reality. ShareThis threat seems wildly overblown by the combination of media outlets looking for ratings, law enforcement agencies searching for power, and Democratic Party operatives eager to exploit the climate of fear for a new War on Terror. But now is not a moment when there is much space for questioning anything, especially not measures ostensibly undertaken in the name of combatting white-supremacist right-wing extremism — just as no questioning of supposed security measures was tolerated in the wake of the 9/11 attack. And so the scenes of soldiers on the streets of the nation is capital, there in the thousands and for an indefinite period of time, is provoking little to no concern.all the more remarkable is that a mere seven months ago, a major controversy erupted when published an op-edby Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) which, at its core, advocated the deployment of military troops to quell the social unrest, protests and riots that erupted over the summer after the killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd. To justify the deployment of National Guard and active duty military forces, Cotton emphasized how many people, including police officers, had been seriously maimed or even killed as part of that unrest:Outnumbered police officers, encumbered by feckless politicians, bore the brunt of the violence. In New York State, rioters ran over officers with cars on at least three occasions. In Las Vegas, an officer is in “grave” condition after beings hot in the head by a rioter. In St. Louis, four police officers were shot as they attempted to disperse a mob throwing bricks and dumping gasoline; in a separate incident, a 77-year-old retired police captain was shot to death as he tried to stop looters from ransacking a pawnshop. This is “somebody is granddaddy,” a bystander screamed at the scene.(Cotton is claim that police officers “bore the brunt of the violence” was questionable, given how many protesters were also killed or maimed, but it is true that numerous police officers were attacked, including fatally). Cotton acknowledged that the central cause of the protests was a just one, noting they were provoked by “the wrongful death of George Floyd.” He also strongly affirmed the right of people to peacefully protest in support of that cause, accusing those justifying the violence of “a revolting moral equivalence of rioters and looters to peaceful, law-abiding protesters,” adding: “A majority who seek to protest peacefully should not be confused with bands of miscreants.”But he insisted that, absent military reinforcements, innocent people, principally ones in poor communities, will suffer. “These rioters, if not subdued, not only will destroy the livelihoods of law-abiding citizens but will also take more innocent lives,” Cotton wrote, adding: “Many poor communities that still bear scars from past upheavals will be set back still further.”The backlash to the publication of this op-ed was immediate, intense, and, at least in my memory, unprecedented. Very few people were interested in engaging the merits of Cotton is call for a deployment of troops in order to prove the argument was misguided. Their view was not that Cotton is plea for soldiers in the streets was misguided, but that advocacy for it was so obscene, so extremist, so dangerous and repugnant, that the mere publication of the op-ed by The Paper of Record was an act of grave immorality.“I will probably get in trouble for this, but to not say something would be immoral. As a black woman, as a journalist, I am deeply ashamed that we ran this,” pronounced the paper is Nikole Hannah-Jones in a now-deleted tweet. Thewriter Taffy Brodesser-Aknerposteda multi-tweet denunciation that compared Cotton to an anti-Semite who “says, ‘The Jew is a pig,’"" argued that “hatred dressed up as opinion is not something I have to withstand,” and concluded with this flourish: “I love working at the Times and most days of the week I am very proud to be part of its mission. But tonight, I understand the people who treat me like I work at a tobacco company.”Formereditor andHuffington Posteditor-in-chief Lydia Polgreen announced, also in a now-deleted tweet: “I spent some of the happiest and most productive years of my life working for the New York Times. So it is with love and sadness that I say: running this puts Black@nytimesstaff – and many, many others – in danger.” That publication of the Cotton op-ed “puts Black New York Times staff in danger” became a mantra recited by more journalists than one can list. Two editors — including the paper is Editorial Page editorJames Benettand a young assistant editorAdam Rubenstein— were forced out of their jobs, in the middle of a pandemic, for the crime of endorsing Cotton is argument but merely airing it. Media reports attributed their departure to a “staff revolt.” The paper itself appended a major editor is note: “We have concluded that the essay fell short of our standards and should not have been published.” In addition to alleged flaws in the editorial process, the paper also said “the tone of the essay in places is needlessly harsh and falls short of the thoughtful approach that advances useful debate.”There is a meaningful difference between deploying National Guard troops and active duty soldiers on American streets. But both measures are extraordinary, create a climate of militarization, have a history of resulting in excessive force against citizens engaged in peaceful protest and constitutionally protected dissent, and present threats and dangers to civil liberties far beyond ordinary use of law enforcement. Why was the idea of troops in American streets so grotesque and offensive in June, 2020 but so normalized now? Why were these troops likely to indiscriminately arrest and murder black reporters and other journalists over the summer but are now trusted to protect them? And what does it say about the current climate, and the serious dangers it poses, that the public is being trained so easily to acquiesce to extreme measures in the name of domestic security?We are witnessing the media and their public treat what ought to be regarded with great suspicion as not only normal but desirable, all through the manipulation of fears and inflation of threats. That does not bode well for those who seek to impede the imminent attempt to begin a new domestic War on Terror.",1,1,Glenn Greenwald
291,Congressman Roger Marshall defeats Kris Kobach in Kansas Republican Senate primary,0.67,46.33,https://www.kansascity.com/article244717957.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/kansas-city-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-04,17,"Congressman Roger Marshall defeated Kris Kobach in the Kansas Republican race for US Senate Tuesday, a victory driven by a party establishment that considered the OB-GYN from Great Bend the best chance of continuing 81 years of uninterrupted GOP control of the state is Senate seats. Marshall and Kobach, a former Kansas secretary of state, fought bitterly in the primary, engaging in intense mudslinging over who was the true conservative and staunchest ally of President Donald Trump. The Associated Press called the race for Marshall shortly after 9 p.m. According to the Kansas Secretary of State is Office, Marshall had 39% of the vote to Kobach is 26% with three-quarters of precincts reporting. Bob Hamilton, a Kansas City area businessman who spent millions of his own wealth to blanket the airwaves with ads, had 19%.“Keeping the Republican majority is at stake, that the Republican majority in this country may well go through Kansas and we are the backstop” Marshall told supporters Tuesday night. Marshall took a call from Trump in front of supporters, putting him on speakerphone. Trump, who declined to endorse during the primary, congratulated Marshall on an “incredible race.”Marshall, a second-term representative who represents the state is vast 1st District, will face Democrat Barbara Bollier in the general election. Bollier, a former Republican and current state senator from the Johnson County community of Mission Hills, is poised to wage the most competitive Democratic challenge for Senate in Kansas in years.“It is clear to me that we need change in Washington, and we need to end the era of hyper-partisanship and division. People just want our elected leaders to work together to get things done. That was obvious before this pandemic, and it is even clearer now,” Bollier said in a statement. The election culminates a stunning fall for Kobach, an informal adviser to Trump who carved out a national reputation as an immigration hardliner. Kobach had staked his chances of electoral redemption on a primary victory after he lost the 2018 governor is race to Democrat Laura Kelly. But groups with ties to national Republicans spent millions urging voters to reject Kobach for fear that he would again lose to a Democrat if nominated. The effort resulted in brutal TV ads highlighting how he had not been chosen for a position in the Trump administration and his campaign had paid a volunteer who posted on white nationalist websites.“I voted for Marshall. I just like information that I had,” said John Bevan, an 85-year-old retired school administrator in Newton. “Kobach, I had questions about him … the re is a lot of publicity coming out saying that he could not make Trump is cabinet and other things, financial things, dealings that he had.”Money flowed into the race on all sides. In the final eight days before the election, outside groups booked $2.5 million in pro-Marshall and anti-Kobach TV ads, according to Medium Buying, which tracks ad purchases. A pro-Kobach group bought $419,000 in air time while a “meddling” group running ads likely to prop up Kobach purchased $2.3 million in air time.“Republican voters have chosen to put their best foot forward and given us the best chance to send a common sense conservative to the Senate,” said David Kensinger, a longtime Kansas Republican strategist. The Senate Leadership Fund president Steven Law described the victory as the “first skirmish to stop Chuck Schumer is brazen Senate power grab was fought tonight in Kansas” — a reference to TV ads run by a group linked to national Democrats designed to boost Kobach in the primary. The SLF spent $2.1 million supporting Marshall in the race. National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Todd Young said he was “more confident than ever” the Kansas seat would remain in Republican hands. Kobach, acknowledging defeat, immediately urged Republicans to back Marshall.“We will hold this seat and I will do everything I can to make sure that happens for the Republican party,” Kobach said during his concession speech. The general election will pit doctor against doctor as the coronavirus continues to grip Kansas and much of the nation. Both Marshall and Bollier feature their medical backgrounds prominently in their campaigns and are likely to lean on their credentials as they try to connect with voters this fall. Marshall has talked about how he is delivered thousands of babies and even tried, unsuccessfully, to be listed as “Doc Roger Marshall” on the ballot. Bollier, a retired anesthesiologist, originally pitched her slogan as “Washington is sick, send a doctor” before the pandemic emerged.“Clearly, Dr. Marshall takes away the doctor card from Bollier, and she uses it all the time, on the (Kansas) Senate floor, the House floor, and in her commercials,” Kansas Senate President Susan Wagle, a Wichita Republican, said in a statement in July. Despite their shared profession, the two physicians have sharply split over their response to the coronavirus. Marshall has campaigned in-person throughout the state, shaking hands and often going maskless. Bollier has rarely left her home, instead hosting virtual campaign events over Zoom. Still, Bollier assembled an extraordinary fundraising machine that shattered previous records for Democrats in Kansas. Bollier left the Republican party in 2018 over frustrations with Trump and GOP hostility toward LGBTQ rights. As a candidate, she has mostly sidestepped Trump.“On the campaign trail, she has proven herself as a capable and compassionate leader who will always put Kansans first,” said Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY is List, a group that works to elect Democratic women. National Republican groups, which rallied to Marshall is side during the primary, are likely to again come to his aid in the fall. Some Republicans also predict Marshall will muster a stronger, more competitive campaign against Bollier than Kobach would have.“It is going to help Republicans up and down the ballot,” Kelly Arnold, a former Kansas Republican Party chairman, said. “I know Congressman Marshall will have the resources and invest those resources into our get out the vote campaign … to make sure not only Roger Marshall is elected but all of our candidates.”The Kansas City Star is Bryan Lowry and The Wichita Eagle is Michael Stavola contributed reporting.

292,Why America keeps turning its back on Haitian migrants,-14.33,38.0,https://www.vox.com/22689472/haitian-migrants-asylum-history-violence,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-24,25,"The images left many sickened and outraged: Border Patrol agents on horseback hounding Haitian migrants near the US-Mexico border,more than 14,000of whom were camped under the Del Rio bridge on September 19. The uniformed men swung their long horse reins — which many interpreted as whips — to keep the migrants from crossing into Texas. In one photo, an agent grabbed the T-shirt of a migrant, while another shouted in a video, “Get out now! Back to Mexico!”Condemnation of the agents’ behavior was swift, with advocates drawing parallels to slave patrols, or the white men on horses who whipped enslaved people in cotton fields. But inhumane treatment of Black migrants, particularly Haitian migrants, is not new; it is closely linked to the history of immigrant detention in the USs. Haitians have sought asylum at US borders for decades, but every presidential administration since the 1970s has treated Haitians differently than other migrant groups, rejecting asylum claims, holding them longer in detention, and making it harder for them to settle down in safety. In the early 1990s, for example, when the USs detained more than 12,000 Haitian refugees at Guantanamo indefinitely, Immigration and Naturalization Servicesdenied the vast majority of them asylum. According to CarlLindskoog, the author of, the USs’ inhumane treatment of Haitian refugees, whom the country has often cast as criminals, unskilled, diseased, and poor, has been a central part of the immigration detention story.“Policies were specifically designed to deter Haitians from coming in. These policies became the prototype for what became a global system of migrant incarceration,”says Lindskoog, a professor of history at Raritan Valley Community College in New Jersey. The current wave of Haitian migrants is fleeing a country that has experienced compounding crises. This summer, Haiti suffered a magnitude 7.2 earthquake and tropical storm that killed an estimated 2,200, with thousands more missing or injured. The July assassination of President Jovenel Moïse worsened violence and instability. Haitians are still reeling from the January 2010 earthquake that affected 3 million people, causing irreparable damage to homes and infrastructure. Gangs have since risen in power, leading many Haitians to live in fear for their lives and families. As Lindskoog says, what Haitians are experiencing is the kind of calamity that asylum was designed for in the period following World War II: “It is their legal right to seek asylum.”However, some migrants hoping for asylum are instead being chased down and shut out at the border —images show them being removed from airplanes in Port-au-Prince with their belongings scattered on the airport is tarmac — while an undisclosed number are being allowed into the USs. Biden is decision to fly Haitians back to deadly circumstances, under a Trump-era policy,underscores the USs’ longstanding animus toward Black migrants. I talked to Lindskoog about the history of Haitian migrant detention in the US and why America has consistently rolled out harsh policies for Haitians, without displaying compassion for immigrants from the embattled Caribbean nation. Our conversation has been edited and condensed. This week, images and video of Border Patrol agents mounted on horseback rounding up Haitian migrants at the southern border sparked national outrage. The images depicted officials using horse reins, which many likened to whips, to control the movement of the Haitians. Can you tell me what came to mind when you saw those images?The images are horrible. I agree with everyone who said it was so terribly resonant of the long history of anti-Black racism and racial violence. Those images bring a lot of strands of history together, from why the Border Patrol was created, to how violent that institution has been, to how our modern policing system comes from the enforcement of slavery. And the n there is how our immigration system has been criminal i zed and merged into our criminal justice system, both of which have anti-Black elements. What is happening at the border is horrifying and fits into the long intersecting history of anti-Black, anti-immigrant sentiment and anti-Haitian exclusion. Let is talk more about the Border Patrol is racist history, which has been well documented and began with its formation in the early 1920s as a kind of brotherhood with KKK members and racist Texas Rangers. Can you tell me more about how these origins were likely at play in Del Rio with Haitian migrants?There is a really good book about this by Kelly Lytle Hernández called in which she describes how the creation of the US Border Patrol in 1924 happened amidst a much broader anti-immigrant moment. There was the nationalImmigration Restriction Act of 1924that placed new racist immigration quotas and exclusions as part of American immigration policy. It was the gatekeep ing mechanism at the time for keeping out who we do not want to come across on American shores. [Author is note: For example,the law favored migration from Northern and Western European countries and decreased the annual immigration cap from 350,000 to 165,000.]Simultaneously, the Border Patrol — which evolved out of a longer history of anti-migrant, anti-Mexican white supremacist violence along the US borderlands — was introduced to police to control the movement of Mexican migrants in particular, but also other people who might cross the southern border. Yes, many people tend to only think of Mexican migrants trying to cross the southern border. But there are people from Caribbean countries taking long, arduous treks across water and through numerous nations and terrains to seek American asylum. For example,reports have suggested that many of the more than 14,000 Haitian migrants who were camped under the Del Rio International Bridge had actually left Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and had stopped in places like Brazil and Chile but have been on the move to Mexico due to various circumstances. What kinds of conditions have these migrants faced in the past 10 or so years?From what I have learned from organizations like the Haitian Bridge Alliance and from reporters who have gone down to places like Brazil to report on conditions, especially after the economic downturn and other crises in Brazil, is that they could not stay there. So they went to Chile and did not have the greatest reception there and sometimes faced a harrowing journey through jungles and across borders. There is a gigantic immigration detention facility in southern Mexico, where Mexico does a lot of the dirty work of the USs by detaining people who have crossed the border with Guatemala. If they got out of the re, and were able to make it through the dangerous terrain up to the US-Mexico border, that is a major act of survival because of everything that they had to face in coming so many miles and facing so many police forces, prisons, and natural challenges. And the n to see the images and read the reports that they are living in that large encampment now, and just trying to get food and water and the n to face that violent reprisal by the US Border Patrol — it is just unimaginable. And how does this modern-day situation compare to the kind of treatment Haitian migrants have traditionally received over the past couple of decades, whether they are entering through the southern border or trying to get to Florida is shores by boat?They have, for most of history, been met with exclusion. During the 1940s, ’50s, and ’60s, most Haitians were coming on student visas or tourist visas, and the n if they did not have authorization to stay, they were overstaying their visa. There were also a number of political exiles. So they were not really on the radar and seen as a big problem. They were establishing the mselves in neighborhoods in New York primarily, and in Boston and elsewhere in Canada. It is really in the early to mid-1970s when the so-called “boat people,” which is a different demographic — more working-class, urban, displaced Haitians — started to come by boats and ships, trying to make it to American shores. When they tried to put in asylum claims was when they started to be more on the radar of American authorities. That triggered this racist backlash, especially in South Florida, because it was at a moment when there was already a racist backlash to the civil rights movement. So to have all these poor unauthorized migrants who do not speak English, that are Black, showing up, the re is this really racist reaction. South Floridians started to put pressure on their local officials, who the n turned to Washington, and there was a very concerted effort to keep Haitians out. The Carter administration introduced something called the Haitian Program— a punishing set of policies designed to deter Haitians from coming in. And if they were already here, it tried to keep them out of the mainstream population. That meant putting them in detention facilities and local jails, basically denying them carte blanche their asylum claims and just sending them back. There was a big legal challenge in 1980,,where Haitian migrants and their advocates got a federal judge named James Lawrence King to recognize in a ruling that this practice was not only discriminatory but also racist. Haitians were being excluded because they were Black and because they were Haitian. King overturned the Haitian Program, but the Carter administration worked to circumvent it like subsequent administrations would. When the Reagan administration came into power, they introduced a new Haitian detention program and the policy of interdiction, in which Coast Guard cutters would intercept boats of Haitian asylum seekers before they could even reach land and send them back, often to violence and death in Haiti. That process continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The Biden administration is mass denial of asylum claims, which they are doing by invokingTitle 42— a 2020 Trump administration coronavirus policy that has been used to expel more than a million migrants without hearings before an immigration judge — is not something new. This is something that both Republican and Democratic administrations have done, and it very much fits with the long history of the US government denying the legitimacy of Haitians’ asylum claims and sending them to a dangerous and often deadly situation. It seems presidents of all backgrounds and in both parties have engaged in harm toward Haiti and Haitian migrants. US involvement in Haiti has often led to periods of instability the re, but the n the US has at times in the past turned around and interned Haitians at Guantanamo. The coup d’état against Haiti is first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, happened when George HW Bush was in power, and hes ort of paid lip service to the illegitimate military government that was ruling after Aristide was put out of office. But Bush refused to accept Haitian asylum seekers and did everything the US government could to keep Haitians from being able to seek safe haven, even though the human rights atrocities after the coup were well-documented. There was another set of legal challenges and legal battles in the courts to give Haitians asylum, some of which were somewhat successful, but that is the period when Guantanamo was first established as an offshore prison to try to serve as a buffer for people whom you do not even want to allow to get to American shores to seek asylum. And Haitians were the first Guantanamo detainees. When Bill Clinton was running for president and trying to defeat George HW Bush, he promised to reverse that. A lot of Americans and people around the world were indignant about the Bush administration is treatment of Haitians. Of course we are gonna let Haitians in,” Clinton said. But after he was elected, he reversed course and turned his back on the Haitians and said, “Well, we do not want to trigger another humanitarian crisis by taking people because the n more people will go out on this perilous journey across the ocean.”He was trying to invoke humanitarian reasons for still denying people the right to seek asylum. Meanwhile, more Haitians filled up Guantanamo, some of whom were HIV positive and had AIDS That began another chapter in what one scholar calls the carceral quarantine of Haitians for medical reasons. This was similar to what is happening today because Title 42 is built on the basis of public health mandates to exclude people. While many people were forcibly returned from Guantanamo to Haiti, a number of those Haitians who remained at Guantanamo were able to make it to the USs after intense political and legal struggle. There is historically also been a difference between how Cuban migrants and Haitian migrants have been treated,which many scholars point out is based on skin color. Is it useful to compare the plight of various migrant groups trying to make it into the USs?I think it is useful. I think there are a lot of interesting polarities in the experience of Haitians and Cubans in how they come to the USs. The best example of course was the summer of 1980 when more than 100,000 Cubans came by boat seeking asylum, and so did approximately 15,000 Haitians. The Refugee Act of 1980 had just passed, but it did not have clear instructions for how to treat vast numbers of asylum seekers, so initially, both Cubans and Haitians were placed in refugee camps on military bases across the USs. But pretty quickly, Cubans, for the most part, were released and allowed to be with family members and the Cuban community. Haitians languished in detention much longer. For the Haitians that came after, a special piece of legislation was passed to adjust their status known as theCuban-Haitian Entrant Act of 1980. But the Haitians that came after the act were again treated just like the ones that came before — excluded and barred. Cubans never suffered the same kind of exclusion or mass detention that Haitians did, despite the fact that they are both coming from Caribbean nations and seeking asylum. How do these exclusionary policies translate to how Haitians are treated once in America?For the Haitian community and Haitian migrants in particular, they have repeatedly been targeted as disease carriers, which historically has also been a racialized notion not only of the foreign-born but especially of the nonwhite foreign-born. In the 1970s, their incarceration exclusion was sometimes justified on the basis that they were carrying tuberculosis. In the 1980s and especially in the 1990s, it became the notion that they were carrying AIDS But Haitians said all along that singling them out is discriminatory because they are not any more likely to be diseased than other people. It is racialized stigmatization. The same thing goes for criminalization. TheBlack Alliance for Just Immigrationhas documented how Black immigrants are much more likely to be incarcerated, how they spend much more time in detention, and how their asylum cases, deportation cases, and immigration appeals are much more likely to be denied. That is part of how immigration enforcement blends into the criminal justice system and policing — now that the re is a criminal i zed racial immigration system, often a migrant is first point of contact in this country is with law enforcement. A lot of municipalities and localities have an agreement between their local law enforcement in the immigration system that they will refer any unauthorized or undocumented person or someone with some kind of immigration issue over to the immigration system. They the n get put into the immigration system based on some racialized reading about who they are and are disproportionately likely to be detained or deported. So it is clear that Haitian migrants are particularly demonized and criminalized, but I also think another element to their story is erasure. It feels like not many people know about this history. Even in the past decade or so, conversations about immigrants tend to leave out Black immigrants in general. Research from the nonprofit organization RAICESfound that 44 percent of families that ICE locked up during the pandemic last year were Haitian and that this information was underreported. A February 2021reportfrom the American Immigration Council stated that at one detention center in 2020, nearly half of the families threatened with family separation were Black and originated from Haiti, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and Afro-Latino communities in Latin America. What does the erasure signify?Black migrants, Black immigrants, and Black asylum seekers are often left out of discussions of immigration, immigrant rights, and immigrant justice. In the media, when we are having these big national debates, we tend to think more about Central Americans and other Latin Americans, not the Caribbean so much. And, of course, in recent years, there were large numbers of displaced people coming from Central America — and that is part of why that drew the attention. But it is also true that Haitians only appear from time to time in conversation, and it is not understood that their experiences track really closely to a lot of other asylum seekers. Even with the current attention being paid to the treatment of Haitian migrants, it is still unclear how the USs is going to decide which Haitians they allow in and which they do not. The Biden administration is initial response was to schedule seven flights a day to send Haitians at the border back. But the n the Associated Pressreportedthat Haitians were being released to El Paso, Texas; Arizona; and other places for 60 days before they’d have to appear at an immigration office. There is not much transparency about how these decisions are being made.​​The Biden administration is under intense political pressure from different sides and from different interests, just as previous administrations have been. The administration is trying to maintain its image as being very different from the Trump administration, especially when it comes to racism and anti-immigrant nativist xenophobia, but I do not believe that his policies have yet proven to be very different.[Vice President] Kamala Harris can stand there and say she is horrified, and [press secretary]Jen Psaki can say the same. But the whole reason the inhumane treatment of Haitians is happening is because the Biden administration is continuing the Trump administration is illegitimate and unjustified use of Title 42, which is a way of denying the asylum process to which Haitians and all other people are entitled, by both our own federal law and international law. US Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorcas made a strong statement to migrants saying that if they come here illegally, they are going to be removed, that they are going to fail. But it is not illegal to claim asylum. It is a legal right to claim asylum. Migrants have to have a legitimate fear of past or future persecution in their home country on the basis of a number of categories — if they can prove that, the n they have proven their asylum case and are supposed to be allowed to stay. Many activists have used the phrase “Haitians are owed.” There is this idea that the world owes Haitiand has played a role in its plight. What do you think about this in the context of what took place at the border this week?We do all owe Haitians for the Haitian Revolution, which successfully ended in 1804 and was the most sweeping human rights revolution in all of human history. Haitian liberation, first from slavery and the n from colonialism and achieving independence, was a victory for all enslaved, oppressed people, including Black Americans. In many ways, Haitians, sadly, because they have so often been targeted by racism and injustice, have kept fighting in the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s in this country and in others. Their determination to liberate the mselves and other people they have struggled alongside continues to be a model for how all incarcerated, enslaved, and otherwise abused people can find their liberation. That is one major reason we owe a debt of gratitude to Haitians. That is even more reason to fight alongside them for justice today at the US-Mexico border and wherever they encounter racism and discrimination. ",1,1,Vox
293,What should the media do with President Trump is false election claims?,-9.0,40.0,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/what-should-the-media-do-with-president-trumps-false-election-claims/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-09,24,"For the past six months, the country has been on edge as we led up to the 2020 election. But even now, as the election is essentially over, the country cannot totally exhale. We have 72 days between now and inauguration day when Joe Biden is expected to be sworn in as the 46th president of the USs. Buckle up because this ride will be bumpy. There is no indication that the transition of power will go smoothly over the next two months. President Donald Trump has taken a defiant to ne, showing no signs of conceding while ramping up his insistence that the election has been rigged. We expect to see recounts and lawsuits, which are acceptable in our democracy. We also expect to see plenty of baseless rhetoric and unproven conspiracy the ories, which are not acceptable. So what role does the media play in how the next two months will go?In her latest piece,Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote of Trump: “He was a deeply abnormal president, but we constantly sought to normalize him, treating his deranged tweets like legitimate news and piously forecasting, every time he sounded the least bit calm, that he was becoming ‘presidential.’”She added, “From the beginning, TV news far too often took his public rallies and speeches as live feeds, letting his misinformation pollute the ecosystem.”There is a danger of that happening again. Based on how he has reacted so far, Trump seems likely to continue floating his false the ories, putting the media in an uncomfortable position. Up until now, most news outlets have tried to walk a tightrope — reporting on the president is protestations about the election, while attempting to point out that Trump is assertions are not rooted in fact or reality. News broadcasters sound something like this: “The president says the election is rigged. There is no proof that is true.” We have heard versions of this on all networks for the past three days. But is that enough? Does not there come a point when repeating the president is unproven claims, even while debunking those claims, does damage? Does not putting Trump is bogus allegations into the ether chip away at the trust in our elections even though there is no reason to doubt the honesty of our elections?On one hand, Trump is the president. What he says and what he does right now is news, especially if his refusal to participate in a transition of power impacts the nation. On the other hand, just because Trump insists the election is a fraud does not make it so — and it does not make it news. AsThe Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg told Brian Stelter on CNN is “Reliable Sources,”“The salience of this administration goes down by the day.”But it is not going to disintegrate completely. News outlets have to think long and hard about what truly is news at this point. It looks as if it will be impossible to completely ignore everything the president says about the election. When the media is forced to cover this part of the story, it must keep repeating that his conspiracies are not true. But the media also does not have to cover Trump is dangerous speech every time he tweets or talks. Trump has made his allegations known. The media has reported on that. For the media to keep reporting on it every single time Trump repeats it is no longer necessary. If something changes — if Trump concedes, or Trump offers something more than just wild, off-the-cuff lies — the n report it. Otherwise, ignore it and cover real news. Goodness knows the re is plenty of it with coronavirus, the economy and so much more. Fox News’ Chris Wallace. (Courtesy: Fox News)Fox News’ Chris Wallace had a couple of moments over the weekend that need to be pointed out. First, on Saturday, after Biden was projected the winner of the 2020 election, Wallace commented on Trump is refusal to accept the results of the election.“I think it is going to become increasingly untenable,” Wallace said on the air. “It is one thing to be pursuing legal challenges. It is another to have this very heightened rhetoric that we know is the way the president does business. I think it is going to become increasingly untenable because I think you are going to start to see a lot of the Republican leaders who are realizing their fortunes and their futures are no longer so directly tied to Donald Trump are going to begin to pull back.”Wallace also pointed out how “un-normal” Trump is refusal to accept Biden is victory is. Then on his “Fox News Sunday” show, Wallace again brought up the idea that Republicans will have to push back on Trump is election claims.“It would seem to me that Republicans on Capitol Hill have a role to play in this,” Wallace said. “A very few of them have said, look, you pursue your legal options, but, you know, damn down the rhetoric, like Mitt Romney, like Pat Toomey.”Then he said this whopper: “There are a lot who are just silent. And the n there are some — I mentioned Ted Cruz — you know who are like the Japanese soldiers who come out 30 years after the war — out of the jungle — and say, ‘Is the fight still going on?’”Here is how NBC News’ Lester Holt closed his “Nightly News” broadcast on Saturday, the day Biden was projected to win the election:“The handwriting has been on the wall for days. Today, it was on the screen in bold letters and a check mark and for the first time it could be said out loud: America has decided to go another way. This kind of passion — the deep disappointment of the president is supporters, the celebratory dances of Joe Biden voters — should be allowed their moment. As a country the campaign whipped us into a frenzy, too often rooted in fear of the other. Today, we let it out. Both sides deserve a collective primal scream over all we have been through.“But tomorrow, just maybe we can leave it on the field, wave away the smoke screens and confront what we know to be real and urgent — a pandemic that is literally killing us and sending too many into financial ruin. If we can reengage unity on anything, let it be in the insistence that our leaders, both incoming and outgoing, put us and our well being first.”In case you missed it, I had a special edition of my Poynter Report newsletter on Saturday, applauding how the media handled Election Day turned Election Week. If you missed it, you canc heck it out here. CNN was the big winner on what turned out to be the final day of the election. From 3 a.m. Saturday morning until 3 a.m. Sunday morning, CNN was the most-watched cable news network. It drew 4.2 million viewers, which was more than MSNBC (3.01 million) and Fox News (1.72 million). Interesting to note that Fox News was the most-watched network of all on Tuesday is Election Day, but the n CNN mostly took over from there. CNN is Brian Stelter compiled exactly when the networks made the calls on Saturday to project that Joe Biden would be the next president. CNN was the first at 11:24:20 a.m. NBC was next at 11:25:15, followed by CBS at 11:25:45, and The Associated Press and ABC at 11:26. Fox News made its call at 11:40 a.m. Looking for an expert source?

294,White House faces bipartisan backlash on Haitian migrants,-2.33,46.67,https://apnews.com/article/texas-del-rio-alejandro-mayorkas-de6e8368484e5a45788c808596a9b4d3,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-22,25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is facing sharp condemnation from Democrats for its handling of the influx of Haitian migrants at the US southern border, after images of US Border Patrol agents on horseback using aggressive tactics went viral this week. Striking video of agents maneuvering their horses to forcibly block and move migrants attempting to cross the border has sparked resounding criticism from Democrats on Capitol Hill, who are calling on the Biden administration to end its use of a pandemic-era authority to deport migrants without giving them an opportunity to seek asylum in the USs. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, an administration ally, said images of the treatment of the migrants “turn your stomach” and called on the administration to discontinue the “hateful and xenophobic” policies of Biden is predecessor, Donald Trump.“The policies that are being enacted now — and the horrible treatment of these innocent people who have come to the border — must stop immediately,” Schumer told the Senate on Tuesday. At the same time, the administration continues to face attacks from Republicans, who say Biden is not doing enough to deal with what they call a “crisis” at the border. Reflecting the urgency of the political problem for the administration, Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas said Tuesday the images “horrified” him, a seeming shift in tone from a day earlier, when he and others were more sanguine about the situation at the border. Mayorkas announced later that the agents involved have been placed on administrative duties pending the outcome of an investigation. “The actions we are taking are swift and strong, and we will take further action as the facts adduced in the investigation compel,” he said on Twitter. It is a highly uncomfortable position for the administration, led by a president who has set himself up as a to nic for the harshness of his predecessor. But immigration is a complex issue, one no administration has been able to fix in decades. And Biden is trapped between conflicting interests of broadcasting compassion while dealing with throngs of migrants coming to the country — illegally — seeking a better life. The provision in question, known as Title 42, was put in place by the Trump administration in March 2020 to justify restrictive immigration policies in an effort to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. But the Biden administration has used Title 42 to justify the deportation of Haitian migrants who in recent days have set up an encampment in and around the small city of Del Rio, Texas. The provision gives federal health officials powers during a pandemic to take extraordinary measures to limit transmission of an infectious disease. A federal judge late last week ruled the regulation was improper and gave the government two weeks before its use was to be halted, but the Biden administration on Monday appealed the decision.“The Biden administration pushing back on this stay of expulsions is another example of broken promises to treat migrants with respect and humanity when they reach our borders to exercise their fundamental right to asylum,” said Karla Marisol Vargas, senior attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project and co-counsel on the litigation. NAACP President Derrick Johnson demanded a meeting with Biden to discuss the situation and called the treatment of the Haitian migrants “utterly sickening.”“The humanitarian crisis happening under this administration on the southern border disgustingly mirrors some of the darkest moments in America is history,” he said in a statement. Shortly after the judge is decision on Friday, Homeland Security officials formed a plan to begin immediately turning the groups of Haitian migrants around, working against the clock. But people kept coming. Trump essentially put a choke hold on immigration. He decreased the number of refugees admitted to a record low, made major changes to policy and essentially shut down asylum. Biden has undone many of the Trump-era policies, but since his inauguration, the US has seen a dramatic spike in the number of people encountered by border officials. The Haitian migrants are the latest example. More than 6,000 Haitians and other migrants have been removed from the encampment in Del Rio, and Mayorkas predicted a “dramatic change” in the number of migrants there within the next two to four days as the administration continues the removal process. As the controversy swirled around him, Biden spent his Tuesday address at the UN General Assembly in New York calling for the global community to come together to defend human rights and combat injustice worldwide, declaring, “the future will belong to those who embrace human dignity, not trample it.”The remarks stood in notable contrast to images of the Border Patrol agents on horseback. Biden himself seemed to acknowledge the challenge his administration faces with immigration, offering a clipped response when asked by a reporter after his UN remarks to offer his reaction to the images.“We will get it under control,” he insisted. Vice President Kamala Harris also weighed in, telling reporters in Washington that she was “deeply troubled” by the images and planned totalk to Mayorkas about the situation. Harris has been tasked with addressing the root causes of migration to the US, and emphasized that the US should “support some very basic needs that the people of Haiti have” that are causing them to flee their homes for the US Videos and photos taken in recent days in and around Del Rio show Border Patrol agents confronting Haitians along the Rio Grande near a border bridge where thousands of migrants have gathered in hopes of entering the country. One Border Patrol agent on horseback was seen twirling his long leather reins in a menacing way at the Haitian migrants, but not actually striking anyone. There was no sign in photos and videos viewed by The Associated Press that the mounted agents were carrying whips or using their reins as such when confronting the migrants. The agents, wearing chaps and cowboy hats, maneuvered their horses to forcibly block and move the migrants, almost seeming to herd them. In at least one instance, they were heard taunting the migrants. Asked about the images on Tuesday, Mayorkas told lawmakers that the issue had been “uppermost in my mind” ever since he had seen them. He said the department had alerted its inspector general is office and directed that staff from the Office of Professional Responsibility be present round-the-clock in Del Rio.“I was horrified to see the images, and we look forward to learning the facts that are adduced from the investigation, and we will take actions that those facts compel,” Mayorkas said. “We do not tolerate any mistreatment or abuse of a migrant. Period.”Previously, during a Monday news conference, both Mayorkas and Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz played down the incident, with Ortiz telling reporters that the agents were working in a difficult and chaotic environment and trying to control their horses. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Mayorkas spoke Monday before he had seen the images. “He believes this does not represent who we are as a country and does not represent the positions of the Biden-Harris administration,” Psaki told reporters on Tuesday. Criticism was withering from members of Congress, including Representative Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee. He called on Mayorkas to “take immediate action to hold those responsible accountable.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also called for an investigation. Republicans, meanwhile, stepped up their continued criticism of Biden is approach to the border, with 26 Republican governors calling on the president to change his border policies.“A crisis that began at the southern border now extends beyond to every state and requires immediate action before the situation worsens,” they said in a statement.",2,2,AP
295,Trump is Save America leadership PAC has not spent the $75 million it raised on “election integrity.”,-13.67,37.33,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/07/trump-save-america-leadership-pac-keeping-usd75-million.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"The rub was always in the fine print. Even after Donald Trump, the actual president of the USs, lost the 2020 election, he cranked up the outrage machine claiming election fraud, hinting at grand conspiracies, and sending Rudy Giuliani barnstorming to provide visuals, footage, new cautious news stories, that could be used to help spin the many, many yarns he was spinning on the fly. Meanwhile, Trump and his associated PACsraked in hundreds of millions on the chaos, confusion, and destruction. Their fundraising em ails shouted things like “We MUST defend the Election from the Left!” as they soaked up cash from low-dollar donors who believed the president. The small print at the bottom whispered something very different: The first 75 percent of these #StoptheSteal donations to the Trump fundraising apparatus were redirected to Trump is Save America leadership PAC, which was for Trump to spend more or less as he wished. The entirety of Donald Trump is life so far has been, essentially, a string of grifts, and so it is unsurprising that his presidential (and post-presidential) life has been no different. The election outrage that Trump fomented in pockets of deep-red Trump country has shaken the democratic foundations of the country and, once again, allowed Trump to pull off a sleight of hand and pocket tens of millions of dollars. The Washington Postreportsthat Trump is Save America leadership PAC, which raised some $75 million in the first half of 2021 on the back of his barrage of lies about the 2020 election, has yet to spend any of that money in support the recounts, ballot reviews, and other shenanigans he inspired in Republican-run statehouses across the country. Ahead of the July 31 filing date for how the organization has spent its money, Trump confidantes explained to the Post that Trump was “uninterested in personally bankrolling the efforts, relying on other entities and supporters to fund the endeavors.”Instead, Trump is keeping the money to play around with—though a Trump adviser dutifully clung to the Trump election racket, telling the Post that Trump had not ruled out spending the money on state ballot review efforts “at some point down the road.” Uh-huh. Instead, the money has gone to funding Trump is professional lifestyle, which is inextricably intertwined with Trump is personal existence and the ecosystem of Trump is long grift. That long play may involve running for president again, though it may not, but either way it requires relevance and a platform, both of which are made possible by those large wads of cash. The money demands attention from candidates, voters, and the refore media; the attention, in turn, produces more cash. So Donald Trump is not going anywhere because he has finally found a swindle in American politics where he can quite literally just ask people for money and they simply give it to him by the millions. It is not complicated. It never is with Trump. He is just doing the thing he telegraphed he would do from the very beginning and stated explicitly in the smallprint.",1,1,Slate
296,Is Trump is Unemployment Benefit Plan Legal?,-5.0,34.33,https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2020/08/13/Trump-s-Unemployment-Benefit-Plan-Legal,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,25,"The White House scrambled earlier this week to clarify President Trump is effort to provide extra weekly payments to unemployed workers, settling on the idea that the new program would provide workers with up to $300 per week in enhanced payments, without requiring states to contribute. But The Washington Post is Catherine Rampellsaysthe plan is anything but clear, with the administration providing “at least five contradictory versions of this parallel benefit system” announced by president. Citing Georgetown law professor David Super, Rampell adds that in addition to being a moving target, the program as currently described is probably illegal. Trump is original plan required states to contribute 25% of the cost of the new unemployment benefit, or $100, bringing the total to $400 per week – a number that has been cited by numerous White House officials. But following a wave of complaints from cash-strapped states, the White House says it has changed the rules to eliminate that contribution. The problem, Rampell says, is that the 25% cost-sharing payment was part of the plan for a reason. The “state funding match included in Trump is executive action was not there just for kicks,” Rampell writes. “It was there because it is required under the law Trump cited as giving him authority to create this benefit program: the Stafford Act.”And that is not the only legal issue: “Counting existing state spending on jobless benefits, rather than new spending, to meet the state-match requirement would also violate Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87,” Rampell says. Why it matters:Aside from the basic but profound issue of public officials following the law, the suspect legal standing of Trump is plan could prevent states from participating in the program. “It is not a matter of whether states are willing to sign on the dotted line,” Super told Rampell. “It is: What are you actually asking me to sign up for?”",1,2,Fiscal Times

Yeah, seems like pretty sound logic to me. This news was not taken at all well by Trump is allies or, it seems, Trump itself. In a now-deleted tweet, golf person Grayson Murray suggested that Trump put on his own tournament—maybeone with blackjack and hookers!""Hey @POTUS you should just host a tournament the same week as the 2022 PGA championship at your course. Put up a huge purse that players ca not turn down. Make the pg a championship a weak field or force them to up their purse and cost them more money.""This is, of course, ridiculous because it supposes Donald Trump would ""Put up a huge purse"" for anything, ever. Not likely. Also, Murray appears to have deleted his Twitter account entirely after the resulting, ahem, response. In any event, we have good information thanks to' top Trump whisperer that Donald is—as a result of this crisis more than any other crisis in his barrel of current crises—melting the hell down. He is angry about impeachment, people who have spoken to him say. But the reaction to the PGA decision was different order of magnitude. Yeah. Yeah, this is the thing that got him. Not any of the rest of it, but the thing that will cost him, personally, money. While it is perhaps satisfying to imagine Donald Trump stomping around in impotent rage as the consequences of his own actions punch him straight in the pocketbook, the news is more grim than that. If there is anything that would convince Donald Trump to order a nuclear strike in his last days of the ""presidency,"" it is the PGA insulting him. He was barely holding his public persona together in videos offering proof-of-life in the aftermath of the coup he himself started. But the golf thing? Yeah, he is gonna freak.",1,1,Daily Kos

299,Femicide Is a Growing Issue in the USs,-6.33,41.67,https://www.teenvogue.com/story/femicide-is-a-growing-issue-in-the-united-states,https://adfontesmedia.com/teen-vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-28,25,"The killing of 20-year-oldVanessa Guillén, a Mexican-American Army specialist who disappeared from Fort Hood, Texas onApril 22, whose remains were found more than two months later on June 30, has spurred conversations about violence against women in the military. Hundreds of women, in what has been called the “military is #MeToo moment,” have shared stories about sexual harassment and assault, illustrating a culture of violence within the ranks of the US military. Before her disappearance, Guilléntold her family that she had been sexually harassed. News of her experience with sexual harassment spurred other women service members to share their own stories under the hashtag#IAmVanessaGuillen. After her remains were found, a criminal complaint released by the Department of Justice alleges that fellow soldier Aaron Robinson murdered Guillén at Fort Hood, dismembering and burying her body with the help of his girlfriend, Cecily Aguilar. On July 1, Robinson died by suicide. Aguilar has been charged with tampering with documents or proceedings and has pleaded not guilty. As Vanessa Guillen is murder, horrific in its own right, has helped uncover a pattern of violence within the military, it also reveals a larger global epidemic of violence against cis and transgender women. Femicide, generally understood to mean the murder of women for being women,a term often applied abroad, is a global issue thatsignificantlyimpactsBlack,Indigenous, poor, and migrant women. It is oftentimes thought of as violence relegated to peripheries, border cities like Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, or endemic to regions like Latin America or Africa. The truth is that femicide is an ever-present and growing crisis in the USs. There are various typesof femicide, and it can be hard to collect data on these killings because some countries do not collect information that could categorize them as so, according to the World Health Organization. Compounding that difficulty is that various places define the word differently — for some, femicide means the killing of women they are a woman, while for others it is any murder of a woman. Some countries, like Mexico, have passed laws against femicide, giving a legal meaning to the term: the murder of a woman can be classified as a femicide if her killing was motivated by gender. The US has not adopted a standardized definition for the term but the federal government tracks domestic violence killings. The Violence Against Women Actpassed in 1994recognizesdomestic violence as a national crime. While the re is no consensus on what qualifies as femicide, this kind of violence has been on the riseglobally. In Latin America, El Salvador and Honduras are consistently among the countries with the highest femicide rates globally, while Mexico saw a145%jump in femicide cases between 2015 and 2019. Last year,South Africadeclared femicide a national crisis when nearly 3,000 women were murdered between 2018 and 2019. These numbers are shocking, but often ignored are the rising rates of femicide in the USs. In 2018, 114 women were killed in Los Angeles County, the highest number since the beginning of the decade, according to aanalysis. That report found that “women are less likely than men to be killed in a shooting, but more likely to be beaten, stabbed or strangled.”The number of women killed in the US has been steadily rising since 2014, according to the most recently available data fromViolence Policy Center, and 1,948 women were killed by men in 2017. Women under 29 and women of color, including trans women, are disproportionately murdered—Black and Native American women experienced the highest rates of homicide between 2003 and 2014, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disappearance of Native American women is a critical problem—nearly5,600 were reported missing last year, according to the FBI is National Crime Information Center and this is violence that has persisted over centuries and permeates communities. And, so far in 2019, at least26transgender or gender non-conforming people were killed in this country. Women Count USA: Femicide Accountability Projectis an online database organized by Dawn Wilcox, a nurse who tracks femicide in the US Of the 1,838 women and girls killed in2018the majority were killed by current or formerpartners, according to the organization. There are stories and names behind these numbers. Oluwatoyin “Toyin” Salauwas a 19-year-old Black Lives Matter activist held captive and sexually assaulted before being killed in Tallahassee. Nina Pop, a Black trans woman who was stabbed to death in Missouri, andDominique “Rem amie” Fells, a Black trans woman whose body was found near the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania, were both murdered this year. Guillén is name, too, is on that list. The day Guillén is killer died, her family held a press conference demanding answers from military authorities. Vanessa Guillén is sister Lupe Guillén gave a gut-wrenching speech condemning the military for sidelining the family during their investigation and for failing to protect her sister, who she says experienced sexualharassment. “My sister Vanessa Guillén was sexually harassed yet nothing was done,” shesaid. “She deserves respect. She deserves to be heard because if this can happen to my sister, it can happen to anyone else.”After finding her remains, the Army Col. Ralph Overland, commander of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment and Guillén is regimental commanders aid in a statement that Guillén is killing “devastated” everyone. The Army web site says an “Army Regulation 15-6 Investigation” is being conducted into claims of sexual harassment, the “standard method of investigation” into such allegations. The rage you hear in Lupe is voice is one shared by thousands searching for truth and justice for their slain loved ones. It is a rage and desperation commonly experienced by relatives of femicide victims. ByP Claire DodsonBySara DelgadoBySara DelgadoRecognizing femicide as an issue in this country means understanding how it is linked to violence against women globally. A powerful video surfaced in February, a few months before Guillén is remains were found, of Yesenia Zamudio, the mother of 19-year-old María de Jesús “Marichuy” Jaimes Zamudio, a Mexico City university student who died after falling from a window in2016. Her death was ruled a femicide, and her mother says Marichuy was thrown from the window.“I have every right to burn and to break,”saidZamudio during marches against femicide. “I am not going to ask permission from anybody, because I am breaking for my daughter."" Zamudio, who has become a fierce advocate against gender violence, was addressing a crowd in Mexico City during a demonstration honoringIngrid Escamilla, yet another woman brutally murdered in Mexico. “This has destroyed our lives. Unfortunately, we are many mothers that feel this pain,” she said in a separateinterview. Authorities have yet to arrest anyone in connection with Marichuy is death, though Mexico City is Human Rights Commission found that the investigators had failed to conduct a fair investigation. While Mexico is political corruption and impunity presents challenges specific to the country is relatives of femicide victims seeking violence, the rage of a mother, of a sister, of the community of a woman disappeared and murdered certainly has global resonance. Guillén is family and their lawyer Natalie Khawam are de mandingan independent congressional investigation into her disappearance and killing; in July, the military announced a panel of civilian consultants would investigate ""command climate and culture"" at the base where Guillén was killed. Her family also calls on congress to create an independent agency that would handle reports from military members who are victims of sexual harassment and assault. #IAmVanessaGuillen demonstrates the power of solidarity against sexual harassment, yet reckoning with gender violence in this country also means recognizing how entrenched patriarchal violence is, and how it extends beyond the military is ranks.",1,1,Teen Vogue

But Greta got to have the final laugh in the matter. As you may know, Trump refuses to acknowledge thathe is currently trailing Biden in the 2020 presidential election, so when Trump tweeted “STOP THE COUNT” yesterday, Greta saw it as an opportunity to embarrass him.

301,What the “Creator Economy” Promises—and What It Actually Does,0.0,43.0,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-the-creator-economy-promises-and-what-it-actually-does,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,25,"The influencer is a fading stock character of the Internet is comme dia dell’arte. Often a conventionally attractive white woman, she shows off her aspiration al life style via social-media channels. She accrues a large following, and the n makes a living by getting companies to sponsor the content of her glamorous life. The cliché of the influencer emerged, during the twenty-tens, from multimedia-rich platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, where the goal was to forge as cur ated and polished an image as possible. Influencers were social-media users as celebrities, with much of the vanity and purposelessness that the comparison implies. By now, the connotations of being an influencer are mostly negative—edited selfies, vapid captions, faux relatability, staged private-jet photos, and unmarked sponsorships. Accordingly, social-media platforms are embracing a new buzzword as a successor: “creator.”“Creator” is a term with a more wholesome air, conjuring an Internet in which we are all artisanal blacksmiths plying our digital craft. But what, exactly, the word implies beyond that is up for debate. According to Taylor Lorenz isreporting for, the term was originally marketed by YouTube, as early as 2011, as an alternative to vocabulary like “YouTube star,” which seemed to imply that only a few famous figures could succeed on the platform. But it is now used to describe practically anyone who is producing any form of content online. TikTokusers are “TikTok creators.” Members of the invitation-only real-time voice-chat app Clubhouse are “audio creators.” OnlyFans, a marketplace mostly used for pornography, hosts “adult-content creators.”Even proponents of the so-called “creator economy,” the lattice of new platforms and tools meant to serve creators, ca not quite agree on what the term means or whom it includes. Its rise has sparked asem antic debate that tends toward the solipsistic. “I think all influencers are creators; maybe not all creators are influencers,” Nicole Quinn, a partner at the venture-capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners, told me. Lightspeed is creator-economy investments include Cameo, a platform best known for custom video messages that celebrities sell to f ans, and Outschool, a marketplace for online classes. For Quinn, the difference in terminology comes down to success: influencers are already famous; creators are striving to be. Li Jin, the founder of the creator-economy investment firm Atelier Ventures, instead defined creators in terms of revenue. “Anyone whose fame stems from online channels, if they are able to earn income through that influence, I consider that to be the creator economy.”Despite its vagueness, “creator” is being adopted as a byword for a new generation of social-media spaces purportedly designed to support content producers in new ways. Where the ad-driven platforms Facebook and Twitter profit from our data and attention without giving much back, the likes of Clubhouse and OnlyFans promise to deliver a larger share of value to users by allowing for what Quinn, of Lightspeed, calls “direct monetization.” Instead of the company is selling ads based on over-all engagement, creators can get paid by their individual viewers, who might buy subscriptions, send tips, or crowd fund new projects. The word “influencer” emphasized a person is magnetic effect on her followers, a nebulous charisma easily turned toward marketing. “Creator,” by contrast, stresses that everyone posting on social media is producing something, pitching in to the collective effort of making user-generated platforms compelling and thus profitable. This idea has proved highly marketable: the creator economy has reportedly seen $1.3 billion in investment funding in 2021 thus far, nearly three times the funding it received in all of 2020. Creator-economy businesses have devised various revenue models as alternatives to advertising. Subscription-driven platforms like Patreon, Substack, and Buy Me a Coffee charge a percentage of users’ income in return for publishing and pay walling their content. Apps like Linktree, Beacons, and Feedlink offer a service that, for a monthly fee, expands the Web site links that sit in the bios of social-media accounts, directing fans to a creator is various content channels. Marketplaces for non-fungible tokens (NF T.s), like Foundation, Rarible, and SuperRare, allow creators to sell expensive digital-art objects in exchange for commission fees. On Twitch, a site where users can live-stream content like video games, and Heygo, a streaming site that provides a virtual proxy for travel, viewers can access video streams for free, with the option to send tips to the hosts. According to Quinn, March of 2020 was the “key inflection point” for this burgeoning economy, as the increased appetite for digital content and the loss of jobs in other industries during the pandemic prompted more people to try their luck as creators. In some ways, the creator economy does appear to give more agency to the user. Rather than trying to game social-media algorithms, creators can theoretically rely on more dependable income from supporters. They can choose which kinds of work they take on, whether it be newsletters, livestreams, or audio chats. “They do not have to care about fighting against the current of the platform,” Sam Yam, the co-founder of Patreon, a pioneer of the creator economy, said. In Yam is mind, earning a living as a creator is an evolution of the so-called gig economy facilitated by companies like Uber and TaskRabbit. Followers are paying for access to someone is unique talent or voice. “You care about the individual more than just the task that needs to be done,” Yam said. “It is value exchanged for creativity.” The model promises a more human and less automated interaction. What were once called followers—the anonymous numbers racking up on a profile page like so many fungible eyeballs—are now customers, supporters, and patrons. But this emerging field, in many ways, resembles a gig economy for digital content. Participants are still precarious workers, relying on the whims of corporations for their livelihoods. Much like an Uber driver or a twenty-tens Instagram influencer, the creator is responsible for her own marketing, health care, and tax contributions. She makes money for the platform that hosts her without receiving the legal and financial protections of employee status, or the stock options typically given to the platform is engineers, designers, and managers. Meanwhile, the social-media giants are developing their own version of the creator economy in an attempt to keep users from fleeing to newer, smaller platforms. Last year, TikTok launched a Creator Fund to pay its users directly for popular content. Snapchat launched a similar program called Spotlight, which offers creators millions of dollars of compensation a month. This past week, Facebook, which owns Instagram, announced that it would pay out more than a billion dollars to users across its platforms by 2022. Anshuman Iddamsetty, a former pod cast producer who now runs a Patreon focussed on erotic self-portraiture, and who uses the pronouns “they” and “them,” told me that they make an adequate living from that account and an OnlyFans page. But they said that the re is a gap between the platforms’ message that anyone can “build an independent creative career,” as Patreon is Web site touts, and the reality of being a solo entrepreneur. “Patreon does not suddenly, magically make the act of creating your deliverables easier,” they said. Ambiguous guidelines can give platforms the power to block users or types of content at will; Patreon does allow some forms of adult content, but Iddamsetty, who describes themself as a “fat erotic artist,” has run into unexpected barriers. Creator-economy hype is relevant “only if you are a certain kind of creator with a certain kind of product,” they said. Even Yam, of Patreon, recognizes the limitations of the burgeoning field. He anticipates a future in which both the social-media giants and the creator-economy brands are avoidable altogether. Each creator will instead have her own custom-built platform, “their own world top to bottom,” from the underlying technology to the published content—an “ownership economy.” For the time being, though, the bulk of users will continue to rely on the preëstablished attention economy for the bulk of their digital consumption. “Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, those are just as dominant as ever,” Jin said. “Today, no one finds a person on Patreon; you go there after you have found them.” In other words, to be a creator, you still have to be an influencer after all.",1,1,The New Yorker
302,Students and faculty urge deeper look at land-grant legacy,-14.17,42.17,https://www.hcn.org/issues/53.1/indigenous-affairs-land-grab-universities-students-and-faculty-urge-deeper-look-at-land-grant-legacy,https://adfontesmedia.com/high-country-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,16,"A banner hangs on a statue of Cornell University is founder, Ezra Cornell, on Indigenous Peoples’ Day this year. Della Keahna UranWhenpublished “Land-Grab universities” last April, the two-year-long investigation shed new light on a dark open secret: One of the largest transfers of land and capital in the country is history had masqueraded as a donation for university endowments. HCNidentified nearly 11 million acres of land, expropriated from approximately 250 tribes, bands and communities through more than 160 violence-backed treaties and land cessions. Now, in the wake of the investigation, land-grant universities across the country are re-evaluating the capital they built from these stolen Indigenous lands. More than 150 years after President Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Act — the legislation that transferred the lands — new discussions about the universities’ moral and ethical responsibilities have forced Americans to re-examine the law is legacy. Land-grant institutions have long prided the mselves on their accomplishments as beneficiaries: They used the proceeds generated by the land to broaden access to higher education, the reby contributing to economic development across the nation. But many of those institutions paid next to nothing for the public lands they received and sold. By far the largest beneficiary was Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, which acquired almost 1 million acres from Ojibwe, Miwok, Yokuts, Dakota and other Indigenous nations through 63 treaties or seizures. The land came from 15 states, and by 1935, when the last parcel was sold, Cornell University had generated nearly $6 million for its endowment, the largest of any land-grant institution. Adjusted for inflation, it raised over $92 million. Now, as the country reconsiders long-standing issues of racial equity and justice — focusing on everything from local political races to national legislation — students and faculty alike are pressuring administrators to address the investigation is findings. On Indigenous Peoples’ Day, October 12, 2020, members of Native American and Indigenous Students at Cornell (NAISAC) put forward a list of 10 demands in the form of apetition. The demands include turning the American Indian and Indigenous Studies Program into a university department; recruiting new Indigenous faculty and students, specifically Indigenous students affected and/or displaced by the Morrill Act; waiving tuition for those students; acknowledging the land of the Gayogo̱hó:nǫ’, or Cayuga Nation, before every Ithaca-based event; and reinstating an ad-hoc committee on Native American Affairs to oversee the approval of these demands.“If the president is office was responsible, the n they would meet each of these demands to the extent that we have laid them out in our petition,” said Colin Benedict (Mohawk), the external relations chair for NAISAC. “Each of these demands in my mind is completely 100% justified and should already have been implemented by the university decades ago.”As of December 1, the petition had more than 900 signatures from students, staff, alumni and community members. The president is office has yet to respond publicly, but in an email exchange, it stated, “The Office of the President is in receipt of the NAISAC petition, and the President is looking forward to working with the Native American and Indigenous community at Cornell on these issues.”A faculty committee, headed by American Indian and Indigenous Studies Program Director Kurt Jordan, launched theCornell University and Indigenous Dispossession Project. The project will research Cornell is Morrill Act land history, identify the Indigenous communities affected, and foster discussion of possible remedies.“We have had a number of statements that have been made by the administration in light of the George Floyd murder, Black Lives Matter, and all of the other things that have been happening this year about the need for Cornell to really address its legacy, its historical roots, its complicity in … to some degree, with white supremacy,” Jordan said.“Benefiting from stolen Indigenous land has to be part of that.”History professor Jon Parmenter recently discovered that Cornell is in possession of over 420,000 acres of mineral rights in the Central and Southwestern US, a portion of which was retained through Morrill Act lands. In its petition, NAISAC urged the university to release a statement acknowledging the amount of land acquired, the interest accrued and mineral rights funds received, and pledging to refrain from mineral and resource extraction on those lands., faculty and students at the University of California, Berkeley have also made strides. Established in 1868, the university received almost 150,000 acres from the Morrill Act. The land raised $730,000 for the university is early endowment, and, adjusted for inflation, has generated over $13 million. The university paid nothing in return. The presence and history of Indigenous people has been largely erased from the UC system, said Phenocia Bauerle (Apsáalooke), director of Native American Student Development at the University of California, Berkeley. Two years ago, Bauerle and the Native American Student Development center created a land acknowledgment to honor the Ohlone tribal lands that the university sits upon. However, the university has yet to adopt an official acknowledgment. According to aCalifornia audit, UC Berkeley is the worst offender among the schools when it comes to complying with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which grants Indigenous nations the right to regain ancestral remains and objects from museums. UC Berkeley has only repatriated 20% of its 500,000-artifact collection. In comparison, the University of California Los Angeles has repatriated 96% of its collection.“A lot of it comes down to, well, they see these issues as historical and not of the present because they see Natives as historical and not of the present,” Bauerle said. Since the dispossession occurred in the past, contemporary people do not see the mselves as responsible, and they feel no pressure to address the issue today. However, “ ‘Land-Grab’ gave us several concrete (points),” Bauerle said. “This dispossession of Native land that this whole country benefits from — here is a specific way that we can show you that Berkeley actually played a part in it. These are the receipts. This is how much money you got.”Bauerle partnered with Rosalie Z Fanshel, a doctoral student in environmental science, policy and management and the program manager for the Berkeley Food Institute, to organize a conference on the Morrill Act and Indigenous land dispossession.“The UC Land Grab: A Legacy of Profit from Indigenous Land” was held in two parts in September and October. The conference dug deep into the history of California is genocide and the founding of the University of California. Participants called for action, including shared land stewardship, research opportunities and tuition options for Indigenous students. More than 500 people attended both days of the conference. David Ackerly, dean of the Rausser College of Natural Resources in Berkeley, was among them. “I felt like I was learning so much that I had not been aware of,” he said. “This is part of our story, I want to be part of this. I want to learn. I want to figure out where we are heading.”Other attendees included staff from the office of UC President Michael V Drake, the office of the chancellor at UC Berkeley and the governor is office, as well as deans and administrators from various UC campuses and units.“Many Native and Indigenous people in the state and across the world have been made promises since colonization, and they have been broken. It is hard not to remember that legacy; I live in that legacy.”One of the panelists, Brittani Orona, a doctoral candidate in Native American studies and human rights at UC Davis and a member of the Hoopa Valley Tribe, was surprised by how many people within the university system had no knowledge of the history of land-grant institutions. “I think with Native people and Native students, you know that our land, our places have been taken away from us, from many different institutions and at many different points of time,” Orona said. At the conference, Orona spoke about the history of genocide in California. “Scholars of California Indian genocide will say it ended in 1873, but I argue it is a continuous process,” Orona said.“Many Native and Indigenous people in the state and across the world have been made promises since colonization, and they have been broken. It is hard not to remember that legacy; I live in that legacy.”Orona, who will complete her PhD. in the coming year, hopes that future Native and Indigenous students have a different experience than she did. “What does that mean, when you are having California Native students pay out of pocket on land that has been dispossessed from them?I appreciate the discussions that are going on, but I will believe it when I see it — and when it moves beyond acknowledgment towards actual actionable items that make life easier for Native and Indigenous students and peoples.”As of December 4, UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ has yet to respond about the conference publicly. In an email, however, she wrote, “To achieve this inclusive campus culture, we must acknowledge how our history, including the Morrill Land Grant Act, impacts Indigenous people. Now more than ever, we, as a university, must take immediate action to acknowledge past wrongs, build trusting and respectful relationships, and accelerate change and justice for our Native Nations and Tribal communities.”High Country News.

""And even when this community is represented, businesses and media rely too heavily upon stereotypical, inauthentic imagery.""Furthermore, our research suggests that LGBTQ+ people in countries with less LGBTQ+ representation in the visuals that surround the m, including media and advertising, actually report experiencing more anti-LGBTQ discrimination and bias -- for example, in Germany, where representation is lower, discrimination is higher, as opposed to in the US Which is to say that authentic imagery which accurately and positively captures the nuances of this diverse community is not only needed, but can have a positive impact globally.""Getty is 2021Visual GPSsurvey found that only 21 percent of global respondents said they saw LGBTQ+ people represented regularly or frequently in visuals (the number for the US was somewhat higher, about one-fourth).

'There is nothing we ca not do if we do it together'Inside, the headline was:It is Time to Come Together: A divided nation in the grips of a pandemic turned out in historic numbers to elect Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. 'Let is give each other a chance,' Biden told the millions who sought a second term for President Trump. 'We are not enemies, we are Americans.'Next to the article is first words was a quote from Harris: America ""chose hope, unity, decency, science -- and yes, truth."" That does not sound like ""unity"" talk, does it?reporter Sandra Sobieraj Westfall proved a reliable Biden repeater by beginning and ending this chronicle with tender stories of deceased Bidens. In large type, it began:It continued:The lyrics to ""On Eagle is Wings,"" a favorite hymn sung at the 2015 funeral of his son Beau -- who died of brain cancer at age 46 -- had kept coming back to the former Vice President over the five days he spent at his Delaware home watching voting returns trickle in as his grandchildren buzzed around him. ""After Beau passed, it was difficult for him to listen to [that hymn],"" says close friend Ted Kaufman. Now as Biden added its words to his first words as president-elect -- ""He will raise you up...make you to shine like the sun"" -- he aimed to lead Americans on the first step to healing writ large. ""Joe standing on that stage, reciting that hymn, proves that you can come back from even the worst,"" says Kaufman. ""When it comes to healing for the country, he knows it is possible.""They repeat the story with a picture of Joe and Beau and a long caption on the story is final page, where Beau says ""you have got to promise me, Dad, that no matter what happens, you are going to be all right."" And Westfall goes back to the violins:Through it all, Biden leans on what he is learned about healing -- not just from Beau is death, but form the December day in 1972 when his wife Neilia and baby daughter Naomi were killed in a car crash that landed his young boys Beau and Hunter in the hospital.""Having lived through almost inconceivable loss and failure [in his earlier presidential campaigns], Joe Biden knows humility and resilience,"" says historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, who sees in the President-elect now a bit of Teddy Roosevelt is gift for helping people from all corners ""feel common American citizenship"" and FDR is ability during World War II to rally Americans to ""accept brutal reality.""It is natural to think of lost loved ones at big turning points in your life. But with the Bidens, this has happened so often in 2020 (as it did at the convention) that it sounds like strategic messaging.",1,0,NewsBusters

Tongues are wagging about the new arrival. Amy Beth Bennett/South Florida Sun SentinelA man walks past Oceanview Adult Toys & More on Fort Lauderdale Beach on Wednesday, November 18, 2020. A touch of decadence arrived on Fort Lauderale is Las Olas Boulevard in the form of a controversial sex shop in a hard-to-miss spot just a block from the beach. But its day in the sun did not last long. Ocean View Boutique, with its wall-to-wall racks of sex toys, opened on Monday. Just four days later, the store got an urgent visit from code officers Thursday saying it had to close. Fort Lauderdale ended up yanking the store is business license because it sits too close to the city is new oceanfront park at Las Olas and A1A, in violation of a local ordinance.“This is not kosher for that site — an adult toy store has to be at least 500 feet from a park,” Vice Mayor Steve Glassman said Thursday afternoon. The store owner did not mention what kind of retail he planned to sell when he filled out his business license application, Glassman said. City officials got their first clue when the complaints started rolling in. Owner Percy Siriwardana, of Cutler Bay in Miami-Dade County, declined to comment when a South Florida Sun Sentinel reporter called the store Thursday morning. News of an adult toy store opening so close to an oceanfront landmark corner had critics in a tizzy, wondering how in the world such a thing could happen. Nearby residents were worried they’d end up being stuck with their new neighbor. Jo Ann Medalie, a 60-year resident of the beach, was over the moon when she heard the place had been shut down.“Oh my God, that makes my day,” she said with glee. “I was worried it might be a lost cause. That did get people wound up, did not it? People were just up in arms.”The store hadblacked-out windows so passers-by could not see the merchandise. A sign warned visitors they had to be at least 18 years old to enter. Not a good fitJohn Burns, president of the Venetian Condo Association, ventured inside the other day, curious to see exactly what was being sold.“When you walk in, it is got toys and playthings that, quite frankly, I do not know what to do with,” he said. “They have racks and walls of adult toys. It is kind of shocking to see in the middle of our beach. It does not set the right tone. The garish lights at nighttime make it look a strip joint in Times Square. It just looks out of place.”Bob Casullo has a birds-eye view of the place from his condo across the street. He caught wind of the new store after seeing a neighbor ranting about it on Facebook.“I do not think that is the right place for an adult toy store,” said Casullo, who lives at the Venetian near A1A and Las Olas. “What are you going to do, buy a dildo on your way to the beach? The women in our building are outraged.”Fort Lauderdale has spent years luring high-end development in an attempt to bring grace, elegance and class to a beach once known for dive bars, wet T-shirt contests and raucous Spring Breaks.“They are taking retail in the wrong direction,” Mayor Dean Trantalis said during a meeting this week at City Hall. “That is not what we are looking for.”Glassman said he had no idea a sex shop was even on the horizon for that corner.“I found out about it when someone text ed me a photo the other day,” he said earlier this week. “At first blush, it does not seem to fit into the vision we have for that corridor. It is not the best fit.”Adult toys and moreNeighbors got their first notice change was coming to 2941 East Las Olas Blvd. when a mammoth sign was hung last weekend blasting the news: “Adult toys and more.”Ina Lee, owner of Travelhost Magazine of Greater Fort Lauderdale, summed up her reaction in two simple words: “Oh no.”Medalie had a one-word description for the store:Schlocky.“That was the last thing I expected to see on the beach,” she said. “We are trying to make this a major destination. When I saw the sign on that store, I thought ‘Oh my goodness. This is quite offensive.’ And where the re is one [adult sex shop], more tend to crop up.”Resident Abby Laughlin wondered how a sex shop could operate right across the street from Fort Lauderdale is new oceanfront “family-friendly” park. The park, Las Olas Oceanside Park at 3000 E Las Olas Blvd., opened last year across from Fort Lauderdale is storied Elbo Room bar. New face, new image?Laughlin joked that the sex shop represents the new face of Fort Lauderdale beach.“Really? Is this the best we can do at our ‘world-class’ beach?” she asked. “Oy! It is an embarrassment for Fort Lauderdale beach.”Glassman, whose district encompasses the beach, says he’d already gotten complaints from residents. So had Commissioner Ben Sorensen. Both mentioned the sex shop drama this week during a City Hall meeting, prompting Trantalis to recall his fight against another adult toy store coming to town — and losing.“I remember the debate we had when Hustler wanted to take over the Peaches record store,” Trantalis said. That was in 2004, when the commission the n in office embraced theHustler project in a 3-2 vote. Sixteen years later, the Hustler shop is still in operation at 1500 East Sunrise Blvd., just blocks from the Galleria mall. Casullo says he has nothing against sex shops, but was relieved to learn his would-be neighbor got the heave-ho.“I do not begrudge them their business,” he said. “I just did not think that was the right place to put it. Where should it go? Next door to the mayor is house.”Susannah Bryan can be reached atsbryan@sunsentinel.comor on Twitter @Susannah_Bryan",1,2,Sun Sentinel

308,Data Brokers Are a Threat to Democracy,-7.0,37.67,https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-data-brokers-are-a-threat-to-democracy/,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-13,25,"You have probably never heard of Acxiom, but it likely knows you: The Arkansas firm claims to have data on 2.5 billion people around the world. And in the US, if someone is interested in that information, there are virtually no restrictions on their ability to buy and the n use it. Enter the data brokerage industry, the multi billion dollar economy of selling consumers’ and citizens’ intimate details. Much of the privacy discourse has rightly pointed fingers at Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok, which collect users’ information directly. But a far broader ecosystem of buying up, licensing, selling, and sharing data exists around those platforms. Data brokerage firms are middlemen of surveillance capitalism—purchasing, aggregating, and repackaging data from a variety of other companies, all with the aim of selling or further distributing it. Data brokerage is a threat to democracy. Without robust national privacy safeguards, entire databases of citizen information are ready for purchase, whether to predatory loan companies, law enforcement agencies, or even malicious foreign actors. Federal privacy bills that do not give sufficient attention to data brokerage will the refore fail to tackle an enormous portion of the data surveillance economy, and will leave civil rights, national security, and public-private boundaries vulnerable in the process. Large data brokers—like Acxiom, CoreLogic, and Epsilon—tout the detail of their data on millions or even billions of people. CoreLogic, for instance,advertisesits real estate and property information on 99.9 percent of the US population. Acxiompromotes11,000-plus “data attributes,” from auto loan information to travel preferences, on 2.5 billion people (all to help brands connect with people “ethically,” it adds). This level of data collection and aggregation enables remarkably specific profiling. Need to run ads targeting poor families in rural areas? Check out one data broker is “Rural and Barely Making It” data set. Or how about racially profiling financial vulnerability? Buy another company is “Ethnic Second-City Strugglers” data set. These are just some of the disturbing titles captured in a 2013 Senatereporton the industry is data products, which have only expanded since. Many other brokers advertise their ability to identify subgroups upon subgroups of individuals through criteria like race, gender, marital status, and income level, all sensitive characteristics that citizens likely did not know would end up in a database—let alone up for sale. These companies often acquire the information through purchase, licensing, or other sharing agreements with third parties. Oracle, for example, “owns and works with” over 80 data brokers, according to a 2019report, aggregating information on everything from consumer shopping to internet behavior. However, many companies also scrape data that is publicly viewable on the internet and the n aggregate it for sale or sharing. “People search” web sites often fall into this latter category—compiling public records (property filings, court documents, voting registrations, etc.) on individuals and the n letting anyone on the internet search for their information. All of these unchecked practices undermine civil rights. Companies that boast holding thousands of data points on millions or billions of people—all for selling them to whomever is buying—themselves represent the aggregation of unrestrained surveillance power. This is particularly dangerous to the less powerful. As centuries of surveillance in the USs have made undeniably clear, the impact of stockpiling individuals’ personal information will fall hardest on the already oppressed or marginalized: the poor, Black and brown communities, Indigenous populations, LGBTQ+ individuals, undocumented immigrants. “People search” web sites in particular can publicize addresses and thus enable intimate partner violence ordoxing. The strong financial incentives to sell data, with virtually nonexistent limitations, gives these companies every reason to share their data with others, including those who use it for harm. Andrew  Williams Matt  BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoLaw enforcement already buys up data from brokers. The Department of Homeland Security, including subagencies responsible for putting children in cages, have purchased cell phone location data on millions of Americans,home address information to support deportations, and home utility data for investigations, among others. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also been purchasing cell phone location data from data broker Venntel. These practices circumvent democratic accountability: Agencies buy the information without warrants, and in doing so may bypass prohibitions on companies handing data directly to law enforcement. Plus, the data may not even be accurate. Aninvestigationbyidentified dozens of US cases over the last decade where individuals were denied housing because screening companies used bad information, often purchased from data brokers or pulled from “people search” broker websites. Citizens also get rejected from jobs because of background checks relying on incorrect data. The unregulated sale of massive databases of citizen information—and the unregulated aggregation and publication of that information online—also undermines national security. This was one of the missing elements of the policy debate over TikTok. If the US government is concerned about foreign authoritarian powers building detailed profiles on citizens, or even just on government personnel, the n data brokers’ ability to sell, share, or publish intimate data sets on Americans with virtually no restriction should be of urgent concern too. Foreign powers could buy this data through shell companies or steal it by hacking. It could the n be used to run micro targeted election ads. It could be used to inform counterintelligence operations or identify persons of interest in the business community. Criminal groups could even use this information to target politicians or judges. Not to mention, the largest data brokers are lobbying more aggressively in Washington. Another recent investigation by found that25 such companies spent $29 million on lobbying in 2020, rivaling the efforts of Facebook or Google. That is why it is more urgent than ever that legislators and regulators address this industry as a key part of protecting Americans’ privacy and curbing harms the industry causes abroad. With zero safeguards, this data sale will only continue threatening democracy. Federal privacy legislation should consider all companies that sell data as part of the data brokerage economy,not just those who sell data on third parties. Local and state laws on public records should likewise account for the intimate partner violence and do xi ng risks of that information getting scraped and published on the global internet.

310,Here is What Researchers Have Discovered So Far About COVID Vaccines And Donated Breast Milk,0.0,45.0,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolefallert/covid-vaccine-breast-milk,https://adfontesmedia.com/buzzfeed-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"Organizations that provide donated breast milk to parents say fielding questions about how the vaccines figure into the transfer of antibodies has led to a “second layer of chaos” from the pandemic. BuzzFeed News ReporterDanielle Byrdsong loaded bags of breast milk into her car, preparing to make her first donation since receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in April.“To be honest, I was a little concerned,” she said. Byrdsong, a 36-year-old mother of two living in the Washington, DC, area, told BuzzFeed News that at the time, she did not know if getting the COVID vaccine would affect her ability to donate her breast milk — an information gap that is increasingly becoming a factor for milk banks as more of the US population is vaccinated. A key question from donors and recipients is whether protection against the coronavirus travels through a vaccinated person is breast milk to an infant. While long-term studies at a larger scale are needed, early research suggests that the answer is yes.“We do not have that proof,” said Kim Updegrove, the executive director at Mothers' Milk Bank at Austin. “We are assuming that it is protective. We are assuming that it is coming through with the milk and that it is a really good thing. All of that leads to a very interesting question coming from people who sit on both sides of the vaccine fence.”Fielding uncertainty about the vaccine has become the pandemic is “second layer of chaos” for milk banks, Updegrove said. Fifteen months after the banks initially addressed panic over the effect COVID-19 might have on lactating or pregnant people, there is a growing need for information regarding whether infants are protected against the virus via the milk of vaccinated people. Donations are typically collected by nonprofit organizations that test the milk, mix multiple donors’ milk into single batches, and distribute the nutrient-rich pooled product to medical providers for people likeParisHenderson, a 33-year-old mother whose son was born prematurely in May The hospital offered her donor milk when her own milk did not come in after the early delivery; her body was behind schedule and unprepared to produce milk. Henderson has not received a COVID-19 vaccine but tested positive for antibodies after she overcame the virus.“I did not care if the person was vaccinated or not,” Henderson said about the people who donated the milk her son received. It mattered more to her that her baby received the nutrients in the milk, she added. A main reason for confusion is a lack of robust clinical study about the effect of the COVID-19 vaccines on pregnant or lactating people. As is standard for most clinical trials, pregnant people were left out of the COVID-19 vaccine trials. To include them would have meant that researchers needed to collect data on both parents and babies, potentially prolonging the clinical trial process and raising complicated ethical questions. According to theCDC, the re is little to no information available about the safety and effects of the vaccines on breast milk as of now, but specific clinical trials are underway or planned.“It just feels like another [instance] in which women are just sort of forgotten,” said Erin Burgin, a 35-year-old mother of two from the Washington, DC, area. After becoming pregnant in 2020 and delivering a few months ago, Burgin said the lack of information on the safety of breastfeeding when vaccinated was “extremely unsettling.”But that is starting to change. Arecent joint study from Brigham and Women is Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital concluded that vaccinated parents do in fact pass their antibodies to infants via their breast milk. The study took place from December 2020 to February 2021 and evaluated 131 women who were either of reproductive age, lactating, or pregnant and about to receive either the Pfizer or Moderna shots. The researchers had two goals in mind: track if their vaccines worked against COVID-19 and, if so, whether the shot also provided protection to infants. Donor breast milk at the Mothers' Milk Bank at Austin is pasteurized and pooled into a single product.“We found that, reassuringly, pregnant and lactating women made similar amounts of antibodies in response to the vaccination, so vaccination was effective,” Dr. Kathryn Gray, lead author of the study, told BuzzFeed News. “For all the lactating individuals in our study, we found that the maternal antibodies also crossed into the breast milk. That suggests that there may be some benefit and protection conferred to infants from pregnant individuals and lactating individuals who are vaccinated.”But the immunity benefits for the baby do not last long after weaning, Stephanie Gaw, an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive sciences at the University of California, San Francisco, told BuzzFeed News. The antibodies coat the baby is mouth, throat, and digestive tract, keeping the virus from infecting the baby is cells, but researchers do not know for how long. Gawled a small study that determined both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines do not cross into breast milk. The study analyzed the breast milk of seven individuals at various time points after they received either mRNA vaccine. Researchers said the results bolstered recommendations that lactating people who get the vaccine should not stop breastfeeding. Gaw added that she saw no harm in mixing pre- and post-vaccine milk. While the new findings are reassuring, the results should not change how milk banks pool their donations, both Gaw and Gray said. Gray emphasized that prior to the pandemic, adults who produce breast milk are typically exposed to myriad infections and receive vaccines frequently. And as the population becomes more immune to COVID-19, these antibodies will just become another layer of protection breast milk provides babies that formula does not. But consistency is important, a report inNaturefound, because babies process antibodies within a matter of hours or days. As a result, any layer of protection that breast milk provides lasts only as long as babies are breastfed.“We have always asked about vaccinations during our screening process, so this is just a new set of information for us to collect,” said Rebecca Heinrich, director of Mothers’ Milk Bank. “We do not yet know what sort of antibody ‘load’ is transferred, or what sort of immune system boost it might provide, but of course our hope is that antibodies in donor milk help protect the infant from all sorts of pathogens, including COVID-19.”Byrdsong, the mother of two living in DC, said that for people like her, the first step should be clearing up confusion over whether antibodies or the vaccine itself is transferred via breast milk.“I think that most mothers who have concerns about the vaccine ... their discomfort with it has to do with the vaccine itself being given directly to a child versus antibodies,” Byrdsong said. “Personally, I do not know any mother who is against their child receiving antibodies, so I do not know if that is something that they understand, that the re is a difference between the two.”Burgin, who received the Moderna vaccine this spring, said she is currently breastfeeding her 6-month-old baby and gives her 3-year-old child a glass of breast milk each week as an immunity boost. Gaw said it is not yet clear how much milk an older child would need to achieve immunity or how long that immunity would take.“I talked to other moms who said that they have continued their breastfeeding journey longer because they had the vaccine and they want to help some of their older kids in their house,” Burgin said. “It is a huge discussion … and breast milk is an easy way to give [protection] to your kid who ca not get the vaccine yet.”Milk banks typically ask donors if they have received other major vaccines, such as against the measles, but they do not yet have a standardized method to prove that they have gotten the COVID-19 vaccine or if they have responded positively and developed antibodies, Updegrove said. However, on average, more than 50% of donors in most states have self-reported in their profile that they received one of the FDA-approved vaccines, she added. The Mothers' Milk Bank at Austin estimates it will process about 900,000 ounces of donor breast milk in 2021, about 100,000 more ounces than last year. But that will not change the way donated milk is pasteurized, said Lindsay Groff, executive director for Human Milk Banking Association of North America. She added that so far, the re is no information about the vaccine is effect on breast milk that would make any changes to the donation process necessary. Experts are also reminding parents that since milk from banks is pooled from multiple people, it is not possible to request milk from unvaccinated donors unless the recipient seeks it directly from an individual.“The reason why multi-donors are recommended in one pool of milk is that the women who are lactating and expressing their milk are not the same,” Updegrove said. “They are eating different diets, they are taking different vitamins. There is a value in mixing multiple different donors.”When asked about the typical profile of breast milk donors, Grey said she hopes to diversify the research on the vaccine is effect on people who are lactating, since her study consisted primarily of white, non-Latino women. Henderson said important information about the health and immunity benefits of breast milk has been lacking among Black parents, and in her case, where she lives in Vienna, Virginia, determined her ability to receive a donation.“I think more women in my community in particular would breast feed if they knew that they were providing their child with a sense of protection,” Henderson said. “I do not think that the information is there. Lactation consultations and breastfeeding centers, they are not available to all. We were fortunate to have our hospital in a wealthier area. That is why we got the donor milk … and they said, ‘This is not something that is offered everywhere.’ We may not have been fortunate enough to have it.”Now that her milk supply has come in, Henderson said she would “absolutely” donate her milk.“You could be saving somebody is life or preventing a baby from getting sick,” she said. “They are so susceptible to everything anyways, just that one little layer of protection. You do not really know, but I feel like it gives a parent peace of mind. A sense of comfort. And that is what I go back to. I do not know that I am doing everything, but I know that at least I am trying.”",2,1,BuzzFeed News

Theads—taken out in,The Washington Post, andThe Wall Street Journalon December 16—claim that Facebook is “standing up to Apple for small businesses,” for whom Apple is changes will be “devastating.” With its not-so-subtle implication that Apple does not care about lifting up the little guys, the campaign amounts to a mammoth bat-swing at the company, especially in this moment of antitrust inquiry and anti-monopoly reckoning. But while the social media giant is leading us in a seemingly virtuous direction, the reality is quite different. Facebook is contentions that this is bad for small business are most likely self-interested. But they are also plain wrong.is the author of and directs the Digital Platforms & Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School. He was a technology & economic policy adviser in the Obama-Biden White House and later, a privacy & public policy advisor at Facebook. The nuts and bolts of Apple is new policy, which will apply to iOS 14, are pretty clear: Data tracking is not allowed if the user chooses to disable the option. And that choice must be presented to the user through Apple is AppTrackingTransparency framework, which, in the user interface, appears as a typical iPhone pop-up query. Apple has further indicated that the kinds of practices that will qualify as tracking include in-app ad display targeted at users with the aid of third-party data, sharing of location data with brokers, sharing of personally identifiable information like email addresses with third-party ad networks for ad-retargeting or look alike targeting, and use of third-party SDKs that use in-app data for commercial ad-targeting services. This definition of tracking can be considered appropriately broad. It could be broader—Appleoffers some examples of practices that will still be allowed under the new policy. But as with every decision, there are natural trade-offs, and Apple has facedtremendouspushback from app developers and major tech firms in response to the announcement. The new policy does not come out of the blue, though. Some have suggested that Apple, along with other major tech firms, including Facebook, are instituting (or already have established) such policies in light of the growing regulatory stick in the air on all matters related to user privacy; the European Commission and the state of California, for instance, have each recently pushed new standards that favor their constituents' privacy rights. And we could soon see similar moves at the federal level in the USs, resulting either from the recently-pushed antitrust suits or the possibility of a reformative baseline privacy law. Facebook is ads claim that small businesses will be impacted—that its many app developers and small business advertisers around the world will suffer in the long run as a result of Apple is privacy-minded changes. Notably, the newspaper ads mention that 44 percent of “small to medium businesses started or increased their usage of personalized ads on social media during the pandemic” and that the “average small business advertiser stands to see a cut of over 60 percent in their sales for every dollar they spend.”But when one examines the technical changes that Facebook announced to its developer community in order to comply with Apple is update, the idea that small businesses advertising on its platform stand to lose a lot of revenue begins to look quite shaky. According to the post, Facebook will tweak engagement measurements so that advertisers cannot track more than eight types of “conversion events,” or in-app user actions that it measures to assess the effectiveness of ad-targeting algorithms. There will also be some minor technical changes to the implementations ofValue Optimization, Facebook is algorithmic tool that maximizes revenues generated from ad targeting by predicting how much a given user will spend in an app,as well as dynamic ads,measurement of performance of ad campaigns, and a subset of Facebook isdeveloper APIs. These are manageable changes—minor coding fixes—for small businesses who depend on Facebook to reach their customers and know their buying habits. But more to the point, they are changes that hurt Facebook and its affiliated data brokers and ad networks—not the main-street small businesses evoked by Facebook is newspaper ads. Andrew  Williams Matt  BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoIt is true that small businesses generally depend on advertising. In recent years, because of the overwhelming popularity of social media, and Facebook is monopoly in that space, that is meant that many small businesses depend on Facebook. But it does not have to be that way—small businesses would still find other places to advertise in targeted ways even if Facebook did not exist, let alone if its targeting and tracking features were fully deprecated. Consider the statistics Facebook presented in its ads. What does the fact that 44 percent of small businesses increased advertising during the pandemic effectively mean? Only that, during the pandemic, more people are stuck at home, and Facebook is monopoly ad network is seeing more consumption as a result. More businesses are advertising over it because more consumers are on the couch looking at their phones. This figure does not necessarily indicate that small businesses benefit from advertising on Facebook, just that they have no other option. The company also notes that without targeting, sales for small businesses would decrease by 60 percent for every dollar spent on Facebook ads. But that is a potentially misleading figure that does not speak to the possibility that these businesses will identify alternative places to reach consumers. We already know that without targeting based on personalized optimization, advertising on Facebook would be far less effective. Recall that in the Facebook advertising network, ad placement is priced by auction, meaning that with less effectiveness in targeting, the price of advertising on Facebook would correspondingly decrease—which in turn would open up more marketing budget for small businesses to advertise elsewhere. The result? Apple is policy will take a bite out of surveillance capitalism, and will hand that excess profit back to traditional media and advertising businesses that will offer small businesses a greater diversity of opportunities to get the word out about their products and services. A more meaningful number for Facebook to report would be how deprecating ad-targeting options correlates, if at all, to the overall commercial success of small businesses—not their sales rates on Facebook itself. Facebook can research and eventually report the former, but it is well aware that such a study would not yield a useful number for their purposes. Of course, in the short term, these changes will cause some minor headaches in updating advertising campaigns and code. But people will still want to buy local products, patronize mom-and-pop stores, and donate to their neighborhood charities. Meanwhile, Facebook will inevitably adjust its ad-targeting technologies and develop new methods of tracking users in aggregated and anonym i zed ways across its applications—innovations that will help the ad industry maintain profitability while respecting Apple is new compliance constraints. And are not these changes that the public should want, in any case? Small businesses owners are, at the end of the day, individual citizens and consumers, too. They care about privacy, just like anyone should—and any increase in data privacy, marginal or otherwise, is an economic win for consumers. Local and digital-first small businesses will still be able to compete fairly—and now, their owners will have a little more privacy protection to boot. There are trade-offs inherent to any policy change; it can be argued that even if advertisers experience a minor hit in ad-targeting in the near future, it is nonetheless good for the whole of society given the gains in individual privacy and autonomy that will also result. Andrew  Williams Matt  BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoWhat, the n, is Facebook talking about in its full-page ads? Not surprisingly, the hit to its own business—and business model. The practices of ad-targeting and engagement-tracking are precisely what make Facebook so tremendously powerful in the digital ecosystem. We know that the vastly dominant share—over 98 percent—of Facebook is global revenues, which in 2019 were over $70 billion, comes from advertising. Even a 5 percent hit to that equates to a loss of billions of dollars a year, a cut that Facebook is financial community—including capitalists, shareholders, and the company is own executives and staff—does not want to see. As many have now contended, Facebook is a monopoly. The company has a dominant share in various subsectors of the consumer internet that are economically critical in the media ecosystem—including social media and web-based text messaging. In fact, Facebook could arguably be considered amonopoly, in that the company takes advantage of powerful network effects that, absent regulatory intervention, establish it as the dominant market player in perpetuity. Using its monopoly power, Facebook has undertaken a number of steps designed to put a stranglehold over the social media economy: buying up rival firms, copying the practices of smaller players, sucking up intellectual talent including independent academics, collecting personal data at exploitative rates and using it for questionable means, and, along with Google, monopolizing the process of information exchange over advertising networks. An imposition of greater privacy protection—instantiated by Apple in response to new, progressive privacy regulations—might be precisely what helps small businesses gain a greater economic foothold. To be sure, Apple is no angel. But the changes it is implementing next year are a good thing for an American and global public that increasingly cares about digital rights and personal privacy. At the end of the day, small businesses are owned by people like you and me—people who the mselves will benefit from improved privacy rights. WIRED Opinionhere, and see our submission guidelineshere.

312,Geography and money will be key as Marshall and Bollier vie for Senate seat in Kansas,2.67,43.67,https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article244743007.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/kansas-city-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,17,"Republican Representative Roger Marshalldefeated former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobachin Tuesday is GOP Senate primary by dominating Wichita and his political home base of western Kansas. The results suggestDemocratic nominee Barbara Bollierfaces a steep challenge in limiting Marshall is support in the state is largest city. Staying competitive in Wichita is likely crucial for Bollier to have a shot at becoming the first Kansas Democrat to serve in the US Senate since the 1930s. Both sides scrambled Wednesday to set the terms of the fight. Republicans had expected a close primary race, but Marshall instead easily dispatched Kobach on Tuesday night.“I think we will have the resources to protect our fort and build out our territory,” Marshall said in an interview Wednesday. “Tell our story of a fifth generation farm kid who became a first generation college student … I think when we share that story it resonates.”But Marshall, a Great Bend OB-GYN, received softer support in the Kansas City area, offering Bollier a potential weakness to exploit. Bollier, a state senator and retired anesthesiologist from Mission Hills, said Tuesday voters want someone with “common sense and a voice of reason.” She moved swiftly Wednesday to intensify her outreach to Republicans, releasing a new ad with Tom Moxley, a former Republican state lawmaker and rancher from Council Grove in central Kansas.“I have never voted for a Democrat for US Senate in my lifetime,” Moxley says in the ad. “But I am going to vote for Barbara Bollier.”Bollier, who did not face a competitive primary,has been a fundraising machine. She has set records for Kansas Democrats and her campaign said Tuesday she is heading into the general election with $4.5 million on hand compared to Marshall is roughly $1 million as of mid-July.“After an expensive and bruising primary, Marshall will face a formidable opponent in Dr. Barbara Bollier, who has been building a strong grassroots campaign, a broad coalition of support, and a massive resource advantage for the general election,” said Helen Kalla, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of Senate Democrats. Still, Republicans believe their party, which holds a significant registration advantage over Democrats, will quickly unite around Marshall.“As of today Barbara Bollier has a lot more money than Roger Marshall does, but Roger Marshall has a lot more voters. It is much easier for Roger Marshall to get a lot more money in the next 90 days than it is for Barbara Bollier to get a lot more voters. And the person who finishes with the most voters wins,” said David Kensinger, who has managed statewide campaigns for Senator Pat Roberts and former Governor Sam Brownback. With all precincts reporting, Marshall had 40% of the vote to Kobach is 26%. Advance mail-in ballots may trickle in the rest of the week, but Marshall is margin of victory was greater than the number of ballots that may be received. Statewide, Marshall won 158,486 votes as of Tuesday in the 11-candidate GOP primary, deflecting super PACs and rival campaigns that spent millions in attacks ads. Bollier won 152,891 votes in a Democratic primary rout against an opponent, Robert Tillman, who spent less than $3,200 in the race. Marshall won every county but one west of Emporia, taking some with an outright majority. In Sedgwick County, where Wichita is located, he trounced Kobach 47 percent to 26 percent.“If you look at that map, west of Topeka is Marshall country,” Marshall said. “I think we are the favorite, but we are going to have to have a good plan and execute it really well.”Marshall won Johnson County, the state is most populous, but by a narrower margin: 33% to Kobach is 25%. He lost Wyandotte County and most other eastern counties. The weaker GOP support for the congressman in those areas may offer Democrats an opportunity. But many Kobach supporters will still likely show up in November to vote for Marshall. Bollier will also have to work to limit Marshall is support in Sedgwick County. Chris Pumpelly, a Wichita-based Democratic consultant, said Bollier will have to follow Democratic Governor Laura Kelly is model and invest time and resources in the Wichita area. Kelly, previously a Topeka state senator, won the governor is office in 2018 in part by winning Sedgwick County.“To be successful, Senator Bollier has to follow the path that has already been established, investing in Sedgwick County, driving out turnout in Democratic areas and Democratic women,” said Pumpelly, who worked on Wichita Mayor Brandon Whipple is successful 2019 campaign. “I am confident her team has the experience and wisdom to do that.”He said Bollier is message focused on the pandemic will resonate in Wichita.“I think that Wichitans, especially, are feeling a lot of the pain of what is going on in the economy with our aviation taking a hit,” he said. “What Dr. Bollier needs to do is speak in the language of authenticity … of compassion.”The Kansas Democratic Party on Wednesday previewed how it plans to attack Marshall this fall, releasing a memo labeling the race a “contest between polar opposites.” It highlights Marshall is health care voting record and accuses him of failing to protect Kansas farmers during the USs’ trade war with China — suggesting Democrats will try to cut into Marshall is rural support. Republicans will mine Bollier is voting record for lines of attack. Kobach told reporters before polls closed Tuesday that while Bollier will paint herself as a moderate former Republican, she has taken a “radically left” position on many issues. He called her “radically pro-abortion.”“So the task for Republicans is going to be very quickly to educate voters about her votes. It is a very issue-based campaign, not a personal attack,” Kobach said. Bollier said she will always support the right of people to have a private physician-patient relationship. Legislators do not belong in that relationship, she said.“I also have always represented my constituents well and that is why they kept electing me. So his word choice would not ring true,” Bollier said. “I have been about the majority of the people and what they have wanted in the state.”This story was originally publishedAugust 5, 2020, 1:02 PM.",1,1,Kansas City Star
313,“Complete incompetence:” Biden team slams Trump is COVID work,-8.33,44.67,https://arstechnica.com/science/2021/01/nothing-for-us-to-rework-biden-team-starts-from-scratch-on-covid/,https://adfontesmedia.com/ars-technica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-21,19,"Just a day into office, President Joe Biden and his administration have unveiled a comprehensive,200-page strategic plan and over a dozen executive orders and actions to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic currently rampaging across the country. With the running start, the administration hopes to finally get control over the virus, which has already taken the lives of more than 408,000 Americans. The number of deaths is expected to top 500,000 next month, Biden sai din an appearance Thursdayto unveil his strategic plan.""Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better,"" he said, calling his approach to the pandemic a ""full-scale wartime effort.""The lag between people becoming infected, developing COVID-19, and succumbing to the disease will keep the numbers grim for weeks to come, regardless of new efforts put in place today. But the administration says it is also facing challenges from inheriting the work from the previous administration. In remarks Thursday, Biden criticized the federal response so far: ""For the past year, we could not rely on the federal government to act with the urgency and focus and coordination that we needed, and we have seen the tragic cost of that failure.""Upon taking office,sources in the administration told CNN that they were shocked by the state of the federal work on the pandemic—or the lack the reof. ""There is nothing for us to rework,"" one source told the outlet. ""We are going to have to build everything from scratch.""Another source echoed that the Trump administration had no plan and that Biden is administration would have to start from ""square one."" Upon realizing the situation, the administration member reportedly responded: ""Wow, just further affirmation of complete incompetence.""To get control of the pandemic, Biden moved ahead with a series of actions, signing executive orders Wednesday requiring masking and physical distancing on federal properties and organizing a White House COVID-19 response team. Thursday, he revealed 10 additional executive orders, which aim to: boost manufacturing for vaccine supplies and equipment; reimburse states for emergency supplies and National Guard deployments; increase testing capacity; support the development of new the rapies; boost health data collection; guide schools on how to safely reopen; guide businesses on how to keep employees safe; require masking on transit and negative tests from international travelers; ensure and equitable pandemic response; and restore America is leadership in public health on the global stage. The 200-page strategic plan, titled ""National Strategy for the Covid-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness,"" fleshes out all the steps Biden has planned to tackle the pandemic. Chief among the priorities is to speed up vaccination, which has been plagued by disorganization since rollout began in December. So far, the federal government has distributed nearly 38 million doses, but only17.5 million doses have gone into people is arms and only about 2.4 million people have received their second dose. Biden has set a goal of administering 100 million vaccines in his first 100 days in office. To reach that goal, Biden aims to speed vaccine development, make the vaccine available to more people, increase the number of places people can get vaccinated, and expand the medical workforce that can administer vaccines. He has already authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency to begin setting up the first of many federal vaccination sites. One of the biggest vaccination hurdles so far appears to have been coordination between states and the federal government. In his final days at the helm, former Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar, laid the blame solely on states for the bungled rollouts. States, meanwhile, pointed fingers at the federal response. To address the problem, Biden noted in his remarks Thursday that he has directed FEMA to assign a ""COVID response liaison"" for each state, so that every state will have its own federal point person to coordinate federal and state efforts to distribute vaccine and get shots into people is arms. Meanwhile, Biden also took steps to rejoin the World Health Organization, retracting withdrawal notification sent by the Trump administration. In an address Thursday, top infectious disease expertAnthony Fauci told the WHO board: ""The USs stands ready to work in partnership and solidarity to support the international COVID-19 response, mitigate its impact on the world, strengthen our institutions, advance epidemic preparedness for the future, and improve the health and wellbeing of all people throughout the world.""",2,2,ARS Technica

Intermountain Healthcare said in a news release that surgeries that can be safely postponed could be delayed until after the coronavirus surge subsides. Intermountain says it will decide which surgeries to delay by balancing the needs of patients with the resources at each hospital.“While this may be disappointing for some patients, it is a necessary and appropriate step given the sharp spike in hospitalizations for patients with COVID-19,” the release states.

While the group apparently makes up about 60%of the video-sharing app is users (a casual 800 million people), TikTok is been something of a saving grace for people of all ages to dance away their feelings during quarantine. Butcountries,lawmakers, and President Trump say the app – owned by Chinese internet company ByteDance – is not goodFor You. And last Friday, Trump said he would ban it. Because of national security concerns. US officials have accused the company of sharing users' data to spy on US citizens and potentially even influence the US election. They are also worried about intellectual property the ft, which has already cost the US billions of dollars. One US senator called it a ""Trojan horse.""

After speaking with Trump, Microsoft said the deal with ByteDance was still on the table, pending a security review. And that it would build on the app is current structure but with enforced ""world-class security, privacy, and digital safety protections.""It is not the first time the US has taken steps to ban a Chinese company over national security concerns (see:Huawei and ZTE). And TikTok is already been banned byUS military branches. But now that an American company is offered to buy it up, some believe the security concerns will be a thing of the past. Others are still worried about the ever-growing power ofBig Tech. A ""new phase"" of COVID-19. Yesterday, White House coronavirus response coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said the US entered a ""new phase"" in the fight against the virus, calling it ""extraordinarily widespread"" across rural and urban areas. She stressed the ongoing importance of social distancing and wearing masks...evenpotentially at home(for people who live with someone who is at risk). It comes as cases in the South and Midwest have skyrocketed in recent weeks. And as California became the first state to report more than 500,000 cases. In all, the US has reported more than 4.6 million infections and over 154,000 deaths. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is. Yesterday, President Trump called for the federal government to seek the death penalty for the Boston Marathon bomber. Reminder: In 2013, Tsarnaev and his brother planted homemade bombs at the finish line, killing three people and injuring hundreds. While his brother died in a shootout with police, Tsarnaev was convicted on 30 charges and faced execution. Butlast week, a federal appeals court threw out his death sentence. It argued the original jury was not fully vetted for potential bias and ordered a new trial to determine whether Tsarnaev should be executed. Now, Trump is saying that ""rarely has anybody deserved the death penalty more than"" Tsarnaev and is asking the gov to seek it once again. Ellen DeGeneres. Last month, nearly a dozen current and former employees of ""The Ellen DeGeneres Show"" spoke to BuzzFeed News, accusing show execs and HR of racism and intimidation. Allegations included employees being fired for taking medical leave and racist comments toward a Black employee. WarnerMedialaunchedan internal investigation into the show and Ellenapologized, saying she is ""committed to ensuring"" this does not happen again.

The notion of a military strike was staunchly opposed, however, by chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley.“If you do this, you are gonna have a fucking war,” Milley is said to have warned Trump. According to the report, when Milley later asked why they were so intent on attacking the Iranians, Pence replied: “Because they are evil.”Milley believed while Trump did not necessarily want a war, he sought a missile strike in response to Iranian provocations against US interests in the region. The report said:In the months after the election, with Trump seemingly willing to do anything to stay in power, the subject of Iran was repeatedly raised in White House meetings with the President, and Milley repeatedly argued against a strike. Trump did not want a war, the chairman believed, but he kept pushing for a missile strike in response to various provocations against US interests in the region. Milley, by statute the senior military adviser to the President, was worried that Trump might set in motion a full-scale conflict that was not justified. Trump had a circle of Iran hawks around him and was close with the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, who was also urging the Administration to act against Iran after it was clear that Trump had lost the election. “If you do this, you are gonna have a fucking war,” Milley would say. The report went on to say the outgoing president convened his advisers in the Oval Office on January 3 to discuss recent reports from the International Atomic Energy Agency on Iran is nuclear activities. At that point both Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and National Security Adviser Robert O’Brien told Trump “it was not possible to do anything militarily at that point,” the report said. “Their attitude was that it was ‘too late to hit them.’“After Milley walked through the potential costs and consequences, Trump agreed.

Trump pointed to a column penned by conservative law professor John Eastman, suggesting that Harris is not eligible to serve as vice president.“I heard it today that she does not meet the requirements, and by the way the lawyer who wrote the piece is highly qualified, very talented.”For years, Trump promoted the so-called birth er conspiracy theory aboutBarack Obama, suggesting that his predecessor was not born in the USs. The debunked theory is widely regarded as racist. Trump made the remarks about Harris just two days after the Democratic Party is presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden, announced her as his running mate. In his op-ed, Eastman argued that the California senator is ineligible to serve as president because her father was a Jamaican national and her mother an Indian national. Neither of the two, he argued, was a naturalized citizen at the time of Harris’ birth. Eastman pointed to the 12th Amendment and Article II of the US Constitution. He also wrote that Harris cannot serve because of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment. The law professor concluded that Harris’ background needs to be reexamined amid reports of Russian and Chinese election interference, writing that “it would be an inauspicious start for any campaign for the highest offices in the land to ignore the Constitution is eligibility requirements.”Eastman was slammed for writing the column, with critics pointing out that his views on birthright citizenship are not shared by most constitutional law scholars. Asnoted, Illinois Senator Tammy Duckworth was also vetted by Biden is team. Although a natural-born citizen, Duckworth was not born in the USs, so Democrats reportedly feared that Trump and his allies would attack her with birth er conspiracy the ories.“But with another Black nominee on the ballot, Trump is returning to his wheelhouse, questioning the citizenship of a candidate born in the USs,” the publication concluded. In their first joint press conference, Biden and Harris accusedTrumpof leaving the nation “in tatters.”The duo also slammed Trump is handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with Biden saying that the commander-in-chief spends more time golfing than addressing the unprecedented public health crisis.

318,Professor defends teaching students to question COVID-19 ‘propaganda’ as NYU investigation continues,11.67,38.33,https://www.thecollegefix.com/professor-defends-teaching-students-to-question-covid-19-propaganda-as-nyu-investigation-continues/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-college-fix-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-15,23,"A New York University professor is suing several colleagues for alleged defamation in relation to his unpopular views on COVID-19 interventions, including the efficacy of masks and particular treatments. The private university opened an investigation againstMark Crispin Miller, a tenured professor in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communications, after 25 faculty called on the department to respond to his “ongoing harm to our students.”Their letter refers to a September incident in Miller is class “Mass Persuasion and Propaganda.” A female student, who has since dropped out of the course, accused him of promoting right-wing conspiracy the ories about COVID-19, and the department chair quickly responded that MCC was considering “next steps.”Miller () responded bybloggingabout the dispute, asking readers to sign a petition in favor of his academic freedom. He mentioned NYU communications to his students and a department email urging him to stop teaching the course, and claimed he was acting in self-defense. The professor told that NYU Steinhardt School Dean Jack Knott told him the investigation would conclude by the end of the semester, but gave him no other details. Miller, who has spent more than 20 years on the NYU faculty, filed a lawsuit in New York State court November 30 after his colleagues did not retract their statements and apologize as he demanded. He shared several NYU communications with to illustrate his legal claims. Miller explained in a phone interview that he was not suing any of the junior professors who signed the letter: “Whether they signed it, willingly or not, I am sure they had no choice.”According to the suit, Miller is colleagues intended to “disgrace and humiliate” the professor “under the guise of phony and uninformed political and cultural correctness and orthodoxy.” He is seeking $750,000 in damages, saying their letter led to loss of professional standing and the worsening of his Lyme disease. The faculty letter “takes every conceivable opportunity to cast me in a bad light,” Miller told. He also said in a separate email that the charges from his colleagues are “so false as to seem downright psychotic.”:Judge tells NYU it ca not punish students for breaking after-the-fact COVID rulesIf Miller is a right-wing conspiracy the orist, he is an unconventional one. The professor isn ame don Turning Point USA is Professor Watchlist, which identifies faculty who allegedly promote “leftist propaganda in the classroom.”He also helped lead a movement in 2012 to halt NYU is redevelopment plans for the Greenwich Village campus. The resulting lawsuit successfully challenged nearly half of the university is expansion plan, though Miller told the experience also convinced him not to sue NYU itself this time. Politically, Miller considers himself a leftist: “I am anti-war, I believe in empowering the working class, cutting back corporate power – I could go on and on.” He said progressive luminaries such as Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Oliver Stone signed his petition, and Ralph Nader provided a separate statement of support. The Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng, who publicly accused NYUof forcing him out of a fellowship because of pressure from Beijing, also signed Miller is petition, the professor said.:NYU declines to testify in Congress about its China campusBut Miller also believes the left has “changed radically over the years. I do not really recognize it anymore.” The left today wants “censorship and government authority to be accepted without question—except if it is Trump,” he said. Some of the professor is colleagues have long despised him for his course content and extramural statements on subjects including the Sandy Hook massacre and transgender ideology. But a civil liberties group told NYU that Miller is alleged conduct is expressly protected by its own policies, and cited court rulings against private universities including New York City is Fordham. One group is not weighing in on the dispute: the American Association of University Professors. A representative told in an email that AAUP is department of academic freedom and tenure confirmed “we have not been involved with this case,” and declined to comment further. Student Julia Jackson tagged NYU in at weet threadSept. 20 to complain that Miller had “spent an entire class period telling students that wearing masks does not prevent the spread of COVID-19.” She also claimed that he said “hydroxychloroquine trials were made to fail so more people would be given the vaccine and have their DNA changed.”She linked to articles and videos shared by Miller, including atwo–partinterview of Canadian physicist Denis Rancourt on One America News Network (), describing them as conspiratorial and “far-right.”Jacksoncalled onNYU to “relieve him” of educating and advising students. MCC Chair Rodney Benson thanked her for reporting the issue and said the department had “made this a priority.”MillerrespondedOctober 6 on his News From Underground blog, explaining that his pedagogical style is to teach students how to identify propaganda drives and seek out alternative claims. He urged his students to read studies that conclude masks and ventilators are ineffective at preventing transmission of the novel coronavirus and saving lives, “with due attention to the scientific reviews the reof.” Miller cited “possible financial links between” researchers and interests such as “Big Pharma and the Gates Foundation.”The blog post embedded Jackson is tweet thread and mentioned a Sept. 21 email to Miller is students from Knott and Carlo Ciotoli, who leads NYU is COVID-19 Prevention and Response Team.:Miller is student tries to get him firedMiller provided with this email (below), which he said a student forwarded to him. Prefaced by the claim that NYU has the “utmost respect for the principles of academic freedom,” it referred students to “the most authoritative public health guidance” – CDCrecommendations.“The evidence backs it up,” the email continued, linking sources. “And we remind you that wearing a mask is required at NYU.” The NYU leaders said “we do not feel we have a choice” in pushing back on Miller is alleged comments. Miller said he did not tell students to break the university is mask mandate, which he actively observes – a point emphasized in his lawsuit. The blog post alleged that NYU had urged Miller to cancel his propaganda course because it would be “better for the department” if he instead chose to teach two sections on cinema. (Miller told Sunday that the quoted phrase was from an email sent by the department is administrative assistant, while a later phone call with Benson, the MCC chair, claimed the change would be better for enrollment.)It linked to ape titi onto back Miller is cause, which as of Monday night has been signed by more than 20,000 people. Miller told last week that the blind Chinese lawyer Guangcheng, who memorably escaped house arrest in China, was among them. Guangchengclaimedto have been forced out by NYU following “great, unrelenting pressure” from Chinese communists, at a time when the university was building a campus in Shanghai. NYU stated that Guangcheng is stay was based on a one-year fellowship and that his claims were “both false and contradicted by the well-established facts,” including that the foreign campus was approved to be built before the dissident is arrival at NYU The October 21 faculty letter to Steinhardt Dean Knott and Provost Katherine Fleming criticized the views that “Miller has espoused on his highly visible website” over the years. While it does not say what is “highly visible” about Miller is blog, the letter complains that “he prominently displays his title as a full tenured professor in our department.”Miller has characterized “transgender surgery as a eugenic form of sterilization,” mocked transgender people and denied “the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting,” they alleged. While Miller has a right to his views, his colleagues object to “discrimination, attacks against students and others in our community, or advocacy for an unsafe learning environment.” Students have complained about his discussion of controversial viewpoints and “non-evidence based arguments” for years, yet frequent complaints to bias review offices and administrators have not “improved” the situation. (The letter does not mention any specific complaints.)Miller is post that linked Jackson is public tweets opened an opportunity for “cyberbullying and threatening communication directed toward the student,” which “subsequently occurred and continues,” the letter claimed. I hope@nyuniversity,@nyusteinhardt, and@mccNYUagree that this professor should not be trusted with educating and advising students, and I hope they take immediate steps to relieve him of these duties. 8/— Julia Jackson (@julia_jacks)September 21, 2020:Cornell vaccine mandate only applies to white studentsIt called for an “expedited review” of Miller is “intimidation tactics, abuses of authority, aggressions and microaggressions, and explicit hate speech,” to be followed by “whatever further disciplinary measures are deemed appropriate.”In an email provided by Miller, Dean Knott told the professor October 29 that an investigation had been opened that day. “I will ask Vice Dean for Faculty Affairs LaRue Allen to begin this review immediately” and decide, based on the collected information, whether to proceed “with next steps as outlined in the Faculty Handbook,” Knott wrote. Miller conveyed his shock at receiving the email in a Thursday phone call with. “I was completely surprised that he had not talked to me first,” he said. In a Zoom meeting requested by Miller, Knott said that NYU “lawyers and provost told him that they had to” investigate. Knott would not give him the scope of the investigation except that “they would talk to people,” according to Miller. “And I said what people? And he said, faculty and students. And I said, what faculty? None of them have seen me teach. And he said: well yeah, so the students.”Miller the n told the dean that he would solicit and send testimonials from current and former students, “maybe 40 letters” so far that “make abundantly clear that there is not a shred of truth” in the colleagues’ letter. He excerpted several in his blog post. A few days after this meeting, Miller confronted his colleagues’ charges in are buttal he shared with. He called “nearly all” their claims “demonstrably untrue,” and the letter “misleading in its various insinuations.” Miller did not launch an email campaign against the department, as they claimed, but rather highlighted “NYU is violation of my academic freedom.”Miller reiterated his public assertion that he simply encouraged students to read “scientific studies—eight randomized, controlled trials, conducted among health professionals over the last 15 years or so—finding that masks are ineffective against transmission of respiratory viruses.”On Sunday he pointed to his Sept. 5essay“Masking Ourselves to Death” for sources:researchfrom Rancourt, the Canadian physicist, as well asJoshua Jacobs,BJ Cowling,Faisal bin-Reza,Jeffrey Smith,Vittoria Offeddu,Lewis RadonovichandYoulin Long. The essay mentions the two-part interview with Rancourt and a debate he had with “another COVID-19 dissident,” physician Joseph Mercola, whose videos “have been banned on YouTube and Spotify since mid-June.” Miller also provided al ink to Mercola is web site pertaining to the censorship. Miller emphasized that he “very clearly” told students that he was “telling you not to wear masks,” but simply engaging in an intellectual exercise. Responding to the email from Knott and Ciotoli, he noted the CDC guidelines “that you regard as gospel truth abruptly changed in early April.” Previously they had “echoed the consensus of the [randomized controlled trials] that I encouraged my students to examine.”It is “wholly false” that he “attacked” Jackson, when in fact “the student attacked, on Twitter, demanding that NYU fire me.” She did not speak up during that class and did not “bother reading any of those studies,” he claimed. “How, and where, and when,I‘attacked’ her your letter fails to specify—as it could not, because I never did.”NYU professor who questions COVID orthodoxy demands colleagues retract false claims about himbyThe College Fixon Scribd:Stanford lock down skeptic disinvited from academic conferenceBy publicly writing under her own name, Jackson tweets “provoked attacks by others, which had nothing to do with me,” Miller continued, adding that he had received similar attacks spurred by Jackson is tweets. (While he mentioned “three media hit-pieces” against him, Miller did not identify the articles.)He only identified Jackson by name once, in the petition defending himself, to show that she demanded his firing. “To cast me as the aggressor in this case is as perverse as your accusing me of having attacked” the department, he said. His web site does not have “a single mention of Sandy Hook” and he only mentioned the school massacre in a class discussion on gun control. Miller recommended “some troublingly compelling scholarship on Sandy Hook” to students, because “we cannot simply rule out any argument that deviates from the official story.” (He exempted speculation about child-sex-slave colonies on Mars, which said was shared by a guest on theAlex Jones Show.)Regarding the alleged transgender mockery, Miller said the university “quickly exculpated” him from secondhand claims by a colleague, defendant Nicole Starosielski, based on “three brief online writings.”His writing on the subject is “highly critical of transgender” because of its “troubling real-world consequences” in sports and prisons and the “radical medical intervention in the sexual development of children.” The ideology has also been aggressively promoted throughout the corporate media with the backing of “multibillionaires with large investments in Big Pharma,” which might have “eugenic purposes.”Miller cited his own “pleasant” email exchange with a transgender colleague at NYU Though this person signed the letter against him, he understands “why she may have felt obliged” to sign it. The professor said he could make his own allegations about a “hostile work environment” going back “some time, but especially this semester,” citing comments from students about faculty disparaging him. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education told NYU President Andrew Hamilton in a November 13letterthat the university is own stated commitment to academic freedom meant it must end the investigation into Miller. The civil liberties group noted a New York court ruled in 2019 thatFordham violated its contractual commitments by refusing to recognize a chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. In a 2018 case closely paralleling the factual allegations in Miller is dispute, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled thatMarquette University could not punish a professor is extramural expressions because of its contractual promises on academic freedom. NYU did not respond to que ries on how its Miller investigation was any different from the rulings cited by FIRE When the university ignored FIRE is November 20 deadline to respond, the group publicly condemnedNYU is investigation. A spokesperson for the civil liberties group told last week that NYU has still not responded. Miller has long been a bee in NYU is bonnet. He is one of several named plaintiffs in an ongoing class action suit against its “mismanagement of our retirement funds,” he told. Having seen the university is lawyers in action, Miller said they are “extraordinarily aggressive when it comes to legal action.”He is more surprised by criticism from colleagues – “people whom I did everything I could to serve in trying to halt the real estate plan” and protecting pension funds. Some of them “wrote letters of recommendation” when Miller was “nominated for a distinguished teaching award in 2012.”He emphasized that “I am not saying this to brag. I am saying this to demonstrate how egregious this attack is.” Only one faculty member – untenured, from the School of Professional Studies – went to bat for him. Miller is the one person “above all” that the instructor recommends to her students, she wrote to President Hamilton and Provost Fleming December 6. (Miller removed the colleague is name from the email he showed.):Trump advisor blasts Stanford colleagues for shutting down COVID-19 debateHis propaganda course is the “best” to make students “critical thinkers, a person who can question mass delusions whether they be scientific or political.” She compared Miller to Galileo and Copernicus, who were “condemned for exploring unpopular truths.”The colleague asked rhetorically, whether “Christopher Columbus was a hero or whether masks do prevent the spread of a virus, do not we want to encourage one and all to look at all the material out there?”Miller told he does not attribute the hostility to his political views, but rather to the “discomfiture” his work causes colleagues. He closely studies “official narratives to determine whether they are true or false and to try to figure out what purpose they serve and what interests are behind them.”The political right does not have a monopoly on critiquing the “echo chambers” of academia, he said: “I think it is also possible to make the same critique from a left-perspective.”Miller sees something similar occurring with the COVID-19 pandemic. “Just for urging the study on the scientific literature on masking as a barrier against respiratory viruses is like a high crime now; that is killing grandma.”:Prof says anti-maskers support white supremacy, policy brutalityIMAGE: Renegade Inc./YouTubeLikeon Facebook/Follow us on Twitter",1,1,The College Fix
319,Legal scholars 'perplexed' by Pelosi is push against Trump is nuclear codes,-3.0,44.0,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jan/8/legal-scholars-perplexed-by-pelosis-push-against-t/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-08,23,"Legal experts are scratching their heads about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is push to prevent President Trump from having the nuclear codes, saying it would curtail the chain of command. In a letter to her Democratic colleagues on Thursday, the California Democrat said she spoke to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley about keeping an “unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclear strike.”“The situation of this unhinged President could not be more dangerous, and we must do everything that we can to protect the American people from his unbalanced assault on our country and our democracy,” Ms. Pelosi wrote. But lawyers noted that unless Mr. Trump was incapacitated under the 25th Amendment or removed from office through impeachment, it would be legally problematic for the commander-in-chief not to be in control of the nuclear codes. Military officers could not bar Mr. Trump from exercising his Article II authority, according to Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University.“I know of no authority by which the nuclear codes can be withheld from the President absent a declaration under Section 4 of the 25th Amendment. Absent such a declaration, a denial of such access would be grounds for the removal of any military officer. The same is true for the exercise of other executive privileges and powers,” Mr. Turley said. Similarly, Ilya Shapiro, the publisher of the Cato Institute is Supreme Court Review, found Ms. Pelosi is statement to present legal trouble unless she does pursue impeachment, which she has hinted could come next week.“It is definitely a problem. Until and unless the president is removed, either through the 25th Amendment or impeachment, he remains the commander-in-chief. Given Pelosi is statement, either she is proceeding with impeachment or she is setting a dangerous precedent for disrupting the civilian chain of command,” Mr. Shapiro said. Democrats have been pushing for Mr. Trump to be impeached a second time, arguing that he incited his supporters to break into the Capitol in a violent riot that ended with multiple people dead. They argue the president should never be able to serve in office again, and an impeachment would be a path to ensuring that bar is set. If a president is impeached in the House and convicted by the Senate, the upper chamber the n holds a second vote to bar the individual from serving in higher office again. It would require 67 senators to accomplish their goal. Ms. Pelosi also said in her letter that she asked Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump, who she said is unstable to continue to serve. She warned if Mr. Pence does not take action, they could move forward in Congress to hold Mr. Trump responsible for the actions of his supporters following a speech he delivered from the White House on Wednesday — just prior to the violence breaking out on Capitol Hill.“If the President does not leave office imminently and willingly, the Congress will proceed with our action,” Ms. Pelosi wrote. Mr. Trump has been telling his voters the 2020 election was stolen due to alleged fraud. Election officials from several swing states have dismissed the claims. Ms. Pelosi is chamber impeached Mr. Trump over a call with the Ukrainian president in late 2018, and the Senate held a trial early last year. The Republican controlled chamber did not vote to remove him at that time. Copyright © 2024 The Washington Times, LLC Click here for reprint permission.

Master Sgt. Brian K Tolliver, 46, died in Largo, Florida, after testing positive for COVID-19 on July 10, according to an Army Reserve Medical Command press release.“We feel a tremendous loss in our military family with the passing of Master Sgt. Tolliver,” said the command is ranking officer, Maj. Gen. Jonathan Woodson, in an emailed statement. “COVID-19 has taken a dedicated soldier from our formation, and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family.”Tolliver, who is from Memphis, Tennessee, was admitted to the Largo Medical Center the day after he tested positive and he remained there until the time of his death, the command is release stated. As of Thursday morning, there have been a total of 34,584 COVID-19 cases among service members, with 11,915 of those in the Army,according to Pentagon data. More than 19,000 service members have recovered from the illness so far. The Defense Department does not break out those numbers to specify whether those troops are active duty or reservists. Tolliver served in the Army for 25 years, more than a decade of which was spent in the reserve component. In his last assignment, Tolliver served as the command paralegal for Army Reserve Medical Command in Pinellas Park, Florida. He is survived by his three children, who reside in Louisville, Kentucky.“Master Sgt. Tolliver was a tremendous mentor, leader, soldier, and one of the finest human beings I have ever met,” said Lt. Col. T Scott Randall, the deceased soldier is immediate supervisor. “He will be sorely missed by all.”Four of the military is five deaths have been soldiers from the Army is reserve components. ANew Jersey National Guard captain died of the illness in March at the age of 57. Then in April, a 41-year-oldNavy chief aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Rooseveltdied. A34-year-old Illinois-based Army Reserve soldier died in May, and a61-year-old Army reservist died earlier this August. The Army Reserve suspended in-person drill in March and shifted to virtual formations and instruction whenever possible, according to a policy memo. The Pentagon is figures show that there have been a total of 75 deaths among DoD personnel, with 47 among civilian employees, seven among dependents, 16 among contractors and the five among uniformed service members. The infection rate in the military has been roughly on par with that of the general US population, but the rates of hospitalization and death are much lower, likely due to the younger demographics within the service branches. Fewer than 2 percent of military cases have required hospitalization, and the death rate is 0.0001 percent, compared to 3 percent nationwide, Military Timesreportedin early August.

The Democratic presidential nominee, offering solace to a suffering nation, said ""decency, science, democracy, they are all on the ballot.""Trump, hosting a packed GOP convention crowd on the White House South Lawn, told of another apocalyptic future — one without law and order, where Democrats would give ""violent anarchists and agitators and criminals"" free rein over the country. The back-to-back party conventions painted a dark picture of a divided nation and set the stage for a presidential race that portends an epic clash between Republicans promising to restore order and Democrats vowing to restore a semblance of normalcy. In words and images, the unprecedented virtual gatherings also provided sharply contrasting perspectives on a summer of urban unrest as the nation comes to terms with episodes of disturbing police violence against Black men in Minnesota and Wisconsin, both in the heart of the Midwestern battleground. For both sides, the stakes could not be clearer.""They always say that every four years, every election is the most important election since the last one, but I think both sides believe it more deeply than usual,"" said David Sturrock, a former Minnesota Republican Party officer and a political-science professor at Southwest Minnesota State University. Ushering forth two well-known nominees in Trump and Biden, the parties kicked off their fall campaigns in somber, existential framing for the November 3 election. For Democrats, that meant appeals to social justice and tapping into polling that shows broad dissatisfaction with the administration is handling of the pandemic. The Republicans' focus on law and order relegated the pandemic to the background, hardly noticeable in the sea of mask less faces coming together for Trump is in-person acceptance speech on the White House grounds. The event infuriated Democrats and some conservatives who called it an improper — and possibly illegal — political use of government property.""Get off our lawn,"" tweeted Minnesota US Senator Amy Klobuchar, a former contender for the Democratic nomination. Trump reveled in the stately backdrop of the White House, the sort of break from political tradition that delights his followers: ""We are here,"" he said, ""and they are not.""Trump is unapologetic appropriation of the White House, and the National Mall fireworks display that went with it, gave Republicans the sort of patriotic spectacle that animates their America First base. For Democrats, it played into one of their central arguments for his ouster.""The message was, in part, are you tired of this [expletive] show? Are you tired of all of this?"" said Norman Ornstein, Minnesotan and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, DC ""We can go back to some semblance of normality with Biden.""Republicans centered their message on the riots, looting and destruction across the country, counting on the disorder in Minneapolis and other cities to bring suburban voters into the Republican fold, whatever their reservations about Trump. Speakers disavowed ""cancel culture"" and ""Woketopians,"" framing socialism and anarchy as the greatest threat to the American way of life. Mark and Patty McCloskey, who were charged for allegedly waving their guns as Black Lives Matter protesters marched past their home in St. Louis, warned that the same thing could happen to others ""watching from quiet neighborhoods"" across the country.""It is almost like this election is shaping up to be church, work and school, versus rioting, looting and vandalism,"" said Donald Trump Jr., the president is son, on the opening night of the Republican National Convention. While Democrats promised to address racial inequities, voters of color featured in the Republican convention vouched for the Trump administration and policies they say led to record employment — at least before the virus hit.""The Republicans know they are not going to pull over a significant portion of Black voters, so part of that messaging is to moderate whites saying, 'Look, our party, we are not racist,' "" said Michael Minta, a political-science professor at the University of Minnesota who focuses on race and ethnicity. ""They are saying, 'How could this guy be racist if he has these people who are vouching for him and his credibility and integrity?' ""Even as the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd infused a new racial subtext into election-year politics, Minnesotans were not featured prominently in either convention. Klobuchar scored a speaking slot on the opening night of the Democratic convention. She talked about unity and the right to vote. Republicans tapped Eveleth Mayor Bob Vlaisavljevich, a former Democrat who praised Trump is support for the mining industry, the lifeblood of the Iron Range, where Republicans see a bounty of rural white voters. For the broader public, conventions are a signal to start tuning in to the campaigns. For each party is base, it is a way to rev up its most active members, who typically mingle with their peers in the convention halls and return home and start on the groundwork of campaigning.""There is a certain organizational element to the conventions that helps,"" said Vin Weber, a lobbyist and former Republican congressman from Minnesota. ""That is missing, you ca not do that virtually.""Millions of Americans, held captive in their homes by the pandemic restrictions, still tuned in to the two surprisingly glitch-free virtual conventions. Some pundits note that the ongoing pandemic, the waves of civil unrest and the deepening polarization of politics have done much of the work of motivating voters this year.""Emotions are high given everything that is going on, and it is also about how polarized we have become,"" said Ben Toff, an assistant professor at the University of Minnesota is journalism school, who also works at the Center for the Study of Political Psychology. ""It is not just an intellectual debate about policy, and frankly, there has not been a lot of policy discussion in these conventions. It is been about identity.

In order to have a chance at reelection, Alabama is Democratic incumbent did not just need to win in the state is most populous counties. He needed to run up the score. Instead, GOP challenger Tommy Tuberville did well in the cities and suburbs, winning eight of the 10 largest counties in the state on his way to a 20 point win. He flipped four of those large counties back to GOP Jones won six of the 10 largest counties in 2017, including two of the top three. In 2017, Jones carried Madison County, home of Huntsville in north Alabama, and Mobile County on the coast. In that special election, Jones won around 57 percent of the vote in each of those counties. On Tuesday he lost both. Out of the 10 largest counties in Alabama, only Jefferson and Montgomery stuck with Jones.[Ca not see the map?Click here.]And while Jones did win in Jefferson County - the most populous in the state and and his home county - he significantly under performed there compared to 2017. This year he edged Tuberville in Jefferson with 54 percent of the vote. In 2017, Jones earned a whopping 68 percent of the vote in Jefferson, in a year where turnout was very low. Jones also won Montgomery on Tuesday, part of the traditionally Democratic Black Belt and the fourth largest county in Alabama. He performed well throughout the Black Belt, which other than Montgomery is sparsely populated. Jones pulled 67 percent of the vote in Montgomery, but that was still a smaller victory than he earned in 2017, when he won Montgomery with 72 percent. Tuberville also flipped Lee County, home to Auburn, and Tuscaloosa County, both of which Jones carried in 2017. In fact, Tuesday is result shows just how much of an anomaly the 2017 special election was. Even if Jones had replicated his percentages in the state is largest counties, Tuberville still would have won handily. Do you have an idea for a data story about Alabama?

Some leftists are repeating their old trope that they are merely anti-Zionist, not full-blown Jew-haters no different from the Klan or other low-class dirtbags. For appearances' sake, most are paying some kind of lip service to condemning this apparently organized Hamas thuggery appearing suddenly on our shores, even as they continue to claim with forked tongues that Israel is the problem. Joe Biden, though, is the exception. He has not said a damn thing. He still remains AWOL as Jews are hunted down and assaulted in hate crimes, raising questions, at least in my mind, as to whether Hamas has something on him. He is said nothing. His Twitter feed is a wasteland and his White House site is silent. 'Silent Joe' is his way with this one, and it is not a compliment. Biden can reliably be counted upon to condemn other hate crimes and perceived transgressions -- he condemned anti-Asian hate crimes, for one, and of course, calls any incident involving a black suspect and a white cop  isystemic racism,' which makes his silence in the case of this shocking wave of attacks all the more remarkable. It is certainly been noticed in any case. According to Ben Samuels, writing inHa'aretz:The Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Committee, Hadassah: The Women is Zionist Organization of America, Jewish Federations of North America, and the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America wrote Biden on Friday highlighting a spike in reported violent incidents targeting Jews in the US and abroad, as well as on social media. TheADL said Thursdayit was seeing ""a dangerous and drastic surge in anti-Jewish hate"" after the outbreak of renewed hostilities between Hamas and Israel, ""from London to Los Angeles, from France to Florida, in big cities like New York and in small towns, and across every social media platform.""The organizations call onBidento call out antisemitism, telling him to ""harness the authority of the Presidency and the USs Government to speak out loudly and clearly against antisemitism.""According to AJ Kaufman, writing atThe Lid:While many wonder whetherIran-backed Hamaswill oblige [on a cease fire with Israel after it started its rocket attacks], we also wonder why President Joe Biden has not been more outspoken, not only in supporting our chief ally in the Middle East, Israel but in condemning violence against Jews in America. Each year,FBI stats showJews are overwhelmingly the victims of more anti-religious “hate crimes” than any eth no religious group. And these numbers continue in May,ironically Jewish American Heritage Month. Joe may be AWOL on the border, but he is even more AWOL on this. As with the border meltdown, his silence suggests consent. Biden is silence is most likely due to his innate cowardice and his consummate political considerations. According to New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin, as president, he shifts like a weather vane to the political winds. He hides, he appears, he calls a lid, but the bottom line is, he is concerned only about one thing politically: Keeping the far left wing of his party ever loyal to him as his political foot soldiers. That is where the biggest Jew-haters roost. Start with the far-left Squad side of things. Writing in the New York Post, Goodwin believes there was a weird turning point in Joe is behavior around this priority of his:A defining moment came last Tuesday when Michigan Representative Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian woman elected to Congress, confronted Biden at the Detroit airport and argued American aid to Israel was funding atrocities against Palestinians. The tarmac face-off lasted eight minutes, and Biden later lavished praise on Tlaib is “passion and concern for so many people.” Presumably, her concern does not include the Jews Hamas vows to eliminate. The irony here is that while even full-blown Jew-haters such as Tlaib and Reps. Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pay lip service to condemning anti-Semitic attacks, as I wrote abouthereyesterday, Joe will not condemn even those. There is more than the Squad, though, in the mind of Joe -- the re is also the Democratic Party is black congressional leaders and activists, who have embraced the likes of Louis Farrakhan and the Rev. Al Sharpton, two notorious anti-Semites, as if they represent all black voters, and are ineffably tied to the mast of the Democrat party. After a spate of anti-Semitic attacks by black extremists in 2019, I noted thishere. Why is that? [Why are these attacks happening?] Because Democrats have been coddling black anti-Semites for years. Where is the Democratic condemnation for race huckster Rev. Al Sharpton, who is also a notorious anti-Semite with a long record of incitement of violence against Jews? Right there in the berth of the Democratic Party, still supposedly representing the black ""middle class.""Where is the Democrats' condemnation for Louis Farrakhan, whose animating breath is all about anti-Semitism? Hobnobbing with Democrats in photos, appearing with Bill Clinton at Aretha Franklin is funeral, and tweeting ""sweetheart"" dreck with fellow anti-Semite, Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar. Where, for that matter, is the Democratic condemnation of Representative Ilhan Omar is anti-Semitism? They could not pass a simple resolution against her in the House after her string of whoppers. They were too afraid to lay a hand on her, despite her long record of anti-Semitic statements. It is coddling all right, and you can bet the more aggressive street predator class of black cultists, such as ""Black Hebrew Israelites"" a known anti-Semitic black group, and Jew-haters in the boroughs noticed the pattern, took note, and launched their reign of terror. Still no recognition of the problem from Democrats, though. They prefer to call it the bad deeds of individuals and the n let them off lightly. That is a recipe of worse to come. In Joe is mind, though, it is best to keep these moral zeros happy so they will deliver the black vote for Joe. This, despite, or maybe because of, President Trump is heavy inroads on winning over the black vote to Republicans in 2020. Elections are going to be tough for Democrats going forward, so Joe is going all in on following the Sharpton way and keeping Calypso Louie content, both creeps laughing up their sleeves at him, in the interest of using their political muscle to perpetuate his own political power. This is more than just speculation. Sharpton, for one, visited the Obama White House with Joe Biden the sitting vice president72 times, according to leftist PolitiFact, and according to Wisconsin GOP Congressman Glenn Grothman, and former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, it was probably a higher figure. Whatever the number of times, it was a big number with a bottom at 72, obviously underlining to Old Joe that political power for Democrats depends on the love of Jew-hating Al Sharpton. Obama taught Biden everything he knows and probably continues to serve as a shadow president. This is a vile dynamic, no two ways about it. Biden is keeping silent for a reason and the multiplying nests of anti-Semitism within his own party amount to a vehicle for him. He the refore stays silent as raw anti-Semitism rears its ugly head and pogrom-like violence spirals across the US, expecting reliably Democrat-voting Jews to let it go, and expecting the whole thing to go away. It will not.

TheADL said Thursdayit was seeing ""a dangerous and drastic surge in anti-Jewish hate"" after the outbreak of renewed hostilities between Hamas and Israel, ""from London to Los Angeles, from France to Florida, in big cities like New York and in small towns, and across every social media platform.""According to AJ Kaufman, writing atThe Lid:While many wonder whetherIran-backed Hamaswill oblige [on a cease fire with Israel after it started its rocket attacks], we also wonder why President Joe Biden has not been more outspoken, not only in supporting our chief ally in the Middle East, Israel but in condemning violence against Jews in America. Each year,FBI stats showJews are overwhelmingly the victims of more anti-religious “hate crimes” than any eth no religious group. And these numbers continue in May,ironically Jewish American Heritage Month. Joe may be AWOL on the border, but he is even more AWOL on this. As with the border meltdown, his silence suggests consent. Biden is silence is most likely due to his innate cowardice and his consummate political considerations. According to New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin, as president, he shifts like a weather vane to the political winds. He hides, he appears, he calls a lid, but the bottom line is, he is concerned only about one thing politically: Keeping the far left wing of his party ever loyal to him as his political foot soldiers. That is where the biggest Jew-haters roost. Start with the far-left Squad side of things. Writing in the New York Post, Goodwin believes there was a weird turning point in Joe is behavior around this priority of his:A defining moment came last Tuesday when Michigan Representative Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian woman elected to Congress, confronted Biden at the Detroit airport and argued American aid to Israel was funding atrocities against Palestinians. The tarmac face-off lasted eight minutes, and Biden later lavished praise on Tlaib is “passion and concern for so many people.” Presumably, her concern does not include the Jews Hamas vows to eliminate. The irony here is that while even full-blown Jew-haters such as Tlaib and Reps. Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pay lip service to condemning anti-Semitic attacks, as I wrote abouthereyesterday, Joe will not condemn even those. There is more than the Squad, though, in the mind of Joe -- the re is also the Democratic Party is black congressional leaders and activists, who have embraced the likes of Louis Farrakhan and the Rev. Al Sharpton, two notorious anti-Semites, as if they represent all black voters, and are ineffably tied to the mast of the Democrat party. After a spate of anti-Semitic attacks by black extremists in 2019, I noted thishere. Why is that? [Why are these attacks happening?] Because Democrats have been coddling black anti-Semites for years. Where is the Democratic condemnation for race huckster Rev. Al Sharpton, who is also a notorious anti-Semite with a long record of incitement of violence against Jews? Right there in the berth of the Democratic Party, still supposedly representing the black ""middle class.""Where is the Democrats' condemnation for Louis Farrakhan, whose animating breath is all about anti-Semitism? Hobnobbing with Democrats in photos, appearing with Bill Clinton at Aretha Franklin is funeral, and tweeting ""sweetheart"" dreck with fellow anti-Semite, Democratic Representative Ilhan Omar. Where, for that matter, is the Democratic condemnation of Representative Ilhan Omar is anti-Semitism? They could not pass a simple resolution against her in the House after her string of whoppers. They were too afraid to lay a hand on her, despite her long record of anti-Semitic statements. It is coddling all right, and you can bet the more aggressive street predator class of black cultists, such as ""Black Hebrew Israelites"" a known anti-Semitic black group, and Jew-haters in the boroughs noticed the pattern, took note, and launched their reign of terror. Still no recognition of the problem from Democrats, though. They prefer to call it the bad deeds of individuals and the n let them off lightly. That is a recipe of worse to come. In Joe is mind, though, it is best to keep these moral zeros happy so they will deliver the black vote for Joe. This, despite, or maybe because of, President Trump is heavy inroads on winning over the black vote to Republicans in 2020. Elections are going to be tough for Democrats going forward, so Joe is going all in on following the Sharpton way and keeping Calypso Louie content, both creeps laughing up their sleeves at him, in the interest of using their political muscle to perpetuate his own political power. This is more than just speculation. Sharpton, for one, visited the Obama White House with Joe Biden the sitting vice president72 times, according to leftist PolitiFact, and according to Wisconsin GOP Congressman Glenn Grothman, and former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, it was probably a higher figure. Whatever the number of times, it was a big number with a bottom at 72, obviously underlining to Old Joe that political power for Democrats depends on the love of Jew-hating Al Sharpton. Obama taught Biden everything he knows and probably continues to serve as a shadow president. This is a vile dynamic, no two ways about it. Biden is keeping silent for a reason and the multiplying nests of anti-Semitism within his own party amount to a vehicle for him. He the refore stays silent as raw anti-Semitism rears its ugly head and pogrom-like violence spirals across the US, expecting reliably Democrat-voting Jews to let it go, and expecting the whole thing to go away. It will not. ",0,0,American Thinker
324,Tucker Carlson Raises a Very Serious Alarm Bell About Ashli Babbitt is Murder and the Enemy Within,21.67,22.0,https://redstate.com/brandon_morse/2021/06/16/tucker-carlson-raises-a-very-serious-alarm-bell-about-ashli-babbitts-murder-and-the-enemy-within-n397591,https://adfontesmedia.com/redstate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-16,21,"President Joe Biden was sworn in on January 20, but it is January 6 that stands out in the minds of many that truly marks the beginning of the Biden era. Yes, Trump was still technically president but we are still waiting on answers that we have yet to get about what happened that day. The Biden administration seems to have no interest in releasing information about it, but the more private entities look into the matter, the more oddities arise. One, in particular, is the murder of Ashli Babbitt. Babbitt was part of the riot within the Capitol and was shot while unarmed. At the time of this writing, we still have no idea who it is that shot her or why he decided to fire on her in particular. It is just one of the many questions the Biden administration is actively not giving us answers to. Aspreviously covered by Nick Arama, Fox News host Tucker Carlson had a very solid point to make about this fact and one that he is actively being mocked for bringing up, which should worry you even more. Carlson began by discussing how the Biden administration has declared that the largest threat to America is not China, Russia, Iran, our porous southern border, or even leftist extremists attempting to de fund the police and burn our neighborhoods down. No, they say that it is white supremacist as said by Attorney General Merrick Garland. It is a very nebulous term. Who are these white supremacist radicals? Why will not the Biden administration name names? For some reason, the administration is withholding that information, but it is likely that they do not know either. What they do know is that it is a good narrative crop to harvest thanks to the January 6 riot at the capitol, a riot the left continues to try to call an “insurrection.”With this event in place, they can now create white supremacist boogie men that can take the form of any person they need it to, including you. It also allows them to come up with solutions that sound just as nebulous to the public but gives them the freedom to do whatever they want. “We must adopt a broader societal response to tackle the problem is deeper roots,” said Garland somewhat ominously. As Carlson points out, this is a scary thought as it marks a change in the way the government treats its citizens, specifically ones that do not agree with the administration. A government can arrest and imprison or even kill a citizen, like Babbitt with no accountability or explanation as Carlson points out:Who did shoot Ashli Babbitt? Why do not we know? Are anonymous federal agents now allowed to kill unarmed women who protest the regime? That is OK now? No, it is not ok. It will never be ok. And why are all those January 6th protesters still in prison on trespassing charges, while so many Biden voters who torched federal buildings are walking free? What is the answer to that question? If that happened in Russia, we rightly call it scary. We’d call Putin a dictator. In fact, we do call him a dictator. And speaking ofJanuary 6th, why are there still so many things, basic factual matters, we do not know about that day? Why is the Biden administration preventing us from knowing? Why is the administration hiding more than 10,000 hours of surveillance tape from the US Capitol? What could possibly be the reason for that? Even as they call for more openness. We need to get to the bottom of it. They could release those tapes to day, but they are not. Why?#ThreadMust Watch Tucker Carlson Segment On Revolver News is Piece About January 6th: Unindicted Co-Conspirators In January 6th Cases Raise Disturbing Questions Of Federal Foreknowledgepic.twitter.com/wzxwsPU0dE— The Columbia Bugle 🇺🇸 (@ColumbiaBugle)June 16, 2021Carlson goes on to make a much deeper point about the possible involvement of the FBI in the January 6 riot, which is another article, but for the moment, focusing on this one fact is something we as a country really need to do. Was Babbitt wrong to storm the Capitol? Sure. Did she deserve to die for it?If the footage of her shooting is any indication, the n no. She was unarmed and while she was attempting to advance into the Capitol she could have easily been detained or pushed back by authorities as they had been doing in other places. Instead, she was shot, and regardless of the apparent reason, no matter how obvious, when an American is shot on American soil by American agents an investigation is warranted and answers need to be given to the American people. Why is the government withholding that info? Moreover, what makes them think they can withhold it? What gives them the gumption to believe they do not owe us answers? Are we now living in a country where killing citizens is just something our government can do if they are protesting at the wrong place and at the wrong time? Do they not feel like they need to justify it?Meanwhile, as Carlson points out, why do the people who tout their narrative get to roam free despite the damage they do all over the country, including the Capitol city? Why not point out the fact that there were many racial supremacists in those riots that lean toward the black race? Why can they burn, loot, and assault with slaps on the wrist?There are far more victims of the Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots than there were victims of the Capitol riot. Is the fear and inconvenience politicians experienced far more egregious than the actual loss of livelihood and even life that American citizens experienced at the hands of leftist riots? Why do we need to know the most minute detail about officers who shoot black people but get absolute obscurity when they shoot someone from a different crowd?It is questions we need to ask and definitely questions the Biden administration needs to answer. In fact, they need to have these answers ready before we ask them. Yet, they are not providing answers. What they are providing are narratives and reasons to dissuade from asking questions. “This was a white supremacist riot” they repeat ad nauseum with little to no proof that it was, making questioning their narrative a defense of white supremacists. No nuance. No context. No questions. Our government has gotten too full of itself. It sees itself above us. It kills us and tells us questioning why makes us morally bankrupt. They think their own accountability is not necessary and if you vote them out they will spend ungodly amounts of time and resources attempting to correct your mistake with lies that allow for excuses for the impeachment of not only a man but also your vote. Our government is out of control. We are losing the Republic we were advised to keep and the unanswered for murder of Ashli Babbitt is a strong indicator of how far we have fallen from it.",0,0,RedState
325,Did you hear US plans to require vaccine passports? Not true,-3.17,46.67,https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2021/04/did-you-hear-us-plans-to-require-vaccine-passports-not-true.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-10,25,"The Associated Press checks out some of the most popular but completely untrue stories and visuals of the week. This one is bogus, even though it was shared widely on social media. Here are the facts:CLAIM:The federal government wants to require Americans to present a health passport or vaccine certificate “on demand,” including for domestic travel. THE FACTS:The US government has no plans to require so-called vaccine passports to travel domestically, or for any other purpose. While private businesses are considering vaccine passports for certain activities, Biden administration officials have said the federal government will not mandate vaccine passports. A vaccine passport is documentation that shows a person has been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus or recently tested negative. The information will be in the form of a scannable code that can be stored on a smart phone or printed out. During a press conference on Tuesday, Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the Biden administration is “not now nor will we be supporting a system that requires Americans to carry a credential. There will be no federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain a single vaccination credential.”But posts circulating on social media are falsely implying that vaccine passports will be mandatory in the US, including for domestic travel. “President Biden and the Democrats want to force Americans to present a ‘vaccine passport’ upon demand, yet they oppose presenting an ID to cast a vote,” reads a tweet by South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. A Facebook post claims: “So, now, I will need a Health Passport to travel IN America, but Illegals do not need any kind of Passport to enter INTO America!”Such claims are “patently false,” according to Lawrence O Gostin, a professor, and director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.“There are no plans in the US to introduce a vaccine passport for domestic travel,” Gostin said to the AP in an email. “Neither the government nor the US airline industry have announced any plans for requiring proof of vaccination as a condition of interstate travel.”Gostin explained that foreign carriers were discussing a voluntary COVID vaccine passport system, but it did not include US carriers yet. In the US, only one state has rolled out a vaccine passport. New York introduced an app through a limited government partnership with a private company. People can show proof of vaccination or a negative test with an app to enter places like entertainment venues. Lawmakers in a handful of states, including Pennsylvania, are trying to ban vaccine passports. Last week, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis also issued an executive order banning businesses from requiring customers to show proof they got the shot. The Facebook post is claim that people without legal status in the US are allowed to enter without documentation is also misleading. Those trying to enter the US must show proof they are an American citizen or documents showing they have permission to enter the country, otherwise they are placed in expedited removal proceedings and face deportation. The law does allow those without documents who have a credible fear of returning to their home country to enter and apply for asylum.",2,2,The Oregonian
326,What Are Debris Flows and Why Are They Dangerous?,0.0,47.33,https://weather.com/news/news/2021-10-22-debris-flow-threat-california-rain,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-24,25,"A​ newer version of this article appearshere. California is bracing for dangerous and potentially deadly landslides in the coming days, as much-needed rain moves in amid historic drought conditions. Terrain left barren by wildfires is most vulnerable to an especially dangerous and fast-moving type of landslide that scientists call ""debris flows."" Known less formally as mudslides, these flows are typically triggered by short, intense rainstorms and can send a wall of water, soil, ash, vegetation, rocks and other debris careening downhill, sweeping away or burying everything in its path.""A debris flow is kind of a flood on steroids,"" Jason Kean, a debris flow expert with the US Geological Survey, told weather.com in an interview. ""It is all bulked up with rocks, mud, even boulders – and boulders can be the size of cars.""Latest Forecast for Western Storms)The threat of landslides usually increases in the fall as wetter weather typically starts to move across the West Coast. A parade of storms forecast into next week has parts of both California and Oregon on alert for debris flows. The USGS and other agencies work together to assess the debris flow threat in burn scars each year. So far they have completed assessments for about 60 fires in nine western states. The public can read the mhere. Among the areas of highest concern in California this year are the Dixie, Monument and Alisal fire burn footprints, Jaime Kostelnik, also a geologist on the assessment team, told weather.com in a recent interview. In Oregon, areas with high risk include parts of the Devils Knob, Jack and Bootleg burn areas. But any burn scar can potentially be at risk, and conditions can change over time depending on the weather and other factors. The cumulative effects of extreme wildfires in recent years make the situation even more hazardous, especially in California. Many of the areas impacted by wildfires have burned more than once in recent years. Besides destroying vegetation that would normally hold soil and debris in place, wildfires change certain characteristics of the soil itself. It becomes less likely to absorb water, which creates conditions ripe for flash flooding and debris flows, according to Kean and Kostelnik.""As (the water) runs off, it picks up all these loose soil particles that no longer have vegetation to hold them in place and the n it bulks up into that debris flow that can move really fast and start actually within minutes of intense rainfall,"" said Kean. Debris can rush down a hillside at a rate over 35 mph and the n flatten out and spread even farther when it reaches the bottom of a slope. California Faces Third Year of Extreme Drought)At least 20 people were killed when mud slides with walls of debris as tall as 30 feet struck the Santa Barbara County community of Montecitoin 2018. On average, 25 to 50 people are killed by landslides every year in the USs, according to the USGS This week, emergency crews worked to prepare areas scarred by the Alisal Fire before the wet weather moved in. That included installing barriers to keep mud and debris from washing over roadways, the Santa Barbara News-Press reported. Storm prep was also underway along the Caldor Fire burn scar in Sacramento, where work included placing fallen trees across bulldozer lines to hold soil in place.“The heavy predicted rains this week has us concerned, but we are going to ke ep working as long as we can,” Paul Naman, a service repair supervisor at the site, told KOVR-TV The elevated risk of debris flows in a burn scar can last up to five years after a fire. Officials in Santa Cruz County, for example, are warning people who live in the area of the 2018 CZU Complex Fire to be on alert for debris flow danger. The threat for California as a whole will increase as the rainy season moves in, usually at its peak from November through February.""California has a distinct wet season that lasts from late fall into early spring, and a dry season with little to no rainfall from late spring to early fall,"" said weather.com meteorologistChris Dolce. ""That extreme variance is related to an area of high pressure that sets up off the West Coast in summer and prevents any significant moisture from reaching the state. Conversely, in winter, that high weakens and shifts farther south, which opens the door for Pacific storms to affect California with heavy rain and mountain snow.""The state is in the clutches of a historic two-year drought. While the rain in the coming days will bring some relief, it remains to be seen how wet this year is winter will be. And experts say it could take years to catch up from the precipitation deficit. Wildfire danger, meanwhile, peaks in the fall because that is when vegetation is completely dried out prior to the arrival of the first significant Pacific storms of the season, Dolce said. Research has linked California is progressively more extreme fire seasons to climate change, and a study published last year by the University of California Institute of Transportation Studies found that the risk of post-wildfire debris flows is also likely to go up. Experts say people in areas under threat should be alert if any rain develops, and do not wait for an evacuation order to leave if heavy rains develop.""They should take it seriously,"" Kostelnik said.",2,2,The Weather Channel
327,"US Capitol building breach 'almost textbook' sedition, legal expert says",-1.67,47.67,https://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2021/01/06/us-capitol-breach-sedition-legal-expert-says/6571725002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-06,25,"The supporters of President Donald Trump who breached the US Capitol building on Wednesday may face charges of sedition, several legal experts told the Detroit Free Press. The US center of power became a scene of outright chaos Wednesday as supporters made their way past barricades, broke in through windows and sent representatives into hiding during a session of debate over election certification. The assault on the Capitol came shortly after a rally for the president, who continued to levy baseless claims that the election was rigged and told the crowd they would ""never concede,""USA Today reported. The actions of the crowd were “inexcusable” and crimes, US Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan Matthew Schneider told the Detroit Free Press.“There is a difference, a big difference, between peaceful protests and expressing your freedoms,” said Schneider, who was appointed to his post by Trump.“This is not it. The violent protesters are committing crimes, and they have to stop right now and this is not what our Constitution protects.”Depending on what investigators find and individual circumstances, charges could range from everything from low-level curfew charges, to trespassing, to the misdemeanor of destruction of government property less than $1,000, depending on the cost of the windows and anything else, he said. There could be a felony charge of destruction of government property over $1,000, depending on what was damaged, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison, he said. Electoral counting resumes after police retake Capitol from pro-Trump rioters; woman shot and killed; Twitter locks out TrumpMichigan lawmakers hunkered down as rioters breached US CapitolOn the high end, charges of civil disorder, interfering with law enforcement, or inciting a riot could all be possible, up to seditious conspiracy — a federal charge punishable by up to 20 years in prison, he said. That latter charge seemed most appealing to two professors of Western Michigan University is Cooley Law School. It reads:“If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the USs, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the USs, or to levy war against the m, or to oppose by force the authority the reof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the USs, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the USs contrary to the authority the reof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.""The phrase “delay the execution of the law” is key, and what was seen from some of the Trump supporters Wednesday, said Devin Schindler, a law professor who once clerked for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.“For at least some of these protesters, particularly the ones that broke into the Capitol, I think the re is an extraordinarily strong case that they used force to delay, to hinder, the execution of our laws governing the election and how electoral votes are counted,” he said. “It seems fairly clear to me, based on what we are seeing, that folks are in fact, almost textbook violating this seditious conspiracy statute by using force to interfere with lawful government activity.""Though people on Twitter were levying the term “treason,” he and Schneider both agreed the charge did not quite fit with what is known, because treason requires the involvement of enemies to the US Retired Brig. Gen. Michael McDaniel, associate dean for the Western Michigan University-Cooley Law School, too, pointed to sedition as a key possible charge in the case, after possible lesser charges. He also said the defense might be difficult; First Amendment protections are not in play once a break-in occurs. The idea of “sedition” has changed, he said, pointing to the version President John Adams used against his political opponents. It is been narrowed by the courts in the present day. He also raised concern for a different federal charge of rebellion or insurrection, which could carry a sentence of 10 years in prison, and Trump iswords at the rally earlier in the day.“Remember it is got to be ‘against the authority of the USs,’” he said, using the language of the law. “So a really interesting question to pose to my law students later on this week is whether or not the president is speech … was inciting them to violence against the authority of the government of the USs.”Depending on that answer, given the president is role, another impeachment would perhaps be more appropriate than a charge, he said. There likely will not be any court action quickly on the events of the day, Michael Traugott, a professor emeritus of communication studies and political science and research professor emeritus at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan, said. There will be jurisdiction issues, even among which agencies will be doing investigations. Michigan leaders renounce US Capitol riot: 'This is happening because of lies'Trump repeated lies about Michigan is election before pro-Trump supporters stormed CapitolSchneider, too, said investigations could take weeks, but said some people could be charged Wednesday evening. But it is not the first time the idea for ""seditious conspiracy"" has been raised in the last year. The US government looked to the seditious conspiracy charge amid the violence of summer protests, Schneider said. Looking back historically, he also recalled another time shots rang out at the Capitol, in 1954. Five House lawmakers were shot and wounded the n by members of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, which argued for the island is independence, who were shooting from the gallery above the chamber,USA Today reported. A different time, a gunman on the first floor of the building also killed two Capitol police officers in 1998, and a former Capitol officer fired shots at a senator in 1947 as he entered the subway tunnel linking the Capitol to Senate offices, USA Today reported. However, Traugott said the nearest precedent to what happened Wednesday can be found back in the Civil War. But even the n, the Capitol itself was not stormed.""The action of the mob in Washington, incited by President Trump, is an unprecedented affront to the peaceful transfer of power on which our democracy is based,” he said. “It is a seditious act unlike anything since the Civil War.“There have been individual acts, like Oklahoma City, but nothing like this. It is pretty directly attributable to one person (Trump).”The actions of the mob created a “tear in our civil and political fabric (that) will be difficult to repair,” he said. People need to know the punishments, so they go home and things do not get even worse, said Schneider.“We should all be able to disagree peacefully,” he said. “That is one of the most disturbing things to me is that we are, on both sides of the aisle, everyone is taking these disagreements to the extreme interest should not be that way,” he said. Considering the historical context, Schindler thought back to the burning of the Capitol during the War of 1812, but still thought the 2020 storming stood out.“This kind of violence within the Capitol is extraordinarily rare,” he said. There is some examples back in the pre-Civil War era or the Civil War era or congressman fights,” he said. “There was some … shootings in the Capitol, but to see this level of violence directed towards the lawful exercise of government is unheard of.”",2,2,Detroit Free Press

329,We Officially Know What Trump Will Be Doing Instead of Attending the White House Correspondents' Dinner and It is an Insult to Reporters,-20.0,27.67,https://secondnexus.com/news/trump-rally-whcd-green-bay-rally/,https://adfontesmedia.com/second-nexus-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"Donald Trump is taking a shot at the press again, this time by scheduling a MAGA rally the same night as the White House Correspondents' Dinner for the third year in a row. The White House Correspondents' Dinner honors members of the White House Correspondents' Association, an organization of journalists who cover the White House and the President of the USs. It is been a tradition since 1921, and—until Trump is presidency—was usually attended by the President and the Vice President. Trump vowed earlier this month to skip the dinner and hold a rally.""We are going to hold a very positive rally,"" Trumpsaid, describing the Correspondents' Dinner as ""boring and negative.""""Everybody wants it. It will be a big one, but the Correspondents’ Dinner is too negative. I like positive things. Okay?""Now, Trump is reelection campaign has announced that the rally will be held in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Holding the rally the same day as the White House Correspondents' Dinner is a two-part snub: not only is Trump openly bucking a decades-old tradition, he is creating a situation in which many members of the press corps being honored at the dinner will have to skip it in order to cover the rally. This is the third year in a row Trump has skipped the dinner, which often features a ""roast"" of the president and his administration. Last year is dinner included comedian Michelle Wolf, whose jokes pointedly mocked Trump and his administration, including attendee Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Wolfalso took shots at the White House press corps the mselves, calling them out for profiting from their obsessive coverage of the President. ""He has helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV,"" Wolfsaid. ""You helped create this monster and now you are profiting from him.""Trump suggested last year that he might attend this year is White House Correspondents' Dinner if it does not include a comedian. This year is dinner is bucking tradition by featuring a historian rather than a comedian, but Trump is still going to skip it. Instead, he will beholding his rally in Green Bay, WI - one of the key states Trump credits with his election results. Trump is rallies are often used to insult the press.

330,Off-Duty Pilot Said to Save 737 on Its Next-to-Last Flight,0.0,50.35,http://time.com/5554684/boeing-737-lion-air-pilot-saved-flight/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-20,25,"As the Lion Air crew fought to control their diving Boeing Co. 737 Max 8, they got help from an unexpected source: an off-duty pilot who happened to be riding in the cockpit. That extra pilot, who was seated in the cockpit jumpseat, correctly diagnosed the problem and told the crew how to disable a malfunctioning flight-control system and save the plane, according to two people familiar with Indonesia is investigation. The next day, under command of a different crew facing what investigators said was an identical malfunction, the jetliner crashed into the Java Sea killing all 189 aboard. The previously undisclosed detail on the earlier Lion Air flight represents a new clue in the mystery of how some 737 Max pilots faced with the malfunction have been able to avert disaster while the others lost control of their planes and crashed. The presence of a third pilot in the cockpit was not contained in Indonesia is National Transportation Safety Committee is November 28 report on the crash and has not previously been reported. The so-called dead-head pilot on the earlier flight from Bali to Jakarta told the crew to cut power to the motor driving the nose down, according to the people familiar, part of a checklist that all pilots are required to memorize.“All the data and information that we have on the flight and the aircraft have been submitted to the Indonesian NTSC We ca not provide additional comment at this stage due the ongoing investigation on the accident,” Lion Air spokesman Danang Prihantoro said by phone. The Indonesia safety committee report said the plane had had multiple failures on previous flights and had not been properly repaired. Representatives for Boeing and the Indonesian safety committee declined to comment on the earlier flight. The safety system, designed to keep planes from climbing too steeply and stalling, has come under scrutiny by investigators of the crash as well as a subsequent one less than five months later in Ethiopia. A malfunctioning sensor is believed to have tricked the Lion Air plane is computers into thinking it needed to automatically bring the nose down to avoid a stall. Boeing is 737 Max was grounded March 13 by US regulators after similarities to the October 29 Lion Air crash emerged in the investigation of the March 10 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. In the wake of the two accidents, questions have emerged about how Boeing is design of the new 737 model were approved. The Transportation Department is inspector general is conducting a review of how the plane was certified to fly and a grand jury under the US Justice Department is also seeking records in a possible criminal probe of the plane is certification. The FAA last week said it planned to mandate changes in the system to make it less likely to activate when there is no emergency. The agency and Boeing said they are also going to require additional training and references to it in flight manuals.“We will fully cooperate in the review in the Department of Transportation is audit,” Boeing spokesman Charles Bickers said in an email. The company has declined to comment on the criminal probe. After the Lion Air crash, two US pilots’ unions said the potential risks of the system, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, had not been sufficiently spelled out in their manuals or training. None of the documentation for the Max aircraft included an explanation, the union leaders said.“We do not like that we were not notified,’’ Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, said in November. “It makes us question, ‘Is that everything, guys?’ I would hope there are no more surprises out there.’’The Allied Pilots Association union at American Airlines Group Inc. also said details about the system were not included in the documentation about the plane. Following the Lion Air crash, the FAA required Boeing to notify airlines about the system and Boeing sent a bulletin to all customers flying the Max reminding them how to disable it in an emergency. Authorities have released few details about Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 other than it flew a “very similar” track as the Lion Air planes and the n dove sharply into the ground. There have been no reports of maintenance issues with the Ethiopian Airlines plane before its crash. If the same issue is also found to have helped bring down Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, one of the most vexing questions crash investigators and aviation safety consultants are asking is why the pilots on that flight did not perform the checklist that disables the system.“After this horrific Lion Air accident, you’d think that everyone flying this airplane would know that is how you turn this off,” said Steve Wallace, the former director of the US Federal Aviation Administration is accident investigation branch. The combination of factors required to bring down a plane in these circumstances suggests other issues may also have occurred in the Ethiopia crash, said Jeffrey Guzzetti, who also directed accident investigations at FAA and is now a consultant.“It is simply implausible that this MCAS deficiency by itself can down a modern jetliner with a trained crew,” Guzzetti said. MCAS is driven by a single sensor near the nose that measures the so-called angle of attack, or whether air is flowing parallel to the length of the fuselage or at an angle. On the Lion Air flights, the angle-of-attack sensor had failed and was sending erroneous readings indicating the plane is nose was pointed dangerously upward.

331,What happens if Trump refuses to concede the election to Joe Biden?,-5.1,44.2,https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2020/11/what-happens-if-trump-refuses-to-concede-the-election-to-joe-biden.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/syracuse-post-standard-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-09,25,"What happens if President Donald Trump refuses to concede the election? Every major news outlet projected Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential race on Saturday, with 290 electoral votes to Trump is 214; Biden also won the popular vote by 4.5 million votes (and counting). Trump has repeatedly claimed voter fraud without providing any evidence and filed lawsuits over mail-in ballots in battleground states like Pennsylvania and Michigan. But his attempted legal challenges, and recounts in states like Wisconsin and Georgia, are not expected to change the overall outcome. Biden claimed victory Saturday and vowed to be a president for all Americans beginning January 20, on Inauguration Day. The president-elect has also already begun making moves to get his administration started, announcing a coronavirus advisory board on Monday -- the same day Ben Carson, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, tested positive for Covid-19. Other leaders, including former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton,George W Bushand Jimmy Carter, have all recognized and congratulated Biden as the soon-to-be 46th president of the USs. Bush, the last Republican to hold the nation is highest office before Trump, said Sunday that “this election was fundamentally fair, its integrity will be upheld, and its outcome is clear.”Yet Trump is team still has not started the transition process to ensure a smooth transfer of power to Biden. The Associated Press reports the General Services Administration, tasked with formally recognizing Biden as president-elect, has not started the process and has given no guidance on when it will begin. What happens if Inauguration Day rolls around and Trump is still refusing to leave the White House? Do squatter is rights apply at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?The 20th Amendment to the US Constitution is clear: “The terms of the President and Vice President shall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of their successors shall the n begin.”Voxnotes that Trump could (and should) follow tradition and attend Biden is inauguration, much like how Biden, Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton did in 2016. But if Trump opts to stay in the White House until Biden is sworn in, Biden has the right to order the Secret Service to physically remove Trump like any other trespasser.“... The USs government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House,” Biden is campaignsaidFriday. But do not expect Trump to be dragged out of the building like WikiLeaks founderJulian Assangewas from the Ecuadorian embassy last year.“There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four years since 1792,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed inSeptember. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also promised to keep the military out of any election disputes.“This is not the first time that someone has suggested that there might be a contested election,” he told NPR. “And if there is, it will be handled appropriately by the courts and by the US Congress. There is no role for the US military in determining the outcome of a US election. Zero. There is no role there.”December 8 is the deadline for resolving election disputes, including recounts and court contests, at the state level. The Electoral College formally votes December 14, and the n Congress counts the electoral votes on January 6, two weeks before Inauguration Day. The New York Postnotes that if the election is somehow still in dispute, things could get complicated: Some states could deliver two sets of electoral votes and Vice President Mike Pence, who serves as president of the Senate, could opt to throw out both sets of votes from those states. If neither candidate has 270 electoral votes, the n Congress would vote for president and vice president; the House of Representatives would need a majority by 26 votes to choose a president and the Senate would need at least 51 votes to determine the VP In that unlikely scenario, if the Senate somehow chooses a vice president but the House does not pick a president, the vice president-elect serves as president until all is resolved. If neither body of Congress can successfully vote by Inauguration Day, the n the presidential line of succession takes effect and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) would serve as president until a new president is chosen. ButABC Newsnotes no presidential candidate in modern history has ever refused to concede. Even Al Gore conceded to Bush in 2000 after a recount in Florida ended 36 days of uncertainty.“I accept the finality of the outcome, which will be ratified next Monday in the Electoral College,” Gore said. “And tonight, for the sake of our unity as a people and the strength of our democracy, I offer my concession.”But will it take Trump longer than Gore to admit defeat?The White House has not indicated Trump plans to concede — “That word is not even in our vocabulary right now,” campaign manager Jason Miller said Monday onFox Business— and Vice President Pence said Monday the race “AIN’t over” yet.“Told @VP Team Today: ‘It ai not over til it is over .. And this AIN’T over.!’ @RealDonaldTrump has never stopped fighting for us and we are gonna Keep Fighting until every LEGAL vote is counted,” Pence is official Twitter account said Monday. Trump also repeated a number of dubious claims about results in Nevada, Wisconsin and Georgia on Monday.“The threshold identification of Ballots is turning out to be even bigger than originally anticipated. A very large number of Ballots are impacted. Stay tuned!” Trump tweeted. Told@VPTeam Today, “it ai not over til it is over.. and this AIN’T over!” President@realDonaldTrumphas never stopped fighting for us and we are gonna Keep Fighting until every LEGAL vote is counted! 🇺🇸The threshold identification of Ballots is turning out to be even bigger than originally anticipated.

You can read portions of the sequence of tweetshereorhere. This may be Lanny is way of venting Democrat frustration. Despite every dirty trick the left has employed, Trump is still president and may continue to be through 2024. Okay, if you red-state rubes will not kneel before us, we will pick up our socialist toys and create a country of our own!To be clear, this is not a threat of civil war. It is more like a family law attorney telling the unappreciated wife what she can expect out of the divorce. For example, Davis claims that the new country will get the following states:Hawaii, Oregon, California, New Mexico, Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and all the Northeast ... including Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Guam, and Washington DC He the n claims that his new country will also get the following:We get the vast majority of the major shipping ports ... Costco, Starbucks, and Boeing ... stem cell research and the best beaches ... the Statue of Liberty ... Intel, Apple, and Microsoft...85 percent of America is venture capital and entrepreneurs ... 90 percent of the high tech industry, most of the US low-sulfur coal ...

Oh, and you can have all the new COVID-19 cases since you are too dumb and self-centered to wear masks. Nice, Lanny. Tell us how you really feel. Clearly, Mr. Davis did not study geography while in college. There are several major ocean ports in the southeastern and gulf states from Norfolk, Virginia to Corpus Christi, Texas, including Charleston, Miami, New Orleans, and Houston. I sort of get his point about Costco, Starbucks, Boeing, Intel, Apple, and Microsoft, due to the location of their corporate offices, but they and the rest of the high-tech industry are not rooted in the ground. I am sure all of them will want to continue doing business with red-state America, and considering how blue states like to raise taxes, many of these businesses may decide they are better off moving to a red state. In fact, this is already happening. Tesla, among others, is moving some of its operations from California to Texas mainly because of taxes. Seriously, dude, the best beaches? Ever heard of Florida?Hate to lose the Statue of Liberty and Yosemite. Maybe the liberals will let all of us deplorables come see them. Sorry to lose Cal Tech and MIT, too. Lanny, you can keep Hollywood and all of the arrogant posturing actors who think pretending to be someone else makes them experts on politics, the attitudes and religious morals of the working class, the Second Amendment, and climate change. You can also keep the Ivy League and all of the other elitist college training centers for the theory and practice of socialism. Oh, and once we get readily available vaccines, the whole mask controversy will die out. The one major flaw in Mr. Davis is plan is that state boundaries are not absolute and inviolable. They are political in nature and can be changed. During the last episode of secession in 1863, the state of Virginia was divided along political lines. The eastern part, old Virginia, remained Confederate until the end of the war, and the western part became West Virginia, a Union state. This same scenario will present itself if blue states decide to secede. Many blue states are already highly polarized politically between the liberal cities and the conservative rural areas. Illinois, for example, has one massive liberal city, Chicago. The rest of the state, which is roughly four times larger in terms of area, is fairly conservative. I cannot imagine rural Illinois would be willing to follow liberal Chicago out of the Union, no matter how the state Legislature votes. Illinois is not the only one. Would the rural areas of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania blindly follow the lead of Detroit, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia? What about upstate New York and New York City, California east of the Sierra Nevada mountains versus the western coastal cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco, southern New Jersey outside the Philadelphia sprawl? The list goes on. If we follow the Virginia–West Virginia precedent, there could be anywhere from three to as many as ten new red states created if blue-state secession occurred. This would leave the seceded blue states a lot smaller than Mr. Davis originally envisioned, perhaps the size of several counties each. Red states would be left with most of the farmable land, plus most of the energy and other natural resources. Still, this may be the solution to a lot of our problems. Blue-state secession will solve the issues of who runs the majority of the country; if the government is going to socialist or more traditional center-right; and the ongoing political fights over abortion, policing, immigration, and most of the more recent appointments to the Supreme Court. Many countries have broken apart in the past thirty years. The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia all separated into smaller countries, and there are separatist movements in other places, such as Spain and Belgium. Even Britain has devolved some of the central government is power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. Will secession occur in the US? Unlikely. The blue states would get a lot more trouble and a lot fewer benefits than they expect. If it does happen, I am perfectly willing to let our blue-state brethren leave, just as long as we do not end up with a Chinese military air base at LAX and a Russian air base at LaGuardia.

Appalling? Yes. But what else do you expect from the woman who has made herself a popular fixture on cable news with her willingness to jettison professional ethics and declare the president mentally unstable?Former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale is in the hospital. He threatened to harm himself this weekend at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,according to law enforcement officials.“Brad Parscale is a member of our family, and we all love him. We are ready to support him and his family in any way possible,” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said in a statement. Self-harm is serious. Suicide is serious. Someone should tell that to Lee.“Here is another side effect of continuing with a mentally impaired leader,”the Yale University psychiatry professor said in reaction to the Parscale news. “It will attract mental impairment, augment mental illness (in both supporters and opponents), and cause disorder to reverberate through society.”Later, after social media users alerted Lee to the obscenity of her attack, she added, “The messages I receive from Trump supporters give a good measure. They went from normal: ‘How could you do this to our president?’ To more disturbed: ‘Dems are diabolical demons, and wretched, vile, inhumane Communists like you made a deal with the Devil’ (my last message).”Ah, yes. So, those angry at her manipulative use of Parscale is reported breakdown are the real issue. Lee is behavior should not shock you.

335,"Israel is Military, Made in the USA",-16.33,39.0,https://www.thenation.com/article/world/israel-military-united-states/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-21,25,"Israel is latest attack on Gaza—with a death toll of over 200 Palestinians so far, including more than 60 children—has once again raised the question of the US role in enabling Israeli killings of civilians. But while it is well-known that the USs is a major aid supplier to Israel, the degree to which the Israeli military relies on US planes, bombs, and missiles is not fully appreciated. According to statistics compiled by the Center for International Policy is Security Assistance Monitor, the USs has provided Israel with $63 billion in security aid over the past two decades, over 90 percent of it from the State Department is Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, a grant program that provides funds to buy US weaponry. But US support of the Israeli state goes back much further—total US military and economic aid to Israel exceeds $236 billion (in inflation-adjusted, 2018 dollars) since its founding—nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars. Not only has US financial support helped Israel outfit its military, but it has been used to subsidize Israel is development of its own military industry, which produces, among other things, armed drones that have been used for attacks on targets in Gaza. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) is a case in point. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Israel has 324 fighter and ground attack aircraft, all of US origin: 83 Boeing F-15s, 224 Lockheed Martin F-16s, and 16 Lockheed Martin F-35s. So, if someone asks whether US-supplied planes have been involved in bombing Gaza, it does not require a research project to answer with an emphatic yes. Israel also possesses US attack helicopters, transport planes, precision-guided bombs, and air-to-surface missiles. And US aid powers the IAF, providing billions of dollars’ worth of fuel under the government-to-government Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. Despite Israeli conduct, the aid spigot remains wide open. Israel is in the third year of a 10-year, $38 billion aid memorandum of understanding negotiated under the Obama-Biden administration. The USs does not make any comparable written agreement regarding a decade-long future financial commitment for foreign or domestic appropriations. And earlier this month, on May 5, Congress was notified of a planned $735 million deal for precision-guided bombs destined for Israel. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) have introduced a resolution of disapproval to try to stop the sale, and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has introduced a parallel measure in the Senate, the first time such a step has been taken with respect to an arms transfer to Israel. From its bombing of Beirut during its 1982 invasion of Lebanon to December 2008 is Operation Cast Lead, which resulted in the deaths of at least 1,383 Palestinians in Gaza, including 333 children, Israeli has largely escaped consequences for its misuse of US weaponry to harm and kill civilians on a large scale. That may be changing. The recent general strike by millions of Palestinians that was reinforced by large demonstrations across the USs is just the latest manifestation of years of organizing by Palestinians and their allies to change US policy towards Israel. Organizations like the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, Jewish Voice for Peace, and the Adalah Justice Project, who have long been calling for a cutoff of US military aid to Israel, have been joined by allies throughout the broader US progressive movement, including the Movement for Black Lives, which has stated, “The fight for Palestinian rights and dignity is integral to the fight for human rights everywhere” and demanded that “the US divest the $3.8 billion of public dollars that goes to Israel in military funding each year.” Human Rights Watch recently released a groundbreaking report that asserted that some of Israel is actions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories led to “deprivations [that] are so severe that they amount to crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.” And last month, the prominent centrist think tank the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace issued a report calling for a “rights-based approach” to US policy on Israel/Palestine that “would prioritize protecting the rights and human security of Palestinians and Israelis.” The political landscape in Congress is beginning to change as well. There is still plenty of uncritical support for Israel on Capitol Hill, but the ground is shifting. One used to have to look far and wide for vocal support for Palestinian rights in the House or Senate, but on May 14 a group of House members—including Democratic Representatives Tlaib, Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Pocan, Cori Bush, and Ayanna Pressley—took to the floor of the chamber to make a plea for the Biden administration to recognize the basic humanity of the Palestinians and to press harder for Israel to stop the killing. In a searing speech, Tlaib said, “We ca not have an honest conversation about American military support for the Israeli government without acknowledging that for Palestinians the catastrophe of displacement and dehumanization has been ongoing in their homeland since 1948.… We must condition aid to Israel on compliance with international human rights and end the apartheid.” And Senator Sanders  took to the pages of The New York Times to call for “an evenhanded approach, one that upholds and strengthens international law regarding the protection of civilians, as well as existing US law holding that the provision of US military aid must not enable human rights abuses.” Even enforcing existing US human rights laws with respect to Israel is use of US weaponry could go a long way toward ending impunity in the use of US armaments. Perhaps the greatest sign of progress in Congress comes from the new bill by Representative Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), which prohibits the use of US funds to enable violations of international and human rights law. The bill, which has 18 cosponsors, will face an uphill battle in Congress, but hills are made for climbing, and as public pressure for accountability over Israel is use of military aid grows, so will support for the legislation. In McCollum is words, “Now is the time to send a clear message to the Israeli government: Not one dollar more of US military aid can be used to demolish Palestinian homes, annex Palestinian lands, and torture or kill Palestinian children.” As of late yesterday, the Israeli government and Hamas had announced a mutual cease-fire in Gaza, a goal the Biden administration had pressed in private conversations with Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials. Hopefully the cease-fire will hold, but it is far from the only issue raised by the US arming of the Israeli military. On the whole, the Biden administration has been far too quiet in the face of ongoing Israeli atrocities. It should use the leverage provided by US aid to Israel to press forcefully for an end to the repression throughout Israel and the occupied territories, and to hold the Israeli government accountable for what Amnesty International has suggested may be war crimes committed in Gaza.",1,1,The Nation

In just one week, the Democratic governor has faced multiple allegations of inappropriate conduct and workplace sexual harassment, including accusations from two former aides. Lindsey Boylan who served in the state is economic development agency and served in Cuomo is administration from 2015 until 2018,published an essay detailing a series of disturbing interactions with the governor. The allegations included an instance when she said Cuomo suggested they “play strip poker,” and that had once allegedly kissed her on the lips without her consent. Cuomo has denied those allegations. Charlotte Bennett, another former aide, detailed a series of uncomfortable encounters with her former boss to The New York Times, including alleged overtures for a sexual relationship while alone in his state Capitol office last June. A third woman, who does not share work history with Cuomo, alleged unsolicited touching at a wedding in 2019. Cuomo, for his part, has spent much of the week trying to distance his actions from some of the more egregious types of behavior that have cast a shadow in the wake of the MeToo movement. Cuomo maintained during his first public briefing since the two additional women came forward that he had never “touched anyone inappropriately.”“The governor is press conference was full of falsehoods and inaccurate information, and New Yorkers deserve better,” Bennett is harassment lawyer, Debra Katz, told the Times. In aCBS News interview Thursday evening, Bennett said that she perceived the governor is alleged sexual overtures as indication that he saw himself as “untouchable.”Cuomo is dominant presence in New York politics, and the accusations of a third-term governor wielding power for self-interested ends and being beyond the grasp of accountability comes as the New York legislature moved to strip Cuomo of the emergency pandemic powers this week. State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D) last month said it was time to restore “checks and balances” for the governor, who had enjoyed additional emergency powers to drive a quick pandemic response since last spring. The move gets ahead of the expiration of the powers set for April 30. Stewart-Cousins had also separately weighed in on New York Attorney General Letitia James’ investigation into the sexual misconduct allegations, saying during a CNN interview this week: “If the investigation shows that something inappropriate did happen, I think he would have to resign.”She elaborated on those comments in a Thursday interview with local networkSpectrum Newswhen asked at what point the governor would lose her support: “Any further people coming forward, I would think it would be time for him to resign.”Cuomo on Wednesday expressed contrition, saying he was both “embarrassed” and had “learned an important lesson.”“I do not believe that I have ever done anything in my public career that I am ashamed of,” he said, adding that he felt “badly” his words had caused discomfort. But even after Cuomo rebuffed calls for his resignation, he was further battered by another report that landed late Thursday. The Times revealed an effort by some of the governor is senior aides to rewrite a report on COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes, likely as part of a broader effort to preserve the image of the long-serving governor, whose missteps amid the pandemic have increasingly come under scrutiny. A final version of the report concealed a staggering number of nursing home deaths occurring until June, as the Cuomo administration publicly cited a figure that was roughly 50 percent lower than the one identified by state health department officials. While Cuomo has previously attributed efforts to withhold true accounting of the total death toll of nursing home residents to concerns that the Trump administration would launch a politically-motivated inquiry, the Times’ report shows evidence of the masking effort far before the arrival of federal requests for the data. Cuomo will face a separate investigation overseen by the state attorney general regarding nursing home deaths.",1,1,Talking Points Memo

Democratic vice-presidential candidate Kamala Harris is set to join Fonda at a Saturday virtual event held by progressive advocacy group Supermajority. The event—titled ""Supercharge: Women All In""—will ""bring together thousands of women to laugh, sing, dance, and celebrate women is political power,"" according to the group is website. Fonda traveled to North Vietnam in 1972 as part of an anti-war protest that saw her pose for photos with enemy troops on an anti-aircraft gun. The photo sparked outrage among Vietnam veterans, earning her the nickname ""Hanoi Jane."" Fonda is public appearances remain subject to controversy—a group of Ohio veterans called on the actress to donate her $83,000 speaking fee to the families of fallen soldiers ahead of a May appearance at Kent State University. Harris and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden have criticized President Donald Trump on veterans' issues in recent weeks. During a September ""veterans roundtable,"" Biden criticized Trump for ignoring ""the bounty on the heads of Americans in Afghanistan,"" referencing a slew of June reports that claimed Russia bribed the Taliban to kill US servicemen. One day before the roundtable, Marine Corps general Frank McKenzie—who oversees military operations in the region—told NBC News that a review of US intelligence failed to corroborate the alleged bounties. Harris promoted the roundtable in atweet, saying American veterans ""sacrifice so much for our nation and deserve our respect and gratitude, both while on active duty and after."" The Biden campaign did not respond to a request for comment on her upcoming appearance with Fonda. Fonda has long supported Harris financially, contributing nearly $6,000 to the Democrat is Senate campaign since 2016. The actress also gave $1,000 to the Biden Victory Fund in June after donating a combined $10,300 to Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D., Mass.) and Amy Klobuchar (D., Minn.), Democratic governors Steve Bullock (Mont.) and Jay Inslee (Wash.), and billionaire Tom Steyer during the presidential primary. Saturday is event will also be attended by Warren, twice-failed presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Senator Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.), and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.). It will feature a ""yelling room where participants are encouraged to scream out their emotions,"" according to event organizers.

343,Talkin’ ’bout a Starcity revolution – The San Francisco Examiner,0.0,42.0,https://www.sfexaminer.com/news-columnists/talkin-bout-a-starcity-revolution/,https://adfontesmedia.com/sf-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-29,19,". Not to go all “you kids get off of my lawn!” at you, but has anyone else noticed that lately it is not enough to have a good idea; the idea has to “change the way we live and work!” Even a bad idea, like COVID, changes the way we live and work. In fact, every single technological upgrade, since the first time a caveman rubbed two sticks together, has arguably changed the way we live and work. Every upgrade is going to change our lives, and we eat it up. Bring the change. It is always for the better, right?But not every new idea can deliver on this, can it?Of course not, but someone in the real estate world really is trying to change the way we live and work. In a world of sound and fury, often indicating nothing, Starcity, a co-living outfit with properties in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Barcelona (!), stands apart from the myriad would-be change agents. If they can pull off their plans for the next two years, they will indeed change the way many people live and work — but are these changes for the better?Up to now Starcity has been a pretty standard co-living provider, offering furnished rooms in rehabbed homes in San Francisco and other cities. They charge residents a membership fee which covers rent, utilities, internet and common area upkeep/perks. They are basically streamlined, upscale boarding houses, temporary in nature (memberships can range from three to 15 months), tailor-made for newly-arrived white-collar workers. But this was not enough for Starcity. They are taking a huge swing next year, and it could result in, in a world of would-be game-changers, an actual game-changer — for a specific type of San Franciscan. At some point in 2021, Starcity will start construction on a project at 457 Minna St. When it is completed, Starcity Minna will be a 15-story, 270-unit co-living monster, built in modular fashion to keep down costs but festooned with all manner of upscale (and, let is admit it, youthful) perks: an event space, a bike repair and storage area, a massive rooftop deck. Each level will consist of 18 en-suite units, a “chef is kitchen,” a dining area that, per online drawings, will double as a laptop-strewn workspace, a media area and a lounge (more laptops). It is a dream come true for a certain type of renter. I am just not sure Starcity is ready to admit who that renter actually is. The City received a $400,000 prize from the federal government as one of the initial winners of a multi-phase competitionThe biennial census is federally mandated and goes a long way in funding support services in The CityDoty was acquitted last month of assaulting a former San Francisco fire commissionerYou may as well lose the drawings of energetic, fashion-forward seniors mingling with their young co livers, Starcity, and technically, I guess the project is aimed at “low- and middle-income residents,” but let is be honest, here; this is a giant upscale dorm for young tech workers. Imagine the catnip Starcity Minna will be for exhausted techies who have been couch-surfing and sleeping in eight to a room in “tech pods?” Imagine getting all of these perks for well below market rent? So what if I have to share a kitchen? I mostly do take-out anyway. Young tech workers, new to The City and at adulthood? They are the ones, perfectly positioned for the soft landing of grown-up dorm living. Not satisfied with this single revolution, last week Starcity rolled out another game-changer,invest.starcity.com, which expands real estate investment beyond the reach of institutions and high-rolling individuals, offering opportunity to anyone with $5,000 to invest. It is a chance, Starcity CEO Jon Dishotsky says, to “democratize access” to real estate investing, in a city where traditional home-buying is well out of reach for many. With this program, and with Starcity Minna, the company has changed access for renters and investors, while also truly creating “a new way to live and work.”And let is be clear about that new way to live and work. Is it a revolution everyone wants? Or needs? Starcity Minna is many things, but what it is at its core is a co-working space with bedroom suites attached. Google may have game rooms and fitness centers to keep you at work (“Need your dry-cleaning done? Do not leave! We will do it right here!”); at Starcity Minna, you never have to go to home because you are already there. Your home office gets lonely; at Starcity Minna, you are never alone. This is the real revolution, a world where work and home are one, a life where you can still take Zoom meetings in your pajamas and the n afterward retire to the coffee station to kibbitz with like-minded peers. It may not be the revolution everyone wants, but Starcity is not lying when it claims to be changing the way we live and work.",1,2,SF Examiner
344,Biden Is Turning America Into the Land of the Freebie,26.33,19.67,https://spectator.org/biden-free-college-democrats-socialism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,23,"With the media proclaiming President Joe Biden to be the new FDR, it is important to craft the right governing philosophy for him. The answer is simple. The federal government should make real the most simple liberal — excuse me, progressive! — principle. Everything in life should be free. At least, everything in life should be free. I had this extraordinary revelation while reading the, the repository of all that is wonderful and decent in the nation is capital. Poststaffer Jen Balderama penned an articleentitled, “Community college saved me. Biden is right: It should be free.” It was an epiphany! I suddenly understood: If even one person benefits from something, it should be free to all. What could be more obvious? What a wonderful life Americans the n would have. Why stop at giving away community college education? Consider the movement to eliminate student debt. The Left already is pushing this hard. It involves the same principle, at least for anyone who borrows to pay for a university degree. How foolish I was to work while in school and accept help from my parents to pay for undergrad and law school. Education was good for me. No doubt adding another lawyer to our terribly under served society was great for the people! Somy schooling should have been free. Why should I have to pay for something just because I chose to do for my benefit? America — and, heck, everyone else on Earth — benefited. Make college free for all. And as much as we want wherever we want. If I feel called to be a permanent student, Washington should make my dream come true. Moreover, if I want to go to Stanford, Harvard, Yale, or some other pricey place, cost should be no object. Indeed, why should I be denied entry by discriminatory “standards” and “qualifications”? Elite schools are part of the racist, elitist, patriarchal, and whatever other evils that apply to structures designed to hold we the people in bondage. All universities should be public, open to all, and free to everyone. Cambridge, here I come!It is time for government to act and make your dreams come true — for free. There is also child care. Why should people be expected to be responsible for their own kids? Hillary Clinton was wrong to believe that it “takes a village.” That is not nearly enough people! Rather, it requires all the smart thinkers in Washington taking and spending everyone else is money. Progressives believe that having sex and aborting babies are the most — actually, perhaps the only — essential liberties. Government is entitled to promiscuously and routinely interfere in every other human decision. If the intersection of these two fundamental rights unexpectedly leaves a baby alive, the n the essential right to economic redistribution kicks in. And everyone else should pay for everything — starting with child care at birth. It is beyond question that health care should be free. Every last procedure. Being healthy is our rightful state, and getting sick is not our fault. Even if someone claims that we contributed to the problem — all the outrageousfat-shamingthat goes on after people have a heart attack, for instance! — it should not be held against us. Personally, I want it all. If a few extra pounds result, there should be some miracle medical procedure to remove a few of them — why should I be denied the chocolate that is necessary to help me determine the meaning of the universe and engage in other essential acts of personhood? My once-bountiful hair appears to be thinning: surely modern medicine can fix that. And it was nice getting the COVID-19 vaccine for free. Why do I have to pay more for aspirin than for a life-saving shot? It all should be free. Similarly, food should be free. We need it to live. And there should be food equality. It is no one else is business what we eat. If I prefer a diet of steak and shrimp, what is the problem? If I want caviar, it should be my right. Why should I be denied my preference? Why should rich people get to eat what they want and not me? That is downright unfair. It also is classist. Racist. Sexist. And probably some other evil “-ist”s as well. In my case, being fat is an essential part of who I am — especially eating cashews, chocolate, potato chips, and ice cream. It is not fair to deny me such necessities just because some dead white cis gender male living in what once was an empire that oppressed native peoples and allowed slavery claimed something was unhealthy. Food should be provided to everyone, without judgment and free of charge. So should transportation. How are those of us who are not Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos supposed to get around? Cars are expensive. Gasoline is expensive. Parking is expensive. We need to go to work (oppressive!) and school. We even have to drive to go out on dates (essential to humankind!). Buy groceries. Vote (early and often!). And organize unions for protest and the socialist masses to overthrow their oppressors. Moreover, gasoline-powered cars are bad for the environment. So mass transit should be everywhere and free. Electric cars should be free. Even taxis for those of us who do not want to own cars should be free. Though not Uber and Lyft, tools of exploitation against the laboring masses. It is socially unjust to expect people to pay for something as essential as transportation. Housing should be free, too. No one should be denied the home of their choosing. Today poor people suffer in cities while their oppressors live in splendor in surrounding suburbs. Public housing is a good start but does not go nearly far enough. It still allows enormous housing inequality. Why should not everyone get to live in a house like that owned by Bill Gates? Government should confiscate the existing housing stock and distribute it on a fairer basis. But much more is required. Government should make companies build houses for free for everyone. Make rich corporations give back to the community! True servants of the people, like Senator Bernie Sanders, who owns three homes, should be shown special consideration for having devoted their lives to taking from the rich for the rest of us. Personally, I believe I deserve at least two homes!Even jobs should be free. That is, government should employ anyone who needs work. Well, a paying position, not actual work, if you get my meaning. Nor is there any reason to let “need” and “qualifications” as defined by dead white cis gender males get in the way. Government should provide employment to everyone — no restrictions. Why should people be constrained by arbitrary limits that prevent the oppressed masses from being all they can be? Have you ever been denied an opportunity that you believed you deserved? It is time for government to act and make your dreams come true — for free. Democrats should listen to progressive activists and institute the socialist ideal. Like to cook? Government restaurants should allow anyone to be a chef. A frustrated architect? Government construction companies should let anyone design and build homes for all. Better yet, produce skyscrapers to showcase the new equal and fair America. Just imagine Stalinist realism with a Bidenesque accent!Did you play doctor when young? No need to waste time in medical school! Government hospitals should hire anyone to fulfill their dreams. We would have true people is radiologists, neurologists, thoracic surgeons, and more. Why let oppressive training get in the way of ideological commitment? Who does not believe they can teach better than some antediluvian professor with an ancient degree granted by a school founded decades or centuries ago by a bunch of dead white slave-owning cis gender males? Government universities could allow anyone to teach. With appropriate emphasis on true human values. We have a chance to build a real and permanent socialist majority. There is no limit to this idea. Why let qualifications get in the way of government service? The more decades of undistinguished office-holding, the better! Government institutions should allow anyone to take power and rule over the rest of us — oh, wait, at least that ideal has been fulfilled! All hail President Joe Biden! But this should be just the beginning. Free should become the new principle of government. Paying for everything remains a slight challenge, though. The who is obvious, starting with rich, oppressive, white, cis gender men and even women — there just are not enough guys, alas. Also high-income, conservative people of color, who obviously are not authentic and do not deserve to be treated as real people of color. And anyone else departing from progressive orthodoxy.

345,Jim Clyburn Urges Filibuster 'Carveout' for Laws Protecting Constitutional Rights Like Voting,-4.67,42.0,https://www.newsweek.com/jim-clyburn-urges-filibuster-carveout-laws-protecting-constitutional-rights-like-voting-1608558,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsweek-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn is urging PresidentJoe Bidento amend the US Senatefilibuster in order to carve out laws that are directly tied to constitutionally protected rights, including voting. Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat and one of Biden is top congressional allies, told Politico in ast ory published Saturdaythat the current voting rights protection bill will only pass if Senate rules are changed to allow a 51-vote majority on the For the People Act of 2021. Echoing the vehement demands of top congressionalDemocrats, Clyburn said it is finally time for the White House to get aggressive in order to protect Americans' right to vote. He said Biden could easily convince Democrat moderates like West Virginia Senator Joe Machin to get behind a tailored ""carveout,"" which would only change the filibuster toward legislation directly tied to constitutional rights.""Pick up the phone and tellJoe Manchin, 'Hey, we should do a carveout.' I do not care whether he does it in a microphone or on the telephone — just do it,"" Clyburn said to Politico. Biden has so far publicly expressed little interest in changing the legislative filibuster in order to pass Democrats' massive election reform bill as well as a second piece of legislation that reauthorizes sections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But Clyburn said Biden ""should endorse"" a legislative carve out immediately, particularly after a recent 6-3Supreme Courtruling that upheld GOP-backed voter restriction laws in Arizona. On Friday, White House Press SecretaryJen Psakisaid that Biden is upcoming Tuesday speech in Philadelphia is set to address voting rights as a ""moral obligation,"" rather than a simple legislative consideration. Clyburn also told Politico that he tried talking with Manchin last month as the Democratic senator and crucial swing vote was proposing changes to the the election reform bill. Clyburn said he told Manchin at the time: ""I am not asking you to eliminate the filibuster ... But what I am saying to you is that nobody ought to have the right to filibuster my constitutional rights.""Some top Democrats, including Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, have likened state-by-state GOP voter suppression bills to aggressive forms of ""white supremacy."" Casey saidRepublicansacross the country are are creating more hurdles for mail-in voting or early voting under the guise of ""phantom voter fraud.""Harvard University law professor and constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe appeared to agree with Clyburn is tactic to circumvent Senate Republicans, tweeting Saturday: ""This is the solution: Enact a carve out for laws protecting constitutional rights.""Meanwhile, dozens of states have recently passed GOP-backed voter suppression laws that are being pushed through state legislatures almost purely on party-line Republican votes. The six Supreme Court justices who recently upheld the Arizona voter restrictions were all appointed by a Republican Party president.reached out to Clyburn is office Saturday for any additional remarks about the filibuster.

346,"The Morning Briefing: Change All the Names, Nuke All the Statues—Grievance Wusses Will Still Be Whining",26.03,20.42,https://pjmedia.com/columns/stephen-kruiser/2020/07/14/the-morning-briefing-change-all-the-names-nuke-all-the-statues-grievance-wusses-will-still-be-whining-n637246,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-14,25,"No doubt I will catch some grief for this one but that is kind of my role around here, is it not?The grievance mob is picking up steam, using the Year of the Riot to claim more cultural victims. We will get into the philosophical discussion about all of this in a moment but, on a personal note, I find it rather exhausting just attempting to keep up with whom or whatever they are mad at during any given moment. At this point, I am not even certain there are any statues left in America. What we have witnessed in recent weeks is truly a descent into madness. Criminals are taking over cities with the backing of the elected officials who run those cities. Those same officials are proudly abandoning their police forces to score points with a bunch of Marxists, the n predictably seeing violent crime skyrocket overnight. We are supposed to believe that this is all being done in the name of delivering some long-overdue justice. It is all bunk. The always-eloquent Thomas Sowell put it very well i na recent conversation with Mark Levin:Right off the bat, Levin asked Sowell about the rioting that has gone on nightly in America since the murder of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. “I am regarded as pessimistic,” Sowell said, “but I was never pessimistic enough to believe that things would degenerate to the point where they are now, where adult human beings are talking about getting rid of the police … what is frightening is how many people in responsible positions are caving in to every demand that is made, repeating any kind of nonsense that you are supposed to repeat. I do believe that we may well reach a point of no return. I hope, of course, that will never happen.”Count me among the pessimists. We are not focusing on riots today but this is all tied together. It is only Tuesday and the grievance-mongers have been busy. They pulled off the seemingly impossible,making Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder back down after years of saying that he would not change the team is name. Barely pausing to take a breath, the grievance mob the n decided to go after the Texas Rangers. That is a rather ambitious Monday. But wait, the re is more!ran a post yesterday titled “Do not Stop at Statues. Demand a Reconsideration of Place Names Too.”This grievance slope is not just slippery, they have now got a free army of people to keep covering it with Vaseline. We will be sliding down it forever at this rate. I do not care if people have hurt feelings. Everybody has hurt feelings at one time or another. The thing is, the lunatics that are becoming a bigger blight on America every day always have hurt feelings. They wake up aggrieved, and the day just becomes one long list of grievances that is updated hourly. Though it may seem impossible, there is an inexhaustible supply of grievances to keep them raging. Back in the Occupy days, I kept saying and writing that the rage was the endgame for them. It is basically the same now. They keep saying they want change, and I do not doubt that they would like to affect some political change here and the re, but that will not make them any less angry. There is nothing that will make them less angry simply because angry is what they want to be. The grievance freaks will always find another grievance. They are addicted to it. What is disturbing about the last couple of months is the pace at which they are finding new ones. As we have seen with the destruction of the statues, they are also not very discriminate about focusing their wrath. It is very aggravating that there are so many Republicans in Washington who do not understand this. We are fighting for the soul of America and we have got Republicans in Congress going on about statues as if they are trying to get dates with antifa. I would not be surprised to see Mitt Romney at the next statue-toppling. He and his ilk are forever convinced that, if they just give the grievance crowd one more concession, everything will be roses and puppies. There is no telling how long we are going to be subjected to this nonsense that is largely being fueled by woke white people at the andNew York Times, but it will no doubt be a while. We may truly have reached a point of no return. The inmates are most definitely running the asylum right now. Yeah, yeah, I know…that is offensive to crazy people.

347,Biden Struggles on Israeli-Palestinian Flare-Up,-1.67,43.67,https://foreignpolicy.com/2021/05/14/biden-israeli-palestinian-gaza-crisis-diplomacy-blinken-netanyahu-hamas/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-14,25,"In recent days, the Biden administration has dispatched an envoy to the Middle East and engaged in a flurry of back-channel diplomacy to respond to the surge in violence between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. The big question is: Does the USs have the appetite, or even the political maneuvering room, to be an honest broker?In recent days, the Biden administration has dispatched an envoy to the Middle East and engaged in a flurry of back-channel diplomacy to respond to the surge in violence between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. The big question is:Does the USs have the appetite, or even the political maneuvering room, to be an honest broker?The escalating conflict between Israeli security forces and Palestinian militants has sparked furious debates among Biden administration insiders on whether the USs should play a leading or supporting role in defusing the crisis, even though it has yet to completely fill its own ranks of senior administration posts overseeing the Middle East. The Biden administration, pushing to shift US foreign policy toward confronting China, showed little interest in diving into the Middle East peace process before the latest explosion of violence, which has culminated in deadly rocket barrages fired into Israel from Gaza and Israeli counter strikes targeting Hamas militants. But due to the urgency of the crisis, and mounting pressure from US lawmakers on both sides of the aisle to respond more forcefully, that may no longer be an option, experts and former officials said.“This was not on their policy priority list at all,” said Kirsten Fontenrose, the director of the Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council. “Now, they are going to be forced to take it on as a primary priority, and I do not think they are ready for that.”Israel is military said on Thursday that it began operations to fight against Hamas militants in Gaza.“I have never seen Gaza in my three and a half years here so empty. It is like a ghost town. You know, people really were terrified to move onto the street,” said Matthias Schmale, the Gaza-based operations director of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides aid and services to Palestinian refugees. “There is not really been a lull in the fighting,” he said in a phone interview that was interrupted by the sound of an explosion. “There is constant rockets from here and really very heavy violent responses from the other side.”Meanwhile, a surge in intercommunal violence between Jewish and Arab communities in Israel has further escalated the crisis, along with widespread Palestinian protests in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. On Friday, protesters on theJordanian border with the occupied West Bank were able to breach Jordanian security forces, while Lebanese demonstrators have attempted the sam eon Israel is northern border. There are also reports of Syrians gathering in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. Demonstrations could only intensify this weekend, as Palestinians commemorate the anniversary of theNakba—the mass expulsion of Palestinians from what would become Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War—on May 15. Some analysts and UN officials voiced fears that if a truce is not broker ed in the next several days, the violence could escalate into a protracted conflict for weeks or even longer. Political paralysis in Israel, which was on the cusp of a fifth round of elections in less than two years, and a delay in Palestinian elections to resolve fractious political lines across the occupied territories could further complicate any potential peace talks. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Wednesday that he was dispatching an envoy to the region to try to de-escalate the crisis. Hady Amr, a deputy assistant secretary of state, worked on Middle East peace initiatives in the Obama administration. Amr is viewed in Washington as the best interlocutor to engage with the Palestinians, according to several former officials. Other current and former officials said the Biden administration should work to coordinate truce talks with other regional powers that have close contacts with Palestinian political leaders and Hamas. This includes Egypt, which has outsized influence in the occupied Palestinian territories and helped broker a cease-fire in the 2014 Gaza war, and Qatar, which is seen to have close ties to Hamas. Schmale said his agency has been providing Israel with location data on UN facilities to ensure they do not get bombed and that he has received assurances from Hamas that it will not use UNRWA schools and other facilities for military purposes. “They said the same in 2014, and we still found weapons … and we ensured those weapons were removed.”Current and former US and UN officials say Egypt and Qatar are quietly coordinating with the UN to try to carve out a path for cease-fire talks. Egyptian mediators traveled to Israel this week but so far to no avail. One additional complicating factor for President Joe Biden is that the USs does not yet have senior envoys permanently stationed on the ground to address the crisis nor a more senior confirmed diplomat in place in Washington. Biden named veteran diplomat Barbara Leaf as his nominee to be top envoy for the Middle East last month, but she has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. Former US Representative Robert Wexler and Thomas Nides, a banker and former State Department official, are front-runners to be Biden is ambassador to Israel, according to several people familiar with the matter. But four months into office, Biden has yet to formally name a nominee for the post. The Biden administration also has yet to reopen its consulate in Jerusalem, a de facto diplomatic mission to the Palestinians, due in part to push back from the Israelis. The Trump administration shut it down in 2019, a year after it moved the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.“We have got to reopen the consulate,” said Ilan Goldenberg, an expert at the Center for a New American Security and a former diplomat who worked on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. “It is in [Israel is] interest and our interest for the US to have the ability to engage with Palestinians on the ground, as we are seeing right now. So in the immediate aftermath of the conflict, I really hope that reopening the consulate becomes a priority.”In Washington, Biden is facing conflicting pressures from both the progressive flank of the Democratic Party—which has become sharply critical of Israel and its treatment of Palestinians—and centrist Democrats and Republicans urging him to do more to support Israel. On Thursday night, members of the House Progressive Caucus took the House floor to voice their support for Palestinian rights and concerns about the escalating situation in Gaza, in statements that reflected the sharp and growing splits among Democrats over US ties to Israel. Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American, joined other progressives in urging Biden to pare back support for Israel and condition or restrict US military aid to Israel as the violence continued. The USs provides $3.8 billion in military aid to Israel annually.“The truth is that this is not a conflict between two states. This is not a civil war. It is a conflict where one country—funded and supported by the USs government—continues an illegal military occupation over another group of people,” Omar said. She later lashed out at the Biden administration is response on Twitter. Administration insiders say pressure from the progressive caucus is unlikely to sway Biden is position on US support for Israel, at least in the short term. Both Biden and Blinken have voiced support for Israel is right to defend itself in statements this week, though Blinken on Wednesday stressed that Israel “has an extra burden” to avert civilian casualties in its retaliatory strikes in Gaza.is a diplomacy and national security reporter at.

350,"As Taliban Atrocities Mount, Afghans Urge International Sanctions",-1.0,42.67,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/taliban-biden-sanctions_n_6116c832e4b01da700f5a9dd,https://adfontesmedia.com/huffpost-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-13,25,"President Joe Biden is extremely unlikely to reverse his plan to wind down America is 20-year mission in Afghanistan even as Taliban militants sweep through the country, massacring their opponents and forcing thousands of people to flee their homes. But Afghans argue that the US still has considerable power to influence the Taliban even after most American troops leave the country: through international sanctions. This week, a Washington-based advocacy group called the Afghanistan-US Democratic Peace and Prosperity Council began lobbying Congress and the Biden administration to seek new UN sanctions on Taliban figures. Its effort has not been previously reported. Separately, Afghan foreign minister Haneef AtmartoldThe Wall Street Journal that world powers should reinstate UN travel restrictions on Taliban leaders.“While the Biden administration is resolved in leaving Afghanistan, it still can lead within international institutions. The Taliban will not respect its calls for peace without a show of force,” the group said in a Friday statement. “Without the US to lead on sanctions, other nations will move to recognize the Taliban in efforts to stem an inevitable refugee crisis. This would be an absolute failing of the US and the international community.”Supporters of stronger sanctions hope they will convince the Taliban to slow its onslaught. When the ultraconservative armed movement previously ruled Afghanistan, it was a pariah. Combined with the toll of a civil war and the Taliban is repression, that isolation made life miserable for most Afghans. In negotiating with Washington as they seek to regain power, Taliban representatives have repeatedly said they do not want to lose foreign support like the aid and expertise that Afghanistan has come to rely on since the US invasion in 2001. Tougher international restrictions on prominent Taliban members could show that countries will shun a Taliban-dominated government in Afghanistan if it violates rights standards and steam rolls other local players like pro-Western Afghans. Without a global rebuke of the offensive, however,Chinaor other powers like Iran might soon decide to acknowledge the Taliban as Afghanistan is legitimate leader, killing the prospect of a multinational effort to limit the group is brutality. UN sanctions could affect prominent Taliban members who are based in Qatar, the small Persian Gulf state that hosted the talks leading to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, and other Taliban forces in Pakistan. A senior Afghan lawmaker who recently fled a Taliban offensive explained their support for sanctions to HuffPost.“Those who have committed atrocities have to be recognized internationally. They will understand that they will not receive legitimacy if they continue to do atrocities,” said the lawmaker, who requested anonymity for fear of Taliban retribution against family members who are still under the group is rule. “The UN, the US and other countries who are involved in Afghanistan should understand that … with keeping quiet about the atrocities that the Taliban are doing, they are inviting the Taliban to do that.”As the Taliban have taken over Afghan cities and districts in recent weeks, they have detained and killed relatives of officials in the US-backed Afghan government,forcedwomen to marry their fighters andtargetedjournalists. The lawmaker said that civil servants and activists in their hometown were told by local Taliban representatives to surrender and provide information like their home addresses; the lawmaker advised them not to because those details would make it easier for them to be hunted down. The Taliban is also forcing local families to provide young men as fighters, the parliamentarian added. An international response matters because Afghans are deeply affected by apparent global apathy toward the m, the lawmaker said. “We are demoralized, we cannot continue, because we think the world is backing the Taliban instead of the people of Afghanistan.”An official at the US mission to the UN said that the Biden administration is open to tightening sanctions.“If the Taliban continues down their current path of violence it will affect the Security Council is review of the travel ban exemption and the status of designations,” the official told HuffPost via email. The official did not comment on potential new sanctions. Biden aides say the US continues to support the Afghan government and wants the Taliban to halt its assault in favor of talks to establish a power-sharing agreement. But the administration knows the next few weeks could bring a very different outcome. The president sent 3,000 troops to Afghanistan on Thursday to help withdraw many of the staff at the sprawling US embassy in Kabul and he is speeding up efforts to evacuateAfghans who previously worked with American forces and are now Taliban targets. The Taliban is takeover of more than two-thirds of Afghanistan ― and the collapse of US-backed government forces in many areas ― has occurred far more quickly than American and Afghan officials expected, suggesting they could soon take their ultimate prize, Kabul. The continued onslaught risks millions of Afghans’ lives and could shatter the society that has developed in the country over the last two decades, as women have come closer than ever to equal rights and foreign assistance has improved issues like humanitarian conditions and press freedoms. The lawmaker who escaped a recent Taliban assault said it was hard to believe how quickly their life seemed to crumble. One month ago, they were telling contacts abroad that instead of seeking safe passage out of the country for progressive Afghans, they should support their attempts to stay in their homes. “Now, after the things I saw, I think we have to find ways to leave instead … It is better to have someone alive outside the country instead of someone who is dead inside of the country.”To the parliamentarian, like many Afghans, recent developments echo painful memories of Afghanistan is civil war of the 1980s.“It is the same stories that my mom was telling me: We left everything behind, we had only one small bag,” they said. “Now this has happened to me.”At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive news subscriptions.

351,Analysis: Cities hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic face bankruptcy,-2.0,44.67,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/analysis-cities-hit-hard-by-the-covid-19-pandemic-face-bankruptcy,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-30,25,"U Bankruptcy is a legal process where people, companies and governments who cannot pay their debts seek to reduce them. Which debts get paid during a bankruptcy are important decisions. They involve how comfortable a city employee is retirement might be, the level of health insurance for pensioners and workers, the extent of labor protections for employees and the future cost of borrowing for a city. City bankruptcy was created by Congress after the Great Depression, in response to4,770different units of city government going belly up. Twenty-seven state snow allow their cities to file for bankruptcy. Those states that do not allow city bankruptcy – Georgia and Iowa explicitly prohibit filing, with the other 21 states having no specific allowance or prohibition – manage the problem of city indebtedness in various ways, ranging from strict budget oversight to the disbanding of heavily indebted cities. Since 1938, city bankruptcy has been used around 700times. A city is bankruptcy differs from corporate bankruptcy in that it does not allow for the liquidation of assets. For cities, bankruptcy is used to reduce debts, not sell off things – such as public roads and buildings – to pay off debts. The bankruptcy judge is role is to determine whether the proposed reduction is fair to all people the city owes money to, which may include workers, pensioners, bankers, suppliers and investors. But bankruptcies can look different in different cities. We are scholars who research changes in how cities go about budgeting. Our work has showed that the city bankruptcies that followed the Great Recession of 2007 and 2008 were not uniform. If you were in a big city, your government owed money to lots of people. The converse was true in small cities. As the number of participants in a bankruptcy increases, the task of deciding how much different creditors should get repaid becomes more complicated. Westfall Township, Pennsylvania, home to about 2,000 people, declared bankruptcy in 2009 after losing a lawsuit to New Jersey real estate developers David and Barbara Katz. Courts ruled that the city owed the Katzes $20.8 million after improperly denying them permission to develop projects in the township. With annual revenues of just $1 million, Westfall had few options but to file for bankruptcy. Resolving Westfall is bankruptcy meant reaching a new agreement with the Katzes. The bankruptcy court approved a$6 million settlement with the developers and gave Westfall 20 years to pay. The city would also raise property taxes and delay the repayment of other debts. By 2014, Westfall is budget had recovered enough for Pennsylvania to remove it from its list of distressed cities. Bankruptcy proceedings were more complicated in Vallejo, California, which is on the northern end of San Francisco Bay. Vallejo,population 120,000, had a 2008-2009 budget of $79.6 million. In 2008, the city lost around one-quarter of its revenues as local sales taxes and real estate development fees collapsed. Vallejo suddenly found itself unable to pay all of its bills. The City Council voted unanimously to file forbankruptcy. In its bankruptcy filing, the city estimated it had between 1,000 and 5,000 creditors. The most contentious part of the bankruptcy concerned the city is obligations to its own unionized employees. Vallejo argued that its bankruptcy should include the option of reducing employee wages and benefits, and changing working conditions, if necessary, without union consent. The judge agreed and, in doing so,expandedwhat types of debt could be reduced in bankruptcy. This was, and remains,controversial. Although unions have pushed back, later bankruptcies have confirmed the court is decision. Vallejo ultimately chose not to impose new employment contracts on most of its employees. That decision helped Vallejo avoid costly legal battles – but the city is main expenditures, wages and pensions, remained largely unaltered. The city emerged out of bankruptcy solvent butstruggling. Filing for bankruptcy ended up costing Vallejo over $20 million in court and legal fees. Vallejo is bankruptcy foreshadowed an even more complex one in Detroit, where revenue decline and failedWall Street bets left the city unable to balance its budget. Detroit listed 100,000 creditors in its 2013 bankruptcy filing, totaling$18.5 billion in debts. Like Vallejo, Detroit would have to decide which creditors to stiff, effectively asking them to pay for the city is budget failures. Detroit is biggest debt during bankruptcy was to its pension holders. Bill Pugliano/Getty ImagesDetroit is biggest debt during bankruptcy was to its pension holders. Bill Pugliano/Getty ImagesThe eventual settlement would reduce Detroit is debts by $7 billion, mostly by slashing the amount of borrowed money the city would have to repay to banks and investors. Butno creditor would walk away unscathed. Wages, pensions and health care for city employees were all cut. The city also entered into a complex “Grand Bargain” broker ed by local philanthropists with the state of Michigan and pension holders that helped settle the city is largest debt, which was to pensioners, while keeping in the city its one major asset, the Detroit Institute of Art is collection. The administrative and legal costs of the Detroit bankruptcy came in at around $100 million. The bigger the city, the more complicated and expensive the bankruptcy. More creditors means more lawyers making competing claims on the city is dwindling revenues. It also makes the process of picking winners and losers more complex and something that can involve testing the limits of bankruptcy law. When these limits expand, just what going bust means can change dramatically. Things that once seemed untouchable, like pensions, can become vulnerable in bankruptcy courts. With many budgets in tatters, the prospect of growing numbers of city bankruptcies looms. Distressed cities will have to figure out what the process means for them. It is rarely possible to predict what any city will decide. With any part of a city is operations – including salaries, pensions, road repairs, borrowing, park maintenance, policing, libraries – potentially fair game, everyone involved faces great uncertainty. There is nosingle, predictable path through city bankruptcy.",2,2,PBS

354,Tribes denounce North Dakota ID law in congressional hearing,-0.75,47.0,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/tribes-denounce-north-dakota-id-law-in-congressional-hearing,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"BISMARCK, ND — Native American voters face poor access to polling sites, discrimination by poll workers and unfair identification requirements, tribal leaders told members of Congress who traveled Tuesday to a reservation in North Dakota where voting rights were a key issue in last year is US Senate race. A House elections subcommittee is meeting at the Standing Rock reservation was the latest in a series of on-site visits across the country on voting-rights issues. Activists told the panel that obstacles still remain more than five decades after Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, which aimed to eliminate such impediments for minority voters.“There continues to be barriers — interpersonal and systemic — at our polling locations in our tribal communities and for our Native voters across the state,” said activist Prairie Rose Seminole, a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation in northwestern North Dakota. The bulk of the two-hour hearing focused on North Dakota is voter ID requirements, which have led to two federal lawsuits by tribes who allege the rules are discriminatory and suppress the American Indian vote, which leans Democrat in a Republican-dominant state. The voter ID dispute drew national attention last fall because of a US Senate race in North Dakota that was seen as critical to Republicans’ chances to keep control of the Senate. Republican Representative Kevin Cramer defeated Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp, who was seeking a second term. North Dakota requires that a voter ID include a provable street address, which Secretary of State Al Jaeger says guards against fraud. Tribes allege the moves by state GOP leaders disenfranchised members who live on reservations where street addresses are uncommon or unknown and where post office boxes are the primary addresses.“The state knew this and they used it to suppress tribal voters,” said Charles Walker, CEO of the Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation. State officials have denied that. The US Supreme Court in October allowed the state to continue requiring street addresses on voter IDs, though Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said in a dissent that “the risk of voter confusion appears severe.”The decision led to an intense effort by tribes and advocacy groups to get tribal members to the polls with proper ID during November is general election. It was largely successful but cost the Spirit Lake and Standing Rock tribes a combined $14,000, in part because they waived normal fees for tribal IDs.“Fifteen dollars is milk and bread for a week for a poor family,” said Turtle Mountain Chippewa attorney Alysia LaCounte, who broke down in tears during her testimony. US Representative Rodney Davis, an Illinois Republican, noted during the hearing that Cramer won handily despite high Native American voter turnout. Native American Rights Fund attorney Jacqueline De Leon responded: “We do not think that outrage is a get-out-the-vote strategy, right?”“There are voter suppression issues going on throughout Indian Country that are not nearly getting the attention or resources that were poured into North Dakota because it just so happened that Senator Heitkamp was running for re-election, and the Senate balance of power elevated this issue to the national stage,” DeLeon said. Davis replied, “So this was all a conspiracy to beat Heidi Heitkamp?”North Dakota Republican leaders have denied that Heitkamp is surprise 2012 win influenced state voter ID law. OJ Semans Sr., co-executive director of the Four Directions advocacy group, which has been successful in voting rights lawsuits in South Dakota and other states, implored the subcommittee to work to increase federal dollars that states can dedicate to helping Native American voters.“The backbone of democracy is going to be given a brace, because people are going to vote,” he said.",2,2,PBS
355,Nurses question hospitals’ claims they are contracting coronavirus in the community instead of at work,-4.33,48.33,https://www.cleveland.com/coronavirus/2020/12/nurses-question-hospitals-claims-theyre-contracting-coronavirus-in-the-community-instead-of-at-work.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cleveland-com-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,18,"CLEVELAND, Ohio – Over the past several months, hospitals have repeatedly said contact tracing shows the doctors, nurses and other health care workers who have acquired COVID-19 are largely being infected through community spread. Leaders from the Cleveland Clinic, MetroHealth and University Hospitals made those assertions during a November 16 news briefing where they announced that hundreds of health care workers and other hospital employees were sidelined due to the virus. The claim has also been repeated by leaders from other Ohio hospitals who have appeared at Governor Mike DeWine is coronavirus briefings. Yet those assertions have puzzled and disheartened nurses who are at the front lines of the pandemic. They question how hospitals can pinpoint where they acquired a virus that is so widespread, and they contend it is just as likely they were infected while treating COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, nurses feel that suggesting they are getting the virus through community spread insinuates they are being careless once they are off the clock.“Every time someone from a hospital is talking, they seem to want to throw in that this is all community spread, that health care workers are not getting [COVID-19] in the hospital,” said Brandon Marlow, a labor representative from the Ohio Nurses Association. “It just seems very curious, why it is a consistent message they feel they need to give.”Marlow said he is not sure why hospitals continue to say employees are being infected outside of work. He assumes it could be related to liability reasons, and said several hospitals have made the same assertions in private meetings with the ONA However, several of Cleveland is largest health systems said they are offering paid leave to employees who contract COVID-19 without requiring them to use vacation or paid time off. Data on the topic is scarce, although one study published in The Lancet found front line health care workers were at higher risk for contracting COVID-19 than the general community. Doug Meredith, an ICU nurse at Cleveland Clinic Akron General, said health care workers who are around coronavirus patients every day know the severity of the virus and take precautions to protect the mselves outside of work. He said it is discouraging to hear hospitals suggest employees are getting infected elsewhere.“I think [nurses] do take it personally. They do feel like their professionalism is being questioned, because of what they do outside of work,” he said. “Because I think we all try to do the right thing.”Hospitals in Cleveland said they trust their employees and do not believe they are being careless in the community. Instead, they feel the high number of employees who have contracted the virus is the result of a spike in infections across Ohio.“Our care givers are highly professional, and contracting COVID-19 outside the hospital is not a reflection of their professionalism, but a reflection of how contagious this virus can be in the community,” a UH spokesman said. How do they know?Hospitals say they have been conducting contact tracing when an employee tests positive for COVID-19 to identify the source of infection. Leadership for the Clinic, MetroHealth and UH said during the November 16 news briefing that the rise in infections among employees largely mirrored the spike in coronavirus cases in Northeast Ohio. But the ONA is skeptical the hospitals can truly identify where and when someone was infected, Marlow said. Even though employees are wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and taking other precautions in the hospital, the re is still a risk they are being exposed.“What [hospitals] would like to say is that because all these measures are in place, the re is no way somebody could be getting it in the hospital,” he said. “And I do not know if that is a conclusion a reasonable person could come to.”Marlow said the ONA has repeatedly asked for data that shows employees are being infected in hospitals but has yet to receive any such proof. The Clinic, MetroHealth and UH did not provide any specific contact-tracing data to cleveland.com. UH said roughly 4.5% of its care givers have tested positive for COVID-19 since the start of the pandemic. That compares favorably to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 13.4% of US health care workers have tested positive. Less than 1% of the UH cases have been linked to exposure at work, a spokesman said. All three health systems have said they have conducted robust contact tracing and have protocols in place to protect employees, such as temperature checks for visitors, mask requirements and social-distancing measures. Meredith has not tested positive for COVID-19, but some of his colleagues have. He said he is not aware of any contact tracing that took place after those exposures. Nurses are already dealing with skeptics in the community who claim the virus is not that serious and the pandemic is overblown. So it is frustrating to hear hospitals tell nurses that they are acquiring it outside of a workplace where they are constantly interacting with COVID-19 patients, Meredith said.“It is kind of like you are hearing it from both ends, and you are stuck in the middle,” he said. “Sometimes you feel like you are completely on your own.”The liability questionEarlier this year, Democratic lawmakers in Ohio is House of Representatives sought to address the issue of workplace liability through HB 573, which proposed making COVID-19 an occupational disease under the workers’ compensation law. Representative Lisa Sobecki of Toledo and Representative Kristin Boggs of Columbus introduced it March 23, the same day Ohio is stay-at-home order went into effect. Yet the bill never got a hearing after being referred to the House Insurance Committee on May 5. Sobecki said she is not sure why it failed to gain any traction, although the state is Republican lawmakers have consistently pushed back on any legislation surrounding the coronavirus and evens ought to strip DeWine is authority to issue statewide public health orders. Sobecki said she is unaware of any outside lobbying to prevent the bill from becoming law. But she said she heard from constituent groups who supported the legislation, and feels it is important for Ohio to stand behind the essential workers who have put the mselves in harm is way throughout the pandemic.“We have not seen bills that help everyday Ohioans in the middle of a pandemic,” she said. “It really saddens me.”She plans to reintroduce a new version of HB 573 once the Ohio Legislature begins a new session in 2021.“This is not going to go away. The pandemic does not stop on December 31,” Sobecki said. “This pandemic is going to continue until we can get the vaccine to Ohioans.”Cleveland health systems said they have nevertheless taken steps to support employees who contract COVID-19. The Clinic is giving its employees paid time off if they contract COVID-19, regardless of where they are infected. Those employees are not required to dip into their own PTO, a Clinic spokeswoman said.“There is a lot of positive things [the Clinic] is doing as well, to try to take care of workers who are off with COVID,” Meredith acknowledged. UH employees who acquire COVID-19 at work qualify for workers’ comp. If they are infected through community spread, they may use the health system is leave and short-term disability programs, a UH spokesman said. Marlow said other Ohio hospitals have similar programs in place to help employees. Those efforts are appreciated, but the ONA also wants hospitals to provide robust contact-tracing data and give more weight to the possibility employees are being infected at work.“I think what makes the most amount of sense is to not pretend once you walk into a hospital, it is a magical place where it is no longer the community and you can no longer contract the virus,” Marlow said.",2,2,Cleveland.com

Biden has proposed raising the capital gains tax rate to 39.6% from 20% for millionaires; coupled with an existing Medicare surcharge, federal tax rates for the wealthy could climb as high as 43.4% – pushing the levy on returns to one of the highest in the developed world, according to a new analysis published by theTax Foundation. Ireland – with a 51% tax on dividends – would be the only developed nation to impose a higher tax on investment income. On average, nations in the 38-member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development levy a marginal tax rate of 24.4% on dividend income. Unlike the US, many OECD nations differentiate how they tax dividends and capital gains. As far as capital gains tax rates, the US would have the highest capital gains tax rate among OECD nations under Biden is proposal. Currently, Denmark has the highest rate of 42%, followed by Chile at 40% and Finland and France each at 34%. Roughly one-fourth of all OECD countries do not impose a capital gains tax on the sale of long-held shares, including Belgium, the Czech Republic, South Korea, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Turkey. The average capital gains tax rate among OECD members is about 19.1%, according to Tax Foundation data. Taxes on long-term capital gains – generally classified as an asset that is held for more than one year – currently range from 0% to 20% in the US, depending on a person is income. Wealthier investors are also subject to an additional 3.8% tax on long- and short-term capital gains that is used to fund ObamaCare. Short-term capital gains on assets sold within a year are typically taxed as ordinary income. The top long-term capital-gains tax rate is currently paid by single taxpayers earning more than $445,850 this year (and $501,600 for married couples filing a joint tax return). Capital gains are taxed favorably when compared to wage and salary income; under existing law, the richest Americans pay a top tax rate of 37% on ordinary income, while the top tax rate on capital gains is 23.8%. Biden campaigned on equalizing the capital gains and income tax rates for rich Americans. But a recent analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan group at the University of Pennsylvania is Wharton School, suggests that rich Americans would employ techniques to avoid the rate increase. Tax avoidance, most of it legal, would cut about $900 billion of the estimated $1 trillion that a capital gains tax increase could generate for the federal government over the next decade, the researchers said.""Even with stepped-up basis eliminated, several avenues for tax avoidance remain,"" the researchers wrote. For instance, they said, taxpayers would likely realize more gains in years when taxable incomes fall below the threshold. They also suggested that an increased share of business incomes would be organized via pass-through interests instead of C-corporations in order to avoid the second layer of shareholder tax.""A large body of empirical research shows that when taxes on capital gains increase, realizations of capital gains fall,"" the researchers wrote. ""Compared with other forms of income taxed under the individual income tax, capital gains are relatively responsive, or elastic, with respect to tax rates.""",1,1,Fox Business

Far-left MSNBC host Joy Reid praised the VP hopeful and recited DNC talking points trashing Attorney General Bill Barr is testimony to the House Judiciary Committee. Reid advanced a wild conspiracy theory that the Barr and the Trump administration will use a “secret police” to scare off Biden voters:Senator, I think one of the things people are afraid of is that William Barr will look the other way if there are violent protests that are attempting to intimidate people that want to vote against Donald Trump or, and/or that he might use his federal secret police force he is created and cobbled together to intimidate voters who want to vote for Joe Biden. Are you worried about that?Instead of looking at the violence in cities like Portland and acknowledging federal officers are there to protect people from violent rioters. Reid looks at it in a purely cynical and political way. Of course the Trump administration did not send federal officers to scare Biden voters, he sent them because oft he failure of these cities’ mayors to lead and protect their citizens. Harris completely ignored Reid is comments on “secret police” and went straight into her VP pitch:Follow @LifeNewsHQListen, at this point, what I am worried about is that we remind everyone of what is at stake in this election, this election which will be, I do truly believe the most important election of our lifetime. Joe Biden has, for example, outlined a number of plans that are part of his policy to build back better, build America back up to where it can be. It has been widely known thatHarris is on Biden is VP short list, so she will praise Biden as much as possible in order to make herself look as favorable as possible. Harris did not want to discuss the real threat of violence in American cities, because that does not serve her self-interest. Reid happily thanked Harris for campaigning for Biden:Thank you very much. And it is important that you put out some proactive information too, people can look up about what former Vice President Biden is offering on the other side.

""And for most people who get this Delta variant, it is going to be the most serious virus that they get in their lifetime in terms of the risk of putting them in the hospital.""The Delta variant has fueled a rise incoronaviruscases, the number of new infections rising in all 50 states. Hospitalizations have also increased 36%, and deaths are up 26%. On Friday, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky said ""this is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,"" as nearly all people who are hospitalized with COVID-19 have not been inoculated. Even as the number of coronavirus cases spikes, Gottlieb said the US is likely under counting infections, as Americans who are younger and healthier, or those who are asymptomatic or have mild cases, may not get tested for COVID-19.""We are not doing a lot of routine screening right now,"" he said. ""Unless you work for the New York Yankees, you are not getting tested on a regular basis. So I think that this Delta wave could be far more advanced than what we are detecting right now in our ascertainment.""Gottlieb estimated the US is picking up roughly 1-in-10 or 1-in-20 infections, and those who get tested for COVID-19 are either sicker or have ""telltale"" symptoms of the coronavirus, such as loss of taste or smell. To mitigate the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, some areas of the country have reimposed mask mandates for both unvaccinated and vaccinated people indoors. But Gottlieb said to protect against the variant, it is important for people to invest in high-quality face coverings, such as N95 masks.""Quality of mask is going to make a difference with a variant that spreads more aggressively like Delta does, where people are more contagious and exude more virus,"" he said ""Trying to get N95 masks into the hands of vulnerable individuals in places where this is really epidemic I think is going to be important, even in cases where they are vaccinated, if they want to add another layer of protection.""As the number of new coronavirus cases grows and vaccination rates flatten, the Biden administration has issued warnings about misinformation about the COVID-19 vaccines that has proliferated on social media, which Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called a ""serious threat to public health.""Gottlieb said the most ""pervasive"" piece of misinformation related to the vaccine is that it will impact fertility, which he said is discouraging many young women from getting their shots.

366,"What Is Felony Murder, And How Much Did The Capitol Rioter MAGA Assholes Commit It?",-20.33,34.83,https://www.wonkette.com/felony-murder,https://adfontesmedia.com/wonkette-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-12,25,"Amidst all of the chaos, outrage, and excellent mem es in the wake of the MAGA riot, it can be easy to gloss over the gravity of what happened last week. Violent insurrectionists tried to stage a coup and five people died at the USs Capitol. More than 50people have been charged with crimes for their roles in last Wednesday is events — but, so far, no one has been charged in connection with any of the deaths. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died of injuries from ""physically engaging with protesters,"" according to the DC Metro Police Department. Both the MPD and FBI are investigating his death as a murder. Depending on what comes out in the investigation, one or more people could be charged with murder, manslaughter, or aiding and abetting murder or manslaughter. Four Trump supporters also died, including one who was shot by Capitol Police. Because of these deaths, there has been a lot of talk about the doctrine of felony murder, which allows prosecutors to charge people with murder even when they did not actually play a part in anyone is death. Does the felony murder rule apply here? Let is take a look. I get it and I agree: There needs to be serious consequences for what that happened last week. But the thing is, felony murder is bullshit. It makes murderers out of people who are not actually killers. Felony murder lets prosecutors charge people with murder if someone dies, even by accident, if they were committing a dangerous felony at the time of the death. The underlying felony has to be dangerous enough that someone dying, even by accident, was foreseeable. A common application of felony murder is when a group of people plan a robbery and someone dies. Even if the death is accidental — or one of the perpetrators is killed by a cop. It does not matter what role you played in the underlying felony, or even if anyone was armed. Felony murder came from 12th century English common law and was eventually codified here in state and federal statutes. Twenty-seven states even execute people who found guilty of felony murder — and at least 11 people have been executed for felony murder since 1985. It is no tout of the realm of possibility that someone could be charged with felony murder for some of the deaths at the Capitol. But it will not be an easy case to make. Because the crimes were committed in DC, federal law applies. The federal felony murder rule, found at18 US Code § 1111, says people can be charged with murder if the y:committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson, escape, murder, kidnapping, treason, espionage, sabotage, aggravated sexual abuse or sexual abuse, child abuse, burglary, or robbery; or perpetrated as part of a pattern or practice of assault or torture against a child or children; or perpetrated from a premeditated design unlawfully and maliciously to effect the death of any human being other than him who is killed, is murder in the first degree. Armed insurrection, riots, and terrorism are, for whatever reason, not on the list. That does not mean it would be impossible for anyone to be charged with felony murder, though. According to former federal prosecutor Tim Heaphy,""You could look at the storming of the doors of the Capitol by that riotous mob as burglary. If they went in with the intent to steal, disrupt proceedings, to commit other offenses, they committed burglary. And, the refore, a murder that occurred during the course of a burglary could be potentially charged as felony murder.""And it appears the DOJ and DC US Attorney have not ruled out felony murder charges, with senior prosecutor Ken Kohlsaying,""Felony murder is always in play in something like this. Until we get all the facts and conduct the investigation, talk to witnesses, review any videos, we are not in a position to comment.""So it looks like we will just have to wait and see to find out. It is easy to get outraged about what happened and understandable that so many people are demanding serious consequences. I am pretty fucking pissed off, myself, that most of the charges so far have been for misdemeanors like unlawful entry to the Capitol. But, at the same time, we need to remember that changing the law to make it easier to charge people with felony murder would be a terrible thing — and very rarely used against people like the white, middle class MAGA assholes who stormed the Capitol. As long as Black kids are still being charged with felony murder for their friends getting killed by cops, I am fine with also using it against racist terrorists. The law is on the books and actively being used, so sure, charge the motherfuckers. Whatever. But also, let is just get rid of felony murder entirely.

367,"Chicago Teachers Union votes to refuse in-person work, defy Chicago Public Schools’ reopening plan",-1.67,46.17,https://chicago.suntimes.com/education/2021/1/24/22247280/chicago-teachers-union-votes-in-person-work-defy-chicago-public-schools-reopening-plan-strike,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-24,25,"Chicago Teachers Union members have voted to defy Chicago Public Schools’ reopening plans and continue working from home Monday because of health and safety concerns. City officials had said in recent days they would view the collective refusal of in-person work as a strike, but in response to Sunday is vote results said they will delay the scheduled return of thousands of teachers and staff until Wednesday “to ensure we have the time needed to resolve our discussions without risking disruption to student learning.”The CTU is move to reject in-person work marks the culmination of a months-long fight between the union and the nation is third-largest school system over how and when to reopen schools during the pandemic — a disagreement that threatens to plunge the city is education into deeper turmoil if a deal is not reached over the next few days.“So what does this mean? It means the overwhelming majority of you have chosen safety,” the union told teachers and staff as they announced the vote results. “CPS did everything possible to divide us by instilling fear through threats of retaliation, but you still chose unity, solidarity and to collectively act as one.”About 86% of the 25,000 rank-and-file CTU members participated in the electronic vote over the past three days, with 71% favoring the rejection of in-person work in an unusually close vote for CTU labor actions. When the CTU voted to strike in 2019, 94% of members who voted chose to walk out. CTU President Jesse Sharkey wrote on Twitter he “will grant that it is a lower percentage than we have had in the past. It is a pandemic, after all.” He later added in a statement he believes “an agreement is within reach, but we need a willing partner.”Illinois law requires three-quarters of CTU members to authorize a typical contract strike, such as the one in 2019. The union has said a work stoppage this time around would come in response to several alleged unfair labor practices by CPS, and the approval of only a simple majority of voting members is required — though the CTU said last week it would seek 60% to show its unity. Union leadership has been adamant, however, that its initial action is not a strike since teachers intend to continue working from home — even though the school district is no longer allowing that option for about half of union members this week. The union has said it would only withhold its labor if no agreement is reached come Wednesday and CPS decides to block teachers from remote work — as it has done with a few dozen pre-kindergarten and special education staff members who have not reported to schools as ordered this month and are no longer being paid. The strategy from union leadership has been to back CPS officials into a corner in negotiations by forcing the district to address teachers’ concerns immediately, delay its reopening plan or risk halting all classes. Thekey unresolved issues are: which teachers and staff who have a household member with a vulnerable medical condition are eligible for accommodations for remote work; the public health metrics that determine the reopening or closing of individual schools and the district as a whole; how vaccines factor into requiring staff to work in person; and the scope of district wide testing of staff and students. About 3,800 preschool and special education cluster program teachers and staff were ordered to return to schools earlier this month for the resumption of in-person learning for their students. Another 10,000 staff members in kindergarten through eighth grades were due back Monday. K-8 schools are scheduled to reopen February 1 for an estimated 71,000 students — out of 191,000 children in those grades — who have said they plan to return. Black, Latino and low-income families have been less likely to choose in-person learning, data has shown. It is also not clear, however, how many of those K-8 students will actually follow through with their intentions to go back. CPS officials on Friday released attendance data from the first week of school for pre-K and cluster students that revealed an average of 3,189 of the 6,470 students who opted in — 49% — returned to classrooms each day. That meant only 19% of 16,944 eligible students were learning in-person that week. The CTU has said those numbers should help predict a similar pattern in the next reopening wave, leading to fewer teachers needed for in-person work. But CPS has said it is still planning as if all 71,000 kids are returning. Schools chief Janice Jackson wrote in an email to families Sunday that the return of K-8 teachers and staff will be pushed back to Wednesday as the two sides continue to negotiate, but CPS still plans for K-8 students to return February 1. Pre-K and cluster staff will be expected to keep reporting to schools this week, and Jackson said the district is goal is “to reach an agreement with CTU as soon as possible.”When she was asked Friday if the union is walkout would mean even remote learning would come to a halt, Jackson said, “I think my point was clear that if the union refuses to work on Monday, that constitutes a strike.”Jackson said it would be unfair to deny families the opportunity to return to schools, and she and City Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady expressed strong confidence that all necessary precautions have been taken to keep students and staff safe from COVID-19. The district has spent $44 million on disinfectants, PPE, air purifiers and other measures to ready schools for the return of staff and students. After a rough fall and early winter, coronavirus infection rates in Chicago have steadily fallen. The city is test positivity rate is at 7.2%, and the seven-day average of daily confirmed cases is down to 629 — both the lowest since mid-October. But teachers have shown serious concerns about their health in schools they believe will not uniformly or strictly enforce mitigation protocols. The teachers union and its medical consultant, national expert Dr. Vin Gupta, have advocated for a slower, more phased-in approach to reopening schools that coincides with teacher vaccinations. School staffers in Illinois are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccinations starting Monday, and some suburbs are prio rit izing teachers for those shots over other essential workers. Gupta also said last week he was concerned about the new strain of the virus that originated in the UK Sharkey wrote to members Sunday that CPS’ decision to delay the return of K-8 staff was done “unilaterally” — not in agreement with the CTU, as the district claimed — and was meant “to sow dissent and disrupt collective Union action” without reaching a tangible agreement. Still, the union was encouraged by the move because it signaled a willingness to resolve the dispute, sources said.",2,2,Chicago Sun-Times

According to conventional wisdom, food that has dropped on the floor can be safely eaten if retrieved within five seconds. Some scientists have even set up experiments to confirm this folk saying. Of course, all bets are off if your toast falls on the floor buttered side down and you have not mopped the kitchen in recent memory. Today, after a contentious election and with the results of the presidential race still uncertain, we are all now looking down at the ground. It is been four years since Donald Trump dropped the buttered toast of our democracy onto the floor. After four years face down in the dirt, can our democracy be picked up, dusted off and restored to some semblance of integrity?Thepollsmade it look like Joe Biden would be an easy winner, maybe even in a landslide. The Democrats were expected to retake the Senate. The huge number of early votes — nearly 100 million — suggested that the 2020 turnout would be the greatest in more than 100 years. The Democratic Party is supposed to benefit from more souls at the polls. The polls were off. If Joe Biden wins, he will do so by a slender margin and only after considerable legal wrangling by both parties. The Democrats are now a long shot to win control of the Senate. And the huge turnout has translated into Donald Trump getting more votes in 2020 than he did in 2016, more in fact than any Republican candidate in history. Texas did not go blue. Neither did Florida or Ohio. The Republican Party went all in for Trump, and he delivered beyond his base. But Arizona may have flipped, and Georgia might as well. If the infamous “Blue Wall” holds — at least Wisconsin and Michigan if not Pennsylvania — the n Biden will become the next president. Still, who in their right mind would want to lead the USs at this perilous moment? The pandemic is surging. The economy has not climbed out of its hole. Donald Trump has applied hisscorched-earth approach to both foreign and domestic policy. The Republican Party has demonstrated that it delights in playing dirty, refuses to compromise for the national good and embraces the most malign of Trump is many fictions from the uselessness of masks to the myth of climate change. Exit polls, meanwhile,reveala country divided by more than just party affiliation. Democrats, for instance, overwhelmingly want to contain the current pandemic while Republicans want to focus on reopening the economy. This dynamic explains why so many Trump voters believe the president better handles both the economy and the pandemic, even if the evidence of his mismanagement is obvious to everyone else. Trump is “law and order” message also proved influential among Republican voters, despite the president is blatant violations of law and disruptions of order. Heck, according to a recent judicial ruling, even the president is Commission on Law Enforcementbroke the law!Perhaps the most sobering conclusion from the election is that nearly half the country is indifferent to the actual mechanisms of democracy. They just do not care that their president refused to endorse a peaceful transition of power if he loses. They do not care that he has derided the very act of voting by insisting, as he did early Wednesday morning, on enlisting the Supreme Court in an effort to stop the counting of the remaining ballots (except in those states, like Arizona, where he hopes to catch up). Nor do they see anything wrong with the Republican Party is efforts to keep certain groups of people away from the polls. That does not bode well for the future of American democracy, especially if the country continues to abide by the Electoral College. For the last several decades, US presidential elections have resembled Groundhog Day — and I do not mean the movie. Why should one groundhog determine the length of winter? Do not the other ground hogs get a vote? Likewise, why should a voter in Pennsylvania matter more than a voter in Maryland or Wyoming?Trump is not the only culprit here. The ground was dirty before he dropped our democracy on it. The Democrats and their patronage systems, like Tammany Hall in New York and Richard Daley is machine in Chicago, set some dismal precedents. But now it is the Republican Party that, to preserve its governing majority in the absence of a popular mandate, is warping the rules of the game and breaking the few rules that remain. Let is say that Biden ekes out a victory. What is the damage report on Trump is four-year assault on democracy? After the 2016 election, the pundit class asserted that one man, however powerful, could not tear down the 250-year-old edifice of American democracy. There was much talk of “guardrails” and “adults in the room,” all of which were supposed to contain the ungovernable id in the White House. Over the course of four years, however, Trump systematically disposed of the supposed adults in the room — Rex Tillerson, Jim Mattis, John Kelly — in favor of yes-men and one or two yes-women. In addition, through executive orders, judicial appointments and obsessive Twittering, he moved the guardrails so that he could steer America wildly off the road. Just before the 2018 midterm elections, Iwrote, “it would be poetic justice if what is left of the mechanisms of democracy — voting, the courts, and the press — can still be used to defeat a potential autocrat, his family, and all the putative adults he is brought into the room to implement his profoundly anti-democratic program.”Over the last two years, those mechanisms were in fact on full display. Despite Trump is full-court press, the judiciary has represented an important check on his power,blockingsome of his attacks on immigrants, his efforts to withhold his financial information and to throw out ballots. The mainstream media, meanwhile, continued to nip at Trump is ankles. The New York Times, for example, published one expose after another about Trump isrecord on the pandemic, histaxes, his financial relations with Chinaand so on. And now the voters have had their say. Despite all the efforts by the Republican Party to suppress the vote, around67% of eligible voters turned out this year, the highest percentage since 1900. Trump supporters did what they could to push against that tide. Theyintimidatedvoters. TheydisruptedDemocratic Party events and even tried to run a Biden bus off the road in Texas. Theyrestrictedthe number of ballot drop-off locations. The post office, run by a Trump appointee,ignoreda court order to locate 300,000 mail-in ballots at risk of not being delivered. But voters gonna vote. Let is also salute all the people who have made that vote possible. Despite the pandemic, tens of thousands of people showed up to staff polling sites and count ballots. Then there are all the volunteers who participated in get-out-the-vote campaigns by knocking on doors, making phone calls, sending texts and doing grassroots fundraising to keep the operations going. Democracy, in other words, is not just about the politicians and the voters. It requires an immense effort by a veritable army of people. They, not the candidates, are the winners of the 2020 election. Trump is not done. Even if he does not get his presumed entitlement of four more years, he has two more months to trash his frat house of a presidency before turning it over to the next administration. That means more executive orders like the recent ones that opened upAlaska is Tongass National Forest to logging and removed workplace protections from federal civil servants. If Biden manages to take his place in the Oval Office, he will likely face a Republican-controlled Senate that will block his every move, just like Republicans adopted ano-compromise position after the election of Barack Obama. Certainly, Biden aims to reverse many of Trump is executive orders with his own ones. That will work in the foreign policy realm, for instance recommitting the USs to the Paris climate accords. But any domestic orders will face court challenges, and suddenly the Republican Party is strategy of pushing through an unprecedented number of federal judges takes on an even more ominous cast. Popular will be damned. The Republicans will rely on senators, lawyers and judges to institutionalize Trump is legacy. Unlike 2008, the Democrats will be hard-pressed this time to claim an overwhelming popular mandate after such a close election. Trump voters, meanwhile, are not going away. They will continue showing up with guns. They will refuse to wear masks. They will spread fake news and outlandish conspiracy the ories. They will also challenge the federal government — now led by an adversary, not an ally — at every turn. Remember the 2016 standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, when a bunch of right-wing extremists seized government property and faced off against law enforcement? Expect an up tick in outright confrontations between federalists and anti-federalists during Biden is presidency. Let is face it: The democracy that Donald Trump dropped on the floor suffered a great deal from the experience. It is going to take more than an election to put it right. We rely on your support for our independence, diversity and quality. Per MonthJoe Biden offers a reset to the Obama years — a bronze age at best, but one that at least... The international community is happy that the American people have taken down the world is biggest bully. Authoritarianism has been on the march for years, but people-powered revolutions are pushing regimes toward democracy on nearly every continent.",1,1,Fair Observer
369,"After a plea to combat antisemitism, the White House convened a meeting with Jewish leaders",-2.33,45.33,https://forward.com/fast-forward/470282/combat-antisemitism-biden-white-house-convened-meeting-jewish-leaders/,https://adfontesmedia.com/forward-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-25,25,"Image by Getty ImagesWASHINGTON (JTA) — The letter went out at midday Friday, from five major Jewish organizations, asking President Joe Biden to “use your bully pulpit to call out antisemitism” in the wake of a spike in attacks on Jews since the launch of the latest Israel-Hamas conflict. By 8 a.m. Monday, Biden was at his Twitter bully pulpit, saying “the recent attacks on the Jewish community are despicable, and they must stop.”At 4 p.m. the same day, representatives of all five organizations were on a video conference call with top staffers at the White House and the Department of Homeland Security. The participants were knocked back by the immediacy of the response.“You know, the next business day after the letter was sent, they brought a good group of key officials together who are really substantive,” said Elana Broitman, the director of the Jewish Federations of North America is Washington office, who attended the meeting. The White House would not comment and the three Jewish officials who returned the Jewish Telegraphic Agency is calls did not feel comfortable describing what the White House officials said, or naming on the record who was present. The White House did not return a request for comment. The groups that sent the letter and which were represented at the meeting in addition to the JFNA are the Orthodox Union, the American Jewish Committee, the Anti-Defamation League and Hadassah. The participants said that each of the five requests they made was addressed during the meeting. These included nominating an antisemitism monitor at the State Department, naming a Jewish liaison, convening a summit on antisemitism, adding funds to secure non profits and keeping in place an executive order by President Donald Trump that combats antisemitism on campuses. The last request, having to do with Trump is executive order, could stir controversy. Some liberal groups, including a number of Jewish ones,have expressed concern that it targets legitimate Israel criticism, and Biden has shown a tendency to purge Trump is more controversial executive orders.“We went through the specifics that we did raise in our letter, and they were certainly open to all of those things and indicated that they were all good suggestions and they are working on the things that we raised,” said Nathan Diament, the Washington director for the Orthodox Union.“We should not take for granted the importance of the president recognizing that America has a problem with antisemitic violence and President Biden recognizes that action is required to protect Jewish communities and rollback the rise in hate against religious and ethnic minorities, over the short and long term,” said Karen Paikin Barall, the Washington director for Hadassah. The groups are convening a virtual rally on Thursday to combat antisemitism, which they say will include top lawmakers from both parties in Congress and from the Biden administration. Broitman said the meeting was likely the first of many.“I was left with the impression that more meetings and more steps to come,” she said. ",2,1,Forward
370,"Rey Rivera is friend, former Baltimore employer pushes back on Netflix is ‘Unsolved Mysteries'",0.0,45.0,https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-cr-rey-rivera-netflix-inaccuracies-20200805-zxmiq4ppp5euxhbcm23ksgezva-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/baltimore-sun-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,24,"The former employer of Rey Rivera is pushing back on his portrayal in Netflix is popular “Unsolved Mysteries” reboot, which raised questions about his involvement in Rivera is 2006 death. Porter Stansberry, who has not spoken publicly about the case since the first days of Rivera is disappearance, told The Baltimore Sun that he was “shocked and hurt” by the show is insinuations.“The reason I have never commented about Rey is death publicly first and foremost is because I never thought there was any mystery about why or how he died,” Stansberry, who runs an investment newsletter business, said in a phone interview. Rivera, 32, was missing for a week before his body was found in a room at the base of the Belvedere Hotel, having apparently crashed through the roof after a fall. The episode hitNetflixon July 1, and people interviewed for the show, including Rivera is brother, Rivera is wife, and the retired Baltimore homicide detective who worked the case in its first weeks, said Stansberry refused to cooperate with police and instructed his employees not totalk to detectives. The episode never accuses Stansberry of foul play, but viewers were clearly pointed to Stansberry as a shadowy figure who existed off screen and might know more than he was saying.“It is completely untrue,” Stansberry said of the claims. “I did everything I could to help,” he said, including meeting with a detective in late June 2006.“He had every opportunity to say this,” Rivera is widow, Allison, told The Sun regarding Stansberry previously not commenting. They have not spoken since June 2006, she said. “The fact is: [Rivera is death is] truly a mystery. There is just no answers.”But a second friend, Brad Hoppmann, who said he knew Rey Rivera since childhood and remained close with him up until his death, also believes the story has been twisted.“This is a real conversation the world can have about mental illness and help people get help when they need it,” Hoppmann said, “and it turned into a murder mystery where they are accusing people of being involved.”Netflix did not respond to repeated messages sent to its public relations department, and the producers did not respond to messages sent through its website. Riverawent missing on May 16, 2006, and a guest at his North Baltimore home said he darted out and never returned. Three the n-co-workers discovered a hole in a sub-roof of the Belvedere Hotel in Mid-Town, and Rivera is battered and decomposing body was found inside. The mystery of his death was covered in the media at the time and was the subject of a 2018 book, “An Unexplained Death: The True Story of a Body at the Belvedere,” by local author Mikita Brottman. The show presents questions about how Rivera could have accessed the building is roof, while his family members say he was not suicidal and did not have any known mental illness. His cell phone and glasses were found on the roof, relatively undamaged, which a retired homicide detective who worked the case said appeared “staged” to him. An engraved money clip he carried was never located. Rivera also left behind a note, which contains strange comments including references to Freemasons and Stanley Kubrick. “I stand before you a man who understands the purpose and value of our secrets,” it says. Though police said the circumstances pointed to a likely suicide, the medical examiner is office ruled the death “undetermined,” saying there was not enough information to render a conclusion about whether it was a homicide, suicide or accident. Rivera is case was featured as the first episode of the new season of “Unsolved Mysteries,”and reached Number 1 trending on Netflix, leading to discussion and speculation on social media. Stansberry said he has received death threats, and his family has been harassed online. He said he is even been questioned by friends and potential business partners.“It is horrific,” Stansberry said. “You ca not even imagine what it is like to tell people I had nothing to do with my friend is death.”Stansberry and Rivera went to high school together in California and were water polo teammates. Rivera, an aspiring screenwriter, had moved from Los Angeles with his wife to take what Stansberry says was an entry-level position at his company writing a financial newsletter called the “Rebound Report.”When Rivera went missing, Stansberry said, he hired a private investigator, offered a reward and personally helped look for Rivera. Once the body was found, Stansberry said this week, “we were all sad and shocked by the fact that Rey killed himself, but once we saw all the facts and his financial pressures, it was not much of a mystery.”In the show, retired Baltimore homicide detective Michael Baier and Rivera is wife say that after Rivera is body was found, Stansberry refused to return calls from investigators and put a “gag order” on employees to keep them from talking.“It is completely a lie,” Stansberry said. “It is not a matter of opinion. It is a lie.”He said only that employees were told to refer media inquiries to a spokesperson. He said he personally spoke with a detective on June 23, 2006, which was after Baier was reassigned and when another detective, Marvin Sydnor, had the case. Sydnor did not return a call seeking comment Tuesday, but Stansberry is attorney Charles Curlett said he had spoken with him recently. Allison Rivera said Tuesday that her information about Stansberry not cooperating came from Baier. Stansberry says the show is wrong that Rivera worked for him at the time of his death and that Rivera had left the job six months earlier on his own accord.“He resigned voluntarily — no ill will. He said he did not want to write in the newsletter world anymore” but did not have a solid next move lined up, Stansberry said. At the time, Stansberry is company was being sued by the Securities and Exchange Commissionfor selling fraudulent stock tips to investors in 2002, before Rivera joined the company. After a trial in 2005, US District Judge Marvin Garbis ruled in 2007 that “Stansberry is conduct undoubtedly involved deliberate fraud, making statements that he knew to be false,” and issued a $1.5 million fine. Stansberry said the re is no connection to those proceedings and Rivera. Of particular interest in Rivera is case is who placed a phone call to him that apparently precipitated him leaving his home. Allison Rivera has said the call came from the switchboard of Agora Publishing, and the specific caller could not be determined. Agora, a global publishing company headquartered in Baltimore, has several subsidiary companies, including Stanberry is, and at the time all calls routed through a main switchboard. A police spokeswoman on Tuesday said the call came from an “owned subsidiary company of Agora Publishing,” but declined to provide additional details, saying it was an open investigation. Stansberry asserts that while the call might have come from someone at Agora — he says Rivera was doing freelance work for another Agora subsidiary after leaving Stanberry is firm — it could not have come from his company.“Every person in our company who had worked with Rey was on the Eastern Shore at the time that call was made, having a corporate retreat in St. Michael is,” Stansberry said. “No one in my company was in town when Rey disappeared. The idea we were calling him from our switchboard is ridiculous.”Stansberry said Rivera had also asked him previously if he was in leadership of the Freemasons, which Stansberry said he thought was a joke. He said when Rivera is family and friends were searching for him, Rivera is wife told him that the Saturday before he went missing, Rivera was “morose and would not get out of bed.”“She told me she was very worried about his mental state at the time he disappeared,” Stansberry said. “I am not the only friend Rey approached and said things that were very odd.”Allison Rivera has said that her husband was in good spirits, though anxious about work. She said Tuesday that she could not recall if she had such a conversation with Stansberry. Hoppmann, Rey Rivera is childhood friend, said not long before his death Rey repeatedly asked him about being a member of the Freemasons and discussing the film “Eyes Wide Shut.”Hoppmann, who also worked for Stansberry at one time but says they are not close, said the week before his death Rivera asked to be able to visit his to p-floor apartment in Jersey City alone. Rivera had a key to the place, but the n returned it.“He was acting really, really weird,” Hoppmann said. Brottman, the author of the 2018 book about Rivera is death and a resident of the Belvedere, said the Netflix show interviewed her for hours, and that she told them the roof was easily accessed, and not a difficult task to reach as the show asserted. In her book, she explores the various the ories and concludes that Rivera likely had a mental break and jumped from the roof.“I think if they’d included my interviews it would have closed down a lot of speculation because it would have been obvious that a lot of avenues and angles had already been explored at length,” Brottman wrote on Reddit. Stansberry said the case is being sensationalized.“I think what is really sad about this is that there are people in Hollywood who will do anything to craft a story to get attention, even when it comes to destroying someone is reputation and trying to sensationalize the tragedy of a death of a 32-year old man,” Stansberry said.",2,2,Baltimore Sun
371,We Need Help': Haiti is Interim Leader Requests US Troops,0.0,43.33,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/haiti-president-killed/2021/07/10/id/1028149/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"Haiti is interim government has asked the US and UN to deploy troops to protect key infrastructure as it tries to stabilize the country and prepare for elections in the aftermath of President Jovenel Moïse is assassination. Amid the confusion, hundreds of Haitians gathered outside the US Embassy in Port-au-Prince pleading for a way out of the country. Women carried babies and young men waved passports and ID cards as they cried out, “Refuge!” and “Help!”“We definitely need assistance and we have asked our international partners for help,” Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph told The Associated Press in a phone interview late Friday. “We believe our partners can assist the national police in resolving the situation.”The stunning request for US military support recalled the tumult following Haiti is last presidential assassination, in 1915, when an angry mob dragged President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam out of the French Embassy and beat him to death. In response, President Woodrow Wilson sent the Marines into Haiti, justifying the American military occupation — which lasted nearly two decades — as a way to avert anarchy. The request was received but there has been no decision, according to a US official familiar, speaking on condition of anonymity because not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. But the Biden administration has so far given no indication it will provide military assistance. For now, it only plans to send FBI officials to help investigate a crime that has plunged Haiti, a country already wracked by gaping poverty and gang violence, into a destabilizing battle for power and constitutional standoff. Haiti also sent a letter to the UN requesting assistance, UN deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Saturday. The letter asked for troops and security at key installations, according to a UN source speaking on condition of anonymity because details of the letter are private. On Friday, a group of lawmakers announced they had recognized Joseph Lambert, the head of Haiti is dismantled senate, as provisional president in a direct challenge to the interim government is authority. They also recognized as prime minister Ariel Henry, whom Moïse had selected to replace Joseph a day before he was killed but who had not yet taken office or formed a government. One of those lawmakers, Rosemond Pradel, told the AP that Joseph “is neither qualified nor has the legal right” to lead the country. Joseph expressed dismay that others would try to take advantage of Moïse is murder for political gain.“I am not interested in a power struggle,” said Joseph, who assumed leadership with the backing of police and the military. “There is only one way people can become president in Haiti. And that is through elections.”Meanwhile, more details emerged of a killing that increasingly has taken the air of an murky, international conspiracy: a shootout with gunmen holed up in a foreign embassy, a private security firm operating out of a warehouse in Miami and a cameo sighting of a Hollywood star. Among those arrested are two Haitian Americans, including one who worked alongside Sean Penn following the nation is devastating 2010 earthquake. Police have also detained or killed more than a dozen former members of Colombia is military. Some of the suspects were seized in a raid on Taiwan is Embassy where they are believed to have sought refuge. National Police Chief Léon Charles said another eight suspects were still at large and being sought. The attack, which took place at Moïse is home before dawn Wednesday, also seriously wounded his wife, who was flown to Miami for surgery. She issued a statement Saturday implying the president was killed for trying to develop the country. “The mercenaries who assassinated the president are currently behind bars,” she said in Creole, “but other mercenaries currently want to kill his dream, his vision, his ideology.”Colombian officials said the men were recruited by four companies and traveled to the Caribbean nation in two groups via the Dominican Republic. US-trained Colombian soldiers are often recruited by security firms and mercenary armies in conflict zones because of their experience in a decades-long war against leftist rebels and drug cartels. The sister of one of the dead suspects, Duberney Capador, told the AP that she last spoke to her brother late Wednesday — hours after Moïse is murder — when the men, holed up in a home and surrounded, were desperately trying to negotiate their way out of a shootout.“He told me not to tell our mother, so she would not worry,” said Yenny Capador, fighting back tears. It is not known who masterminded the attack. And questions remain about how the perpetrators were able to penetrate the president is residence posing as US Drug Enforcement Administration agents, meeting little resistance from those charged with protecting the president. Capador said her brother, who retired from the Colombian army in 2019 with the rank of sergeant, was hired by a private security firm with the understanding he would be providing protection for powerful individuals in Haiti. Capador said she knew almost nothing about the employer but shared a picture of her brother in a uniform emblazoned with the logo of CTU Security — a company based in Doral, a Miami suburb popular with Colombian migrants. The wife of Francisco Uribe, who was among those arrested, told Colombia is W Radio that CTU offered to pay the men about $2,700 a month — a paltry sum for a dangerous international mission but far more than what most of the men, noncommissioned officers and professional soldiers, earned from their pensions. Uribe is under investigation in the alleged murder of an unarmed civilian in 2008 who was presented as someone killed in combat, one of thousands of extrajudicial killings that rocked Colombia is US-trained army more than a decade ago. CTU Security was registered in 2008 and lists as its president Antonio Intriago, who is also affiliated with several other Florida-registered entities, some since dissolved, including the Counter Terrorist Unit Federal Academy, the Venezuelan American National Council and Doral Food Corp. CTU is web site lists two addresses, one of which is a gray-colored warehouse that was shuttered Friday with no sign indicating who it belonged to. The other is a small suite under a different company is name in a modern office building a few blocks away. A receptionist said Intriago stops by every few days to collect mail and hold meetings. Intriago, who is Venezuelan, did not return phone calls and an email seeking comment.“We are the ones who are most interested in clarifying what happened, so that my brother is reputation does not remain like it is,” said Capador. “He was a humble, hard-working man. He had honors and decorations.""Besides the Colombians, among those detained by police were two Haitian Americans. Investigative Judge Clément Noël told Le Nouvelliste that the arrested Americans, James Solages and Joseph Vincent, said the attackers originally planned only to arrest Moïse, not kill him. Noël said Solages and Vincent were acting as translators for the attackers, the newspaper reported Friday. Solages, 35, described himself as a “certified diplomatic agent,” an advocate for children and budding politician on a now-removed web site for a charity he started in 2019 in south Florida to assist resident of his Haitian hometown of Jacmel. He worked briefly as a driver and bodyguard for a relief organization set up by Penn following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed 300,000 Haitians and left tens of thousands homeless. He also lists as past employers the Canadian Embassy in Haiti. His now-deactivated Facebook page features photos of armored military vehicles and a shot of himself standing in front of an American flag. Calls to the charity and Solages’ associates went unanswered. However, a relative in south Florida said Solages does not have any military training and does not believe he was involved in the killing. Joseph refused to specify who was behind the attack, but said that Moïse had earned numerous enemies while attacking oligarchs who for years profited from overly generous state contracts. Some of those elite insiders are now the focus of investigators, with authorities asking that presidential candidate and businessman Reginald Boulos and former Senate President Youri Latortue meet with prosecutors next week for questioning. No further details were provided and none of the men have been charged. Analysts say whoever plotted the brazen attack likely had ties to a criminal underworld that has flourished in recent years as corruption and drug trafficking have become entrenched. The growing power of gangs displaced more than 14,700 people in Haiti last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.“This country has nothing to offer,” said 36-year-old Thermidor Joam, one of those thronged outside the US Embassy on Friday. “If the president can be killed with his own security, I have no protection whatsoever if someone wants to kill me.”Prosecutors also want to interrogate members of Moïse is security detail, including the president is security coordinator, Jean Laguel Civil, and Dimitri Hérard, the head of the General Security Unit of the National Palace.“If you are responsible for the president is security, where have you been?,” Port-au-Prince prosecutor Bed-Ford Claude was quoted as telling French-language newspaper Le Nouvelliste. “What did you do to avoid this fate for the president?”",1,0,Newsmax

My own church has a stone structure by a creek in Johnson City, Tennessee. We know that the first Christians here baptized believers in that water and worshiped together on the banks, nearly 200 years ago, before building the fellowship hall and sanctuary with stone and stained glass. Around town, I see churches that meet in storefronts, in renovated factories, and one above an upscale barbecue joint. There are big, towering church buildings on the main streets downtown and, further out, churches with wide, rolling, golf-course-worthy lawns. There is a clapboard church tucked into a hill where they painted over the word, and now, in slightly unsteady freehand, the sign saysHoliness. There  is a church with a gazebo pulpit in an expansive parking lot, built for drive-in worship; another with space designated for a taco truck; another where the windows have been covered up; and another that looks like a giant Hershey is kiss. At each of these places, Christians sing and socialize, pray and think about their lives—what they love and what they should love—and they listen to the Word of the Lord. None of these places, unfortunately, appear in Allan Doig isA History of the Church through Its Buildings. The “church” of the title turns out to be incredibly narrow, the “history” even narrower. Charlemagne is crowned emperor six times in these pages, while Martin Luther shows up only once, critiquing the funding mechanism for the construction of St. Peter is in Rome. There are no Puritans in the book, despite their intense opinions about church buildings. No Pentecostals, despite their radical reimagining of sacred space. There is only one mention of Baptists, and that is a passing reference in an extended quotation. Nor does Doig is scope extend to Africa, Latin America, North America, or Asia (with the exception of a brief mention of Jesuit missionaries to Japan). The book discusses 12 buildings: three in Rome, six elsewhere in Europe, two in Istanbul, and one in Jerusalem. These are all churches one might see on a humanities tour with a liberal arts college—tourist attractions and World Heritage sites. In fact,A History of the Church through Its Buildingswould be perfect for that kind of trip. Doig, a recently retired chaplain for a college at Oxford University, frequently describes the best way to approach these historic buildings. In Aachen, Germany, for example, he recommends “coming round the eastern end of the Rathaus … from the market square past the” a tower, for the best view of the Basilica of the Holy Mother of God. In Istanbul, Doig suggests taking the tram to the Hagia Sophia, since it “closely follows the ceremonial route of the emperor, from the former site of the Hebdomon military grounds near the airport, via the Golden Gate, past the fora and on to the milion, the marker from which all distances in the Byzantine empire were measured.”The book also focuses its explanations on why each building exists, enlisting history as necessary to explicate a structure is particular size, shape, and composition. Rather than using the churches to illuminate the history of the church, it is the reverse. For example, Doig does not show how the Basilica of St. Vincent, in Cordoba, Spain, sheds light on Arianism, the Christological heresy that dominated in Spain at the time of its construction. Instead, he offers Arianism as the explanation for the location of the cathedral, as a sixth-century king of Hispania moved the bishop is seat in an attempt to unite and reform Arian Christianity. After Arianism was condemned at the Council of Toledo in 589, the Roman Catholic Pope Gregory attempted to secure the orthodoxy of the church with a series of gifts, including purported relics of Christ is cross, Peter is chains, and John the Baptist is hair. But since the structure was built before the Roman influence was well established, the Cordoba church has “a four-bay nave with side-aisles, transepts, and chapels to either side of the sanctuary.”As the narrative moves on, it becomes clear that for the author, “Why does this church have a four-bay nave with side-aisles, transepts, and chapels to either side of the sanctuary?” was the most interesting question to be asked. The book is deepest insight into church history is that the structures always reveal something about a church is relationship to power. While churches are set apart as houses of God and places of prayer, they are never entirely apart. Each structure has a place in a legal regime, an economic order, and a political system. Sometimes, in fact, the church is the symbolic foundation of state power. The Abbey of Saint-Denis, in Paris, for example, was rebuilt by King Pepin the Short and finished by his son Charlemagne to sanctify their replacement of the Merovingian royal line. Father and son were both buried in Saint-Denis, as were all but three of the subsequent kings of France and many other monarchs. The church—set apart—served a crucial function in the construction of the idea of the French state.“As a space for the performance of the rituals of kingship,” Doig observes, “no other could compete with Saint-Denis.”My church is building in East Tennessee certainly does not compete with Saint-Denis on this count, though it too reveals a relationship with power. The property lines have put limits on our expansion over the years. On Sundays, worshipers have to park in a neighbor is lot, requiring us to take care to maintain that relationship. Last year, we used COVID-19 relief funds to pay the utilities for the building we mostly did not use during the pandemic. As I readA History of the Church through Its Buildings, though, my mind turned to the relationships that Doig does not explore. A church building arranges a congregation is relationship to baptism, Communion, and preaching. It is in the design phase that a church decides whether the pulpit will be in the center or off to the side, whether or not there will be a fixed structure for serving the Lord is Supper, and how new Christians will be buried with Christ and raised with him. The building also structures the relationship between the church and its music. Sometimes worship leaders are literally spotlighted, but I have also prayed in a church, converted from a house, where the music came from another room. It felt like eavesdropping on the morning is hymns. The building can physically represent church hierarchy—saving a seat for a bishop, offering an exclusive entrance for the senior pastor, or setting up a greenroom for a guest speaker. A church also organizes a congregation is relationship to itself. In Doig is own Church of England, the re is a huge difference between buildings with fixed pews and buildings with movable chairs. Some congregations sit in a circle while they worship. Here in Tennessee, it is not uncommon to bury the deceased behind the church building, until the Resurrection. The building may be passed down to us through the generations—along with the faith itself—so that as we worship on a Sunday, we also realize we are taking care of something that we ourselves did not build and that we will one day leave to others. The church, in the end, is not a building. But it does have them. And the history of the church happens, in part, through buildings. That history should not be limited to buildings that attract tourists and World Heritage designations. If we learn to look carefully at even the humblest churches, we can see a record of relationships and traces of the faithful witness of believers before us who used these buildings to sing and pray, live their faith, and receive and proclaim God is good news.

375,‘I am Not Changing My Mind’: New York Fires Unvaccinated Health-Care Workers,-3.67,45.33,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/09/new-york-fires-unvaccinated-health-care-workers.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2021-09-30,25,"On Tuesday morning, hours after New York isvaccine mandate for health-care workers went into effect, Deborah Conrad was pretty sure she’d lost her job. The 46-year-old physician is assistant, who works at United Memorial Medical Center in Batavia, has refused to get the shot and was one of tens of thousands of unvaccinated New Yorkers whose employment hung in the balance after the state is order went into effect at midnight. Conrad is co-worker told her she was no longer on the schedule for next week and her email seemed to have been shut off.“I am assuming I am no longer employed. It is my understanding that there is no notice or letter going out,” said Conrad. A spokesperson from Rochester Regional Health, the system that operates Conrad is hospital, said that 99 percent of its employees had complied with the mandate, but did not respond to questions about firings. Conrad said that she would not let the mandate influence her decision not to get the shot. “A lot of people I work with felt forced into getting vaccinated. But I am not changing my mind. I am not better off than any of the m, I just feel very strongly.”On Wednesday,Governor Kathy Hochul is office indicated that a major crisis had been averted at hospitals, some of which prepared for a staff shortage. In a press release, the governor is office said no facility has closed because of the requirement. Catholic Health system in Western New York postponed a number of elective surgeries on Monday while it assessed its staffing levels, but by the end of the day the system had achieved 100 percent compliance with the mandate, according to a spokesperson for the network, and dodged being short-staffed. On Thursday, Albany Medical Centertold Spectrum Newsit closed two emergency urgent care centers temporarily in order to reallocate staff to its main campus. The state is largest health care employer, Northwell Health, was the first to confirm that it had fired about two dozen managers on Monday for not getting the shot. While Northwell, which employs 76,000 people statewide, has begun the process of firing the rest of its unvaccinated staff, it would not provide numbers on just how many workers it would lose. Erie County Medical Center had suspended about five percent of its hospital workforce, or 176 employees, in addition to 100 staff members at its long-term care facility. The employees will have 30 days to comply with the mandate before they are fired, according to a spokesperson. Hochul has said that health care workers fired for refusing the vaccine will not be eligible for unemployment insurance without a valid accommodation signed by a doctor. Hochul had declared a state of emergency and said that she would deploy National Guard troops with medical training to help at hospitals across the state Monday night, if necessary. After a last-minute surge that inoculated 3,000 public hospital employees, Mayor Bill de Blasio said that roughly 10 percent of the city is public-hospital workforce, or about 5,000 people, remained unvaccinated and were not allowed to work. (On Monday, a federal appeals court ruled that the city ismandatefor nearly all public-school employees can proceed. De Blasio gave them until the end of the day on Friday to get at least one dose of the vaccine or else they would be suspended without pay come next week.)The state is mandate has seemed to push up vaccination rates. Statewide 87 percent of hospital workers have received at least one dose, up from 84 percent last week, but lower than the governor is initial estimate of 92 percent. Nursing homes, however, did hit 92 percent compliance, up from 70 percent when the mandate was first announced in August. Staff at home care and hospice need to be vaccinated by October 7 or else they too will face termination. While most states have resisted implementing mandates, health-care workers in Rhode Island, Oregon, Maine, and Washington, DC, are also now required to be vaccinated. On Monday, a hospital system in Delaware said that it had fired 150 people for not complying, according to the. Novant Health hospital system in North Carolina said that it had fired 175 employees, according to theAssociated Press. New York is health-care mandate is facing at least eight lawsuits. Last week a federal judge in Utica issued a temporary restraining order that allowed health-care workers with religious exemptions to continue working until at least October 12. Jillian Dobrzenski, a 34-year-old nurse at Catholic Health, is among those who have a religious exemption, but said that her choice to remain unvaccinated was based on a range of factors, including that she had COVID last December. If the religious exemption is not extended beyond October 12, Catholic Health said unvaccinated employees will be placed on unpaid leave for 30 days, after which their employment will be terminated.“I am not ready to not be a nurse anymore and this would basically eliminate me from being a nurse in the entire state,” Dobrzenski said. “We would probably be okay on savings for at least a handful of months. After that, I already have an RN license to work in the state of Florida and it looks more and more each day like we will probably end up selling our house and moving.”",2,1,New York Magazine
376,An uncomfortable $15 minimum wage column,4.0,38.67,https://www.al.com/opinion/2021/02/an-uncomfortable-15-minimum-wage-column.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-com-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-07,24,"President Joe Biden is pushing to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 as part of another COVID-19 relief package. Republicans have sounded the alarm, and Democrats do not see why their political counterparts refuse to see the wage hike as an unmitigated good. Like most policy issues, it is more complicated than the partisan spin makes it sound. The wage hike will not result in $38 burritos at Taco Bell. The restaurant chain confirmed as much to Politifact, “At our company-owned restaurants in New York City, where the minimum wage is $15 an hour, our Bean Burrito is $1.89 plus tax and Crunchwrap Supreme is $4.49 plus tax.” Rest easy. Mandatory wage increases do not necessarily result in massively expensive heartburn delivery mechanisms. The minimum wage does have a practical impact on hiring decisions. It is the lowest entry point to engage labor. If an employer needs someone to sweep and mop the floors, it might be worth hiring someone at $7.25 an hour for the task. At $15 dollars an hour, the manager might allocate the task across several existing employees and not hire anyone. Their workload goes up, but it is not clear that pay would follow, especially if those workers are already above the minimum wage threshold. That may not be a problem for a large retailer like Amazon that already pays higher wages, but it definitely forces tough choices for smaller employers. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has studied various minimum wage proposals, and both Democrats and Republicans like to cherry pick the information that fits their respective narratives. Yes, the CBO does find that “1.3 million workers who would otherwise be employed would be jobless” under a $15 minimum wage. It also concludes “the $15 option would increase the wages of 17 million workers whose wages would otherwise be below $15 per hour.” The report determines that overall family income would slightly decrease. It is almost as if economic realities do not respond conveniently to political narratives. Hiking the minimum wage does mean higher pay for millions of workers, but it also means that up to 3.7 million (the CBO is high-end estimate) might lose their jobs. That is the real tradeoff we are talking about. Supporters of a higher minimum wage should stop acting like it is an unmitigated good, and opponents ought to be honest that it would absolutely increase incomes for some lower-income workers. But what about the machines?We have all seen the mem es of various automated ordering kiosks being the “new” $15 minimum wage employee. Saavy businesses will always look for more efficient operational choices, but that does not always hurt workers. A 2017 McKinsey & Company study found, “employment and productivity both grew in 95 percent of rolling three-year periods and 100 percent of rolling 10-year periods since 1960.” In other words, technological advances across American history have not meant fewer jobs. Amazon is Alexa is nice, but she ca not fill the shoes of the average Chick-fil-A employee with a smile on her face. While the minimum wage is billed as an effort to address poverty, income inequality is the real problem. According to CBO, average household income after federal taxes and means-tested federal program transfers was $35,900 for the lowest 20% and $229,700 for the highest. That is a big difference, and it expands rapidly towards the opposing ends of the income spectrum. It might seem strange for a conservative to discuss income inequality, but it is essential to protect a free marketplace. Absolute wage equality would remove powerful incentives to work hard and take economic risks, but being mindful about corporate income distribution is smart politics. Members of Congress who champion free markets should encourage. When companies take care of their workers in terms of benefits and do what they can to increase take home pay, workers thrive, their families are better off, and the average worker has an incentive to defend an employer against government encroachment. Progressives tend to take a more skeptical view that corporations will almost always prioritize shareholders over employees. When businesses do not focus sufficiently on workers, their lives are more difficult. When laborers see the handful of folks at the top of the organization chart with fat pockets, politicians have a far easier time promoting the mselves as champions of the little guy with a government cudgel. Thinking of the minimum wage in that context puts some options on the table. If the pain point is mostly for small businesses, why not offset the minimum wage increase with a corresponding tax reduction for the entities most economically harmed by it? If the logic is that the increase makes lower-income Americans less reliant on government social services, it is a tradeoff that might make sense. Better yet, simplify and expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and let most average families keep more of the money they already earn. The uncomfortable reality is that increasing the minimum wage to $15 is not as impactful at creating entry-level jobs, moving people out of poverty, or helping families thrive as we’d like it to be. If we want to make real progress on those issues, we must expect more from our elected employees in Congress who make a lot more than the bare minimum.

Arrest warrants issued August 26 led to the arrests of Antwane Moseley, 39, and Taunisha Whyte, 27, both of Las Vegas. Las Vegas police said they were called at 2:34 a.m. August 15 to an apartment complex on the 4900 block of Dean Martin Drive. A woman told police she was pistol-whipped, beaten, choked and sexually assaulted by Moseley because she refused his demands to work as a prostitute.“Moseley wanted her to go out onto Tropicana Boulevard and work as a prostitute for him to make money so he could pay the hotel, get his items out of pawn and have money to spend,” police wrote in the warrants. The woman said she was punched, beaten with a phone and choked to the point of unconsciousness. She accused Whyte of punching and biting her, the n participating in efforts to keep her from leaving. She escaped when her assailants fell asleep. Police were called when a security officer found the partially clothed woman running through the complex and yelling for help. Las Vegas Justice Court records show Moseley is charged with seven felonies, including sex assault, kidnapping, sex trafficking of an adult, conspiracy, battery by strangulation and domestic battery. Whyte is charged with sex trafficking of an adult, conspiracy to commit sex trafficking and first-degree kidnapping. Both suspects are scheduled to appear Sept. 10 in Las Vegas Justice Court.

A 20-foot-tall wall of water could be unleashed in minutes if the wall surrounding a phosphate wastewater pond breaches, a Manatee County government official said Sunday. About 306 million gallons of polluted saltwater remain in the reservoir that began leaking last week, Manatee County Administrator Scott Hopes said. At a news conference on Sunday morning, Hope said up to a 20-foot wall of water could form in less than an hour, based on models, if the pond breached. The pond was once used to store waste from a plant at the site that turned phosphate into fertilizer. Officials in Manatee County on Florida is Gulf Coast ordered residents of more than 300 homes near the site to evacuate immediately Saturday.""What we are looking at now is trying to prevent — and respond to if need be — a catastrophic flood issue,"" Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said at the Sunday morning briefing. DeSantis said the water is not radioactive, even though the gypsum stack that the pond sits on is mildly radioactive. The governor said the water is mostly saltwater from a dredging project years ago and the ""process water"" from the old fertilizer plant. That process water is high in phosphorus and nitrogen, nutrients that can cause algae blooms in rivers and bays. Much of the water has already been drained into Port Manatee, which sits at the mouth of Tampa Bay. DeSantis said pumps are sending 33 million gallons a day from the pond to the bay. He also said the Florida National Guard is flying more pumps to the top of the gypsum berm around the pond to pump more water. DeSantis and Noah Valenstein, the secretary of Florida is Department of Environmental Protection, said flooding is the biggest danger to the public now. Valenstein the primary focus is on directing a controlled discharge to an area where it will have the least impact. At a county news conference at 2 p.m. Sunday, Vanessa Baugh, chairman of the Manatee County Commission, said, ""Steady draw down of the process water has continued at Piney Point, and we have thankfully avoided uncontrolled breach that would have endangered people and property in the evacuation zone around the stacks.""Baugh also said drinking water in Manatee County and the town of Palmetto remained unaffected by the breach at the pond. She said the county utility system was a closed system and water from the pond could not enter it. She also said the county is main source of drinking water, Lake Manatee, was not affected. She added that private wells near Piney Point also should remain safe. Hopes, the county administrator, said at the afternoon news conference that the additional pumps should double the amount of water that can be pumped from the pond. He said if the work continues as it is going now, the danger might be over by Tuesday. On Saturday, Hopes said attempts to plug the breach overnight with dirt and stone failed.""Evacuate area NOW Collapse of Piney Point Stack Imminent!"" read the alert from county officials about 11 a.m. Saturday.“There has been further motion with the wall,” Manatee County Public Safety Director Jacob Saur told the Bradenton Herald. “We have ordered further evacuations and closed US 41.”2020 Hurricane Season Had One Fewer Landfall Than Previously Thought)Hopes said officials think the water would flow to the north of the pond across low-lying areas and down into Tampa Bay. The collapse could also threaten other retention ponds on the site, Hopes said. DeSantis declared a state of emergency for Manatee County about 1:45 p.m. Saturday. He later expanded it to include neighboring Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. Officials first discovered a tear Thursday in the reservoir, which contained about 800 million gallons of water and waste products from the manufacture of fertilizer from phosphate, according to the Bradenton Herald. The pond breached about 4 p.m. Friday, leaking water that contains phosphorus and nitrogen. Residents within a half mile of the reservoir, which is owned by HRK Holdings, were warned to evacuate. The evacuation order was expanded to residents living within 1 mile of the old plant about 7:20 p.m. Friday. Saturday evening, officials added another 316 homes and several more businesses to the evacuation area, according to WTVT.“What has been occurring in the past 12 hours is there are a number of small breaches in addition to what we believe is a significant leak at the bottom of the retention pond,” Hopes said earlier in the day. Officials tried to reduce the risk of a collapse by draining the wastewater. DeSantis said Sunday those pumps were pumping 23,500 gallons a minute, into nearby Tampa Bay. Hopes said additional pumps were pumping about 1,500 gallons a minute into the bay. The pond sits in large mound that is known as a gypsum stack that is made of phosphogypsum, a byproduct of the fertilizer made at the plant from the 1966 until 2001. Most of the naturally occurring radioactive uranium, thorium and radium in phosphate rock ends up in the phosphogypsum, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The uranium and thorium decay to radium, and radium decays to radon, a radioactive gas. The wastewater inside the pond at the top of the stack is a mixture of seawater from an old dredging project, rainwater and the leftovers from fertilizer manufacturing that can carry phosphorus and nitrogen, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Hopes said Saturday afternoon that snook live in the pond that is in danger of collapsing and he has seen ducks swimming on top of it. Two other ponds on the site have higher levels of the byproducts, he said.""The risk factor is the potential release of nearly 1 billion gallons of water,"" Hopes said. Wastewater from previous leaks at other gypsum stacks have caused fish kills and algae blooms. Phosphorus and nitrogen are nutrients that feed algae blooms and red tide. Matthew Pasek, a geoscience professor at the University of South Florida, told Axios that releasing the water would affect Tampa Bay.""Algae blooms followed by fish kills are the most likely thing,"" Pasek said. ""It is going to impact the food chain further down the line too. It is unlikely to cause human damage, but the re is going to be a pretty stinky bay for a while.""The old Piney Point phosphate plant has threatened Tampa Bay before when polluted discharges flowed from the property, the Times reported.“We have certainly had similar concerns in the past but I think that this one is magnified because now we have the owners of the stack admitting that the re is a real possibility of a total collapse,” Glenn Compton, who leads the local environmental advocacy organization ManaSota-88, told the Times. “Hopefully they will be able to contain as much of the wastewater coming off the site as possible.”Florida has about 25 gypsum stacks that altogether hold about1 billion to ns of phosphogypsum, according to E&E News. In 2016, a sinkhole opened in a stack in Mulberry, Florida, dumping 215 million gallons of wastewater into the Floridan Aquifer, a source of much of the state is drinking water. Mosaic, the owner of the gypsum stack, pumped as much of the wastewater back out of the ground as possible. After taking thousands of samples, the company declared there was no off-site contamination. In 2004, Hurricane Frances ripped open a gypsum stack in Riverview, Florida, and 65 million gallons of wastewater flowed into a creek leading to Tampa Bay. In 1997, a heavy rainstorm unleashed a spill at a gypsum stack near Mulberry, Florida, that spilled 56 million gallon of wastewater into the Alafia River,killing everything in its path for 42 miles, according to the Florida Phoenix. More than 1 million baitfish and shellfish, 72,900 game fish and a number of alligators were killed.",2,2,The Weather Channel
379,The 2020 Election Result Completely Discredits The Democratic Leadership,-22.67,33.83,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/11/the-2020-election-result-completely-discredits-the-democratic-leadership,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-04,25,"As of the time of this writing, Joe Biden has a lead in enough states that, if present trends hold, he will narrowly win the presidency. This would be a huge relief, because Donald Trump is a monstrosity and four more years of his authoritarian leadership would bean utter disaster for workers, immigrants, and the climate. I would be hugely relieved if Joe Biden became president,not because I think his presidency will in any way be good but because it averts the worst possible catastrophe. But even assuming Biden is sworn into office, Election Night 2020 was a rude awakening for Democrats, because many of them were hoping to see Donald Trump resoundingly repudiated by the electorate. This did not happen. Turnout massively increased in this election (a greater percentage of eligible voters turned out than in any election since 1900), but this was not because the public rose up in unison to defeat Donald Trump. In fact, millions who did not vote for Trump in 2016 voted for him this time. Biden actually appears to have done far among certain constituencies than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Some heavily Hispanic parts of South Texas that broke overwhelmingly for Clinton split far more evenly between Biden and Trump. Trump managed to make inroads among voters of color that I am certain the Biden campaign never thought was possible. The fact that this election is so close is a serious indictment of the Democratic Party leadership. Hundreds of thousands of people are dead from a pandemic that the Trump administration has handled with the grossest incompetence. My colleague Eli Masseysums things upaccurately:If Joe Biden could not thrash Trump under these circumstances, God only knows how he could have won if COVID-19 had not happened. Trump has been an abysmal president. His approach to climate change threatens the lives of countless human beings. The case against him should be open-and-shut. Yet the Democratic Party lost to him once and has come close to doing it again. How?I have already seen some Democrats on social media blaming the voters. Americans just must be more irredeemably stupid and racist than we thought. I do not think this attitude is correct or helpful. Why are the native Spanish speakers of Miami and South Texas less enthusiastic about Biden than they were about Hillary? Do we simply blame them for “not knowing their own self-interest”?The answer to what is going on is not actually mysterious. The left has been saying it over and over ad nauseum: the Democrats have failed to offer a compelling alternative. Joe Biden has been an uninspiring corrupt corporate candidate. He is been, incredibly, less politically competent than Hillary Clinton. He opposes policies that are hugely popular with voters. He is been unable to generate enthusiasm—we rightly criticized Trump for holding giant rallies in the middle of a pandemic, but we also know Trump is right that Biden could not hold giant rallies even if he was willing to pay people to come. Democrats have taken voters of color for granted. We know this. My colleague Malaika Jabali, in “The Color of Economic Anxiety,” documented how Black voters in Wisconsin felt completely unseen and unheard by the Democratic Party. My colleague Briahna Joy Gray has spent the entire election cycle warning that Joe Biden was treating voters of color like they we reobligated to vote for him. The Biden campaign is outreach to Latino voters was infamously abysmal, sometimes not even rising to the level of being patronizing. It was just lazy and insulting, such as Biden pulling out his iPhone and playing the song “Despacito” for 15 seconds. There were reports that his campaign did not even consider these voters “part of the path to victory” and there were warnings before the election that this was going to cause problems:Politicoreports. Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee “in spite of, not because of” his Latino outreach,Politicowrites, but more than 20 Latino political operatives say his luck may not hold in the general election. Indeed, it did not hold, because it turns out you need more than luck. You also need hard work, and there was little sign throughout the campaign that Biden is team was actually putting in the work necessary to resoundingly defeat Trump. The Biden campaign seemed to be coasting on a sense of self-assurance, convinced that Donald Trump could not possibly be reelected. Some of us were horrified when we realized how little campaigning Biden was actually doing; there was a period where Trump is campaign was knocking on a million doors a week and Biden is was knocking on zero. The Biden campaign is messaging was all over the place. He completely screwed up the first presidential debate, sounding weak and incoherent. As with Clinton, there was no clear set of things that Biden was telling voters he would actually for them. I do not know if anyone could name Biden is signature promises, beyond “not banning fracking,” “not passing the Green New Deal,” and “not wanting Medicare for All.” These points he hammered consistently. Trump did not do well either in that first debate (both improved in the second debate) and it was notable how bad Trump is own campaign was. His messaging was incoherent (was Joe Biden an Antifa-loving socialist or a corrupt Washington elite?) and he wasted giant piles of his campaign cash. He lost the powerful populist rhetoric that swept him into office in the first place, in favor of attacks on Biden is ne’er-do-well son Hunter, a strange issue to choose for an electorate focused on the pandemic and the economy. Trump made serious missteps and often seemed desperate. Defeating him should have been a cakewalk. It was truly shocking to see many Democrats learn absolutely nothing from 2016. I tend to be politically cynical, but to see of the lessons learned was remarkable. The central points that I and others on the left have been emphasizing over and over since that election were:This last point should have been one of the absolutely central lessons from 2016, an election in which Trump outperformed his polls and shocked the nation. But, incredibly, the complacency of 2016returned in 2020. I was rather shocked myself, because I thought we had all learned that polls can underestimate Trump is support, since many Trump voters do not like to admit they are Trump voters (and some are QAnoners who probably think pollsters are part of the socialist globalist pedophile-cannibal ring). I spent months arguing with people who insisted that the polls had been “fixed” since 2016 and the same thing that happened once could not happen twice. I even heard this from leftists skeptical of Biden, and I suspect that there was a certain “wishful thinking” bias creeping in. Nobody on the left wanted to have to actually work to get Biden elected, because he was transparently awful, so there was an inclination not to question polls showing Biden with a comfortable lead. The polls were not reliable, just as they were not reliable in 2016. Dave Wasserman of the says they have “rarely led us more astray.”FiveThirtyEight is final Florida average, for instance, put Biden ahead in the state by 2.5 points. As of right now, Trump is winning the state by 3.4 points. The site put Trump ahead in Texas by 1.1 according to the polls, but he is winning right now by 6.1. In Ohio, Trump was ahead in the polls by 0.8, but he is winning by 8 points. Though it appears Biden will win, polls actually led to predictions of a “Biden landslide,” and it is obvious that this was not only a complete mirage, but hugely irresponsible to even discuss. When people falsely assumed Biden was this far ahead, they could wrongly assume that the Democrats had everything under control and all the average person needed to do was keep scrolling Twitter and checking to make sure everything was still in hand. I have warned people before not to ever listen to polling pundit Nate Silver, and this election showed exactly why. He offered people the reassuring observation that for Trump to win would require a serious polling error of the kind unlikely to occur. Well, a serious polling error did occur, and though it may not have been enough to give Trump the win, it is obvious that these sorts of statements from people like Silver put the country at risk by downplaying the possibility of Trump seriously outperforming expectations. Silver, as I noted in my analysis, is always careful to hedge by saying that he is only commenting on what isprobable, but this actually shows why his work is extremely unhelpful. He predicts that anything could happen (even a big polling error), so that whatever happens, he can say “I predicted that.” Indeed, when I asked him if a Trump victory would mean his analysis was useless, he told me that it would not, because a Trump victory was one of the set of things he said could happen. This means that he has carefully made sure he never issues a “falsifiable” prediction. But it also means that taking his probabilities as meaningful commentaries on reality is very, very dangerous. The best approach to an election you want to win is to assume you are likely to lose and do whatever it would take to reverse that outcome. Let is be very clear: the Democratic Party screwed this election up massively. Trumpactually did better than he did in 2016in areas with high COVID-19 deaths. Union members in Ohioappearto have gone for Trump, and most of the people who saw the economy as the top issue voted for Trump, even though this should theoretically be the issue on which the Democratic Party is strongest. Now, Democrats are not going to take the Senate. The candidate that the leadershiphand-picked to run againstMitch McConnell (instead of progressiveCharles Booker) got crushed. Themassive amount that was spent to defeat Lindsey Graham went nowhere, predictably. The Democratssquandered money on pitifully unpersuasive messages in races that they should have been able to win. Theyfailedto flip Republican target seats in the House and even lost important seats. Even though a popular progressive policy, the$15 minimum wage, attracted overwhelming support in Florida, the Democratic candidate did not. The fact that there were many voters in Florida who voted for both Donald Trump and a $15 minimum wage should be a puzzle for the Democratic leadership. Why do they support a candidate who opposes the very thing they seem to support? Fox Newsrecently published results of polls of voters confirming that large numbers support government-run healthcare, restrictions on gun rights, the preservation of abortion rights, and a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants. How, the n, could Donald Trump, a person who is doing exactly the opposite on all of these issues, come so close to winning reelection?There is nothing surprising here, however, to anyone who has read, say,Thomas Frank is, or who was paying attention to Michael Moore is warning in 2016that Trump would win. (Current Affairsalsoexpressed its concern.)Current Affairscontributing cartoonistMatt Lubchanskyputs it well when they say “if I were the opposition party candidate or candidates I would simply espouse policies with broad-based support that improve people is material conditions in clear and accessible language.” That is exactly what has not happened, and heads need to roll in the party over this. Pelosi, Schumer,Tom Perez: these people need ousting. They have failed. It makes me terribly sad to think about how differently this could have gone. We had a candidate, Bernie Sanders, who was uniquely well-positionedto counter Trump is messaging. But as my colleague Luke Savageputs it, “Democratic elites expended more energy, conviction, and zeal to defeat Bernie Sanders, his movement, and Medicare For All than they did to defeat Donald Trump.” Sanders had a formidable organizing apparatus, an agenda designed to address ordinary working people is basic material concerns, and even ap roven effective Latino outreach strategy. I, an dother writers for this magazine, have spent the past four years warning that not only are candidates like Biden going to tank the Democratic Party is long-term electoral prospects, but the left that can plausibly restore Democratic political fortunes. As Joe Biden (potentially) flounders and staggers across the finish line and centrist Democrats lost house seats, a reported26 out of 30 nationally-endorsed Democratic Socialists of America candidates won their races. DSA candidates tend to win in unexpected places because they put in the work and have a message designed to appeal to a broad base of voters. (“If we win, you will not have to worry about money when you need to go to the doctor” is an argument that people can be enthusiastic about making on the doorstep, as compared with “If we win, the parasitic private insurance industry will be preserved but we will make several important tweaks to Obamacare.”)There is an argument made that the left cannot win because being called a “socialist” hurts Democratic candidates, with Joe Biden having been wounded by this attack. But I think that misunderstands the problem. Being called a socialist does hurt, if you acknowledge that being a socialist is bad and are put on the defensive about it. But every Democrat is hit with this attack, even if they are obviously a socialist (which Biden clearly is not). The best approach is not to try to meekly insist that the socialist charge is a lie, but to lean into it, to say “What of it?” and to explain why the socialist agenda is reasonable and moderate. If you think that ca not be done, just have a look at Bernie talking to Trump voters or speaking at a Fox News town hall. He does not run away from the label, he explains what it means to him, and the n the audience ends up going “hm, that actually sounds pretty reasonable.” At the debates this cycle, Biden and Harris’ worst moments were when they defensively insisted that they didn ot support the job-killing Green New Deal. They would have done much better if they’d replied: of course I support the Green New Deal, because itcreatesjobs, and if you do not understand that, you are an idiot. Instead of asking me to disown the Green New Deal, why do not we ask why the Republicans are content to let the planet burn? Democratic defensiveness makes it seem as if they are shifty, and looks like an acknowledgment that Republicans are right that socialism and the Green New Deal are bad. Disowning socialism makes you look weak. Embracing it makes you look cool and tough. I do not want to dwell too much in the counterfactual fantasy of a Bernie-Trump race, but it does need to be emphasized that Joe Biden is failure to effectively fight Trump—a man whose closing argument to the country was a video of him dancing to the YMCA—shows the urgent need for something fresh, new, and real. No more pretending that candidates we all know are bad are actually secretly competent and have a plan. No more pretending that “I will cancel a certain amount of student debt for people who run a business for three years in a disadvantaged community” is a serious plan to deal with the student debt crisis. No more lofty words covering up detestable deeds. People can see through that crap, and they are tired of it. There is no mandate for centrist politics in this country. No flood of Republicans is going to defect from Trump to support Biden if Biden just pledges his love of f racking enough times. Assuming Biden staggers over the finish line, we have got to spend the next several years building a very different Democratic Party, in order to avoid some horrible neo-fascist like Tom Cotton or Dan Crenshaw taking the presidency in 2024. Biden will likely do very little, and will be relatively unpopular from the moment he takes office. The Republican senate will obstruct him, and he will use them as an excuse to avoid doing even the limited number of things we might reasonably have hoped for from him. It may be a sort of non-presidency, and that is alarming in some ways and advantageous in others. It is alarming because we urgently need action to be taken on climate change, and Biden is likely going to sit uselessly twiddling his thumbs, growing steadily more unpopular and reminding the country why they do not like the Democratic Party. It is advantageous because it gives us a few years to try to build an authentic left alternative and fill the leadership vacuum. These are going to be critical years for the left. We must build institutional power. We have to pressure the Biden administration in every way we can. We need to unionize as many work places as possible. Everyone who cares about the future of the country should be a dues-payingDSA member. Strong independent media organizations that can combat right-wing lies and present left arguments compellingly to a mass audience need to be built and buttressed. (Organizations like and this magazine are doing our best to fill this need and could really use your support in these coming years.) We will not have much time: the 2020 map shows us that the Biden presidency is doomed if the right regroups, because even if Trump is voted out, “Trumpism” is alive and well and has mass appeal. The Democratic Party establishment fundamentally does not know what it is doing. This was proved definitively in 2016. This year, what we have learned is that is not only incompetent, it is also unteachable. It will not get better, not even in response to this calamity. If it is up to the people currently in charge of the party it’d be Harris/Buttigiegin 2024. Nothing will change unless change it, which it is now our responsibility to do. A Biden presidency is a relief, but only a small one. It is also a burden, because it means that we must now act fast to totally change the party, before it is too late. There can be no relaxing and “going back to brunch.” Our work is cut out for us.",1,1,Current Affairs

Proposals to hold newly arrived asylum seekers on disused ferries or overseas have been branded “illegal, expensive and illogical” by immigration experts, former civil servants and politicians. Leaked reports have shown Priti Patel is Home Office considered plans to process migrants off the UK mainland and also looked at floating walls to block asylum seekers crossing the Channel from Calais. Matthew Rycroft, permanent secretary at the Home Office, told MPs on Thursday that “all options were on the table”. But the plans werebranded ""inhumane"" by Labour leader Keir Starmer, who said: ""This is not creative thinking, this is lurching from one ridiculous proposition to the next.""Ex-civil servants and prominent lawyers told The Independentthe proposals were “unrealistic” and rooted in an attempt to “look tough” on the issue of immigration, when in fact they would do nothing to solve any problem – instead generating higher costs and more legal and moral issues for ministers. Dave Wood, who was head of immigration enforcement under Theresa May, said the idea of processing asylum seekers on a disused ferry or remote islands would be “illegal, impractical, expensive and illogical” – and born only out of ministers “trying to sound like they have got a very tough response” to the rise in Channel crossings. He said: “Once it is been thought through I am sure they wont implement it because as they think it through they will see it is mad. More importantly, it does not solve any of the problems they are trying to solve. At the end of the day, what would it solve? Absolutely nothing.“It is party politics and trying to sound tough to the public, but they ca not answer the important questions.""The former civil servant also said it was unlikely to deter people from coming to the UK to seek asylum: “Whether they think immigrants wont come here because they know they will be put on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic, I do not think that will wash. People will still come. Ultimately, many will not be returned home.”Tony Gray, a former Border Force employee who left five years ago, said he believed the ideas indicated the “mindset of the government and the home secretary at the moment”.""They have made lots of promises and lots of tough statements about sending people back, but it is very difficult for them to actually achieve that, and they knew that from the start.”Mr Gray added that some of the asylum seekers he saw arriving in Kent during his time with Border Force were “extremely vulnerable” and would not cope well in a far-flung centre: “Many of them have gone through incredibly a lot, from those who have been bombed out of their homes, to those forced out by armed groups.”According toThe Times, Number 10 is considering buying retired ferries and converting the vessels into processing centres to house asylum seekers off the UK coast, and also discussed moving migrants to decommissioned oil platforms in the North Sea for processing, but the idea was rejected. TheGuardianreported that the government was considering sending asylum seekers could to detention centres in Papua New Guinea, Moldova, or Morocco, in a version of the Australian “offshore” model. It claimed leaked documents had revealed Downing Street had asked officials to look into the matter, but was met with “pushback” from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. The ideas echo those floated by the Labour government in 2003, which included establishing a “protection zone” in a country such as Russia or Albania, and a potential processing centre in Tanzania, but were quickly concluded to be unfeasible. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King is College London and former senior civil servant of more than 20 years, was chief economist at the Cabinet Office when those ideas were floated.“The motivation for this now is the same as it was the n,"" he said. ""The idea that we can somehow convince people that if they get here they will be shipped offshore and they will be in camps and their claims will probably be denied and they will be shipped back home.“And the objections the n were the same as what you have seen now – which is on the humane side, the legal side and the practical and cost side. It will cost a lot, they will end up with a lot of legal challenges and many of the people will end up staying here anyway.""He said that in order to resolve the issue of large numbers of people in the asylum system, the government must invest more resources in processing asylum claims “quickly and humanely”, referring to the growing backlog in the waiting times for asylum decisions. Official figures show the number of asylum seekers waiting longer than half a year for their claim to be decided hit a record high this year after surging by 76 per cent in 12 months. Meanwhile, the number of people granted asylum reached its highest level in 16 years, with more than half of claimants granted protection at the initial decision stage, compared with only a third the previous year. Mr Portes added: “What is the humanity in shipping people more than likely to be genuine asylum seekers off to some offshore processing centre where they may languish for years? This government has done some bizarre things so it is not impossible. But would it actually achieve very much, probably not.""Immigration barrister Colin Yeo said the proposals were “very unrealistic” and were an attempt to confront a problem that was not really there.“There are huge practical obstacles to it, not just around the cost and logistics but the moral consequences on what happens when you detain people in that way in foreign countries,” he said.“The one idea that does seem potentially doable and is probably lawful is putting people on a ferry. But why would you do that? There are not that many of them. If you are going to detain the m, why not have them on-land?“Most of these people are genuine refugees, the numbers reaching the UK are much smaller than other EU countries, and the numbers are actually falling on previous years. The idea that you need extreme measures to deal with a problem that is not really a problem at all seems unreal.”Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, wrote a letter to the home secretary on Thursday saying the proposals seemed to be “both extremely inappropriate” in terms of the UK is commitments to human rights and to asylum, and an “incredibly impractical and expensive” way of doing so. Adam Holloway, the Tory MP for Gravesham, said it was “completely right” for the Home Office to look at ways of deterring asylum seekers from coming to the UK, but called for any solution to be “civilised”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 is Today programme on Thursday, he said: “Talk of oil rigs and Moldova and Papua New Guinea, to me, is somewhat bizarre. You are determined for me to say it is a great idea to put people on islands - I am not saying that.”The Home Office is completely right to look at other options so there is some sort of deterrent, but not the Australian model where you have poor welfare standards and everything else. We have got to find a civilised version of that.”Sonia Lenegan, legal director at the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association, said the timing of the proposals was “remarkable” given that it came a day after the response to the Lessons Learned report was published, in which the Home Secretary spoke of building a better Home Office.“Australia is offshore processing policies are absolutely not a system to be admired or emulated, they have received international condemnation because of the levels of human cruelty involved,” she added. Kate Allen, Amnesty international UK director, described the proposals as “entirely immoral and inhumane”, adding: “It is a dismal reflection upon Home Office Ministers that this idea to effectively exile people seeking asylum to far-flung and isolated places has been given any consideration at all.“For too long the Home Office has done its worst business behind closed doors, with little consideration of the needs, rights and welfare of women, men and children affected by it.”Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action, said the government is speculative plans were “inhumane and morally bankrupt” and “steeped in racism”, adding that they would expose vulnerable people to “horrendous human rights abuse and trauma”The Home Office has been approached for comment.

383,Only the Church Does Anti-Racism Right,4.33,32.0,https://www.ncregister.com/commentaries/anti-racism-tolton,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-catholic-register-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-18,16,"In the decades I have been alive, I have seen herculean efforts to address racism. From kindergarten through college, adults taught against racism at every stage of my life. Institutions everywhere poured time and money into diversity. Newscasters were diverse, movie characters were diverse, the most popular family on television was the Huxtables, the most popular talk show wasOprah!, and the most popular actor was Will Smith. We celebrated Harriet Tubman in school, celebrated Martin Luther King Jr. Day at home, and the n celebrated a Black American in the White House. So — why did not it work? Why is race the pressing issue that it is, as if the last 50 years never happened?In the wake of the killing of George Floyd in May, it is more clear than ever: You have to pick one or the other — either secularism or racial harmony. You ca not have both. All the secular-racial-diversity money in the world ca not solve a problem that stems from the human heart. Only faith can do that. If you believe that one God created all people in his image and commands that you love the m, you will eventually have to confront your personal feelings, whatever they are, about people of different races. But relativism breeds intolerance. If there is no objective truth that we all have a duty to discover and honor, the n whoever has the most power in a given situation determines what is right and wrong — whether it be your schoolteacher, the media or a police officer. You ca not teach that racism is wrong and that “your truth is as good as my truth.”It is no accident that the greatest advances of human rights in the USs have come from religious people, from Sojourner Truth to Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to the Catholic Church. So, why are not more people looking to the Church for answers? Mylast column, comparing the anti-racism movement and the pro-life movement, was the perfect introduction to this column, because there are two stories to the Church is response to racism, just as there are two stories about the Church and abortion. One story is the Church is unwavering condemnation of abortion, from the DidachetoPope Francis and US bishops calling abortion the “preeminent” issue of our day. The other, darker, story is the fact that many of those who wrote, defended and expanded abortion laws were Catholic-raised, Catholic-educated, proud self-proclaimed Catholics: Joe Biden, Andrew Cuomo, Nancy Pelosi and Sonia Sotomayor, to name just a few. And do not leave out Catholic voters who propped up the abortion industry with their votes. The Church is fight against racism is the same way: There are Catholic heroes and villains, but the Church is teaching gets it right. The Church is history in Africa starts when Jesus fled there as an infant. It continues with the first individual baptism stor yin the Acts of the Apostles—Philip baptizing an Ethiopian. The Ethiopian Church became one of the world is earliest and most beautiful expressions of Christianity. The Church is teaching on slavery has certainly developed, but you can see it unfolding from the beginning. Paul preached obedience to slaves, just as he preached obedience to the citizens of unjust Roman rulers. But he alsourgedChristians to show kindness beyond what is owed to “property” to slaves, made one slave“a brother,” and told us all that we are “neither slave nor free.”It is difficult to track Church teaching on slavery, because countries have embraced various economic arrangements that bind laborers to bosses, including: serfs, indentured servants, apprentices, the military draft, wards of the state, etc. Certainly, though, chattel slavery has always been “the fruit of covetousness, of degradation, of savagery,” as Church Father John Chrysostom put it in the fourth century. As racial slavery grew in the 15th century, so did the Church is denunciations, with papal threats to excommunicate slavers as early as 1435, the n repeated again and again for centuries. When the pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock, Black Catholics had already been on the continent for nearly 100 years in St. Augustine, Florida, Father Cyprian Davis points out in hishistory,Black Catholics in America. The nearby Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose, Florida, established in 1738, would become the oldest Black town in America. On the West Coast, when Los Angeles was founded in 1781, more than half of its families were Black. But racist Catholics were here early, to o: Bishops were sometimes part of the solution and sometimes part of the problem, often keeping silent on race issues. Bishops’ sins included agreeing to slave owners’ demands that slaves not be catechized, taking sides with unions against black laborers, and treating black women religious orders shamefully. Startling Vatican interventions were sometimes necessary, as when Pope Pius IX agreed to place one bishop is terrible pastoral letter about slavery on the “Index of Forbidden Books” in 1864, or when, in 1904, the Vatican complained that the “condition of Catholic negroes” in the USs was “not in conformity with the spirit of Christianity, which proclaims the equality of all men before God.”But that is how the Church works. People are sinners; the Church corrects them — and alongside the villains are saints and heroes. Saints celebrated by the Black community are well known, from Perpetua and Felicity to the Venerable Augustine Tolton. Black Catholic heroes likejournalistDaniel Rudd (1854-1933) are less known. He was a pioneering Catholic journalist in 19th-century America who had a clear-eyed view of race in America. “The Catholic Church alone can break the color line. Our people should help her to do it,” he wrote. “We need the Church; the Church wants us.”He saw the Church as the world is best answer to racism. Why?First, he said, “because she has up to this time been the only successful leader of men of all the other races,” he wrote. That is a great point. Anyone who dreams of an international multiracial organization dedicated to love should be advised that one already exists. The Catholic Church does notstrivefor diversity. Itisdiverse. Worldwide, more than two-thirds of Catholics are nonwhite. By 2050, five of the 10 countries with the largest Christian populations will be in Africa. In America, Catholic churches are more diverse than other denominations. Second, Rudd wrote, “[T]he Catholic Church is not only a warm and true friend of the Colored people but is absolutely impartial in recognizing them as the equals.”Jesus said we were to love every neighbor as ourselves — even strangers; even Samaritans; even our enemies — and the Church teaches that we all have infinite dignity. A third reason is the Church is social teaching. “We have noticed in many of the papers published by Colored men statements that the Catholic Church is not and has not been the Negro is friend,” Rudd wrote. “[W]e call attention to the encyclical letter of our Holy Father, Pope Leo XII. … In its treatment of the rights of rich and poor it has not been equaled by any writer upon this subject, because it comes from the authority of the teaching Church.”A last reason the Catholic Church is best on race is its focus on reconciliation. Author Deacon Harold Burke-Sivers is a modern-day Daniel Rudd.“If we are to defeat the evils of racial injustice, we must always lead with love,” he said in a recent speech, “not rioting or looting or vandalism.“Racism is learned behavior, and Catholics can play a significant role … by taking a hands-on approach.”The Church is approach has always been to convert, not just condemn. Relativism and violence will always fail. The Church has the only answer to racism — God is.",1,1,National Catholic Register
384,Swedish Coop supermarkets shut due to US ransomware cyber-attack,0.0,45.0,https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-57707530,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-03,25,"Some 500 Coop supermarket stores in Sweden have been forced to close due to an ongoing ""colossal"" cyber-attack affecting organisations around the world. Coop Sweden says it closed more than half of its 800 stores on Friday after point-of-sale tills and self-service checkouts stopped working. The supermarket was not itself targeted by hackers - but is one of a growing number of organisations affected by an attack on a large software supplier the company uses indirectly. Cyber researchers say about 200 businesses have been hit by this ""colossal"" ransom ware attack, which had mainly affected the US Cyber-security firm Huntress Labs said the hack targeted Florida-based IT company Kaseya before spreading through corporate networks that use its software. The firm believes the Russia-linked REvil ransom ware gang was responsible. Kaseya said in a statement on its own web site that it was investigating a ""potential attack"". A spokeswoman for Coop Sweden told the BBC: ""We first noticed problems in a small number of stores on Friday evening around 6:30pm so we closed those stores early. It was much bigger and we took the decision not to open most of our stores this morning so that our teams could work out how to fix it.""The whole paying system at our tills and our self-service checkouts stopped working so we need time to reboot the system.""It is understood that Coop does not use Kesaya directly on its systems but that one of their software providers does. The case highlights the growing concern in the cyber-security world about so-called supply chain attacks where hackers are able to claim multiple victims by attacking their supplier. The US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency, a federal body,said in a statement that it was taking action to address the attack and urging users of the Kesaya software to shut it down. The UK is National Cyber Security Centre said: ""We are aware of a cy ber incident involving Kaseya, and we are working to fully understand its impact.""Ransomware is a growing, global cy ber threat, and all organisations should take immediate steps to limit risk and follow our advice on how to put in place robust defences to protect their networks.""The cyber-breach looks to have been timed for maximum disruption as it emerged on Friday afternoon when companies across the US were clocking off for the long Independence Day weekend. Kaseya is urging customers that use its VSA tool to immediately shut down their servers. Kaseya said in its statement that a ""small number"" of companies had been affected, though Huntress Labs said the number was greater than 200. It is not clear what specific companies have been affected, and a Kaseya representative contacted by the BBC declined to give details. Kaseya is web site says it has a presence in more than 10 countries and over 10,000 customers.""This is a colossal and devastating supply chain attack,"" Huntress Labs' senior security researcher John Hammond said in an email. At a summit in Geneva last month, US President Joe Biden said he told Russian President Vladimir Putin he had a responsibility to rein in such cyber-attacks. Mr Biden said he gave Mr Putin a list of 16 critical infrastructure sectors, from energy to water, that should not be subject to hacking. REvil - also known as Sodinokibi - is one of the most prolific and profitable cyber-criminal groups in the world. The gang was blamed by the FBI for a hack in May that paralysed operations at JBS - the world is largest meat supplier. The group sometimes threatens to post stolen documents on its web site - known as the ""Happy Blog"" - if victims do not comply with its demands. REvil was also linked to a co-ordinated attack on nearly two dozen local governments in the US state of Texas in 2019.

Here is what health experts and the CDC have to say about why you need to continue wearing a mask and social distancing after you get the COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccines are safe, even without long-term dataThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines come in two doses -- the first shot starts building protection, while the second shot is needed to get the most protection the vaccine has to offer against the coronavirus,according to the CDC The first shot has been proven to be highly effective, Dr. Iahn Gonsenhauser, chief quality and patient safety officer of Wexner Medical Center, told CNET He said the second dose amplifies the protection and will extend the life of immunity. After you receive the second shot, your body needs time to build the protection needed to fight the virus. It could take up to two weeks for your COVID-19 vaccine to begin protecting you against the coronavirus,according to the CDC During that time, it is important to keep yourself and those around you safe by continuing to socially distance and wear a mask when around people outside your household. You may not get full protection from the coronavirus right away. Because the coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccine are both so new, the re is not enough evidence at this point to know if people can still carry the coronavirus pathogens and pass them along to others without being infected the mselves.""This gives enough time for the virus to grow in the respiratory passages and spread the infection to others, all while the body is fighting its own infection, aided by the vaccine,"" Gonsenhauser told CNET There is a lack of data that shows whether or not a vaccinated individual can spread the virus after becoming infected, and a person could potentially be ana symptomatic carrier, he added.""While the vaccine is highly effective, the re is still a slim chance -- 5 to 10% -- that after someone gets vaccinated, they could become infected,"" Gonsenhauser said. However, more data could become available as scientists and doctors learn more about the effects of the vaccine on COVID-19. COVID-19 reinfection: Can you get the coronavirus more than once? What we know so farUntil experts fully understand the protection a COVID-19 vaccine provides, it is important to continue wearing a mask and following social distancing protocols,the CDC says. This can help prevent the coronavirus spread among communities of people until more of the population is vaccinated against the coronavirus. Wearing a mask is ""adding on the protection of the vaccination,"" Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy,said December 14 on a CBS radio affiliate. The CDC says that together, wearing a face mask and getting vaccinated will offer the best protection from getting and spreading COVID-19.""The immune response, including duration of immunity, to COVID-19 is not yet understood,""the CDC says. More research is needed to determine how likely you are to get reinfected, and the CDC says""it is not known what antibody levels are needed to protect against reinfection.""The defenses the body gains against the virus during and after infection seem to fade relatively quickly, making it difficult to achieve herd immunity over a longer period of time,according to Dr. William Haseltine, a former professor of Harvard Medical School who is renowned for his work on the human genome and HIV/AIDS.""The bigger concern is someone becoming reinfected with the same variant of COVID-19, not getting sick the mselves, but still being contagious to others. You can get infected twice and be asymptomatic the second time around, and still carry it and transmit it to other more vulnerable people around you,""said John V Williams, professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh. So far, there have been very few cases of reinfection of the coronavirus. In fact, reported cases of reinfection with COVID-19 remain rare,according to the CDC However, if COVID-19 is like other types of coronaviruses, such as the common cold, reinfection will become more prevalent as time goes on,according to Scientific American. Reinfection of COVID-19 is a possibility. It is going to take months or longer for enough of the population to be vaccinated to start seeing case numbers go down substantially. Therefore, it is important to continue wearing masks whenever you are around people outside your household.""If after getting vaccinated, people stop wearing their masks, other people who have not been vaccinated could start thinking masks are not necessary anymore,"" Gonsenhauser said of social behavior. If those unvaccinated people have the virus, they can spread it faster by not wearing a mask. COVID-19 vaccine card is not an immunity passport. Here is the differencePeople in smaller groups are less likely to wear masks when together,according to a Vox survey first published in November. Thirty two percent of respondents said they do not wear a mask when attending a sit-down gathering.""Masks are a key measure to suppress transmission and save lives,""the World Health Organization says. If 95% of the public wears a mask, tens of thousands of lives could be saved,according to a Nature Medicine study from October. Despite theCOVID-19 vaccines being proven safe, some Americans may avoid vaccination. Incorrectcoronavirus vaccine myths and other misinformation have falsely claimed that the vaccine will include government-tracking microchips or be forcefully administered by the military. This is not true. Some may be wrongly concerned that the vaccine was developed too quickly to be safe. Both vaccines in the US have undergone extensive clinical trial sand have been proven to be 94% and 95% effective, well over the 90% efficacy threshold required. While a vaccine will not completely stop the pandemic in its tracks, it is the direct route to herd immunity. However, in order to get the re, more people will need to get the coronavirus vaccine. And, due to a limited number of doses, not everyone is able to get the coronavirus vaccine all at once. In fact,depending on which group you are in, you may be waiting until at least April to get the vaccine,according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert -- if not later. If a significant portion of the population refuses to take the vaccine, we will likely not see numbers of new cases decrease as rapidly as we'd like, says Gonsenhauser. He says he and other medical providers are doing everything they can to remind people how safe the vaccine is-- from bringing relatable and accessible information to communities who have different oppositions to distrust the vaccine, to help them make better-informed decisions. Some people may think it is okay not to wear a mask after getting COVID-19. Currently, the re is not enough information at this time to determine if or when the majority of the population can safely stop wearing masks and avoid close contact with others to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus,the CDC says, but it will likely come down to the numbers. When there are enough observable changes, such as cases dropping and the threat levels of community spread sharply falling. When that happens, medical experts can redetermine the need for mask-wearing. However, it could be well into 2021 before that happens.""We would need to see a dramatic decrease in the number of new cases per 100,000 of the population after enough vaccines have been administered,"" Gonsenhauser said. For more information, here are theCOVID-19 vaccine side effects and what we know so far, and hidden medical charges you could encounter after getting the vaccine. Also,here is where you can get the COVID-19 vaccine when it is your turn.",2,2,CNET
386,"In still-unsettled Fourth District race, Jesse Mermell leaves door open to a recount request",1.67,48.0,https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/09/03/metro/with-votes-still-being-counted-mermell-leaves-door-open-recount-request-fourth-district/?p1=HP_Feed_ContentQuery,https://adfontesmedia.com/boston-globe-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,25,"FRANKLIN — Trailing in a preliminary vote count, Jesse Mermell on Thursday did not rule out seeking a recount should she fall short to Jake Auchincloss as the Fourth Congressional District is contentious Democratic primary stretched through another day. Mermell, a former Brookline selectwoman, also raised doubts about the vote count itself, charging that there may be uncounted ballots beyond those that were tallied in three municipalities on Thursday under a court order. She repeatedly declined early Thursday afternoon to specify in which towns or cities she believes there may be additional ballots left from Tuesday is nine-way primary to succeed Representative Joseph P Kennedy III But she called the possibility of votes falling through the cracks “deeply concerning.”AdvertisementIn a twist, the number of still-uncounted votes later grew. Secretary of State William F Galvin dispatched members of his office to Franklin, where officials said there were 3,000 ballots that had to be counted — far more than the approximately 600 the town is clerk had initially estimated. State and local officials were huddled in a Franklin school gymnasium into Thursday night, combing through remaining ballots while Auchincloss held a roughly 1,400-vote lead, according to preliminary results.“We are focused on making sure every vote is counted, and discussion of anything beyond that would be incredibly premature,” Mermell said earlier Thursday outside Newton City Hall, where she donned a mask with the phrase “Vote” repeated 12 times on it.“No one wants a recount, particularly in the middle of a pandemic when we all want to be focused on the important task of getting rid of Donald Trump in November,” she said. “But as we know all too well, it matters who is representing us.”A website,massrecount.org, was live as of Thursday afternoon, offering a way to sign a district-wide recount petition for the Fourth District primary. At the bottom of the site it said: “Paid for by the Committee to Elect Jesse Mermell.”AdvertisementAsked about the website, Mermell spokesman David Guarino acknowledged soliciting signatures, describing it as a move “out of an abundance of caution,” given the tight deadline to file a petition by Friday. He said no decision had been made as of Thursday afternoon “on requesting further counting.”Mermell, however, had to first close enough of the gap to legally be able to force a district-wide recount, which requires the margin to be within 0.5 percent. A spokeswoman in Galvin is office said it also does not have the legal authority to accept electronic signatures for recount petitions. Anunofficialtally updated Thursday by the Associated Press showed Auchincloss, a moderate Newton city councilor and Marine veteran, with 33,433 votes, putting him 1,377 ahead of Mermell, a progressive Brookline Democrat. Only Franklin had yet to publicly report its results by Thursday evening, when Auchincloss had a 1-point lead. The new totals reflected 129 votes Mermell netted after Newton and Wellesley updated their own preliminary results Thursday. A judge had approved a petition from Galvin to allow officials in those two communities and Franklin to continue tallying what was initially estimated to be 1,450 uncounted votes from Tuesday is primary. In Wellesley, where officials tallied roughly 100 uncounted ballots, Mermell netted five votes, picking up 18 votes to Auchincloss is 13. In Newton, she netted 61 more, earning 222 additional votes and Auchincloss getting 161 more out of roughly 750 officials counted there. Newton is city clerk said it also had 500 additional ballots that had been counted earlier, and were being added to its preliminary count. AdvertisementIt is in Franklin, however, where the calculus changed. The town clerk is office initially told Galvin it had 600 ballots left to count, but state officials, fearing the estimate was “inconsistent” with the number of mail-in ballots residents had requested, arrived to perform an inventory. Officials ultimately identified more ballots across the town is eight precincts, totaling roughly 3,000, said Debra O’Malley, a spokeswoman for Galvin is office. Auchincloss had won each of the municipalities that border Franklin, and he was expected to perform well in the Norfolk County town,leaving it unclear how the extra ballots would reshape the margin between the two candidates.“As the final votes are being counted, we as candidates must be conscientious in allowing Secretary Galvin to take the lead and ensure that the will of the voters is heard in the 4th Congressional District,” Auchincloss said in a statement Thursday night. Given the primary is heavily divided nine-way field, Mermell Thursday evening faced a steep climb to not only close the gap with Auchincloss, but to gain enough votes to potentially force a recount across the district is 34 cities and towns. Under state law, a campaign can file a petition by Friday, with at least 500 signatures, for a district-wide recount, but only if the margin between first and second place is within 0.5 percent. AdvertisementIf the margin is larger, a campaign can also ask for more narrow recounts at the precinct or city ward levels, needing to file only 10 signatures with each request.“We are focused on getting every vote counted to day,” she said. During the primary, Auchincloss was often on the defensive against his more progressive rivals, who sought to frame him as ill-suited for the solid-blue district after he was previously enrolled as a Republican and worked for the state GOP and Governor Charlie Baker is 2014 campaign. (Auchincloss later re-enrolled as a Democrat after winning his Newton City Council seat in 2015.)Mermell was, by far, Auchincloss is most relentless critic, saying last month that the Newton Democrat was “someone who has been indefensibly out of step with this district time after time,” citing controversial past comments and social media posts. She often used Auchincloss as a foil, framing the primary as a two-way race and him as someone who “does not represent our values.” On Thursday, she declined to say if she would support Auchincloss, should he be the nominee. Auchincloss is backing of Baker, an abortion-rights-supporting, socially liberal Republican, did not appear to be a check against him in the more moderate Bristol County communities that anchor the district is southern end, said state Representative Patricia A Haddad, a Somerset Democrat and Auchincloss supporter. Preliminary results showed Auchincloss winning Fall River and all of its immediate neighbors. When Baker won reelection in 2018 by 33 points, he got 71 percent of the vote in Bristol County, a 42-point margin over his Democratic opponent. Advertisement“People do not go to the extremes” in this region, said Haddad, the Massachusetts House is third-ranking Democrat.“I very much reflect my district, which is progressive at times and conservative at times,” she said. “I just really thought [Auchincloss] was a good fit, for the whole district.”Mermell carried the district is wealthy northern suburbs, winning Brookline, Wellesley, Dover, Needham and Newton, preliminary results show. She was bolstered by endorsements from some of the state is highest-profile Democrats, including US Representative Ayanna Pressley and state Attorney General Maura Healey, and the consolidation of support from onetime candidates Dave Cavell of Brookline and Christopher Zannetos of Wellesley, who suspended their campaigns in August. But she struggled to carve out enough support as the district stretched farther south. In Attleboro, Fall River, and Taunton — three of the district is largest communities outside the Boston suburbs — Mermell finished fourth, fifth, and sixth, respectively, unofficial results show. Newton City Councilor Becky Walker Grossman placed third in the primary, with more than 26,000 votes, and Natalia Linos, a Brookline epidemiologist who entered the race only in May, finished fourth, preliminary results indicated. Ihssane Leckey, a former Wall Street regulator from Brookline, and Alan Khazei, a cofounder of City Year and a Brookline resident, followed. Zannetos, Brookline attorney Ben Sigel, and Cavell rounded out the voting. Julie Hall of Attleboro beat David Rosa in the district is Republican primary, according to unofficial results. Whichever Democrat emerges will be heavily favored on November 3 in a district that Hillary Clinton won by 24 points in the 2016 presidential election and Barack Obama by 16 points four years earlier. Hall, an Air Force veteran and a former Attleboro city councilor, said in a statement Thursday that “whoever wins the Democratic Primary will arrogantly assume this seat is already won.”“They will ignore the majority of voters who know that the free market is the only place that will help our economy recover from the COVID-19 shutdown, make health care affordable, and our economy greener,” Hall said.

One piece would provide $748 billion for support for small businesses, including Payroll Protection Program loans, added unemployment benefits, and vaccine development and distribution. The other would provide $160 billion for state and local government as well as temporary liability protection from coronavirus related-lawsuits. Those two issue have been major sticking points in reaching a deal as the clock ticks on the current Congress. The bipartisan group plans to hold a news conference Monday to announce the modified proposal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has long called for a liability shield from coronavirus litigation, while congressional Democrats have made money for states and cities their top priority. Breaking the proposal in two parts might give a relief package a greater chance to pass. Romney is among a group of lawmakers who have vowed to stay in Washington through the holidays to get a deal done as businesses across the country shut down, especially in the restaurant and hospitality industry, and Americans struggle to stay employed amid another COVID-19 surge. Senator Joe Manchin, D-W Va., one of the leaders of the effort, said the bipartisan group and their staffs have met regularly the past month, including a call Saturday and another call later Sunday to “finish things up.”“The bottom line is the re is a lot of parts to this bill, and in the spirit of compromise, you have to work through all of that,” Manchin told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.” “But at the end, you ca not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”Romney expressed optimism earlier this month that Congress could get a relief bill passed before Christmas.“I think it would send a terrible message if we are home celebrating Christmas and people is unemployment has run out and businesses are being closed,” he said.",2,2,Deseret News

391,"Bob Iger As Ambassador To China? Hollywood Names Are Floating For Joe Biden Picks, But Rumors May Clash With Reality",-1.67,38.67,https://deadline.com/2020/12/bob-iger-chinese-ambassador-rumors-jeffery-katzenberg-joe-biden-disney-1234658940/,https://adfontesmedia.com/deadline-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-18,21,"With a newly elected Democratic president, this is the season of speculation, where names are being floated as potential ambassador picks. And this time around, Disney is executive chairmanBob Igeris getting attention as a prospect for one of the highest profile foreign posts, China. But while there is a lot of talk of Iger and others (including Comcast is David L Cohen and former MPA chairman Chris Dodd), it is still just that: talk. Not only is it premature, but the polarization in the Senate could make things dicey for any nominee, much less one who comes from the ranks of Hollywood, a favorite punching bag of the right. Joe Biden‘s team is said to be concentrating right now on its to p-level cabinet picks. Team Biden has been sending out word that the speculation is premature and that nominations will not be considered until after January 20. Last week, Sean Savett, who has been working on the transition team for Biden, reacted to a rumor that Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms had been offered an ambassadorship to The Bahamas and declined. Related StoriesPoliticsJoe Biden To Get Covid-19 Vaccine On Monday; Kamala Harris Will Receive Shot After ChristmasNewsJoe Biden Lands In LA For Campaign Visit; POTUS Easily Wins South Carolina Primary -- Update“This is not true. No decisions on ambassadorships outside of UN have been made,” Savett wrote. Iger is not the only deep-pocket Tinseltown name being to ssed into the embassy speculation mix. As happened several times during the Obama era, longtime donor and presidential confidantJeffrey Katzenberghas also been rumored of late to be up for a plum overseas posting. However, a source with knowledge of the former Quibi boss’ situation bluntly says that such talk is bogus at best. This is not to say an ambassadorship for a Hollywood figure would not be so out of the ordinary. After Barack Obama is presidential victory, he tapped Charles Rivkin, the n CEO of WildBrain Media, and Nicole Avant, a music industry executive and producer, to be ambassadors to France and The Bahamas, respectively. Rivkin is now the chairman of the Motion Picture Association, and Avant is a producer. Four years later, Obama selected Colleen Bell, a television producer, as ambassador to Hungary, and HBO executive James Costos as ambassador to Spain. But this time around, the confirmation process could very well be a hurdle, particularly given the attacks Republicans have been prone to make on showbiz. Things will be smoother if Democrats win control of the Senate in the January 5 runoffs, and either way, much depends on timing and the nature of anti-Biden intransigence. But for politicians on the left and the right, the Walt Disney Co. has been a sure-fire way to draw attention. Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has attacked Disney and other studios for “kowtowing” to China, and he was among a group of lawmakers in both parties who signed a letter to Disney CEO Bob Chapek in Septemberexpressing concerns over the credits of because they included a note of thanks to Chinese authorities who have been cited for human rights abuses. An executive for the company later said that the movie was almost entirely shot in New Zealand, but some locations were used in China and that it was standard practice to acknowledge local governments in the credits. On the other side of the partisan divide is Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) who has chided Disney for the pay of its the me park workers compared with that of top executives, including Iger. The company recently said that it would lay off 32,000 workers, mostly in its the me parks, which face severe restrictions on attendance because of the coronavirus pandemic. One senior Hollywood executive with strong DC ties said that Iger would hit turbulence. “Hell no. There is no way that Iger would pass a confirmation hearing,” given the scrutiny facing the next posting in Beijing. Meanwhile, Cohen, senior executive vice president at Comcast, has been mentioned as a potential ambassador to the UK In a recent interview with the former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendellsaid that he talked to Cohenabout a high-profile ambassador post or that of commerce secretary. Cohen, who was once Rendell is chief of staff, held Biden is first major fundraiser. Comcast has called the speculation premature. Dodd is name has long been floated as a potential ambassador to Ireland. He recently declined comment on those prospects. None of this is to say that these ambassador picks would not be qualified, even very well qualified — particularly when compared to some other nominees of the past. Iger, for instance, has a raft of experience interacting and negotiating with senior leadership in China, particularly when it came to building the massive Shanghai Disneyland, and he himself considered running for president this year. There are also less high-profile postings, outside of world hotspots, that would not be such a flashpoint. While ambassador posts come with a certain level of glamour and cachet, there are downsides. Whoever is an ambassador will be stepping into a role assisted by career diplomats with far greater knowledge of the bureaucracy of the mission, and they may be subject to the scrutiny of the State Department, including inspector general audits. There is also the matter of pay — there are healthy benefits, but salaries run around $150,000 per year, a fraction of what top executives are accustomed to getting. Money is not an issue for many of those who are tapped for ambassadorships, typically from the ranks of campaign bundlers and top donors. The postings are intriguing enough for many in show business to make a career turn, even with the scrutiny. The likes of Shirley Temple Black and John Gavin have served as ambassadors, and others who have held posts describe it as an experience of a lifetime, even with the drawbacks. Yet more often than not, speculation as to who will get these posts does not pan out. Back in 2012, Anna Wintour was floated as an Obama pick as ambassador to the UK or France. She got neither posting. Chances are that the coming weeks will see even more industry names floated as potential ambassador picks, but there is still a ways to go before the choices become reality.",1,1,Deadline

The latest bad part was that a lot of folks did not get together and enjoy the whole family around the dinner table loaded with turkey, dressing and gravy, and a wonderful variety of pies, cakes, and other goodies. However, some good things did not change. It is “huntin’ season” for just about all game in Arkansas and the virus ca not keep us out of the woods and off the water!As the first segment of duck season winds down, the overall hunting has been good. The best hunting has been west of the ridge in the flooded grain fields and along the White, Cache, L’anguille, Black, and lower White rivers. The ducks are liking large expanses of water and avoiding the smaller pot holes and sloughs. Locally Horseshoe and Midway hunters are off to a nice start and will only get better with colder weather. The AGFC surveys report only 25 percent of the expected birds have arrived so the best is still ahead. Christmas time brings both Santa and ducks. Deer hunters are enjoying a good season in spite of early season warm weather. Crittenden County has harvested 140 deer so far. The state total that includes archery, muzzle loading, and modern gun is over 140,000 deer so far and there is still a month to go in some zones. Always check the free AGFC Hunting Guidebook because there are many zones and the regulations very in the zones. The bucks are in full rut and this is a good time to take a trophy. Lakeside Taxidermy has taken in several very nice deer to mount. Be careful when caping the deer and Never cut in front of the front shoulders. Do not forget about all the small game available to hunters that does not get a lot of attention. If you run beagles for rabbits, the season runs all February. Speaking of dogs, squirrels dogs are a great way to get that young hunter in the woods and let the hunting bug bite him. Do not forget quail, even though there are not many left in the Delta. Shooting preserves have these sporty tasty birds and they test your wing shooting. This is fun for both the kids and the daddies. I am a living testament for these kinds of hunting, both as the boy and the dad. I have not heard from any duck picking services. This is important information to pass on to my readers. Wynne Meat Processing offers complete services for deer hunters. They will skin and cut up the deer any way you want. Their summer sausage is outstanding! Call 870-208-8353. In fishing news, Deep trolling at Horseshoe is producing some very good strings of crappie in about 20 feet of water. The fishing under the piers has improved. The wind and cold makes it unpleasant to fish, so wear plenty of warm clothes. Midway crappie and bass are biting better. Catfish at both lakes is good. This is a wonderful time of year and make sure that young hunter is snuggled up next to you in the duck blind or deer stand. These trips are the origin of many wonderful holiday time memories. Send me pictures and details of your trips. Lakeside Taxidermy appreciates getting to mount you trophies at reasonable prices, quick service, and quality work.

394,Tennessee is GOP House Passes Bill Targeting Voter Registration Drives,-2.5,48.0,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/muckraker/tennessees-gop-house-passes-bill-targeting-voter-registration-drives,https://adfontesmedia.com/talking-points-memo-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"The GOP-controlled state House in Tennesseepassed legislationMonday making voter registration drives more onerous. The bill imposes fines on registration groups that turn in too many incomplete registration forms, while also allowing criminal penalties, including jail time, if the groups violate certain rules regarding voter registration. Republicans, including Secretary of State Tre Hargett,pushedthe bill after local election officials in Tennessee is Shelby County we resue din 2018 by a black voter group for their handling of voter registration forms. Under the new proposal, voter registration groups that turn in more than 100 “deficient” registration forms can be fined up to $2,000, and those that turn in more than 500 deficient applications would face fines up to $10,000. The groups also must be registered in state, are required to submit the registration forms within 10 days of collecting the m, and are banned from paying workers per registration completed, under the legislation. Violating those rules could land a paid worker of a voter registration drive in prison for nearly a year and also impose a $2,500 fine. The penalties apply only to groups that pay workers for the collection of registrations. Voting rights group say that the legislation is geared at chilling voter participation efforts in a state that has one of the lowest registration rates in the country. Its supporters say it will prevent counties from having to spend thousands on correcting the deficient forms. In the 2018 litigation, the Tennessee Black Voter Project alleged that the officials in Shelby County, which contains Memphis, had failed to process thousand of applications the group had submitted. The county election commission claimed that the registration group had bombarded officials at the last minute with nearly 10,000 applications — some 55 percent of them either missing information, coming from felons, or being duplicates. The group countered that the applications were being deemed incomplete for minor deficiencies, like a failure to check the “Mr./Mrs./Ms” box. A state court judge ruled that the election officials had to let those with incomplete applications vote with regular ballots on Election Day once they corrected the deficiencies at their polling place. That order, however, was mostly blocked by an appeals court in the state. The new legislation now heads for a vote in the Senate, where it has already been approved by a committee.",2,1,Talking Points Memo
395,Court ruling: Big Ten must disclose additional documents in next 10 days,2.67,48.67,https://omaha.com/sports/huskers/football/court-ruling-big-ten-must-disclose-additional-documents-in-next-10-days/article_5dfb72e7-3bb7-586d-b354-b488c91441f3.html#tracking-source=home-trending,https://adfontesmedia.com/omaha-world-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-02,22,"The Big Ten must disclose additional information related to its decision to postpone fall sports and do so in the next 10 days, the Lancaster County District Court ruled Wednesday. The order comes less than a week after eight Nebraska football players sued the league on multiple counts for its decision to push back fall sports. The Big Ten must produce all documents reflecting whether an official vote was taken on the decision, including the official tally but not including how individual members voted. It must also reveal in full its governing documents and bylaws — it submitted 13 pages of bylaws to the court last week but redacted more than 11 full pages.“The court is order recognizes the time-sensitive nature of the lawsuit,” said Mike Flood, the lead attorney for NU players, in a statement. The typical time line for discovery in Nebraska is 45 days. Between NU players filing their lawsuit August 27 and the Sept. 12 deadline, the Big Ten will be compelled to disclose documents within 16 days. Players’ argument to speed up the process is based on the idea that the decision to postpone wrongfully interferes with their business expectations to build their personal brands and potentially profit from their name, image and likeness within a fall college season. Not all of the player requests were granted in the order. Meeting minutes, including audio and video recordings and transcripts, are not included in the order to produce. Players also asked for all medical assessments, studies and data between July 1 and August 12 — the day after the postponement announcement came down — that went into the decision to postpone. In her order, Judge Susan Strong said that request was “potentially burdensome.”Though the Big Ten will not be forced to reveal how individual presidents and chancellors voted, The World-Herald and other media outlets have confirmed the dissenting votes came from Nebraska, Iowa and Ohio State. The league has already submitted a sworn affidavit from Northwestern President and Council of Presidents and Chancellors Chairman Morton Schapiro saying the vote was 11-3. Wednesday is ruling, in essence, forces the league to confirm that tally and not just one member of the COP/C.“Requiring the (Big Ten) to formally produce a limited amount of information is not unduly burdensome and may expedite the resolution of some of the issues in this time-sensitive lawsuit,” Strong said. The court ruling is only on the motion for expedited discovery, not the merits of the players’ case at large. NU player reps can take the suit in a variety of directions after reviewing documents of the vote and the full league bylaws. The lawsuit is top stated objective is to invalidate the Big Ten is decision to postpone fall sports. It also seeks greater transparency in how the league arrived at the decision and limited damages not exceeding $75,000.

396,"Study finds spike in suicidal thoughts, self-harm during and after pregnancy",-7.0,44.0,https://19thnews.org/2020/11/new-research-finds-dramatic-growth-in-suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm-during-and-after-pregnancy/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,25,"Suicide is a leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the USs, and new research shows that people with suicidal thoughts after giving birth dramatically increased between 2006 and 2017, with the biggest spikes amongst people who are Black, lower income, or younger. The study,published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, looked at just under 600,000 privately-insured people. Researchers analyzed the data to track cases of sui cid ality — suicidal ideation and deliberate self-harm — within a year either before or after giving birth. From 2006 to 2017, sui cid ality diagnoses increased from .2 percent per 100 people to .6 percent per 100. In the same period, cases of deliberate self-harm went up from .1 percent per 100 in 2006 to .2 percent per 100 in 2017. When applied to the approximately 4 million births that take place each year, that means an increase in tens of thousands of suicidal cases and intentional self-harm. The 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one.“Suicidality is something we do not think about or talk about as much, and it is a lot more common than I had realized,” said Kara Zivin, a professor at the University of Michigan and the paper is senior author. Zivin pursued the research based on her own experience — 10 years ago, after giving birth to her son, her postpartum depression made her suicidal. Now, she said, she wants to shine light on an under-discussed topic in public health that has profound consequences. Already, the USs’ rate of pregnancy-related deaths is higher than any other wealthy nation. And suicide is a major concern. According to a 2017 report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it accounted for about 6.5 percent of all pregnancy-related deaths.“I was certainly aware of the risks of things like postpartum depression. I never expected the level of illness I had,” Zivin said. “I do not fully understand it, still.”It is not clear what is behind the trend, though the researchers argued that it is likely a combination of doctors more often catching cases of sui cid ality — which is typically under-diagnosed — and the problem itself growing more common. But it is hard to know what is driving the increase. Zivin said the study makes a strong case for policy interventions that ensure people can access mental health care during and after pregnancy. For instance, people who have Medicaid as their insurance when pregnant will lose that eligibility after 60 days post-birth in most states — even though suicide a year after giving birth is still considered pregnancy-related. That is something states or the federal government could address, she said, by extending Medicaid to guarantee insurance for a year postpartum, and making sure people can see mental health specialists. The study found that Black people experienced the largest increase in perinatal sui cid ality of any single racial group — increasing from .2 percent per 100 in 2006 to .9 percent in 2017. In some ways, that reflects a bigger reality: The nation is pregnancy-related death rate is far higher for Black people than for White people. That is still likely an under count of the gap, said Katy Kozhimannil, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota and director of its rural health research center. Black women are disproportionately covered through Medicaid, not private insurance. (Kozhimannil was not involved in the study.)The study authors said it is not clear why Black people experienced such a dramatic increase in diagnoses. But experiences of racism have been linked to physical stress and mental illness symptoms, Kozhimannil noted. And big picture, she added, the data emphasizes why health policy-makers need to emphasize the impact of systemic racism when crafting pregnancy-related health interventions.“It is not about race, it is about racism,” she said. “Thinking about it in that way would point to the common root, and might get us in policy discussions further toward valuing the health of Black people in pregnancy.”The authors believe that the paper is even more pressing now. If pregnancy-related suicide was already a problem, experts say it is one that is likely to only grow, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has added new strains to perinatal mental health. As the pandemic worsens this winter, experts are sounding the alarm about a potential spike in suicides. That is especially a concern for people who have access to firearms, Kozhimannil said; the vast majority of gun deaths each year are suicides, and people who attempt suicide with a gun are more likely to suicide. And right now, more women are buying firearms for the first time.“This is more important than ever in the COVID-19 era,” said Lindsay Admon, an OB-GYN at the University of Michigan and the study is lead author. “The postpartum isolation people feel will have been compounded by this epidemic.”It is likely that the study data underestimates the extent of the problem. The study looks only at people with private insurance, who tend to be wealthier. It does not include the almost half of all American births that are insured through Medicaid, which covers lower-income people. People on Medicaid are already more likely to experience the kinds of external stressors that can trigger symptoms of depression and anxiety, and more likely not to have a doctor diagnose or help them access treatment. The study also only tracked official diagnoses, even though self-harm and suicidal thought are typically underreport ed and under-diagnosed.“It shows a big problem and probably under counts the magnitude of the problem, and the magnitude of the potential disparity,” Kozhimannil said.",2,2,19th News

Saying to someone “I am sorry your foot was in the street and the refore I rolled over it with my car,” is not an apology. Saying how you really feel and the n apologizing because you have been called out is not an apology, it is a get-right. Meaning, you are trying to get right so you do not lose your job or endorsements or public standing after spouting your true feelings. See,ESPN is Stephen A Smith is apology for his xenophobic comments about Japanese Major League Baseball star Shohei Ohtani. Smith is apology had nothing to do with own feelings and everything to do with getting right with his employer. So with that I say, fuck Texas Deputy Attorney General Aaron Reitz, who fixed his dumb ass fingers to tweet that Simone Biles, the greatest gymnast in the history of the sport, is a “national embarrassment,” after she withdrew from the team final and the individual all-around competition earlier this week to focus on her mental health. Biles lives in Spring, Texas, just north of Houston, and it remains unclear whether we have seen the last of the most accomplished gymnast in the sport at the Tokyo Games. In a now-deleted tweet, Reitz, who would probably get winded running a city-block, “quote-tweeted video from Kerri Strug is 1996 Olympic performance on an injured ankle” the n said, “Contrast this with our selfish, childish national embarrassment, Simone Biles,”CBS Newsreports. Late Wednesday afternoon, Reitz tweeted to say he owed Biles “an apology. A big one”:It is exhausting dealing with the criticism of Black women who have elected to take care of the mselves over everything. Show me one time where America ever gave a shit about Black women who still are not paid properly and who are three to four times more likely to die during pregnancy than their white counterparts. Why would a Black woman ever risk her mental health for a country that has not figured out why they are 40 percent more likely to die from breast cancer and are more at risk than white men to die from COVID-19?If Black women do not look out for the mselves and their own mental health who is going to? Surely not doctors. Doctors do not even listen to the m, and when they do, they do not believe that Black women are suffering as badly as they say they are. Simone Biles is the face of a sport that allowed her and her teammates to be sexually assaulted. Let that sink in. So fuck all of these Facebook warriors, elected officials and armchair quarterbacks who could not carry Biles’ medals on a good day without needing to take a water break. And fuck America, too. You should be ashamed of yourself for wanting to ride the coattails of a Black woman when it is patriotic, but ca not support her when she is not performing for you.

398,Capitol Incident a Dress Rehearsal,-7.67,34.0,https://consortiumnews.com/2021/01/08/capitol-incident-a-dress-rehearsal/,https://adfontesmedia.com/consortium-news-bias-reliability/,2021-01-08,23,"Written on January 7ith the normalization of mass shootings in the USs it is more than understandable that members of Congress feared for their lives when they learned protestors had forced their way into the Capitol in unknown numbers and were roaming around at will. But by the time it was over we knew that: only five weapons were seized by police so most of the intruders were probably unarmed; the only shots fired were by police who killed an unarmed female protestor; video and photos showed the demonstrators taking pictures of chambers and art work like they were tourists; and the occupiers were peacefully led out of the Capitol six hours later. (Had they been anti-racism protestors one wonders how differently it would haveended.)A dramatic event such as this is an old-time reporter is dream, to just describe the facts and details as they emerged, painting a picture in words in print or on the radio. With so many mobile phone pictures and video as well as TV cameras everywhere, that journalistic function has been greatly diminished if not extinguished. In its place are preaching, partisan, editorialists masquerading as mainstream journalists. By the time it was over it was clear what had not happened: it was not a “coup,” it was not an “insurrection,” it had nothing to do withPutin, or China or Iran and it was not like Pearl Harbor, as Senator Chuck Schumer ridiculously tried to call it. It was not the storming of a “temple of democracy,” interrupting Congress’ “sacred duty,” or “desecrating” the “hallowed halls” of the Capitol. Such quasi-religious rhetoric inflates the self-importance of officials elevating the mselves above the people they are supposed to serve. It was not the storming and occupation of the Japanese Embassy in Lima, Peru in 1996 or the 1985seizureof the Palace of Justice in Bogota, Colombia. It was in some ways the downtrodden forcing their existence into the faces of an elitist Congress who serve very powerful interests instead. But it was also the delusive manipulation of desperate people by Donald Trump, a master manipulator who for his own interests has somehow convinced millions of Americans that he is their champion whose re-election was stolen from the m, even when it is doubtful their lives were much improved over the past four years. What this event did is send a message, which went beyond claims of a stolen election, a message that no one in Congress or the media will openly acknowledge, if they have gotten the message at all, namely, that as long as Congress and the rest of the Establishment continue to ignore ordinary Americans’ interests and serve only their own, the anger and the desperation in the land will explode, rendering Wednesday is events merely a dress rehearsal for what may well turn into a full-blown insurrection.

The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses of the shot and will come with a COVID-19 vaccination card after your first injection is administered. But is that the same as an immunity passport to return to normal activities? What are the differences?The wallet-sized vaccination cards will come with the coronavirus vaccination kits sent out from Operation Warp Speed,according to the US Department of Defense. The cards will be printed in both English and Spanish. So what are coronavirus vaccination cards, and how will they differ from an immunity passport? We answer that and more below.8 coronavirus vaccine myths, debunkedA coronavirus vaccination card is a wallet-sized card that details your personal coronavirus vaccineinformation. It is designed to be a helpful reminder for each person who receives the first shot to be aware of when they need to return to get the booster shot. For example, one vaccine may require that you come back three weeks later, while the other may require that you return in a month for the booster. An immunity passport (or vaccine passport) is not an official US document. Some posit it could serve as an official immunity certificate that would show your immune status after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and allow you to return to normal activities such as international travel. Avaccine passport could take the form of a physical card, a mobile app, a QR code or a sticker on a passport. With an immunity certificate, people could be able to return to the workplace and enter restaurants and stores, for example, and participate in less strict physical distancing measures,according to the Lancet. Currently, immunity passports for coronavirus do not exist, as experts need to le arn more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Your two vaccine shots will need to come from the same company. A COVID-19 vaccination card will not be the same as an immunity passport. Instead, it will serve as a reminder to get your second shot of the vaccine. It also details which vaccine you received -- but that is all. It ca not be used for any other purpose. Immunity passports have been used in other countries for different diseases, like polio, to give international travelers the OK to travel. The immunity passports would certify that an individual is immune to the coronavirus and can the n give people more freedom to travel and socialize in public. When you receive your first shot, the following information will be on the coronavirus vaccination card. Read more:COVID-19 vaccine is flying high and on dry ice to reach youThe COVID-19 vaccine cards will be used to help medical providers keep track of which vaccine was administered to you, so that you receive the correct second dose from the same vaccine manufacturer. For example, if you receive the Pfizer vaccine in the first shot, you will need to receive the Pfizer vaccine in the second shot. The same goes with the Moderna vaccine, since the two are not interchangeable,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(PDF). This is because, while the two vaccines use the same technology that focuses on the mRNA of the virus, they are developed differently. Even if you have received the vaccine, you will still need to wear a mask. Number Even after you receive both doses of the coronavirus vaccine, it is still recommended by the CDCthat you continue to w ear a mask while in public and social distance. ""Experts need to understand more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide,"" the CDC says, before it can make a decision on when to end mask wearing and social distancing.

400,Trump Becomes the First President Since Eisenhower to Change Faiths in Office,0.0,47.0,https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/october/trump-nondenominational-presbyterian-religious-eisenhower.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-27,25,"More than 180,000 people have stopped identifying with the Presbyterian Church (USA) in the past four years, according to official church numbers. Now the re is one more: President Donald Trump. Trumptold Religion News Servicelast week in a written interview mediated by spiritual advisor Paula White-Cain that he does not consider himself to be Presbyterian. He was confirmed in the church and has called himself Presbyterian numerous times over the years. But no more.“I now consider myself to be a non-denominational Christian,” Trumpsaidin the statement. “Melania and I have gotten to visit some amazing churches and meet with great faith leaders from around the world. During the unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak, I tuned into several virtual church services and know that millions of Americans did the same.”While the mainline denomination has previouslychallengedTrump is affiliation, his recent departure seems to be the result of the president slowly moving away from his childhood church and toward a more evangelical faith. Trump was not a regular churchgoer before he was elected president. HeattendedNorman Vincent Peale is church for a while and praises Peale is bookHe has alsoattendedEpiscopal churches for several Christmas and Easter services. In 2016, he was described by one prominent evangelical supporter as a “baby Christian.”Since moving to the White House, however, he has visited many different churches, mostly evangelical and Pentecostal. He has met with numerous ministers, been prayed over, and sought the advice of spiritual counselors like White-Cain, a Florida tel evangelist often associated with the prosperity gospel, who took a position as the Trump administration is faith outreach coordinator last year. City of Destiny, the church White-Cain founded in Florida, is nondenominational. Most Americans do not think Trump has strong religious beliefs,according to the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute poll. Roughly 40 percent say the president “is mostly using religion for political purposes.” White evangelicals who vote Republican see things differently: Fifty-nine percent say Trump has strong religious beliefs. In some ways, Trump is decision to disassociate with a mainline denomination is also part of a larger cultural trend. Many Americans have done the same. In 1975, nearly a third of Americans identified with a mainline denomination. Today, that has dropped to a little more than 10 percent. The Presbyterian Church (USA) has declined from 3.1 million members in 1984 to about 1.3 million today. Membership has dropped by an average of 4.5 percent every year that Trump has been president. Changing religious identification is also common in the USs. Social scientists call this “switching.” This includes dramatic conversions, like when someone has a born-again experience, but also more subtle changes, like when someone moves to a new town and decides to try the local Baptist church instead of another Methodist congregation. Religious switching seems to happen more often when there are a lot of choices—like there are in the USs. And it seems to happen more when people take religion very seriously and think it is an important and distinctive part of their personal identity—like they do in the US In the three-wave Cooperative Congressional Election Study—which surveyed the same individuals in 2010, 2012, and 2014—1 out of every 6 Christians changed their religious identification over four years. Some stopped identifying as Christians and either called the mselves “none” or “nothing in particular.” But about 16 percent changed denomination, including about 20 percent of Presbyterians, who stopped calling the mselves Presbyterian and started calling the mselves something else—often “nondenominational.”Of course, most Americans are not the president. It is highly unusual for the chief executive to change religious identification in office. The last time it happened, Trump was six years old. Dwight Eisenhower was baptized the second Sunday he was in the White House, in January 1953. He was joining the group that Trump is now leaving: the Presbyterians. Eisenhower, like Trump, was not particularly religious before his election. He was raised in a small Anabaptist denomination, which he left when he went to military school. His parents later joined the Bible Students, a group that became the Jehovah is Witnesses. When he was running for office in 1952, the World War II hero is lack of a denomination became an issue. He was called “a man without a church and without a faith.”One of his spiritual advisors, the evangelist Billy Graham, encouraged Eisenhower to set an example for the nation by joining a church, and recommended he become a Presbyterian. Though Graham was a Baptist, he worked across denominational lines, knew the Presbyterian minister in Washington, DC, and thought Eisenhower would feel comfortable at the orderly, formal Sunday service. Eisenhower originally resisted the idea,according to historian Gary Scott Smith, thinking the move would just look cynical and political. He felt his faith was private. He was convinced when one of his staff asked him to think about the nation is children, yanked out of bed every Sunday to go to church, complaining that they should not have to go if the president of the USs did not have to go. The president should set a good religious example. Eisenhower made it a priority in his administration to promote belief in God and religion, in very general terms. He saw religion as a spiritual resource in the Cold War conflict with Communism. He added “under God” to the Pledge of Allegiance and promoted the National Day of Prayer. He spoke frequently about the importance of “a deeply felt religious faith”—most famously when he said, “Our form of government has no sense unless it is founded in a deeply felt religious faith, and I do not care what it is.”Most Americans came to see Eisenhower as a very religious president, though some critiqued him for being specific about his faith. He seemed to promote a generic American religion, which had nothing to do with Jesus or any particulars about God or any theological content. He seemed to have, one person said, “a very fervent believer in a very vague religion.”Today, when the Cold War struggle has been replaced by culture war conflicts, critics see Trump is move from Presbyterian to nondenominational Christian in the opposite light: It is too specific. Instead of trying to represent all Americans with platitudes about “deeply felt faith,” they claim Trump ismakingapoliticalmove,identifyingwith the religious voters he needs at the polls.",2,1,Christianity Today
401,Several tied to Haiti assassination plot were previously US law enforcement informants,0.0,45.67,https://www.cnn.com/2021/07/12/americas/haiti-assassination-plot-us-law-informants/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-12,24,"Several of the men involved in the assassination ofHaiti is Presidentpreviously worked as US law enforcement informants, according to people briefed on the matter, as US investigators grapple with an increasing number of Florida links to the alleged hit squad. Haitian President Jovenel Moise was killed last Wednesday in an operation that Haitian authorities say involved at least 28 people, many of them Colombian mercenaries hired through a Florida-based security company. At least one of the men arrested in connection to the assassination by Haitian authorities previously worked as an informant for the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the DEA said in a statement in response to CNN.“At times, one of the suspects in the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise was a confidential source to the DEA,” the DEA said in a statement. Haitian police arrest suspect accused of orchestrating President is assassination“Following the assassination of President Moise, the suspect reached out to his contacts at the DEA. A DEA official assigned to Haiti urged the suspect to surrender to local authorities and, along with a US State Department official, provided information to the Haitian government that assisted in the surrender and arrest of the suspect and one other individual,” the DEA said. The DEA said it is aware of reports that some assassins yelled “DEA” at the time of their attack. The DEA said in its statement that none of the attackers were operating on behalf of the agency. Other suspects also hadUS ties, including working as informants for the FBI, the people briefed on the matter said. The FBI said in response to CNN is reporting that it does not comment on informants, except to say that it uses “lawful sources to collect intelligence” as part of its investigations. Authorities on Monday announced the arrest of a suspect who they say orchestrated the assassination. Haitian-bornChristian Emmanuel Sanon, 63, entered the country on a private jet in June, Police Chief Leon Charles said at a news conference. Haitian authorities say that Sanon hired the Florida-based company CTU Security, which they alleged recruited men initially to provide security for Sanon, though their mission appears to have changed thereafter.“He came to Haiti accompanied by a few people in the beginning of June, these people were supposed to ensure his security and his business,” said Charles at the news conference. “He came with the intention to take over as President of the Republic.”Two Colombian suspects who were killed in Haiti by police also had links to CTU Security, which is owned by a Venezuelan national, said Colombian police on Monday. They have requested assistance from the US Interpol office to investigate the company is data. It is not clear that the men who worked as US law enforcement informants wittingly participated in the assassination plot or were aware of the mission, the people briefed on the matter said. Haitians hope 'the truth will come out' as foreign investigators probe assassination of their PresidentCNN has not been able to reach Sanon or his representatives for comment since his arrest. A delegation from the US, including representatives from the State Department and Department of Homeland Security, returned from Port-au-Prince on Monday and briefed President Joe Biden,according to the White House. Biden said later on Monday that he was “closely following the events in Haiti,” and that the US was “ready to continue to provide assistance.”Haitian authorities have provided limited details on the investigation, but the growing number of Florida connections to the plot appears to portray an operation at least partly hatched in the USs. Three American citizens have now been arrested in Haiti for their alleged involvement, according to State Department spokesperson Ned Price. That may increase the likelihood that the US Justice Department could bring charges against any US participants in the plot. On Monday, the Justice Department said it would “investigate whether there were any violations of US criminal law” in connection with the assassination. Senior officials have conducted an initial assessment, and the department would continue assisting Haitian authorities to investigate “the facts and circumstances surrounding this heinous attack,” said a spokesperson in a statement.

The shopping district—one of the finest in the Dallas-Fort Worth area—is home to quaint boutiques, fine jewelry stores, and even a selection of parks and green spaces equipped with water fountains. And on Friday, November 6, the family-friendly space was overrun with demonstrators protesting against any declaration of President Donald Trump is defeat in the 2020 presidential election. The protest, organized on social media by a pair of young women who call the mselves the Patriot Sisters, attracted areported75 people, many of whom brandished “Thin Blue Line” American flags and signs emblazoned with the words “TRUMP 2020.” One woman strummed a guitar and sang religious songs, while other protesters prayed and declared that “voter fraud should be stopped in the name of Jesus.”The group also attracted supporters of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory, including one man carrying a cell phone on a self ie stick, which he used to record the protest while chanting religious declarations interspersed with statements about child-trafficking and pedophilia—dog whistles used by QAnon adherents.“We will not lose this nation and allow human trafficking to continue,” the man carrying a self ie stick said in av ideo titled “Prayer Rally for TRUMP! #Trump2020 #PrayForTrump #TheGreatAwakening.”“We will not lose this nation and allow pedophilia to continue…we declare that no darkness will triumph in these last days. Praise you, Jesus,” he said. (The Great Awakening is a term associated with QAnon, as well as with religious-right activists who believe God is using Trump to bring spiritual revival to the US)The Patriot Sisters run popular Instagram and TikTok accounts, which they have used to promote the anti-mask movement, anti-Black Lives Matter rhetoric, and pro-Trump propaganda and misinformation. They have even made a post using the #SaveOurChildren hashtag, which was hijacked by QAnon followers to push falsehoods about the purported exploitation of children by liberal elites. While they may not necessarily be ardent supporters of QAnon, the Patriot Sisters’ attraction of some of the conspiracy theory is impassioned followers not only emphasizes the recently formed overlap between evangelical Christians and QAnon, but also highlights the current state of despair festering within the movement – a despair centered around a single question:What now?Election night was supposed to signal a key moment in Q is long-touted reckoning. The anonymous prophet fueling the QAnon movement spent years flooding the internet with unfounded conspiracies, proclamations about the so-called deep state is cabalistic control of the USs, and Trump is role as the anointed savior fighting off the forces of evil. The posts began on the infamous discussion board 4chan in October 2017, where an anonymous poster claimed to have “Q clearance” granting him access to classified information at the Department of Energy, including nuclear secrets. Q quickly amassed a large following through his posts (known as “Q drops”), and the movement grew among right-wing circles. QAnon eventually morph ed into a virtual cult where supporters claim that a cabal of elite pedophiles made up of Hollywood actors, Democrats, and other high-ranking officials is behind a global child sex-trafficking ring. The unfounded conspiracy theory also alleges that Trump is planning a day of reckoning known as “The Storm,” during which thousands of these deep state actors will be arrested. Many believed that the supposed reckoning and the eventual defeat of the deep state would begin with Trump is victory in the 2020 election. Joe Biden is victory served as a body-blow to the movement is ardent followers. Q is final drop before the election was on the morning of November 3, and featured an Abraham Lincoln quote from 1863, in which the former president declared “that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom.” The drop also bore the image of an American flag and a YouTube link to the the me song of the 1992 film “The Last of the Mohicans.” TheYouTube link was viewed more than 35 million times and features more than 28,000 comments, mainly from loyal followers of the QAnon movement.“This is the Q message board to day,” read one comment. “A genius way to get past the sensors. Seeing all the recent comments makes me proud win or lose. WWG1WGA.” (The code denotes QAnon is best-known slogan, “Where we go one, we go all.”)While Q is followers gathered in earnest to witness a reckoning that never came, Q himself was mysteriously silent. Even the operators of the websiteQ Alerts, which keeps track of the Q drops, attempted to reassure followers regarding their prophet is suspicious absence. “Q has been dark for 9 days. At times Q strategically goes dark for days, weeks or in some cases months. Be sure you have some type of Q Alerts in place so you are notified when Q drops again. If your browser shows a red bell icon at the bottom/right, that is a great place to start.”Q is disappearance (which lasted for nine days until the anonymous figure resurfaced again on November 12) coupled with Trump is defeat in the presidential elections, led to a range of responses from his followers. Some stood their ground and doubled down on the conspiracies, while others began to question whether they the mselves had been fooled. Followers (known as Anons) flooded forums, Telegram chats, and Q-friendly spaces to discuss the events, share their despair, and seek comfort from others.“We Have (sic) been told time & again Trump wins in the end!! Do not give up so easily, if you believe do not give up,” one poster told a QAnon group of several hundred members on Telegram. Another responded that “giving up is NOT an option for me!!”This is not the first time that QAnon believers have faced disappointment. One of the initial claims of the conspiracy theory was that Hillary Clinton would be arrested and imprisoned in 2017. When that did not happen, QAnon followers recalibrated and decided that Clinton had been placed under house arrest and was wearing an ankle bracelet. Even her appearances in public only emboldened them to raise the stakes and claim that the deep state had replaced her with a clone. Then in 2018, Q claimed that Republicans would dominate the midterm elections and reclaim the US House of Representatives. This, of course, did not come to pass, and while this likely impacted some of Q is followers, the movement only continued to grow over the next couple of years. Q is nine days of silence during a critical time in the supposed reckoning left a power vacuum within the cesspool of conspiracies on 8kun, the message board formerly known as 8chan that has been linked to white supremacy, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, various other hate crimes, and multiple mass shootings. Following three mass shootings in 2019 (Christchurch, New Zealand, in March; Poway, California, in April; El Paso, Texas, in August) where each oft he assailants used 8chan as a platform to post their manifestos, 8chan went offline in August 2019 and rebranded in November 2019 as 8kun. While 8kun quickly became a home for Q is posts, the site saw a surprising shift on Election Day. Shortly following Q is November 3 drop, Ron Watkins—son of 8kun owner Jim Watkins—revealedthat he was “resigning as the admin of 8kun effective immediately.” According to the Washington Post, Watkins resigned to focus on his “health and marriage” and that he had “no thoughts or insight” into why Q had not posted in over a week. Given that Watkins was one of a handful of people who could verify Q is drops, several fake Q posts appeared over the following days which caused mass confusion among Anons before being discredited. Others spammed the forums with biblical passages comparing Moses’ miraculous parting of the Red Sea to QAnon is ongoing fight against the deep state. The posts served the purpose of preying on vulnerable believers who were seeking answers for Q is temporary disappearance. For some Anons, their determined and whole-hearted support for the baseless conspiracy theory cost them their marriages and destroyed their families. Those who have gambled on Q being a harbinger of light against the forces of evil cannot afford to turn back now, lest they realize they had sacrificed their loved ones to follow an anonymous internet troll. Faced with little alternative, many have doubled down on their beliefs and converged onto their last resort: unfounded conspiracy the ories alleging widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Major Patriot—a popular twitter account belonging to a QAnon supporter—was among the first to tweet out words of encouragement to his 168,000+ following, claiming that everything was going according to plan for the Trump administration despite the election results:I want to encourage any of you who may be alarmed about what is happening in our nation…Have Faith in God, our President and THE PLAN Rejoice now in VICTORY Do not worry. Do not be afraid. THERE IS A PLAN. IT IS A GOOD PLAN. IT IS BEING EXECUTED — and it will not fail. Many Anons followed suit, including some of the most prominent QAnon-related accounts on social media. They began to share disinformation surrounding the 2020 presidential election. Some pushed doctored videos and fake stories about ballot stuffing, while others propagated hash tags such as Stop the Steal, as well as the alleged ballot “watermarks” conspiracy theory. Everything happens for a reason and It is far from over.@realDonaldTrumpis still the current sitting President of the USs of America. That alone with Election Fraud in plain sight (America is Watching) in lock-step with MSM, I can guarantee you Justice will prevail.pic.twitter.com/z2qKiUu1fA— QAnon Report ⭐⭐⭐ ?? (@QAnon_Report)November 8, 2020The QAnon accounts pushing Trump is disinformation campaign were not limited to the USs. Amazing Polly, arguably the most outspoken QAnon supporter in Canada, has been actively pushing the election fraud narrative on Twitter. Polly, who appears to live in Ontario, is also a vehement anti-vaxxer and believes that COVID-19 was a planned event that helped enable a globalist coup—a claim she admits she inherited from far-right conspiracy-monger Alex Jones. There was also a significant amount of Q-related activity from European followers of the movement, primarily in Germany, Italy, and France, as well as the United Kingdom. It has primarily been embraced by conservatives and the far-right, many of whom view Trump as a potential savior from leaders such as Germany is Chancellor Angela Merkel and France is President Emmanuel Macron. As Anons continued to amplify unfounded claims of widespread election fraud, some viewed the election aftermath as a renewed call to action. Philadelphiapolice arrested two armed men on Thursday November 5, who were targeting the Convention Center where vote-counting was taking place. The two men were found in a Hummer with a decal on the rear window bearing the QAnon slogan WWG1WGA The arrest is a stark reminder that the FBI has labeled QAnon as a potential domestic terrorism threat. QAnon supporters have be encharged with terrorism for driving an armored truck to the Hoover Dam and blocking traffic for several hours,faced murder charges for the March 2019 slaying of Gambino crime family under boss Frank Cali, and kidnapping charges after a QAnon supporter attempted to kidnap one of her children who have been removed from her custody. The potential for violence has not stopped influential Q-adjacent accounts from pushing the election fraud conspiracies on social media. Midnight Rider, another prominent QAnon account with more than half-million followers, has been actively amplifying messages from Trump, Rudy Giuliani, as well as Michael Flynn, who served as national security advisor for the first three weeks of Trump is presidency before resigning. Emboldened by Trump is defiance and hisadministration is refusal to concede the election, the account tweeted on November 11, “Losing never felt so good!”While the QAnon movement has been fueled by despair and denial ism in the aftermath of the election, the movement is not without its small victories. Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene was declared the winner in Georgia is 14th Congressional District, becoming the first QAnon supporter to win a US House seat. She was followed shortly thereafter by mixed martial arts fighter Tito Ortiz, a fellow QAnon supporter who was elected to Huntington Beach City Council. (Author note: Right Wing Watch covered Ortiz is campaign, including his support for the QAnon movement,here.)“Q is a patriot, we know that for sure,” Greenesaidin a 2017 video, which has since been deleted. “There is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out, and I think we have the President to do it.”The congresswoman-elect has spent the last week propagating voter fraud claims and falsely asserting that Trump won the election. She even designed a petition titled “Stop the Biden Steal,” which she hosted on her campaign website. Now the most visible and influential QAnon supporter in American politics, Greene has targeted everyone from President-Elect Biden to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, while also asserting that her husband is experience at the ballot box reflects an ongoing “absentee ballot scam.”Joe Biden is not President-elect. That is a media falsehood. We CAN NOT allow CCP Joe to have National Security Briefings with these SERIOUS allegations. The Presidency is not for sale to the Communist Chinese!#BidenCrimeFamily— Marjorie Taylor Greene ?? (@mtgreenee)November 12, 2020These prominent accounts are merely a handful of the accounts linked to QAnon that have been flooding hash tags and posts on social media. According to the non-profit research group Advance Democracy, QAnon-related accounts were responsible for approximately 10 percent of the tweets amplifying hash tags such as #StopTheSteal. QAnon followers have also been spotted at several pro-Trump Stop the Steal rallies, and have joined forces with other far-right groups in promoting the upcoming Million MAGA March in Washington, DC, on Saturday (aka the March for Trump, Stop the Steal DC). Q followers will be joined by other MAGA loyalists, including the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, and white nationalist “groypers,” as well as professional conspiracy the orists like Alex Jones. By November 12, Anon is rejoiced at their fabled leader is return to 8kun. At 9:32 p.m. Eastern Time, Q posted an American flag along with a short message aimed at rallying his digital troops. “Nothing can stop what is coming. Nothing!” Q wrote. Q followed up with a pair of cryptic posts, which amounted to a series of open-ended questions followed by a link to the National Council of Statewide Interoperability Coordinators. While Q is posts may distract his followers, many of whom are simply relieved that their leader has returned, it remains unclear whether the QAnon fantasy will able to sustain itself over the coming months as the disappointments continue to pile on.

403,Omaha protesters paint harsh picture of jail; officials say they did their best in a bad situation,3.0,44.67,https://omaha.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/omaha-protesters-paint-harsh-picture-of-jail-officials-say-they-did-their-best-in-a/article_d355a9af-143a-5ad4-98c8-85cf5ee39925.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/omaha-world-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,22,"Amanda Humes and Ben Schacht have carefully considered which local protests to attend among several over the past two months. In early June,they attended a vigil for Zachary Bear Heels, who died in 2017 after he was punched and shocked with a Taser by Omaha police officers. Two days later, they marched down Dodge Street to Memorial Park — a week after James Scurlock was killed. Saturday is gathering, which started at Midtown Crossing and was held to stand in solidarity with Portland and demand justice for Scurlock, was near the married couple is residence. They trusted the organizers and took part in the peaceful protest. But they did not return home until early Monday morning, after little sleep and an overnight stay at the Douglas County Jail. What they learned while there is that the arresting and booking process is not a smooth one.“There was this feeling of hopelessness. It did not feel like there was a person in there who was interested in listening or helping,” said Humes, 33. “This feeling that you are up against this system of processing … you do not know where you are in that process or how long it will take.”The 120 protesters who were arrested by Omaha police officers Saturday night near 28th and Farnam Streets bogged down the jail is booking process, despite the fact that Douglas County correctional officers stayed past their shifts and additional officers were called in to handle the influx. Scheduled routine maintenance to the jail is computer system only added to the delays in getting protesters processed and released. Many protesters took to social media or told their family and friends about conditions inside the jail. Some of the allegations included that air conditioning in the cells was turned off, that they were not given food and that the cells were overcrowded. Some protesters contended that the system glitches were deliberate. Douglas County Corrections Director Michael Myers said the allegations are not accurate.“It was just a perfect storm of events,” he said Monday while showing a World-Herald reporter the areas where the protesters were kept. “I do not want to discount people is experiences. It is frustrating to know that we were doing the best that we could with the resources that we had and the space that we had, and to be demonized like that feels unfair.”Myers said the jail is not equipped to handle so many people at one time. Officials had set up a third booking window after the large protests of late May and early June. The change allowed jail workers to book as many as 40 people in one hour, but the Saturday night system reboot jammed up the process. After people are booked, they are patted down and screened for metal or cellphones. They also must turn in any property, other than clothing, visit the medical office and get a booking photo taken, among other steps. Myers said with 100-plus people, all of that takes time. The protesters filled the jail is 66-chair holding area, two large cells, eight small cells and a courtroom waiting room and small gym that officers turned into sleeping quarters with plastic cots. The holding area has 10 phones, which are free to use, two private toilets and drinking fountains. Sometimes on Sunday, Myers said, the large holding cell doors were opened to allow people to freely walk around. Other times, officers switched out groups to let them use the phones and get water. Protesters dispute that phone access and water were readily available. Riley Wilson, who served as a legal observer for a Scottsbluff attorney, said that at one point, 43 men were in one of the large cells, standing-room only. Wilson and others criticized the crowding based on federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that recommend keeping people 6 feet apart to minimize the spread of COVID-19.“Once we were transferred over to the correctional facility, the biggest, scariest thing for me,” Schacht said, “was being in a pandemic and being crammed together. Masks can only protect you so much.”Myers said if the re is a problem with an inmate, jail workers move the people from the waiting room to the cells for safety, and that is what happened. Most of the time, he said, the large cells held about 20 to 25 people.“You ca not social distance here,” he said. “We did the best that we could.”All arrestees are given orange, laundered masks, and most of the protesters wore their own masks, Humes said. Correctional officers are also required to wear masks. Many protesters said the capacity of the large cells was 14. A small sign above those cells — numbers 1 and 6 — say “ICE CAPACITY — 14.” Myers said that if the jail is holding arrestees for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the n only 14 people can be in that cell at once. But these protesters were not arrested on ICE-related charges, so those standards did not apply.“ICE has a lot of standards which exceed normal operating standards,” Myers said. At least one transgender person was arrested and placed into a small holding cell alone. Myers said officials usually allow transgender inmates to be with the gender they identify as, and a committee discusses placement so that the inmate and others are safe, but the committee does not meet on weekends. The protesters were arrested on suspicion of a combination of charges, but mostly failure to disperse and obstructing passage. One person was arrested on suspicion of negligent driving, six with obstructing officers, four with resisting arrest and 11 with unlawful assembly, said Omaha Police Lt. Sherie Thomas, a police spokeswoman.“The protesters started walking in the street against the direction of traffic, the n there were announcements made advising the crowd that they were unlawfully assembling before arrests were made,” Thomas said in an email. Omaha Police Capt. Mark Matuza had said Saturday that the protest “leaned toward the potential of getting violent.” When a World-Herald reporter requested more information about that statement, Thomas said “some intelligence was gathered” and declined to give further details. Wilson, the legal observer, said he did not observe any violence by protesters. He said he did see officers push someone off their bicycle and shoot pepper balls. As they arrested protesters from about 9:30 p.m. to 9:45 p.m., they ordered people to get on the ground and the n put zip ties on their hands. Protesters sat on a bridge along Farnam Street for a few hours before they were taken to the Douglas County Jail, where they waited again.“It was incredibly slow, and it was really painful,” Humes said. “Both my wrists were swollen and bruised from having to lay there like that.”Once inside the jail, Humes said, she was put into a holding cell with other women.“They all yelled, ‘You are 46!’ meaning I was the 46th person to go into this room,” she said. Humes said some people were waiting to get their medication, and others coached a woman through an anxiety attack. At some point, the toilet in the women is cell clogged or overflowed. Myers said that he had not heard about that but that maintenance staff is on hand at all times to fix problems as they arise. Around noon Sunday, Myers said, he authorized his staff to use a paper process to book people and allow them to post their bail because the computers still were not working. About 37 people were released during the day Sunday, and 69 people were released between 3 p.m. and midnight, he said. A few protesters had warrants from other counties and were not allowed to be released, he said. Myers said he was at the jail Sunday, overseeing the holding area. He said he spoke to a gathering of friends and family outside the jail to address their concerns. Myers said he is proud of the way his correctional officers handled the influx of people. Humes said she was able to pay her $500 bail but could not leave the jail until about 10 p.m. Sunday. She waited for her husband for a couple of hours but the n went home. Her husband was released about 1 a.m. Monday. Schacht, Humes and Wilson said they heard officers say that the jail process, charges and financial burden might stymie the arrestees’ future efforts to raise their voices in protest. But they said the situation only bolstered many protesters’ attitudes.“When you hear that, it sure makes you think, this was a very deliberate attempt to send a message,” Wilson said. “If the desired result was to have (protesters) being dissuaded from acting, all they did was intensify their beliefs.”alia.conley@owh.com, 402-444-1068twitter.com/aliaconleyOWHGet the latest in local public safety news with this weekly email.",2,2,Omaha World-Herald

It lasted nine interminable minutes. It ignited our righteous indignation—an oil fire floating on an ocean of grief. Mostpeople felt this way about the video of the murder—yes, murder—of George Floyd last year. The officer responsible, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of three counts on Tuesday for snuffing out a man is life over the course of those nine excruciating minutes. Some observers, though, seem less concerned about the murder of George Floyd and more concerned about—well, it is hard to say what they are concerned about. Some of them are claiming that the trial was a set-up. Rigged. That the jury had it in for Chauvin. Or that Chauvin did not really matter because the real villains were Joe Biden and Maxine Waters and Don Lemon, who somehow managed to pressure the jury into convicting Chauvin on all counts. Probably because they were afraid of cancel culture. It is possible to stipulate all sorts of things here:Yes, President Biden and Representative Waters both made statements they should not have. Watersencourageddemonstrators to get “more active” and “more confrontational” if Chauvin were not convicted, which was not an explicit call to violence but was at least unwise. Bidensaidthat the evidence was “overwhelming” in his view and encouraged the jury to reach “the right verdict” without making explicit what the right verdict was. Neither should have said what they said. Political leaders should be circumspect when offering public commentary about ongoing trials—or better yet, should altogether refrain from commenting. Still, as violations of norms go, these seem more like misdemeanors than felonies. And most importantly: There is no evidence that they swayed the jury. Yet by fixating on all of this, the Extremely Online right has been doing something interesting in the hours since the verdict was announced. They are not willing to be pro-Chauvin, exactly. Well, most of the m, anyway. You do not see a lot of affirmative defenses of Chauvin being mounted, or a lot of folks proclaiming his innocence. But there is an awful lot of anti-anti-Chauvinism. So much so that it might well become the latest article of faith for conservatives in good standing.",1,1,The Bulwark
405,"If Mumia Abu-Jamal is Case Is a ‘Non-Issue,’ Why Have Media Gone to Such Lengths to Silence Him?",-18.33,33.67,https://fair.org/home/if-mumia-abu-jamals-case-is-a-non-issue-why-have-media-gone-to-such-lengths-to-silence-him/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-01,25,"Philadelphia public broadcasterWHYY(4/24/21) was one of the few outlets to report on an April 24 rally seeking the release from prison ofMumia Abu-Jamal. The story included important information on Abu-Jamal, who is serving a life sentence for the 1981 killing of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner. It noted that the case has “drawn scrutiny” over claims of police, prosecutorial and judicial bias and misconduct. It cited new evidence released as part of the appeal process, including a note from a key prosecution witness asking the prosecuting attorney for money—the sort of evidence that Johanna Fernandez, a history professor and part of Abu-Jamal is legal team, notes has in other instances led to a defendant either being set free or getting an immediate new trial. Along with Fernandez, the piece includes the voices of Abu-Jamal is brother Keith Cook, and MOVE member Pam Africa, as well as people who traveled from around the country to call attention to Abu-Jamal is case, his current state of health—he has a number of debilitating conditions, and has just had heart surgery—and to put his story in a context of political prisoners here and around the world. I confess I was still irked byWHYYusing its lead paragraph to frame the story like this:The case has pitted Abu-Jamal is supporters, including a long list of national and international celebrities who say he was framed, against police and their supporters, who resent the attention given to a man convicted of murdering a fellow officer. It bugs me, because those were the the mes decades ago when Abu-Jamal was first convicted and sentenced to death (Voices With Vision,4/27/21). That he was a “cause celebre”—and the refore, wink wink, something something about liberal Hollywood, no need to pay attention—and that the upset of anyone concerned about his deeply flawed trial or his inappropriate sentencing was merely the atrical, because, after all, he was “convicted,” was not he?Elite media at the time were open to straight-up lies: A 1995Washington Poststory (5/18/95) led with a macabre account from Faulkner is widow, Maureen Faulkner, about how when her husband is bloody shirt was held up in court, Abu-Jamal turned around and smiled at her. Except attorney Leonard Weinglass and the court record show that Abu-Jamal was not in court when the shirt was displayed (Extra! Update,8/95). ABC‘s investigative news show20/20(12/9/98) employed a number of techniques for their big 1998 piece—stating prosecution claims as fact, even when they were disputed by some of the prosecution is own witnesses or the forensic record; stressing how a defense witness admitted being intoxicated, while omitting that prosecution witnesses said the same (Extra! Update,2/99). At one point, actor and activist Ed Asner is quoted saying, “No ballistic tests were done, which is pretty stupid”—but the n host Sam Donaldson is voice over cuts him off: “But ballistics testdone,” he says, referring to tests that suggested that the bullet that killed Faulkner might have been the same caliber as Abu-Jamal is gun. But he did not note that tests had not been done to determine whether that gun had fired the bullet, or whether it had been fired at all, or if there were gunpowder residues on Abu-Jamal is hands. Producers fromPeople is Video Networktold FAIR at the time (Extra! Update,2/99) thatABCnot only used clips they’d recorded from Abu-Jamal without permission, but they added layers of echo, making him sound, they said, “like a cave-dwelling animal.”No one was too surprised when it was revealed that in a letter asking permission from the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections to interview Abu-Jamal (a request that was denied),20/20pointed out that “we are currently working in conjunction with Maureen Faulkner and the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police” (Extra! Update,2/99). After that, the main story has been non-coverage. For instance, in 2006, when Abu-Jamal won the right to appeal on three grounds—including a jury purged of Black people, the prosecutor lowering jurors’ sense of responsibility by saying their decision “would not be final,” and the fact that judge Albert Sabo was all kinds of biased—thePhiladelphia Daily Newstold reporter Dave Lindorff that it was a “non-issue” (Extra!,3–4/06)—although when a judge overturned the death sentence in 2001, the paper (12/19/01) found time to editorialize: “Let Mumia Rot in Darkness.”The late great media critic Ed Herman (Extra!,9–10/00) reported how thePhiladelphia Inquirerwould not cover rallies and tribunals in support of Abu-Jamal, calling them “stunts,” but when the Fraternal Order of Police bought a full-page ad in the New York Times, that merited a story. In 2000, when Amnesty International declared that the original trial was “deeply flawed,” theInky(2/18/00) made it the fifth “news brief” on page 2B But if Mumia Abu Jamal is case is a non-issue that only celebrities care about, why the active silencing?In 1994,NPRcancelled plans for a series of commentaries from Abu-Jamal—who is, after all, a journalist, a former head of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists—after Senator Bob Dole threatened their funding. They said it was because it was a “highly polarized and political controversy”—which they proceeded to say nothing about for the following year (Extra!,11–12/95). WhenDemocracy Now!prepared to air commentaries, stationKRTI, out of Philadelphia is Temple University, cancelled the show and all ofPacificanews (Extra! Update,4/97), with a station VP explaining: “What is good enough forNPRis good enough for me.”And when a Vermont college aired a taped commencement address from Abu-Jamal, it led Philadelphia lawmakers to throw together something called the Revictimization Relief Act, allowing crime victims or prosecutors to sue inmates whose behavior behind bars “creates mental anguish” for the victims. Clearly unconstitutional, violating both free speech and due process rights, it was dubbed the Silencing Act by many, who noted that it did not just curtail prisoners’ right to speak, but journalists’ and all of our rights to hear them (FAIR.org,10/22/14). Media is response was a shrug: TheNew York Timesran anAPpiece (10/21/14) with the headline “Pennsylvania: Gov Signs Law to Help Protect Crime Victims.”Elite media would have us believe they are engaged in a serious reckoning with the racism of the US criminal justice system, that they care about over-incarceration and prison conditions. And keeping people behind bars just because powerful people want them the re, and not due to the merits of their case? Well, that is what Other Countries do. If only there were a case, 40 years’ worth of case, that would allow them to explore those ideals—if not to do justice by Mumia Abu-Jamal (they ca not return what is been taken from him), the n to do some semblance of justice by their own claims of concern.",1,1,FAIR
406,"With US hospitals overtaxed by COVID-19, huge numbers died from lack of healthcare access",-15.33,34.33,https://www.salon.com/2021/04/30/with-us-hospitals-overtaxed-by-covid-19-huge-numbers-died-from-lack-of-healthcare-access/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-30,25,"In calculating its human toll, a pandemic is similar to a war. The most precise way public health researchers can get a handle on the impact of something like COVID-19 is to compare the number of total deaths recorded in a specific place during the pandemic with death tallies from prior years. That analysis will yield a figure known as ""excess deaths"" — which simply means deaths above and beyond what would normally be expected. That figure captures not just COVID-19 deaths, but the number of people who were unable to access health care at a moment in their lives when a chronic condition was becoming life-threatening. It also includes individuals whose primary cause of death may have been something else, but who were also infected with COVID-19. And now that the dust has settled and the data are being tabulated, America is excess death numbers over the past year are staggering. The importance of tabulating such a dark statistic is twofold: its record-breaking nature is due to both to our largely for-profit healthcare system, as well as government incompetence. Indeed, for decades our government ignored the warnings from public health experts that the US was not properly prepared for the pandemic we are living through now. It is not like no one could saw the pandemic coming. In his book""The Great Influenza"",first published in 2004, John M Barry presaged the COVID-19 crisis, describing how ""hospitals, like every other industry, have gotten more efficient by cutting costs, which means virtually no excess capacity — on a per capita basis the USs has far fewer hospital beds than a few decades ago.""He continued. ""Indeed, during a routine influenza season, usage of respirators rises to nearly 100 percent; in a pandemic, most people who needed a mechanical respirator would not get one.""As we have learned first-hand over the last several months, because the healthcare system wasoverwhelmed, getting accurate cause of death data was itself a work in progress. No doubt huge numbers of cases of COVID-19 may have been missed. In other instances, individuals may have died at home or succumbed to a chronic illness that was written off as COVID when it was not. The one constant comparative data point is death itself from any and all causes. Like births, deaths are something we track with some precision. Hence, one way that medical researchers can get a sense of the scale of the impact of something like COVID is to compare the total number of deaths from all causes during the pandemic and compare it with the same data point over several prior years. Such an ""excess death"" analysis will capture the collateral impact of overwhelmed healthcare systems that were under-resourced long before the pandemic. It will include the people that died as a consequence of opting not to go to the hospital for an unrelated condition for fear of catching COVID-19. While that might not count as a COVID-19 death per se, it tells us something about what happens when we permit healthcare to operate without any margin or redundancy — what is effectively a form of rationing healthcare. According to a recently published study in theJournal of the American Medical Association, which looked at the rate of excess deaths from March 1, 2020, to January 2, 2021, there were 522,368 ""excess deaths,"" as gauged against averages over the same period from 2014 to 2019. At the start of this year, COVID-19 deaths were reported at just over 350,186. By comparing the ""excess rate"" of death with the COVID-19 reported data, linked to its location, we can get some sense of where the public health system had the hardest time holding up under the once-in-a-century strain of a mass death event. The study, produced by researchers with the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine in Richmond and the Yale School of Public Health, calculated that COVID-19 accounted for 72.4 percent of the excess mortality. The balance may have been ""either immediate or delayed mortality from undocumented COVID-19 infection, or non-COVID-19 deaths secondary to the pandemic, such as from delayed care or behavioral health crises.""While nationally there was a 23 percent increase in excess mortality during the pandemic, New York State, which lost close to 50,000 to COVID, saw the nation is highest spike, with a 38 percent jump in excess deaths — though Mississippi and New Jersey actually exceeded New York State on a per capita basis, according to the researchers. In an editorial that was published with the study,Dr. Alan M Garberwrote of the importance of grasping the bigger picture, beyond the daily COVID dashboard. ""There is no more visible or alarming manifestation of the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic than the deaths it has caused,"" he noted.""The missteps in responding to an outbreak that not only could be, but largely was, predicted should not give governments confidence that they are prepared for threats that are more speculative and possibly further in the future,"" Garber continued. ""Failure to anticipate the scale of the potential damage from such future catastrophes will only exacerbate the tendency to downplay their importance, making it less likely that governments will prepare adequately. That is why understanding the toll of a pandemic is an important step in the right direction.""In New York City, where COVID killed more than 32,000 city residents, fighting the virus inspired life-saving innovations. It also exposed long-standing healthcare disparities that left some neighborhoods more at the mercy of the highly contagious and deadly virus, according to Dr. Mitch Katz, the CEO of New York City Health + Hospitals. NYC H+H, the nation is largest municipal hospital system, includes 11 hospitals and saw some of the highest patient death counts early on. Over the course of the pandemic, thousands of H+H workers from a myriad of job titles were sidelined by the deadly virus, which took the lives of 53 employees. It was in the throes of this nearly unprecedented public health emergency that H+H found ways to improve patient care while at the same time reducing the exposure of staff to the deadly virus which helped to slow the spread of the virus.""We have done a lot of work from the first wave about putting glass doors in, or glass in the walls to create a window for cameras in the patient rooms — microphones so that patients can be monitored safely without going into the room . . . and that is a positive development whether the re is COVID or some other infectious disease,"" Dr. Katz said during a phone interview. ""So, I think we learned how to make our hospitals safer for the care of patients with infectious diseases.""For Dr. Katz, one of the most sobering discoveries was how pre-existing disparities in the city is private and public hospital infrastructure left some communities so much more vulnerable during the pandemic.""I think the fact that we had so many fewer hospital beds in Queens compared to Manhattan was one of the stark lessons,"" he said. ""That is part of why it was so much more challenging to deal with the pandemic in Queens and Elmhurst Hospitals was because there were so few beds compared to the size of the population in Queens compared to Manhattan and other parts of New York State. The discrepancy in the number of beds I'd say was an issue.""Dr. Katz established a national reputation leading the public hospital systems in San Francisco and Los Angeles before returning home to New York. After years of experience on the front lines of urban healthcare on both coasts, he believes that the nation is vulnerability to COVID-19 can be traced back to a steady disinvestment in public health that started during the Reagan era.""Yes, the pandemic shows how we have to build up our public health infrastructure so that we are better prepared for what people need,"" he said. As the city, state and federal governments all attempt to regroup after the death of more than a half-million and the infection of well over 30 million, Dr. Katz believes policy makers would be well advised to consult the data not just on COVID deaths per se, but on excess mortality rates referenced by neighborhoods.""Absolutely, and I think we have some sense already of the excess mortality that occurred both among people who had COVID and did not come forward for testing,"" he said. ""Some of those people were undocumented immigrants or people who were very low income and feared coming forward to a hospital.""Some of that excess mortality we know where people who were having heart attacks or other serious health conditions and did not come forward for care because they were so frightened of catching COVID from the hospital. So, I think the excess mortality is very helpful frankly it does not have to be exact. We can all acknowledge there were a number of people who died and did not have a COVID test. It is the general population trend that matters.""If America is to get well, which is the first step to escaping the undertow of this pandemic and preparing for staving off the next, we have to uplift these places where regular access to quality healthcare was a socio-economic preexisting condition that helped drive the local body count. Our own individual health is linked to the health of our neighbor. That is not scripture. That is biology.",1,1,Salon
407,The countries that will be first in line to get a coronavirus vaccine,-1.67,51.33,https://qz.com/1884905/who-will-get-the-coronavirus-vaccine-first/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,25,"If scientists find a successful coronavirus vaccine—which is still “if,” rather than “when”—the companies that own the rights will face the difficult question of who gets the first doses. Researching and producing a vaccine costs billions of dollars, so governments around the world are offering major funding in exchange for the promise of early batches. Inevitably, the richest countries are more likely to get a vaccine fastest. The table below shows ongoing public deals for the first vaccines being developed by different companies, in order of the country or institution that has pre-ordered the greatest number of doses. Some of these deals, including the two within the European Union and the UK is deal with Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline, are still in negotiation. Others did not disclose the volume of vaccines to be produced: Israel is working to source vaccines from Moderna and AstraZeneca, for example. While the US and India is Serum Institute are snapping up the greatest volume of pre-orders, not all deals are made equal. AstraZeneca is arrangements with Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the Serum Institute of India are intended to distribute the vaccine to low-and-middle income countries. Russia is drugmaker R-Pharmplans to distribute AstraZeneca is vaccineinternationally, while Brazil licensed the ability to produce it domestically. The biggest dealsdo not necessarily line upwith the most advanced vaccine trials. Currently, six institutions are conducting phase three trials, the large-scale efficacy studies that are the final hurdle before drug approval. One of these trials does not have particularly promising results, but is in advanced stages because it is testing an approved tuberculosis vaccine. That leaves five vaccines in late-stage trials. One is created by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, which is fielding four different deals. Pfizer and Moderna announced the start of their phase three trial son July 27. And two are created by Chinese companies: Sinopharm and Sinovac. Those two companies are notably underrepresented among existing deals. China is president President Xi Jinpingtold the World Health Organization (WHO) in Maythat any vaccine developed nationally would be a “global public good.” But while AstraZeneca and Pfizer have made commitments in exchange for funding, the Chinese companies’ arrangements are less clear. Sinovac is offering some vaccines in exchange for conducting trials internationally: The company has a licensing agreement with Brazil, while a Bangladesh health ministry official told Reutersthe country would “get priority” for any vaccine successfully developed. Sinopharm has not made such clear-cut public deals. The comparative lack of funding for Chinese companies means they have less means to bulk up production. AstraZeneca has committed to producing2 billion doses, and expects to deliver much of this by early 2021. Pfizer, which is collaborating with German company BioNTech and Chinese company Fosun Pharma, said it expects to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. In comparison, Sinopharm is expanding production to200 million vaccine doses a year, while Sinovac Biotech is building a plant to make 100 million doses a year. Once a successful vaccine is created, the re is some incentive to share: The pandemic will not die out until it is addressed globally. The chief executive of the vaccine alliance Gavi, Seth Berkley, says the priority should be for every country to get a vaccine to20% of their population. But as long as supplies are limited, it is likely that countries will put their own citizens first.

408,Medicaid Expansion Has Passed Every Time It is Been on the Ballot,-12.67,39.33,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2020/08/06/medicaid-expansion-has-passed-every-time-its-been-on-the-ballot/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,25,"It is never a good idea to put too much stock in issue polls. As we have seen time and time again, the wording of the question often determines the outcome. But when it comes to health care—and especially Medicaid expansion—we do not need polls, because even voters in red states are making it clear that they are not aligned with Republicans. On Tuesday, Missouri became the seventh state to expand Medicaid since Donald Trump was inaugurated. All but one of those states (Virginia) did so by referendum at the ballot box. Youcan now add Missouri to the group of orange states on this map. The 53 percent of Missourianswho voted to expand Medicaid probably did so for a variety of reasons, like the fact that an additional 230,000 people will gain insurance coverage, or the fact that a refusal to expand the program has contributed to the closing of 10 rural hospitals in that state since 2014. There is also this concern:“Quite frankly, Missourians are sick and tired of not getting their fair share. They pay their taxes, they have seen now 37 other states use that money to expand access to health care. Meanwhile, our economy is clearly ailing here,” Jack Cardetti, the campaign is spokesperson, said last week. As Sarah Kliffexplains, the group that is behind the strategy of putting Medicaid expansion on the ballot is the Fairness Project. So far, they have had a massive impact, expanding the program to cover an additional one million low-income Americans. Their next target is Florida, which, if passed, would add coverage for an additional 800,000. Republican governors and legislators have fought these gains every step of the way. But Medicaid expansion has passed whenever it has been put on the ballot. The lesson here is that, even as Trump and Republicans ask the Supreme Court to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act, their own constituents in red states are telling them that they support a critical element of what that legislation accomplished. A party that actually cared about what American voters want would be paying attention.",1,1,Washington Monthly

US District Judge Robert Pitman minced no words in a 113-page takedown of the law. Acknowledging that his was not the last word in a case that is likely headed to the Supreme Court, Pitman basically said he did not care—he was not going to stay his judgment. That is going to be up to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. For Pitman is part, “The State has forfeited the right to any such accommodation by pursuing an unprecedented and aggressive scheme to deprive its citizens of a significant and well-established constitutional right. From the moment SB 8 went into effect, women have been unlawfully prevented from exercising control over their lives in ways that are protected by the Constitution. That other courts may find a way to avoid this conclusion is theirs to decide; this Court will not sanction one more day of this offensive deprivation of such an important right.”As predicted, Texas is appealing.“Though the court is ruling offers a sigh of relief, the threat of Texas’ abortion ban still looms over the state as cases continue to move through the courts. We already know the politicians behind this law will stop at nothing until they have banned abortion entirely,” the American Civil Liberties Union is (ACLU) Brigitte Amirisaid in a statement. “This fight is far from over, and we are ready to do everything we can to make sure every person can get the abortion care they need regardless of where they live or how much they make.”The lawsuit was brought by the Biden administration, and in a Twitter thread analyzing Pitman is decision, Imani Gandyhighlights Pitman is rebuttal to Texas’ argument that the USs government has not suffered harm from the abortion ban, which allows to sue any person who “aids or abets” an abortion performed after six weeks for $10,000 and attorneys’ fees. Pitman offers a list of federal agencies that “aid or abet” abortions, exposing the agencies or their employees to vigilante claims under the Texas law. But the next courts to hear the case are dominated by partisan Republicans who … do not really care about the law, let alone women is right to self-determination or privacy or medical care. Pitman methodically answered many of the outs Texas was trying to use, but the higher courts may still embrace those, dismissing precedent and logic and common f’ing sense. Texas is not even the main game in far-right efforts to overturn, though. That is coming on December 1 in Supreme Court arguments abo uta Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks, with Mississippi officials making clear that yes, this is an effort to overturnRoe. It is all too likely that the Trump Supreme Court will jump on this chance to gut women is reproductive rights. In response to that imminent threat, a group of reproductive rights groups have shifted their stance on the filibuster, coming out in favor of filibuster reform or abolition for the first time. “We will not stand for senators hiding behind the abortion issue and opposing reform in our name,” said Shaunna Thomas of UltraViolet. “We cannot rely on the courts right now, so we are working with what we have, which is a Dem majority which has promised two things to the women of color who put them in office—the right to vote and the right to control when they have children.”",1,1,Daily Kos
412,‘From hearsay to hard evidence’: are UFOs about to go mainstream?,-0.33,43.67,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/29/ufos-uap-america-pentagon-report,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-29,25,"Nick Pope spent the early 1990s investigatingUFOsfor the British ministry of defence. Sequestered in a rarely visited government office – the “metaphorical basement” – he well remembers how his field of work was regarded.“I would walk down the corridor and people would whistle the the me music to either Close Encounters of the Third Kind or the Twilight Zone,” Pope told the Guardian. Towards the end of his spell at the MoD, a new science fiction show featuring a pair of FBI alien hunters was also growing in popularity. “I do recall the X-Files the me tune being whistled, too,” he said. In the nearly two decades since the n, attitudes towards UFOs have slowly been changing, especially in America where the subject matter has gone from the margins to the mainstream, with even former president Barack Obama opining on their potential existence. Rebranded by governments and enthusiasts as “UAPs”, or unidentified aerial phenomena, 2021 has seen arguably the first ever serious discussion of unknown flying things. In June the Pentagon is set to release a highly anticipated report on what it knows about UAPs, and the excitement about that disclosure has been fueled by a slew of witnesses coming forward to share their experiences with the 60 Minutes news show in May Obama was among many public figures to add his thoughts on UAPs and the Pentagon report this month.“There is footage and records of objects in the skies, that we do not know exactly what they are, we ca not explain how they moved, their trajectory,” Obama said i nan interview with CBS. “They did not have an easily explainable pattern. And so, you know I think that people still take seriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is.”The sincerity of the discussion around UAPs – “I want us to take it seriously and have a process to take it seriously,” the Republican senator Marco Rubio told 60 Minutes – is a far cry from the jeers Pope once faced. So what has changed in America?“In the last three years it has been elevated above just hearsay and segued into hard evidence,” said Pope, who is now based in Arizona, said. “Not just the testimony from military pilots who have been involved in encounters with these things, but radar data and the infra-red camera videos that everyone is seen.”In recent years a series of government videos showing UAPs, have been released, including footage from a navy F-18 fighter jet which showed an oblong object flying through the sky near San Diego in 2004. This April photos and videos taken by navy personnel wereleakedonline, showing triangular-shaped objects buzzing around in the sky, and in May leaked military footage showed an oval flying object near a navy ship in San Diego – an apparent UAP hotspot. Members of the navy saw UAPs so frequently that the encounters became commonplace, Ryan Graves, a retired navy pilot, told 60 Minutes.“Every day,” Graves said. “Every day for at least a couple years.”For Ted Roe, who runs the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena, a non-profit where pilots or others can report their experiences with UAPs, this was merely confirmation of what he already knew.“That does not surprise me at all,” Roe said. “Somewhere in the world every day this is happening – it manifests steadily, daily. And from my private conversations with current and former military fliers I feel that the reports that I get – as far as pilot reports – are clearly the tip of the iceberg.”But for all the apparent easing of taboo around UAPs, Roe says there is still a stigma.“Nobody is willing to risk their careers or reputation on this subject, even now,” Roe said. “Pilots will not contact us until they retire. I’d say it is almost 50-50, the cases I get, that are more recent, versus those that happened years ago and they did not want totalk about because they would lose their flight status, and because they were worried about their careers.”The government – all governments – have previously been reluctant to even acknowledge that they monitor UAPs. In 2007 the US defense department launched an “Advanced aerospace threat identification program” to investigate UFOs. The effort was so secretive that the public was only made aware of it 10 years later, af tera New York Times investigation. As leaked or officially published footage has spread, however, demands for transparency from the public and politicians has grown, prompting the CIA to release thousands of documents on UAPs in January 2021. Rubio, the vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, has been a particularly loud voice, and he was part of a group of elected officials who succeeded in thrusting theIntelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021into the $2.3tn coronavirus relief spending bill signed into law by Donald Trump in December. That act ordered government agencies to provide a declassified “detailed analysis of unidentified aerial phenomena data and intelligence”, and “a detailed description of an interagency process” for reporting UFOs. The report must be handed over by 25 June.“Men and women we have entrusted with the defense of our country are reporting encounters with unidentified aircraft with superior capabilities,” Rubio told the Tampa Bay Timesin mid-May“We cannot allow the stigma of UFOs to keep us from seriously investigating this. The forthcoming report is one step in that process, but it will not be the last.”The flurry of recent videos and the imminent release of the report has ignited an excitement around unidentified flying things not seen for years. Pope warned, however, that after years of furtiveness from intelligence agencies, people should not expect the government to release it knows about these mysterious objects in the sky.“The report must be unclassified, but it could have a classified annex, so the re is a strong possibility that any earth-shattering facts will be in that classified annex, rather than the unclassified report,” Pope said. He added: “So people should be excited, but not too excited. They should be pragmatic, and a little expectation management might be useful.”",1,1,The Guardian

Within hours, Taliban fighters were trickling into the city center with little resistance. The Taliban had already swept in and captured the capital city of Kabul. By nightfall, President Ashraf Ghani had fled the country, and the Taliban is reconquest of Afghanistan was complete. The idea that the Taliban were ever interested in peace talks was dubious before. Last Monday in Doha, Qatar — the site of fruitless peace talks with the Taliban across now two administrations — the US envoy to those talks announced his intention to ""press the Taliban"" for an end to their offensive across Afghanistan. It was a naive statement even at the time, and it has not improved in the week since. The Taliban had already been pressing at the gates of several provincial Afghan capitals. Having withdrawn troops from the country, the US lacked whatever leverage it once had in negotiations with the insurgent group. But the White House appeared confident. ""Ultimately, our view is that the Afghan security forces have the equipment, numbers and training to fight back that will strengthen their position at the negotiating table,""White House press secretary Jen Psaki insistedTuesday. What negotiating table? The idea that the Taliban were ever interested in peace talks was dubious before. By the middle of last week, it was downright fanciful. And in the hours that passed after Psaki made this ponderous pronouncement, the Taliban took one city after another. Like dominoes, Herat, Ghazni, Kunduz, Lashkar Gah and Kandahar fell to insurgents. In the process,Taliban fighters took control of millions of dollars' worth of vehicles, helicopters, offensive weaponry and advanced military infrastructure.""The Taliban,"" Psakiobserved last week, ""has to make an assessment about what they want their role to be in the international community."" This was hardly an errant thought. On August 8, the US Embassy in the Afghan capital had admonished the Taliban for sacrificing the ""international legitimacy"" they claim to want. ""They should devote their energy to the #PeaceProcess,"" read a statement from the Kabul embassy is Twitter account, ""not a military campaign. #CeasefireNow."" For now, the ""promise of hashtag"" remains unrealized. Like dominoes, Herat, Ghazni, Kunduz, Lashkar Gah and Kandahar fell to insurgents. The White House is irresolvable confusion notwithstanding, the Taliban had made it perfectly clear what their intentions were. As the insurgency retook Afghan territory, it resumed its abhorrent treatment of women and girls. Taliban members are reported to have targeted women with death for operating in professions or wearing clothing that offends the former leaders of the Islamic emirate. It has begun shuttering girls' school swith the intention of keeping them closed for good and relegating their students back to the shadows of Afghan society. And according to Human Rights Watch, the Taliban have been summarily executing Afghan civilians linked to the government— a development Secretary of State Antony Blinken meekly said was ""troubling."" Already, the Afghans who put their lives on the line to assist the US Army over the last decades are reported to have been beheaded, a grotesque dereliction of our duty to the Afghans who foolishly believed in the US These were the very same people we spent months talking ""peace"" with, demoralizing our Afghan allies in the process, only to abandon the charade and the country with it when it became clear that the Taliban were not going to let us take the easy way out. As recently as July, President Joe Biden insisted that it was ""not inevitable"" that the Taliban would retake control of the country. ""The likelihood that the re is going to be a Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely,""Biden reassured the public. By the middle of last week, intelligence officials who had thought it would take the Taliban a year to complete their reconquest of the country revised their estimates. Kabul would be cut off in the next 30 days, they warned. The city and the US-backed government would fall to the Taliban before the year is end. But even that was deliriously optimistic. Collapse came not in weeks but over the course of a single weekend. Kabul was all but surrounded not in 30 days but in 72 hours after these revised estimates were made public. The US, which had hoped to preserve its diplomatic presence in its embassy — it even sent 3,000 troops to ensure that prospect — summarily abandoned the place and evacuated all but a skeleton crew. There may not have even been enough time to carry out orders to burn sensitivedocuments, agency logos and even US flags— lest the American public have to confront the wages of our defeat on their television screens. The Biden White House is belief in a Taliban that existed only in their own minds was so total that one of the administration is last, desperate gambits was to beg the insurgency for mercy. The New York Timesreported as recently as Thursday that the US envoy in Doha had a new objective: to seek assurances from the Taliban that they would leave America is embassy in peace. The administration was even reported to have dangled ""financial aid and other assistance"" to the ""future Afghan government,"" a euphemism for a Taliban-run enterprise. These were the very same people we spent months talking ""peace"" with, demoralizing our Afghan allies in the process. Given the Taliban is commitment to violence and its refusal to renounce its ties to Islamist terrorist groups, such assurances — even if they were forthcoming — would not be worth a dime. Such a deal would only have legitimized an entity the Biden administration insists is illegitimate by virtue of the tactics it is using to seize power. And in the end, it would only have preserved a diplomatic presence in a capital city operated by a government Washington does not recognize. What were they thinking?With the near total collapse of the Afghan armed forces, the Biden administration was left to articulate its last, most demoralizing argument in favor of total withdrawal — we are powerless to alter the course of events and should accept our utter futility. Over the weekend, the president released a written statement outlining the rationale that led to our unilateral declaration of defeat. ""One more year, or five more years, of US military presence would not have made a difference if the Afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country,"" Biden insisted. The president is dubious exercise in clairvoyance notwithstanding, a review of even the recent past does not support this kind of fatalism. The notion that the Afghan conflict looked the same in 2021 as it did in 2016 is downright hallucinatory. The US and NATO formally ended combat operations in Afghanistan at the end of 2014. In the years that followed, the American mission had been limited to support operations for local forces, many of which took place from behind the high walls of US-run facilities. To the extent that America is modest, affordable and low-risk footprint in Afghanistan maintained the peace, it was largely as a deterrent force that dissuaded the Taliban from embarking on the broad offensive now underway. The lastAmerican combat-related deathin Afghanistan occurred on February 8, 2020. Every US soldier is death in service to the country is tragic, and their sacrifices must be honored. But to call that an unacceptable level of risk calls into question US deployments to places like Kosovo, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain and Kuwait, whereUS soldiers also lost their lives last year. And yet, the happy fallacy Biden may come to regret putting his faith in most is the notion that the US was desperate to dissolve our commitments to the Afghan people and would celebrate that achievement. Where are the sighs of relief from a grateful public? Where are the celebrations? If Brookings Institution scholars Madiha Afzal and Israa Saber are right, the Biden administration has misread the national mood.""The public seems to be partly ambivalent, partly divided on the correct course of action,""they wrote in a careful dissection of recent polling on the American presence in Afghanistan. ""What is clear is that the common refrain in policy debates that 'Americans want out' is not accurate and should not be presented as the driving force for efforts to withdraw from Afghanistan.""That idea — the notion that the American public longed for this humiliation — may prove to be just another delusion. And a terribly costly one, at that. Noah Rothman is the associate editor of Commentary Magazine.",1,1,MSNBC
414,Democrats are furious Trump is DOJ got lawmakers’ data from Apple,-7.67,40.0,https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/6/11/22530070/trump-doj-apple-data-schiff,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-11,25,"Democratic lawmakers are calling for an investigation into the Trump administration is Department of Justice (DOJ) and its use of subpoenas to obtain device metad ata belonging to at least two members of Congress. They say it is a disturbing attack on the separation of powers, the principle of keeping the operations of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches generally separate from one another. The calls for oversight follow aNew York Times report revealing that the DOJ made Apple turn over records from several people associated with the House Intelligence Committee — including Representative Adam Schiff, Representative Eric Swalwell, their staff and family, one of whom was a minor — in the midst of an investigation into people leaking classified information. While the seizure of this data happened back in 2017 and 2018, a DOJ gag order kept Apple from informing the representatives until just last month when they received an email notification from the company. Now, members are reportedly racing to gather more details from Apple about the scope of the DOJ subpoena, and the DOJ is top national security official, a Trump appointee, has resigned. At the same time, the DOJ is pursuit of phone data went beyond those lawmakers. In February 2018, the department also sought communications data about an Apple account belonging to former White House counsel Don McGahn, according to a New York Times report published on Sunday. It is not yet clear why the DOJ sought that data, and Apple only notified McGahn about the subpoena last month. That the Department of Justice sought the private phone data of US lawmakers without their knowledge is remarkable and disturbing. While details are still emerging, the exchange sets a concerning precedent about the ability of the executive branch to obtain the digital records of lawmakers as well as tech companies’ roles in complying with such orders. Attention has now turned to both Apple and the DOJ, and it has raised concerns over how each approaches controversial government demands for sensitive data. It is unclear what data Apple actually handed over. Apple did not respond to Recode is request for comment. Recent reporting indicates that the information shared with the DOJ about members of Congress and staff were provided through the company is standard procedure of obliging government requests for data, and thatApple was not awa reit was handing over data belonging to members of Congress. Still, Democrats are outraged, calling the seizure of this data “an assault” on the separation of powers. They say the subpoenas constituted dangerously broad government surveillance deployed in service of the political interests of the n-President Donald Trump.“President Trump repeatedly and flagrantly demanded that the Department of Justice carry out his political will and tried to use the Department as a cudgel against his political opponents and members of the media,” Representative Schiff told Recode in a statement. “It is increasingly apparent that those demands did not fall on deaf ears.”RelatedThe DOJ is inspector general, Michael Horowitz,announcedon Friday that he will start a review of the agency is actions under the Trump administration and will look at “whether any such uses, or the investigations, were based upon improper considerations.” Senator Ron Wydenhas also promised to introduce legislation aimed at “reform[ing] the abuse of gag orders” and increasing transparency into government surveillance. On Monday, the New York Timesreportedthat John Demers, head of the DOJ is national security division and one of the the last remaining Trump appointees at the department, would resign following the outcry. While Demers did not become the DOJ is top national security official until after the subpoenas for Democrats’ records were sent, some want to know what Demers knew about the ongoing investigations. Companies like Apple frequently hand over user data when government agencies demand it. Here is how Recode is Sara Morrison explained it last year. Depending on what law enforcement is looking for, it may not need physical possession of your device at all. A lot of information on your phone is also stored elsewhere. For example, if you back up your iPhone to Apple is iCloud, the government can get it from Apple. If it needs to see whose DMs you slid into, law enforcement can contact Twitter. As long as they go through the proper and established legal channels to get it, police can get their hands on pretty much anything you have stored outside of your device. You do have some rights here. The Fourth Amendment protects you from illegal search and seizure, and a provision of theElectronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986(ECPA) dictates what law enforcement must obtain in order to get the information. It might be a subpoena, court order, or warrant, depending on what it is looking for. (WhatsApp actually does a good job of explaining this in its FAQ.) A section of the ECPA, known as the Stored Communications Act, says that service providers must have those orders before they can give the requested information to law enforcement. But, assuming the government has the right paperwork, your information is very obtainable. On Apple is US-focusedtransparency website, the company says it can receive government requests related to a person is device identifier, financial identifiers, customer data related to account information, and customer data requested in the midst of an emergency. In the case of the DOJ is investigation into leaks, Appleturned over metad ata and account information, according to the Times.“In this case, the subpoena, which was issued by a federal grand jury and included a nondisclosure order signed by a federal magistrate judge, provided no information on the nature of the investigation, and it would have been virtually impossible for Apple to understand the intent of the desired information without digging through users’ accounts,” a company spokesperson, Fred Sainz, told the New York Times. “Consistent with the request, Apple limited the information it provided to account subscriber information and did not provide any content such as em ails or pictures.”“These demands for lawmakers’ private data are especially disturbing because they threaten the separation of powers. But the problem is far bigger,” ACLU senior attorney Patrick Toomey told Recode in an email. “The government seizes the sensitive information of vast numbers of people each year, often without any notice to the people affected.”Tech companies do have some power when they receive these kinds of requests. They can try to reject a government request as being invalid, though they often do not. Challenging such a request can also be hard to do if a company has limited information on what the request is actually for. Apple says that between January and June 2020, the company provided data 82 percent of the time when a government agency requested identifying information about a particular device. Tech companies can also try to fight a gag order. In this case, a gag order seemed to remain in place. This is concerning. At the same time, the seizure of this kind of data is a dark reminder that companies like Apple continue to hold onto vast amounts of user data and that they can be legally obligated to hand it over to the government without a user ever knowing. This story includes new information reported about Apple and about the resignation of a DOJ official. ",1,1,Vox
415,"Chaos, violence, mockery as pro-Trump mob occupies Congress",-5.33,45.0,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/1/6/22217370/police-order-evacuation-buildings-capitol-hill,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-07,25,"WASHINGTON — “Where are the y?” a Trump supporter demanded in a crowd of dozens roaming the halls of the Capitol, bearing Trump flags and pounding on doors. They — lawmakers, staff members and more — were hiding under tables, hunkered in lockdowns, saying prayers and seeing the fruits of the country is divisions up close and violent. Guns were drawn. A woman was shot and killed by police, and three others died in apparent medical emergencies. A Trump flag hung on the Capitol. The graceful Rotunda reeked of tear gas. Glass shattered. On Wednesday, hallowed spaces of American democracy, one after another, yielded to the occupation of Congress. The pro-Trump mob took over the presiding officer is chair in the Senate, the offices of the House speaker and the Senate dais, where one yelled, “Trump won that election.”They mocked its leaders, posing for photos in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one with his feet propped on a desk in her office, another sitting in the same seat Vice President Mike Pence had occupied only moments before during the proceedings to certify the Electoral College vote. That certification would eventually take place, but not until well after midnight. This began as a day of reckoning for President Donald Trump is futile attempt to cling to power as Congress took up the certification of President-elect Joe Biden is victory. It devolved into scenes of fear and agony that left a prime ritual of American democracy in tatters. Trump told his morning crowd at the Ellipse that he would go with them to the Capitol, but he did not. Instead he sent them off with incendiary rhetoric.“If you do not fight like hell, you are not going to have a country anymore,” he said. “Let the weak ones get out,” he went on. “This is a time for strength.”His lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, told the crowd, “Let is have trial by combat.”What happened Wednesday was nothing less than an attempted coup, said Representative Diana DeGette, D-Colo. Senator Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent Trump critic, said, “Today, the USs Capitol — the world is greatest symbol of self-government — was ransacked while the leader of the free world cowered behind his keyboard.”Sasse went on: “Lies have consequences. This violence was the inevitable and ugly outcome of the president is addiction to constantly stoking division.”Police said they recovered two pipe bombs, one outside the Democratic National Committee and one outside the Republican National Committee and a cooler from a vehicle that had a long gun and Molotov cocktail on Capitol grounds. Yet Trump, in a video posted 90 minutes after lawmakers were evacuated, told the insurrectionists “We love you. You are very special,” while asking them to go home. Authorities eventually regained control as night fell. Heavily armed officers brought in as reinforcements started using tear gas in a coordinated effort to get people moving toward the door, the n combed the halls for stragglers, pushing the mob farther out onto the plaza and lawn, in clouds of tear gas, flash-bangs and percussion grenades. Video footage also showed officers letting people calmly walk out the doors of the Capitol despite the rioting and vandalism. Only about a dozen arrests were made in the hours after authorities regained control. They said a woman was shot earlier as the mob tried to break through a barricaded door in the Capitol where police were armed on the other side. She was hospitalized with a gunshot wound and later died. Early on, some inside the Capitol saw the trouble coming outside the windows. Democratic Representative Dean Phillips of Minnesota surveyed the growing crowd on the grounds not long after Trump had addressed his supporters by the Ellipse, fueling their grievances over an election that he and they say he won, against all evidence.“I looked out the windows and could see how outmanned the Capitol Police were,” Phillips said. Under the very risers set up for Biden is inauguration, Trump supporters clashed with police who blasted pepper spray in an attempt to hold them back. It did not work. Throngs of mask less MAGA-hatted demonstrators to re down metal barricades at the bottom of the Capitol is steps. Some in the crowd were shouting “traitors” as officers tried to keep them back. They broke into the building. Announcements blared: Due to an “external security threat,” no one could enter or exit the Capitol complex, the recording said. A loud bang sounded as officials detonated a suspicious package to make sure it was not dangerous. It was about 1:15 p.m. when New Hampshire Representative Chris Pappas, a Democrat, said Capitol Police banged on his door and “told us to drop everything, get out as quickly as we could.”“It was breathtaking how quickly law enforcement got overwhelmed by these protesters,” he told The Associated Press. Shortly after 2 p.m., Republican Senator Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Vice President Mike Pence were evacuated from the Senate as protesters and police shouted outside the doors. With the Washington Monument in the background, people attend a rally in support of President Donald Trump near the White House on Wednesday, January 6, 2021, in Washington.“Protesters are in the building,” were the last words picked up by a microphone carrying a live feed of the Senate before it shut off. Police evacuated the chamber at 2:30 p.m., grabbing boxes of Electoral College certificates as they left. Phillips yelled at Republicans, “This is because of you!”Representative Scott Peters, D-Calif., told reporters he was in the House chamber when protesters began storming it. He said security officers urged lawmakers to put gas masks on and herded them into a corner of the massive room.“When we got over to other side of the gallery, the Republican side, they made us all get down, you could see that they were fending off some sort of assault, it looked like,” he said. “They had a piece of furniture up against the door, the door, the entry to the floor from the Rotunda, and they had guns pulled.” The officers eventually escorted the lawmakers out of the chamber. Shortly after being told to put on gas masks, most members were quickly escorted out of the chamber. But some members remained in the upper gallery seats, where they had been seated due to distancing requirements. Smoke fills the walkway outside the Senate Chamber as supporters of President Donald Trump are confronted by US Capitol Police officers inside the Capitol Wednesday. Along with a group of reporters who had been escorted from the press area and Capitol workers who act as ushers, the members ducked on the floor as police secured a door to the chamber down below with guns pointed. After making sure the hallways were clear, police swiftly escorted the members and others down a series of hallways and tunnels to a cafeteria in one of the House office buildings. Describing the scene, Democratic Representative Jim Himes of Connecticut said “there was a point there where officers had their guns and weapons pointed at the door, they were obviously expecting a breach through the door. It was clear that there were pretty close to pulling the trigger so they asked us all to get down in the chamber.”As he walked out of the Capitol, Himes said he had lived in Latin America and “always assumed it could never happen here.“We have known for years that our democracy was in peril and this is hopefully the worst and final moment of it,” Himes said. “But with a president egging these people on, with the Republicans doing all they can to try to make people feel like their democracy has been taken away from them even though they are the ones doing the taking, it is really hard, really sad. I spent my entire political career reaching out to the other side. And it is really hard to see this.”Democratic Illinois Representative Mike Quigley was also in the balcony. “It is not good to be around terrified colleagues, with guns drawn toward people who have a barricade ... people crying. Not what you want to see,” he said.“This is how a coup is started,” said Representative Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif. “This is how democracy dies.”",2,2,Chicago Sun-Times

The NCLA urged GMU to reexamine the policy “to deem natural immunity at least equivalent to that achieved through vaccination, and to confirm that Professor Zywicki will not lose eligibility for future pay raises (merit or otherwise) if he does not wish to share his vaccination status.”“George Mason is forcing me to choose between serving my students on one hand and undergoing an unnecessary and potentially risky medical procedure on the other.

At the current rate, it could take months to vaccinate those now eligible, including front-line workers, teachers, first responders and people age 65 or older, Dr. Joneigh Khaldun, the state is chief medical executive, said Wednesday. Some officials have said Governor Gretchen Whitmer should not have opened vaccinations up to people ages 65 and older beginning Monday - which lengthened the queue by about 702,000 people - while the state was vaccinating the initial group of 800,000 front-line workers. But Michigan Department of Health and Human Services officials say the priority is getting as many people vaccinated as quickly as possible. Large-scale vaccination centers, which have been swiftly set up across the state, have the capacity to inoculate tens of thousands of people per day. But appointments have been dramatically limited because Michigan does not have enough vaccine. Appointments to be vaccinated at health departments and hospitals are filling up as soon as they become available, providers said. Michigan anticipates receiving 62,400 doses the week of January 18, MDHHS spokeswoman Lynn Sutfin, and health providers said that will lead to additional shortages of vaccine beginning next week. Michigan Medicine received 20,000 fewer doses of vaccine than planned this week, and has placed a temporary hold on scheduling first-dose vaccine appointments because it only has enough to fulfill appointments already scheduled, spokeswoman Mary Masson said.“Please be patient, we do not have enough vaccines and it takes time to administer, but we are building quickly and it looks like we are going to be coming into more vaccines soon,” Whitmer said Wednesday. “This is the greatest tool we have to end this pandemic.”Here is what you need to know:The vaccine will be rolled out in phases, based on availability. The state began vaccinating front-line health care workers in December and on Monday, the state extended eligibility to additional health care workers, those in long-term care facilities, residents 65 and older, and childcare, corrections and K-12 school staff. An estimated 2,576,000 Michigan residents are considered eligible for the vaccine, but the state had just 831,150 doses as of Wednesday, Sutfin said in an email to The News. Sutfin said Michigan expects to receive an allotment of 60,450 doses of Pfizer is vaccine this week. The state is also accelerating distribution with the Michigan National Guard, Sutfin said.""We recognize that there is not enough vaccine for every currently eligible individual with the limited supplies we have,"" Sutfin said. ""There will be some places that run out of vaccine and do not have enough appointments available. This is why we have asked the federal government to give the State of Michigan more vaccines.""Vaccination will take place in different phases that occur simultaneously, the state health department said. Michigan has more than 5,000 facilities participating in the federal program to vaccinate staff and residents in long-term care facilities, which is being administered by CVS and Walgreens pharmacies. Michigan is allotment of Moderna vaccine doses through the end of January are being shipped directly to the companies, which coordinate distribution, vaccination and federal and state reporting. The companies are not accepting appointments at their stores. Meijer is120 pharmacies throughout Michigan are partnering to distribute the vaccine through atext-based registration process through the Federal Retail Pharmacy Partnership Program. Meijer will administer the first doses at a limited number of stores in Wayne County to patients 65 and older beginning the week of January 18. Specific store locations have not yet been determined.

County health departments that are scheduling for front-line health care workers in Phase 1A:Available for 1B (seniors, essential front-line workers) appointments or waitlists:is boosting its COVID-19 vaccination call center staffing, expanding the hours of operation and urging those not yet eligible to hold tight after being inundated Monday with more than 120,000 requests for vaccination appointments. The city has converted the TCF Center parking garage into a drive-through vaccine center, by appointment only. Mayor Mike Duggan said Detroit is hoping to provide 20,000 coronavirus vaccinations by early February if the state is able to maintain an adequate supply. If additional doses come through, they hope to increase the number of vaccinations to 30,000, the mayor told reporters Tuesday. Detroit is currently offering vaccinations to residents over age 75 and any ""good neighbor"" driver, 65 or older, who accompanies them to the TCF Center, as well as essential workers including K-12 teachers and child care workers. All participants must make an appointment in advance. The city also ramped up vaccinations of critical workers including police officers and bus drivers. The city has booked its first 2,000 appointments, already set up through the first part of next week. Detroiters eligible should call (313) 230-0505 to arrange appointments.health department has exhausted its supply of vaccine and is unable to make new appointments before its next shipment of vaccines, officials posted to the county iswebsite. About 300,000 Macomb residents qualify for the vaccine, but the county is allocation for this week was 3,800 doses, County Executive Mark Hackel said Tuesday.""We need to make sure we have the supply before start continuing to open the demand,"" Hackel said. ""If we are going to try to figure out how do we get to the masses, it ca not just be with health departments throughout the state.""Health Division asked residents to remain patient Wednesday as the department is seeing an overwhelming demand for the vaccine. The department has received 7,800 doses, administered about 5,600, and scheduled an estimated 17,000-plus first- and second-dose appointments through the end of February, officials said. There are more than 217,000 residents age 65 and older eligible to receive the vaccine in Oakland County. Officials are directing seniors to hospital systems to check for availability. The department is phone lines have received more than 20,000 calls each day and officials say the minimal supply limits their ability to schedule further appointments.

For anyone unable to complete the form, call the health hotline at 800-848-5533.“We are asking the community to help us plan for administering future doses of vaccine we receive by completing this new form,” County Executive David Coulter said in a press release. “This will help us reach residents and workers who are eligible for vaccination when more doses become available. As we receive more vaccine, we will continue to administer them quickly and efficiently until everyone has the opportunity to receive the vaccine.”Health Department repurposed Eastern Michigan University is Convocation Center as a vaccination center, said Susan Ringler Cerniglia, the department is spokeswoman. The center has eight to 14 vaccination stations operating at a time and can inoculate up to a thousand people a day.""We are working toward as soon as we have sufficient vaccine to do 5,000 a week,"" she said. As of Wednesday, the Washtenaw County Health Department had administered 2,088 initial doses, and 70 second doses, of the two-dose vaccine. Dr. Mouhanad Hammami,health strategist, said demand for the vaccine is outpacing the state is ability to supply it to regional health departments. The county has an estimated 500,000 people eligible for the vaccine but only received 2,900 doses this week, which will be exhausted by next week, he told county commissionersTuesday. Hospitals and health systems currently have the most reliable supply of vaccines for seniors, Hammami said.""I want to emphasize that anyone 65 and older because this is the contradiction that the state has said, 'Call your health department,' which will do them no good if they call us. In fact, it will put a lot of burden on us because we are going to repeat the same message: You need to go to your health system,"" Hammami told The Detroit News Monday. Residents are encouraged to check their health provider is online medical chart or portal as all local health systems are going to start making appointments for their patients once they vaccinate their medical personnel. Oakland County officials are directing 1B groups to Beaumont Health, St. Joseph Mercy Oakland, Ascension Providence and McLaren Oakland.has tripled its server capacity after its web site crashed Friday due to heavy demand for vaccines. The health system will continue working on the system and plans to expand capacity even more, said Hans Keil, Beaumont is chief information officer. A limited number of appointments became available Monday to patients by a randomized computer lottery. Senior patients receive an email inviting them to schedule their vaccination through their myBeaumontChart account. When Beaumont receives confirmation about how many doses will arrive next week, the health system will send additional email invitations to eligible patients to schedule appointments.""We are in regular communication with state and local officials and talking with them about increasing our allocations of the vaccine because we have the capacity to do so much more,"" Beaumont Health CEO John Fox said in a press release. ""Next week, we hope to launch two additional clinics and should have the capacity to do more than 50,000 vaccinations a week. Again, this all depends upon how much vaccine we receive.""Beaumont is also preparing to launch a call center to assist with answering questions and scheduling appointments.

419,Gyms remain open despite recent outbreak at Pacific Beach business,-5.0,44.0,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/communities/north-county/story/2020-07-30/gyms-remain-open-despite-recent-outbreak-at-pacific-beach-business,https://adfontesmedia.com/san-diego-union-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-30,20,"Multiple gyms across San Diego County remained open Thursday, despite the outbreak reported this week at one Pacific Beach fitness business, The Gym, that had been operating illegally. The Gym was closed Thursday afternoon, and inside a person could be seen measuring a floor mat. The nutrition shop attached to the gym remained open. The clerk at the shop said the gym was in the process of readying its equipment to move outdoors. Three people or more testing positive for COVID-19 is considered an outbreak. Of the 235 outbreaks so far countywide, five were in gyms, a county spokesman said Thursday. About half of all outbreaks were in congregate care facilities. No gym is allowed to operate indoors under the county health order first issued in March and updated again Thursday, the spokesman said. He could not say which other gyms had reported novel coronavirus cases. Many of the large chains such as Crunch and 24-Hour Fitness are closed, but some of the smaller, independent gyms have defied the county order. Another fitness center called The Gym, with different owners, was filled with clients Thursday morning in Vista, many not wearing masks or maintaining the required 6-foot distance. Co-owner Todd Danner said the management planned to move their equipment outside to the parking lot, and he did not look happy about it.“Some of these (weight) stacks weigh 1,000 pounds,” Danner said. Movers were coming to help carry things, and he needs to buy tents and artificial turf for the asphalt. He feels like his business already complies with the county is emergency public health order, he said. Still, Vista city officials sent him a list of things that needed be done. Later Thursday, the Vista Sheriff is Station received a formal complaint about the business, said Lt. Ricardo Lopez, media relations director for the Sheriff is Department.“Deputies visited the business just before 12:30 p.m. to notify gym staff they were in violation of the public health order,” Lopez said by email. “They were given an updated copy of the current order. A formal crime case is being written and will be submitted to the San Diego County District Attorney is Office.”Violation of the county health order is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, up to six months in jail, or both, Lopez said. No one answered the phone at The Gym in Vista late Thursday afternoon. The county had issued a total of 144 citations for violating the county health orders through Wednesday, according to the Sheriff is Department is website. Boulevard Fitness in City Heights was open and operating Thursday morning in a large open area with open garage-door-sized windows that opened nearly an entire wall of the multi-level building to open air. Fans on the floor and ceiling created a noticeable breeze throughout the space. Some areas, such as an area with treadmills and an exercise room, were closed off because they did not have windows or doors to the outside, said owner Shawn Gilbert. Customers, almost all of whom were wearing face coverings, sanitized their hands and got their temperature taken before being allowed inside. Machines were spaced 6 feet apart – Gilbert said they measured carefully – and there was a covered, open-air area outside the big windows with equipment in it where people who wanted to be all the way outside could work out. The gym was not accepting new members and it had limited use to 50 percent of the facility is capacity, Gilbert said. He said the gym would be closed on Sunday for professional deep cleaning. Gilbert said police had come by twice about a week ago in response to a noise complaint about the music in the gym. Gilbert said the music did not seem particularly loud to him, but he turned it down and police left. He said police did not express any other concerns about the gym is operations. No county officials or any sort of multi-agency “strike teams” had come to the gym, Gilbert said. He said he had not received any cease or desist letters from the county, nor any public health orders to close, and he felt “1,000 percent” sure the gym is operations were permissible under public health orders. No classes were underway Thursday ata jiu-jitsu gym in Normal Heights that had opened in defiance of the county is public health order in May One employee was inside the building. The main entrance was locked and the lobby was dark. A phone call to the gym reached voice mail and an email was not immediately answered Thursday afternoon. Weights were being lifted at the Metroflex Gym in Oceanside, where owner Lou Uridel was briefly arrested in May for re-opening after a two-month closure in violation of the county health order. He has a court hearing scheduled for September.“Right now, we feel we are in compliance,” Uridel said Thursday afternoon. Mask-wearing, which for a time was optional, is now mandatory, he said. He and his employees emphasize self-care, cleanliness, and distancing, and they encourage their clients to maintain a safe distance. Occupancy of his building is limited to a maximum of 35 people, about 20 percent of its normal capacity, he said. Fans have been added and a rear door opened to keep air moving through the interior. Foot traffic is routed in one door and out another. Police officers frequently stop by to check on his business, Uridel said. He tells them he is complying with the rules and that nothing has changed, and they leave. Uridel, an attorney licensed in California and Illinois, said COVID-19 and its prevention has become a political issue and he appears OK with that. He recently decided to run for Oceanside mayor in November, and a big plank in his campaign is support for small businesses. Located close to Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base, almost three-quarters of the clients at Metroflex are active-duty military or veterans. Some said they feel like a family. Don Butts, a trainer who works six days a week at Metroflex, said he feels safe there.“I have not gotten sick,” he said. “None of my clients have gotten sick.”Oceanside police spokesman Tom Bussey said Thursday it is the county is responsibility, not the city is, to enforce the public health order. Police have often said enforcement of the state and county public health orders is difficult for many reasons. Some people claim that requiring a business to close violates the owner is rights under the state and federal constitutions. Also, because the health orders are issued by the state and county, city police departments may not have the authority to enforce them. County officials said this week they plan to form enforcement teams with representatives from each city in an attempt to improve compliance.",2,2,San Diego Union-Tribune

Four years ago, the Senate was dealing with a racist-adjacent nominee for attorney general, and a wealthy know-nothing for Secretary of Education, and a guy who lasted about 11 minutes as Secretary of the Interior before he was under investigation, and a Treasury Secretary nominee who was a foreclosure king and who “forgot” to list assets on his financial disclosure forms, and assorted other grifters and rascals. So yes, these confirmations are going just a bit more smoothly than those of the previous administration*, because this administration believes in hiring competent, honest people who actually will do the jobs to which they are appointed, and who will not grab for every perk on the shelf. And, you have to admit, listening to McConnell spout this self-congratulatory bushwah on the day that the Senatewill finally vote to confirmMerrick Garland to a government job is downright hilarious if you look deeply enough into it.

Faulconer served as mayor from 2006 to 2014 and officially launched his campaign to run in either the 2022 race for governor, or sooner if a recall election takes place.“He is failed us, year after year,” Faulconer said in his first campaign video. “I am running to make a difference, not to make promises.”While past petitions to recall California Governor Gavin Newsom have failed, there is a current petition that has gained 1.3 million of the 1.8 million of the necessary signatures, according to the “Recall Gavin” campaign. The recall campaign is senior adviser Randy Economy told LA Weekly back in December that he believed enough signatures would be garnered by the end of January and while that did not happen, the campaign has until March 17 to reach the necessary threshold. While leaders in the state, including LA Mayor Eric Garcetti, praised Newsom for aggressive action early on in the pandemic, of late, small businesses and Republican voices such as Faulconer have been vocal about their displeasure with the governor is orders to shut down. Those voices grew louder after Newsom was photographed dining at the French Laundry restaurant in Yountville on November 6, 2020. The dinner appeared to be indoors, although the restaurant said it was their outdoor area, and Newsom was seen packed in tightly with several others and no visible masks worn by the patrons. Newsom later apologized for the dinner, saying he felt “uncomfortable” and should have left the moment he noticed there were so many people in attendance.“To him the re is rules for everybody else and the n the re is rules for him,” Economy said about the governor is November dinner. “It is the arrogance of power and he does not care for the average person in California. He cares about living in his own political bubble.”On Tuesday, a survey conducted by theUniversity of California, Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studiessaid that among the 10,000 registered voters who were polled, 48% approved of Governor Newsom is performance, while 46% disapproved.

422,President Trump Seems to Have a Problem With Yamiche Alcindor. Why Is That?,-15.12,39.62,https://www.vogue.com/article/yamiche-alcindor-donald-trump-feud,https://adfontesmedia.com/vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-03-31,23,"At Sunday is coronavirus press briefing, held in the Rose Garden of the White House in front of a smattering of reporters and government officials, all practicing social distancing, President Donald Trump made some startling announcements. In addition to backing away from his earlier proclamation that the country would be back to normal by Easter, and instead announcing that the country would be under shelter-in-place orders through the end of April, he soberly predicted that at least 200,000 Americans might die from COVID-19during the current pandemic, adding that the reason that number was not higher was because his administration had “done a very good job.”But the most charged moment of the press conference was whenYamiche Alcindor, the White House correspondent fo rand a former reporter forThe New York Times, asked the president why he had recently said that some state governors might not need as much medical equipment as they had requested from the federal government to fight the frighteningly rapid spread of COVID-19. (OnSean Hannity is Fox News Channel show last Thursday, Trump said: ""I do not believe you need 40,000 or 30,000 ventilators,"" an apparent reference to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo is recent claim that the state needed 30,000 ventilators.)Referring to Trump is remarks on that show, Alcindor addressed the president and said, ""You have said repeatedly that you think that some of the equipment that governors are requesting, they do not actually need. You said New York might not need 30,000 — """"I did not say that. I did not say that,"" Trump responded.""You said it on Sean Hannity is Fox News, you said that you might — "" Alcindor said.""Come on, come on,"" said Trump said, cutting her off again. ""You know, why do not you people act — why do not you act in a little more positive — it is always trying to getcha, getcha.""Alcindor tried to ask the question again, but the president continued, ""And you know what, that is why nobody trusts the media anymore."" He added: ""Look, let me tell you something. Be nice. Do not be threatening.""As Alcindor continue to press the president, he turned toward another reporter and a White House aide came over to Alcindor and snatched the microphone from her hand. It would not be the first time Trumpwould show a flash of anger over Alcindor is questioning. Ata White House press conference in 2018, shortly after the midterm elections, Alcindor asked the president about comments he made at a rally that October, where he labeled himself a nationalist. Alcindor pointed out that some interpreted the comment as embracing white nationalists. Trump, looking annoyed, said, ""I do not know why you'd say that. That is such a racist question.""On Monday, at another White House coronavirus briefing, the president called on her again, and Alcindor asked why the USs was lagging behind other countries, including South Korea, in providing coronavirus tests for their citizens. He answered, ""We have done more tests than any other country in the world, by far.""Then the president challenged her on the premise of her question. ""I know South Korea better than anybody. It is a very tight — do you know how many people are in Seoul?"" he asked. ""Do you know how big the city of Seoul is?"" Alcindor just kept looking at him, poised to press her question again. ""Thirty-eight million people,"" Trump said, ""That is bigger than anything we have. Thirty-eight million people, all tightly wound together."" (The actual figure is close to 10 million.)Finally, he stared at her, seemingly exasperated: ""You should be saying congratulations rather than asking a reallys narky question.""With that, he announced the press briefing was over, turned his back on the reporters and quickly strode into the White House. On Sunday night, Alcindortweeted out her response to the interaction with Trump: ""President Trump today at the White House said to me: 'Be nice. Do not be threatening.' I am not the first human being, woman, black person or journalist to be told that while doing a job. My take: Be steady. Stay focused. Remember your purpose. And, always press forward.""What about Alcindor seems to get under Trump is skin so much?April Ryan has a theory. Ryan, like Alcindor, is a longtime Washington reporter who has verbally tussled with the president at contentious White House news conferences. And Ryan, like Alcindor, is African-American. Ina 2018 essayfor, Ryan wrote about how Trump had frequently attacked her (""nasty,"" loser""), Alcindor (""racist"") and another African-American reporter, CNN is Abby Phillip (""I watch you a lot, you ask a lot of stupid questions"") in ways that seemed more deeply personal than his criticism of their white, male colleagues. The Washington Postheadline was: ""I am a black woman. Trump loves insulting people like me.""Wrote Ryan: ""When Trump denigrates black women, he is sending the message that he does not see us equally.""With the latest round of exchanges this week, other journalists and prominent figures weighed in, echoing Ryan is sentiment. ""'Be nice. Do not be threatening' oh my god what a textbook distillation of his racism and sexism,""tweetedRebecca Traister, a writer formagazine. I am so sorry @Yamiche is his target but she is so goddamn great at her job.""""You go girl,""tweetedSusan Rice, the former ambassador to the UN in the Obama administration. ""Pathetic when insecure men ca not stomach strong black women.""OnMonday is episode of the podcast""Pod Save America,"" Alcindor declined to speculate whether Trump might be singling her out because of her race. Instead she pivoted, saying that, in the face of this pandemic crisis, ""We do not have time for foolishness; we do not have time for sideshows.""Of course, Alcindor is not the only reporter Trump has attacked during his three years in office. He is banned CNN is Jim Acostaand said to Peter Alexander, ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself,"" when the NBC reporter asked of the coronavirus outbreak: ""What do you say to Americans watching you right now who are scared?""But as others have pointed out, Trump does seem to have a particular problem with women who challenge him, regardless of race. As Molly Jong-Fast wrote fo rin November, during the Ukraine hearings of the House Intelligence Committee, Trump took to Twitter to lash out at Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, in ways that seemed more pointed than his earlier criticisms of previous witnesses, Yovanovitch is fellow diplomats William Taylor and George Kent. (""Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,"" his tweet began, before ending with ""it is a US President is absolute right to appoint ambassadors. "")""Why was the president is response so different to witnesses who were roughly saying the same thing?"" Jong-Fast asked. ""What was the big difference between Kent and Taylor and Yovanovitch? All three are career diplomats, all three are Ivy League graduates, all three have worked in the State Department, all three are experts in Ukraine. But only one of them is a woman. Could that be why the president singled out Yovanovitch? It is almost as if the president is unable to control his rage against women. It is almost as if the president thinks he can bully women and silence them.""In a column i non Monday, headlined, ""Yamiche Alcindor wants an answer, thank you very much,"" the paper is media critic, Eric Wemple, weighed in. He quoted a PBS spokeswoman in defense of Alcindor: ""She is doing exactly what is expected of a free press in our democracy: posing timely, pertinent questions to those in power on behalf of the American people. She was hardly the only reporter in the Rose Garden yesterday, or at other times, to be on the receiving end of such treatment. It will not deter Yamiche from asking fair and direct questions, especially at such a critical time.”""Good!,"" Wemple responded in his column. ""Those fair and direct questions, after all, continue illuminating the petty and insecure soul of President Trump as he runs away from his previous statements, utters barely comprehensible excuses for his mismanagement and otherwise diffuses a stink in the Rose Garden.""",1,1,Vogue

Being on the list typically means US companies are banned from exporting technology to blacklisted companies. DJI not only sells products to consumers, but since it is far and away the market leader, its technology is used by all sorts of companies that need drones or hand held cameras. This is not the first time that access to Chinese drones has been targeted by the US government, usually due to security concerns.

As part of the process, officials contracted a conspiracy-prone firm called Cyber Ninjas, which started work to “statistically identify voter registrations that did not make sense, and the n knock on doors to confirm if valid voters actually lived at the stated address.”But in a letter to Senate President Karen Fann, the DOJ said the process could target minority communities and have “significant intimidating effect” on voters.

427,Film Crew Members Say The Alec Baldwin Prop Gun Shooting Fits A Pattern Of Safety Shortfalls They have Had To Work Against,-5.0,37.0,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/briannasacks/rust-film-prop-safety-protocols,https://adfontesmedia.com/buzzfeed-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-24,25,"“The lack of accountability is astronomical. It is endemic.”BuzzFeed News ReporterThis aerial photo shows a film set at the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe, where Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun, killing the cinematographer, officials said. Producers on the set ofRustin New Mexico,whereAlec Baldwinaccidentally shot and killed director of photography Halyna Hutchins, cut significant corners when it came to safety protocols and working conditions, according to those who were involved and familiar with the project. Interviews with 10 production workers, documents, and em ails obtained by BuzzFeed News show that those in charge of producing the Western staffed key roles with less-experienced, nonunion workers and rushed the sour c ing of props, such as guns, to save money at the expense of safe and humane working conditions. At least two property masters — who are in charge of acquiring, validating, choreographing, and overseeing all the props and department staff in a production, including weapons and those in charge of them — said that they turned down the opportunity to work onRustbecause of their concerns over how rushed the project was, what they considered to be low-ball pay, and how “flippant” the producers seemed about protocols. In 2019, a prop maker and licensed pyrotechnician with the Local 44 union filed a formal complaint against Dave Halls, the assistant director onRustwho handed Baldwin the loaded gun, for violating safety protocols, specifically related to firearms on set. Crew members also walked off one of his more recent projects after he had them shoot “guerrilla”-style on train tracks in the middle of the night. There have been a host of other missteps that workers say exemplify the systemic issues that have long plagued production and jeopardized their safety. Workers in the industry say a culture of ignoring basic standards, outsourcing to less-experienced workers, and paying unlivable wages to churn out content more quickly and cheaply is a big part of why Hutchins, a revered and admired cinematographer who was the film is director of photography, is now dead.“It is literally a war zone on some of these films, and no one takes responsibility. No one acknowledges that this culture of sucking it up and dealing with it is a problem,” Maggie Goll, a prop maker and licensed pyrotechnician, told BuzzFeed News. “The lack of accountability is astronomical. It is endemic.”A source close to the production pushed back on allegations that producers cut corners to save money, pointing out that it is an IATSE/Teamsters/SAG DGA union/guild–certified set, and everything was done according to union guidelines. The source also said that they had three full-set safety meetings since the film started earlier this month, including on the day of the accident. In a new letter sent to crew Sunday night, obtained by BuzzFeed News, Rust Movie Productions reiterated that it was ""conducting an internal review of safety protocols"" and cooperating with Sante Fe authorities. The producers said they decided "" to wrap the set at least until the investigations are complete.""Santa Fe sheriff is detectives said the shooting took place as the cast and crew were rehearsing with the equipment, which was set up by one of the film is production assistants and the armorer. According to court documents, the assistant director picked up one of the prop guns that was sitting on a cart outside, yelled, “Cold gun!” — meaning that the weapon was safe to use — and handed it to Baldwin without knowing it contained live rounds. For months, production workers from across the industry and part of the unionInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees(IATSE) have been threatening to strike, citing exhausting, stressful conditions that were exacerbated by the pandemic. Rustwas no different, they say. Crews on the low-budget, Old West period film were working 14- to 18-hour days, staying in a dilapidated hotel an hour away from the set, and making well below standard rates while at one point waiting three weeks to get paid, according to two people familiar with the situation and reporting by other media outlets. The Los Angeles Timesreported that camera operators also made a complaint about the lack of gun safety and protocol on set last weekend after two other accidental prop gun discharges. The situation was so egregious that in protest, members of Hutchins’ camera crew walked off the set over the working conditions, a rare move that industry veterans told BuzzFeed News was a “huge red flag” that should have immediately halted production.""A handful of members of the camera crew quit the production on Wednesday night,"" a spokesperson for Rust Movie Productions said. ""The camera crew is not involved with props and prop safety protocols and have no interaction with the firearms used in production.""In the culture of Hollywood, you endure and protect your team, especially those who brought you into the gig, industry veterans said. It has to be incredibly dire, they added, for unionized operators to choose to abandon the job and leave their director. Movie industry workers take part in a candlelight vigil to honor cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on October 23. Warnings about the production arose in September when Neal Zoromski, a veteran property master, told one of the producers that he had concerns about how and where they were sour c ing props and personnel for the film. On Sept. 20, Row Walters, a unit production manager, reached out to Zoromski asking if he would be interested in joining the Tier 1A feature (that classification means it is a low-budget production), shooting in Santa Fe starting October 6, according to em ails obtained by BuzzFeed News. But the low rates, slim staffing, and rushed time line were red flags, said Zoromski, who has been in the industry since 1989, is a 25-year union member, and has worked on everything from7th HeaventoThe Day After Tomorrow.“They did not seem to be playing it right from the beginning,” he said. “It felt slipshod, and the vibe was that this is a very unsafe situation, and I told them as much.”Based on conversations with Walters and a production designer, the prop master realized that they “were behind the eight ball” and trying to prepare a project days before it was about to start. Unfortunately, that has become the trend in Hollywood, he said, to try to throw a production together in 8 to 10 days, when the “bare minimum should be three weeks.”They were “flippant” with details about the weapons that were to be provided and shrugged off his questions about who was going to be on staff, Zoromski added. He also said they insisted they had everything they needed locally — “and that is a great concern.”As the demand for content has exploded and more companies are jumping into the streaming frenzy, studios have been creating projects in places outsideLos Angeleslike New Mexico, which union workers say is cheaper. Often, as union workers who have worked on New Mexico productions told BuzzFeed News, that means production companies can hire less-experienced people to fill key roles, such asRust is 24-year-old armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, for less money. In apod cast last month, Gutierrez-Reed — who has not responded to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment — talked about being new to the role after just coming off her first film,The Old Way. The Daily Beast reported that filming on that set was allegedly briefly paused because of concerns over how she was handling the weapons. In his discussions withRustproducers last month, Zoromski said he inquired about the armorer, since it is usually the prop master is job to hire that role, as well as the weapons. According to em ails and the call sheet, obtained by BuzzFeed News, the prop master had two assistants, one of whom was also the armorer. It was concerning, he said, that the film chose to combine those two roles into one. It compressed that person is ability to “check the functioning guns, test the m, and prepare them for use.” The call sheet also showed that most of the crew members were nonunion, meaning they were likely paid below the standard wage. Zoromski and other industry experts also balked at the findings from a Santa Fe sheriff is search warrant, which stated that Halls, the assistant director, picked up a revolver from a cart and handed the weapon to Baldwin. That goes against guidelines from the Actors’ Equity Association, which state that “all loading of firearms must be done by the property master, armorer or experienced persons working under their direct supervision.”“It is absolutely beyond the pale that an AD would ever touch or grab a prop weapon off a cart and give it directly to an actor to rehearse or otherwise,” the prop master said. Halls, who could not be reached for comment Sunday, has worked on a slew of films and shows, including blockbusters likeTheMatrix, in various assistant director roles since the 1990s, based on his IMDb profile. And according to the Directors Guild of America, he recently completed a safety training course mandatory for membership eligibility. But two people who worked with him on various past shows said that he has a history of disregarding basic safety protocols and measures, such as not checking weapons, not holding safety meetings, and inappropriately addressing women. Back in February, crew members also walked off the Georgia set of another low-budget production where Halls worked as assistant director,One Way, because of what they said were unsafe working conditions and lack of pay. Angela Schroeder, a set decorator, told BuzzFeed News that the final straw for a few members was the last night, when Halls decided to shoot at an active train yard because she said the production company had not properly secured any locations. The assistant director had all of the crew working within 30 feet of at least eight dark train tracks in the middle of the night, without spotters, she said, adding that “nobody knew what they were doing.”Halls later posted a photo on Facebook of them moving a fake body with a train in the background, calling it “the martini shot” for the last day. The worst part, Schroeder said, was that it was around the anniversary of the death of Sarah Jones, a camera assistant who was fatally struck by a train on another Georgia movie set in 2014. In follow-up interviews with BuzzFeed News, two other people involved with the train scene said that they had planned to shoot near train tracks and it was planned, scouted, and fully vetted, as evidenced by call sheets. Eric Napier, the location manager, said that they had contacted the railroad company about filming on the property next to it.""All filming locations were scouted, vetted, rented, and insured. I do not work on 'guerrilla' projects. I will not work with a company that does not invest the time, resources, and money to do it right,"" he said. ""I have unfortunately worked with producers that cut corners and do not care about the crew, Thomasville Pictures is not one of those teams.""Goll, the pyrotechnician with the Local 44 union, had a similar experience with the assistant director in 2019 while working onInto the Dark, an anthology series. The show, which streamed on Hulu and was made by Blumhouse Productions — which notoriously set the standard for making blockbuster content for little money — was also low budget, with conditions and culture similar toRust is, she said. She ended up submitting a complaint to the DGA Usually, when there are dangerous elements in a production, such as gunfire, stunts, or pyrotechnics, leaders on set host a meeting every morning to go over the props used and the risks, as well as ensure that there are known fire lanes and usable exits in case something goes wrong. OnInto the DarkandOne Way, those meetings, as well as other basic safety processes, were not happening, and crew members complained, Goll and other staff said.“It was inexcusable that we had to basically demand those universal, common policies every single day,” she said. “It is like that on many shows now because it is this culture of 'Shut up, do the job, stop whining, and get it done.' Seconds are money, and the faster they can rush through things, that saves money. But we are asking ourselves now,What is that cost? And it is our lives, livelihood, and general well-being.”Goll said Halls often complained about and was exasperated by extra safety steps onInto the Dark, like having a gun “cleared” by a professional technician. And contrary to protocol, Halls would not inform workers when there was a weapon present, or distinguish between a real gun and a prop, until the assistant prop master demanded that Halls inform the crew every time. A representative for Blumhouse Productions did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“We were being dismissed to our faces even though so many people knew it was wrong,” she said. “It is frustrating because so often this falls on deaf ears, and people have been afraid to speak up, because when you do, you are not there in the days to follow.”That, at least, has changed. Production workers have been speaking out about what they have endured on the job en masse, filling social media accounts with stories and organizing rallies. There is a new, sweeping solidarity, Goll said, because they are no longer accepting what is at stake: their lives. “We no longer want to be treated as expendable.”",1,1,BuzzFeed News

S House of Representatives voted to pass the Equality Act, the LGBTQ+ rights legislation that would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. While the bill still has to proceed through the Senate to become law, the vote is a first step towards ahu ge win for LGBTQ+ Americans. Across social media, people are already cheering this bill is progress. TheEquality Act, which was previously introduced in 2019, would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. The bill would cover discrimination in employment in housing, employment, and public businesses like restaurants, stores, and services. While it passed the House in 2019, it was not brought for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate at the time. Now, reintroduced in a Democrat-controlled Congress, the bill has passed the house in a 224-206 vote, per CNN, with at least three Republicans crossing party lines to vote in its favor. Notably, this version of the bill follows the Supreme Court is June 2020decision in, in which the Court ruled that a gay man fired from his job had been discriminated against — asserting that sexual orientation and gender identity were covered under sex discrimination. Now, the Equality Act would codify that ruling and its precedent into law, while expanding its applicability. Across social media, people celebrated the vote and expressed their hopes for the future. Now, the bill goes to the Senate, where it already has strong supporters among the Democratic Party, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has promised to bring it to a vote. However, its ultimate fate is unclear, as it will have to pass the 60-vote threshold to avoid a filibuster. Conservative opponents have suggested that it would violate religious liberty by requiring businesses and institutions to provide services to LGBTQ+ people — the Equality Act would explicitly supersede 1993 isReligious Freedom Restoration Act(RFRA), which prohibits the government from ""substantially"" burdening the free exercise of religion. In short, religious beliefs could not be used to justify discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. Still, the bill has a far better chance in 2021 with a Democrat-controlled Senate than under a Republican-controlled Senate back in 2019. With any luck, Twitter will get to celebrate this legislation again soon. Be the first to know what is trending, straight from Elite Daily",1,1,Elite Daily

Most folks recognize that a one-time $600 stimulus check is nowhere near enough to keep millions of struggling Americans afloat in the midst of a public health and economic crisis. But given the fact that Republicans were fiercely opposed to additional stimulus payments, it was a big win for Democrats that they managed to get direct payments included in the compromise relief package at all. Asmembers of Congresshave spent months negotiating, it is clear that Trump did not take the time to even examine the proposals. If he had, he would have seen that Democrats already passed COVID relief legislation back in May that included stimulus checks for twice the amount that are included in the current bill.

430,UK economic growth slows in May,0.0,46.33,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-57769712,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,25,"The UK is economy grew more slowly than expected in May after a rebound in the hospitality sector was offset by disruptions to car production. The economy expanded by 0.8% in May as coronavirus restrictions eased to allow pubs and restaurants to serve indoors. While that was the fourth consecutive month of growth, it was also a slowdown from the 2% growth seen in April. The economy is still 3.1% below pre-pandemic levels,the Office for National Statistics said.""Of course, the pace of the recovery was always going to slow as the economy climbed back towards its pre-crisis level. But we had not expected it to slow so much so soon,"" said Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics. Pubs and restaurants ""were responsible for the vast majority of the growth seen in May"", said Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics""Hotels also saw a marked recovery as restrictions lifted,"" he added. Accommodation and food services grew by a massive 37.1% in May, with the overall services sector growing 0.9%. But UK carmakers struggled with a shortage of microchips, with the manufacture of transport equipment falling by 16.5%. Construction firms were hit by very wet weather in May as firms lost working days, although the ONS said the sector remained 0.3% above February 2020 is pre-pandemic level. British Chambers of Commerce head of economics Suren Thiru said: ""While the latest figures confirm the rebound in economic activity continued into May, the sharp slowdown in growth suggests that the recovery is losing a little steam as the temporary boost, from the earlier phases of reopening, fades.""Overall, in the three months to May, economic output rose by 3.6%, helped by strong retail sales, and as pubs, restaurants and schools reopened from March. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""The government is continuing to support the recovery, with the furlough scheme in place until September, and schemes like Restart helping people who have sadly lost their jobs get back into work.""Looking ahead, Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International, said: ""A sporting summer may not directly cause an 'it is coming home' bounce, but the impact on consumer confidence ca not be ignored.""That being said, there are many unknowns ahead. The UK is set on its road map to 'freedom day' but cases are rising, challenges in the labour market persist and the initial spending boom could slow in pace.""After shrinking at the start of the year under renewed lockdowns, the economy is meant to be surging back. On a chart, a line graph looks like the second bounce of a precipitous economic bungee jump. In that light, to day is figures are a disappointment. The consensus forecast was for growth of 1.5% in May Instead we got barely half that - 0.8% - with activity in construction shrinking for the second month in a row and manufacturing also down. Some of that was down to one-off factors such as the shortage of microchips, which forced carmakers to send workers home. But while activity in restaurants and pubs jumped as customers were allowed inside for the first time in months, it is clear that our economic bungee cord is slackening before it was expected. The economy remains 3.1% below where it was in February last year, and no larger than it was in January 2017, making it one of the two weakest performers in the G20 group of advanced economies. In the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are the most widely watched. In a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly bigger than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer. Most economists, politicians and businesses like to see GDP rising steadily. Rising GDP means more jobs are likely to be created, and workers are more likely to get better pay rises. If GDP is falling, the n the economy is shrinking - bad news for businesses and workers. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known as a recession, which can mean pay freezes and lost jobs. Read more here. Aseparate statement from the Office for National Statistics on trade figures showed that the UK is still importing more goods from outside the EU than from the bloc following Brexit. However, the difference is narrowing. The value of imports from non-EU countries were £20bn in May, while imports from the bloc - many of which face new barriers to cross-border trade - were £18.4bn, the ONS said.

436,Republicans Like Bob Corker Have Nowhere to Go,-7.67,35.0,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/bob-corker-republicans-trump/619436/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,25,"The former senator from Tennessee famously clashed with President Donald Trump. After two years of silence, he still thinks his party is the future. Senator Bob Corker had just gotten out of a hot-yoga session with his wife on a Sunday morning in 2017 when his phone started blowing up. President Donald Trump was tweeting about him, falsely claiming that the Tennessee Republican supported the Iran deal (he did not) and that he had begged Trump for a reelection endorsement (Corker says he never did such a thing). “I got to my house, and I was dripping wet, standing in my closet, getting undressed to go jump in the shower,” Corker told me recently from his office in Chattanooga. He typed out a response: “It is a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning.” Corker sent it to a couple members of his staff—“No public officials should ever send their own tweets,” he says—whom he expected totalk him down. “No, it is too good,” they told him. “We are going to let it go.” Thecommenthas now been retweeted nearly 148,000 times. Corker is tweet seemed to resonate because it stated plainly something that few Republicans were willing to say out loud at the time: The country was being run by someone who regularly broadcasted false information, seemingly without forethought or input from his staff. But Corker, who left office in 2019, gets frustrated by the focus on this kind of dramatic episode. “I spend not one second of my day thinking about any of those things. Okay? Not one second,” he said. “It is such an irrelevant part of our life.”Still, he is also starting to recognize that his legacy as a USs senator—and as mayor of Chattanooga, where he got his start in elective office—was defined not just by the legislation he passed or his work as the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee but by his willingness to call out racism and moral failings in his own party. Corker still believes in what he sees as the core mission of the Republican Party: to promote free enterprise, fight for equal opportunity for everyone, and protect citizens’ safety. But it is not clear where a person like him fits in to day is version of the GOP In 2020, Corker did not vote for Trump, but he also could not bring himself to support Joe Biden. He cast his ballot for a Republican senator who, Corker believes, has no desire to be president. (He would not say which one—even his wife does not know.) That ethos is hard to find in Washington, but Corker still believes it is worth pursuing. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Let is start with some ancient history. In 2006, you were running for Senate, and the Republican National Committee financed an infamous ad about your opponent,Harold Ford Jr.(The ad showed fake “man on the street”–style interviews, including one with a scantily dressed white woman who declares, “I met Harold at the Playboy party!”) At the time, you said, “We do not want this. We want it pulled,” and it was gone in a few days. The ad seems to be an early sign of where the Republican Party might have been headed. Were there elements at that time in the national leadership of the party who might have been thinking,You are maybe overthin king what actually happened. Probably the type of person who thought up that ad was some political operative or some pollster. Matter of fact, I had very tough conversations with the entity that ran that ad. What were those conversations like?Oh, it just cratered us. We were at plus-six in the race, and it took us to minus-four over seven days. The ad came out on a Friday night, and it ran throughout the weekend, but you ca not pull it down. And we could not talk directly with the RNC, because it was illegal. The ad was constantly on the air—Wolf Blitzer and Chris Matthews. Every outlet in the country was talking about it. And it painted me. I mean, how did I evolve to the public arena? I saw that we had poverty in our inner city and people who were not able to live in decent housing. I led the creation of a nonprofit that helped 10,000 people here in our community have decent, fit, and affordable housing. Predominantly, they were African Americans. That was my history. So I come to this race. People did not differentiate between me and the RNC They did so much damage to us and hurt me personally. People who did not know me thought I was a part of that. Was your criticism that the ad was strategically unwise? Or was there a bigger-picture conversation about, “Who are we as a party, and what kind of message are we trying to send?”When you are 30 days or three weeks away from a nationalized election, you are not thinking at that moment about what this says about us as a party. You are livid over what people have done to you in the election in the name of helping you. I will fast-forward to an event that, to me, is more indicative. When I ran for Senate in 2006, we had a Democratic governor, and the election was very close. We were a mixed state. West Tennessee was Democratic. Look at what happened when President Obama was elected. Lookat west Tennessee today. To me, that is a little more indicative of how race possibly affected the state of Tennessee. Say a little bit more about that. You felt, even at the time when President Obama was running in 2008, that there might be political changes happening?We were in the height of a financial-system breakdown. I was highly involved, as a young senator, in shaping the future of the automobile industry. So, no, I am not thinking about that at the time. What I am reflecting upon is that by 2010, Tennessee had become a solidly red state. Obviously, people in our state railed against President Obama is policies and health-care bill. But there was certainly a turn in our state to bright red from being purple just a few years earlier. Can I say that race had nothing to do with that? I do not think that I can. In the period you are pointing to—2008, 2010, the Tea Party surge—there was a turn within the Republican base. At the time, did you look around and say,?I mean, obviously, I was very aware. During the Tea Party period of time, I did 66 town-hall meetings across our state. I remember walking into the Loudon High School auditorium. Town-hall meetings typically are not particularly interesting. But there were over a thousand people there with placards. They were angry—at Republicans, too. I was very concerned about where we were going fiscally as a nation, but I was unaligned with them because I was from Washington, and I did not say the red-meat things because I do not believe them. I have never been able to say those kinds of things. I cannot bash the other side of the aisle. I have just never been able to bash a Democrat because they are a Democrat. The Tea Party—they liked me. They did not love me. Read: The evangelical politician who does not recognize his faith—or his partyWhen you first saw candidate Trump coming onto the scene a few years later, it seems like you thought,You are shaking your head. There were other candidates I preferred who washed out. I was just amazed at it. But I have always attempted to be constructive. I remember watching a foreign-policy speech that Trump gave. It was okay. What I tried to do, especially being chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, was to take a few sentences of what he said and applaud those and try to build on those—almost leave a trail to a better place. Not to flatter him or get in his good graces. But, hopefully, I would be one of the few people saying something positive at that time, and he would read that and think,Sure enough, he called right after that, thanking me for saying something positive. You talk about the rally in Charlottesville as a defining moment. What were you thinking as you were watching that on television and the press conference that happened afterwards?I took a few days to take in everything that happened. I think the rally was on a Saturday. Tuesday at Trump Tower, the president made the comments that he made. I knew I was going to be here in Chattanooga on Thursday, in my hometown. I got a call early one morning from someone at the White House. I was a recipient of calls from a number of people—almost like they were standing in a coat closet in the White House: “Corker. You cannot believe what has happened.” I received a call from someone well known, probably about 6 a.m. Everybody knows I get up early. I knew what I was going to do. I thought through the words I was going to us every carefully. I used the words: “The president ha snot yet demonstrated …” That gives this person the ability to become something different than they were at that time. In retrospect, we can all recognize that Charlottesville was a turning point in the Trump presidency. But what was it about that moment that made you think,?I was mayor of a city. I spent my time dealing with issues in our inner city. These were my friends, my fellow citizens, my constituents, the people that I worked with on a daily basis. To have a person who was blatantly dog-whistling to white supremacists was totally unacceptable. Something needed to be said. Not in a way that was a personal attack but to focus on the fact that this person was not rising to the occasion as a president. In the days leading up to January 6, the two senators from Tennessee were part of the effort to challenge the certification of the Electoral College results. One of those people was your replacement. Did you call them up and say, “This is not how we do this”?I made a statement. I go out of my way to not ever name people. I just do not think that is constructive. But we know from other quarters that it stung. I served for 12 years in the Senate, a year and a half as commissioner of finance, and four years as mayor. I know how receiving calls like that is. I have tried to not be one of those people. They are the senators now, and I am not. What do you imagine your work ahead will be? Where will your labors be most valuable?I have got a lot of energizing, fun things going in business. But I know, down in here [], that while I will always continue to love the world of business, there will be some missional thing that will evolve as a part of my life. I do not know what that is yet, but I just know what my DNA is. It is been that way since I was in my late 20s. I have had the greatest privilege of my life serving publicly. The most rewarding period of time was being mayor of a city, where you touch people in a real way. I have earned the right for a period of time to be in this state that I am at. I have got the freedom to be uncluttered, mind-wise, with all these things that you are talking about. Read: Eric Metaxas believes America is creeping toward Nazi GermanyI want to ask you about something that is actually more local, and perhaps more symbolic. The once-defunct Walnut Street Bridge, which is now a vibrant pedestrian pathway, is a beautiful symbol of Chattanooga is future. It is also where theEd Johnson lynching memorial has been built. To me, this really captures the challenge ahead for the city: to thrive and grow and attract people to live here, but also totalk more openly about the history of this place, where lynchings occurred. This is a really big struggle in the country right now—figuring out how to work optimistically toward the future, but also to be more open and honest about our past. I think people in your party have struggled with this. What I want to know from you is: What is the right way forward in this hard moment?Just as it relates to the memorial, my wife and I contributed to it. I read about it in the paper, and I signed a check the next day. That is something that we, as a family, support. Neither party is addressing the race issue in a manner that represents the greatness of our nation. I think the Democratic Party is doing as much damage—or more—on the issue of race today than even some of these subtle but real undertones in the Republican Party that you are speaking of. We should be doing everything we can to give every student of every race and every young person every opportunity possible. But the n to say, “We are not going to do everything we can to have equal opportunity. We are going to have equal outcomes”—all that does is exacerbate it, and the n you have got white people who feel disenfranchised. I ca not believe what is happening in Atlanta right now. I cannot believe the total lack of concern for allowing the crime issue to be what it is. I do not understand what is happening with these big-city mayors, how they would disrespect their citizenry so much that they would let crime be rampant. Generally speaking, Black people in our country somehow have had lesser opportunity. That is what we ought to be focusing on, because that is the future. That is solving a problem. That is taking us someplace. Should we be aware of our past? Yes, we should be aware of our past. But some of the things that are happening right now today are not benefiting racial equality. They are actually taking us down a hole that leads to a place that is not constructive.",1,1,The Atlantic

438,Pandemic Meat Shortage Spurs Calls to Shift Slaughterhouse Rules,-0.67,48.33,https://about.bgov.com/news/pandemic-meat-shortage-spurs-calls-to-shift-slaughterhouse-rules/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bloomberg-government-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-19,17,"Empty fridges at grocery stores in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic exposed weaknesses in the meat supply chain that lawmakers are seeking to address in their last-ditch efforts to pass another stimulus bill. Outbreaks at meat-processing facilities caused temporary shutdowns that reduced the amount of meat available for sale. The disruption also exacerbated preexisting tensions over restrictions on meat sales across state lines. To get their meat to shelves, livestock farmers pay either state- or federally regulated slaughterhouses to butcher their animals. Meat from state-inspected facilities ca not be sold across state lines, making it more advantageous for farmers to work with the four federally regulated companies that dominate the market:Tyson Foods Inc.,JBS SA, Cargill Inc., and National Beef Packing Co. Lawmakers have offered bipartisan proposals to help small-scale processors and livestock producers access larger markets at fair prices, with House Agriculture Committee ChairmanCollin Peterson(D-Minn.) leading the charge. His legislation to make it easier for processing facilities to become federally regulated was added to House Democrats’ stimulus measure (HR 925), but it faces an uncertain future if last-minute stimulus negotiations fail.“The pandemic confirmed something farmers have known for some time: there is a severe shortage of local and regional meat processing facilities across the country,” Rob Larew, the National Farmers Union is president, said in a statement. The Agriculture Departmentregulatesabout 6,500 slaughter and processing facilities nationwide, while 27statesmonitor about 1,900 small-scale processing facilities. Federally inspected plants have an expanded market throughout the US and abroad. Large retailers will often only sell meat that carries the Agriculture Department inspection seal. Eight of the 27 states participate in a program that allows state-inspected plants to qualify as federally inspected establishments. Although state inspection programs are required to impose requirements “at least equal to” those of USDA, plants applying to become federally inspected often have to spend money to upgrade their facilities. Facility upgrades are the greatest barrier to businesses being able to qualify for USDA oversight, a department spokesperson said. Meatpacking giants running federally inspected facilities have come under fire for allegations of price gouging during the pandemic, sparking outrage among lawmakers such as Senator Chuck Grassley(R-Iowa) and prompting an investigation by the Justice Department. Peterson is bill (HR 7490), incorporated in the stimulus package, would establish facility upgrade and planning grants for meat and poultry processors to qualify for federal inspection. The stimulus measure would set aside $100 million for the grants. Some lawmakers have taken an alternate approach to address processing industry issues. Reps. Chellie Pingree(D-Maine) andJeff Fortenberry(R-Neb.) introduced the Strengthening Local Processing Act (HR 8431) to aid small meat processors and boost state operations. The bill would expand the Agriculture Department is portion of state inspection program costs. It would also offer grants to small and state-inspected plants, and set up two $10 million grant programs for meat-processing training. Fortenberry said the legislation would reinvigorate local meat processing as the re is “broadening concern over corporate concentration in the meat packing industry.”The Cattle Market Transparency Act (S. 4647), introduced by Senator Deb Fischer(R-Neb.), would address cattle industry issues by setting regional negotiated cash minimums and giving producers more market information, among other policy changes. The nation is top four meat processing companies control about 80% of the slaughter market, according to Grassley. The North American Meat Institute estimates their share of beef production is actually closer to two-thirds. The companies last month persuaded a judge to temporarily to ss a 2019lawsuitover alleged antitrust violations. JBS, Tyson, Cargill, National Beef Avoid Cartel Claims for NowCargill, with 12 federally inspected processing facilities primarily for beef and turkey, is “confident in our efforts to maintain market integrity and conduct ethical business,” Daniel Sullivan, the company is media relations director, said in a statement. The other companies did not respond to requests for comment. Grassley urged government officials to look into possible cattle market manipulation by large beef-packing corporations in late March. A federal investigation is ongoing, he said in an October 13 telephone interview, adding, “I really have not had this positive of a response from the Justice Department, Republican or Democrat, for years.”The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment. Mike Stranz, vice president of advocacy at the National Farmers Union, pointed out that “98% of all meat processed in the US goes through 50 plants,” making supply chain interruptions consequential, he said. However, National Chicken Council spokesman Tom Super said in an email that “there is no shortage of chicken plants in the US and we did not experience any major disruptions in production this spring or summer.”To contact the reporter on this story:Megan U Boyantonin Washington atmboyanton@bgov.comTo contact the editors responsible for this story:Sarah Babbageatsbabbage@bgov.com;Loren Dugganatlduggan@bgov.com",2,2,Bloomberg Government

The party was especially strong in rural areas like Oklahoma — success that the socialist movement could actually replicate today. Eugene Debs in 1912. (Library of Congress)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. Markwayne Mullin is an ultraconservative Republican congress person from eastern Oklahoma. He hates socialism and is not afraid to tell you about it.“Socialism is nothing but a disguised free democracy, meaning that they make you think you have a choice, but you really do not,” he warned his constituents in 2019. The Green New Deal “has nothing to do with eliminating my cows from farting,” he insisted. “It has to do with that farm being deemed a hazard to the public health” so the federal government can claim “eminent domain and take over our farms.” And if the socialists and bureaucrats in New York and Washington, DC can use farting cows as an excuse to take over farms, what is next?Donald Trump skillfully tapped into fears of “socialism” to run up huge margins in places like Mullin is congressional district, which went for Trump in 2020 by the largest margin in the state (76 to 22 percent). But this largely rural area was not always a hotbed of reaction. A century ago, socialist firebrands likeKate Richards O’Harefound receptive audiences in eastern Oklahoma, and the state boasted the largest per capita Socialist Party (SP) membership in the country. Five-time Socialist presidential candidateEugene Debsconsidered southwestern farmers “real Socialists . . . ready for action, and if the time comes when men are needed at the front to fight and die for the cause the farmers of Texas and Oklahoma will be found there.”Today, Debs is words sound like a broadcast from another dimension. While socialists, radicals, and progressives are doing important work across the country, left politics are —at least for now— largely synonymous with the most urban and cosmopolitan precincts in the USs. The New York City chapter of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) claims roughly 10 percent of the organization is entire membership. The crop of democratic socialists recently elected to Congress hail from places like the Bronx and Queens (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), New York is northern suburbs (Jamaal Bowman), Detroit (Rashida Tlaib), and St Louis (Cori Bush). Electoral breakthroughs at the state legislative level have come so far only in New York, and all of those legislators represent districts in the Big Apple. Chicago boasts a socialist caucus on its city council, but no other town or city can say the same. This year marks the 120th anniversary of the SP is founding. And during its heyday, many of the movement is biggest strongholds were found in the country is most rural areas. As James Weinstein observes in, until 1918 “the greatest relative voting strength of the movement lay west of the Mississippi River, in the states where mining, lumbering, and tenant farming prevailed.”In addition to Oklahoma, the states with the highest proportions of SP voters were Nevada, Montana, Washington, California, Idaho, Florida, Arizona, and Wisconsin. Butte, Montana — which elected a Socialist government led by Mayor Lewis Duncan in 1911 — features one of the last public remnants of the old SP:Socialist Hall. Even in states like New York, the party tended to do just as well in smaller upstate towns like Schenectady, where Socialist mayorGeorge Lunnwas elected to two terms in the 1910s, as it did in New York City. Big-city socialists today still have a lot of work to do in our neighborhoods and workplaces. But if we want to become a truly popular movement, we need to find ways to grow beyond our metropolitan footholds. Revisiting the SP is record of building power in rural and small-town America — including a frank assessment of its failures and shortcomings — can give us a sense of how that legacy might be rebuilt today. The SP was far from the first organization to make a radical appeal to the nation is hinterlands. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, the Knights of Labor, the People is (Populist) Party, and other organizations rallied workers and farmers against the growing power of bankers, railroad barons, and land speculators. But when the Socialist Party formed in 1901, it was not simply as a reincarnation of Populism. As James Green observes inGrass-Roots Socialism: Radical Movements in the Southwest, 1895–1943, while many of the early SP leaders were former Populists, the Socialists’ main areas of support in the region were outside the old Populist strongholds, among the growing ranks of tenant farmers and industrial workers in cotton farming and coal mining areas. In addition to former “Pops,” the movement drew on an experienced cadre of labor organizers like the old Knights of Labor militantMartin Irons, a grizzled Scotsman who had led a massive railroad strike in 1886 against the robber baron Jay Gould. Radicals and Socialists in the region drew much of their support from migrants who had fled their homes in search of land. Instead of a frontier idyll, these migrants found that many of the best lands had been claimed by railroads, speculators, and cattle ranchers, and the cost of setting up an independent farm was often prohibitive. Many nominally independent farmers became deeply dependent on creditors. By the turn of the century, most farmers in the region were tenants and sharecroppers, rather than the self-sufficient homesteaders of their dreams. Some of these tenants were Cherokees, Choctaws, and other indigenous people who had their tribal lands stolen. Some were black migrants looking to get out from under Jim Crow. Most were white. Nearly all were poor, ensnared in exploitative forms of agricultural finance like the crop-lien system. This set of property relations generated bitter class struggles between tenant farmers and their landlords, which allowed the Socialists to exploit fissures in the Democratic Party is electoral base. In addition to tenant farmers, Socialist organizers were well received among the miners, timber workers, and railroad men of Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Kansas, and the interior West. They were particularly successful in recruiting militant miners, who built strong United Mine Workers (UMW) and Western Federation of Mineworkers (WFM) locals across the region. The UMW was one of the main sources of black recruitment to southwestern Socialism, as it was one of the only organizations that sought to unite working people across racial lines. Local SP organizations, however, were not always willing to do the same. Many white SP members resisted cooperation with black and indigenous farmers, and segregated party locals could be found in Texas, Louisiana, and elsewhere. Still, a number of Socialist leaders fought racism and white supremacy in the movement. The rakish Southern radicalCovington Hallorganized dock workers across the color line in New Orleans and was a leading founder of the interracialBrotherhood of Timber Workers(BTW). Oscar Ameringer, one of the most underappreciated figures in the history of American Socialism, worked to unite the black and white brewery workers of New Orleans while on assignment from the Socialist-led Brewery Workers’ Union. When he moved to the Sooner State in 1907, he quickly began agitating for socialism among tenant farmers in Indian Country. Together with state party secretaryOtto Branstetter, another German social democrat with close ties to the Milwaukee Socialists, he sought to bring together black, white, and indigenous workers in a strong and well-organized SP affiliate. Official party organizations did not spring up overnight. In the first years of the twentieth century, the Southwest was covered by a vast web of journalistic and propaganda activity that drew masses of people into the Socialist movement — in many cases before under-resourced official party organizations could reach them. As Green recounts inGrass-Roots Socialism, radical journalists, intellectuals, and propagandists promoted “an unusual level of self-organization and self-education among the poor working people who joined the movement.”None was more important thanJulius Wayland, whose weekly paper, theAppeal to Reason,was central to Socialist education and organizing in places like Oklahoma and Texas. The paper is “Appeal Army” of volunteer salespeople would fan out into the country like Methodist circuit riders, hawking subscriptions and pamphlets and seeding party organizations wherever they went. By 1912, Green writes, “over six thousand Appeal volunteers were walking, bicycling, and driving buggies through Oklahoma and Texas spreading the Socialist gospel.”Their efforts won the paper a national circulation of roughly 750,000 — the highest of any weekly publication in the country. TheAppeal, in Green is words, “was literally the only contact with socialism experienced by many people in the first decade of the century, and it was particularly important in converting younger farmers and workers” who were not veterans of the Knights of Labor or the Populist movement. Other unofficial but Socialist-aligned papers like the National Rip-Saw(St Louis) and theRebel(Hallettsville, Texas) served a similar role, bringing Socialism to the people in an idiom that blended class struggle with American republicanism and evangelical Christianity. Socialist organizers also made excellent use of mass encampments, a familiar institution associated with both Populism and religious revivals. Socialists organized their first encampment in 1904 in the Grand Saline area of Texas, where a thousand farmers from across the region showed up to listen to speeches and lectures for hours. As one account in the Socialist press described it, “Go into the Grand Saline country and see erstwhile democrats . . . preaching Socialism as earnestly as did the Pentecostals preach the New Gospel and perhaps you will have a clearer conception of what the encampment accomplished.”These encampments brought thousands into the movement because “they drew upon the collective traditions of the frontier and added political significance to common experiences.” Preachers and teachers advanced Socialist ideas in biblical and populist language to justify the struggle against those who would deny workers of hand and brain the full product of their to il. Ameringer described the encampments’ effect in vivid terms:For these people radicalism was not an intellectual plaything. Pressure was upon them. Many of their homesteads were already under mortgage. Some had already been lost by foreclosure. They were looking for delivery from the eastern monster whose lair they saw in Wall Street. They took to socialism like a new religion. And they fought and sacrificed for the spreading of the new faith like the martyrs of other faiths. Attendees were thrilled by the oratory of renowned leaders like Mother Jones, but they also made minor celebrities of forgotten figures likeWalter Thomas Mills. Known as the “little professor,” this diminutive polymath established a “School of Social Economy for Socialists” and wrote a popular textbook calledThe Struggle for Existence, which offered readers an eclectic blend of Christian moralism and scientific socialism. If a good organizer is, in the words ofFred Ross, a “social arsonist who goes around setting people on fire,” the old Socialist movement had them in droves. And nobody in the movement set more people on fire than Eugene Debs, easily the most popular orator at the Southwestern encampments. Debs brought both prophetic and intellectual intensity to his speeches and exuded an unshakeable faith in the ability of the poorest and most despised people to change the world. Reflecting on the success of the encampments, Debs related how farmers and their families would head home “feeling that they had refreshed the mselves at a fountain of enthusiasm,” ready and able to deliver “the glad tidings of the coming day” to their friends and neighbors. A lively press and effective organizing tactics like encampments were key to Socialists’ success in rural areas. But the movement would not have found such fertile soil if it did not directly appeal to people is material interests — even if they diverged from orthodox Marxist prescriptions. The Texas and Oklahoma parties, for example, supported tenant farmers’ essentially Populist demands for private, small-scale ownership of farmland despite the opposition of party members from other sections of the country. Critics argued that small family farms were inefficient and obsolete, and that only demands for land collectivization were consistent with proper socialism. Other Socialists disagreed. In his influential 1902 studyThe American Farmer,Algie Simonsinsisted that not only were small farmers not disappearing, but that the growing power of corporate capital made them a potential audience for Socialists. Simons is main argument was twofold. First, “the small farm owner is a permanent factor in the agricultural life in America, and that he forms the largest uniform division of the producing class,” and second, “any movement which seeks to work either with or for the producing class, must take cognizance of him.” Industrial workers could not, in his view, transform society without the masses of small farmers standing with them at the ballot box and on the field of class conflict. Simons is arguments gained additional strength after the party is disappointing results in the 1908 elections, when it offered no agrarian program beyond a vague call for collective ownership of all land. In 1912, the national party congress adopted an agrarian program that incorporated demands long raised by Simons and the Southwestern Socialists: state-supported cooperatives; public ownership of transportation, storage, and processing facilities; graduated land taxes; and expansion of cheap government-backed leases of land to family farmers. The new program marked an important moment in the movement is development. As Simonswroteafter the 1912 convention, “Conditions in agriculture, in the party and in the views of the delegates have all changed with the years, and the Socialist party now goes forth with a clear statement of its position in regard to the farmer that should mean a tremendous growth in agricultural localities in the near future.”He was right. In 1912, Debs received a total of eighty thousand votes (about one-tenth of his national total) from Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. At its height in the middle of the decade, the Oklahoma party claimed about ten thousand members, the most members per capita of any state in the country. In 1914 and 1915, the year when the SP had its largest number of state legislators in office, states west of the Mississippi River accounted for nineteen of thirty-three legislators. Oklahoma alone accounted for six, second only to Wisconsin is nine, and it elected a total of a hundred seventy-five Socialists to local and county offices. The party is back-and-forth over how best to approach the rural masses resembled debates in other parties of the Second International. In his review of Simons is book, German the orist Karl Kautsky noted that the agrarian question was “one of the most difficult and disputed” issues in the German Social Democratic Party — pitting Bavarians and other southerners who wanted to appeal to poor and middle peasants against northerners who only wanted to recruit landless agricultural laborers on large estates. This question was also a major dividing line in Russian social democracy, where Lenin is support for aligning with the Russian peasantry put him at odds with the Mensheviks, who focused primarily on the urban working classes and bourgeois liberals. The erosion of small farmers as a social class means that contemporary socialists do not confront the same “agrarian question” as our predecessors. But the conundrum of “contradictory class locations” is very much on the agenda, as the often-heated discourse over the “ PMC (professional managerial class) question” clearly shows. The challenge today is to reconcile two groups who are largely isolated from each other socially and politically: progressive, highly educated wage earners and the masses of lower paid, less-credentialed working people. In his history of the SP, Jack Ross observes that “the movement of the Old Southwest never fit neatly into the factional categories of the national party.” The left-wing Texas Socialists, for example, supported the essentially “revisionist” agrarian program. They were sympathetic to theChristian Socialistsand sought to recruit ministers to the movement — positions in keeping with many of the party is more moderate elements. At the same time, they staunchly opposed the successful campaign to recall “Big Bill” Haywood from the party is National Executive Committee in 1913 over his support for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) and sabotage. Similar dynamics played out on organizational questions and white supremacy. Left-wingers dominated the Oklahoma party is ranks, but for years its social democratic leaders like Branstetter and Ameringer sought to reproduce the more centralized methods of Victor Berger is Milwaukee organization. Local radicals denounced this “German form of organization” and sought greater organizational decentralization wherever possible. The degree of commitment to interracial organizing did not tend to break down along neatly defined left-right lines either. In general, the Oklahoma Socialists took a firmer stand against white supremacy than their counterparts in Texas and elsewhere. Even the most radical elements of the movement could be weak on the question of racial equality. WhenRebeleditorTom Hickeyand other left-wing Texas Socialists formed a Land Renters’ Union in 1911 they barred blacks from joining the organization. The union eventually organized black and brown tenants, but into separate locals. As Green notes, many of the poor white tenant farmers of the region “pitted the mselves against landlords and businessmen on one hand, and against black sharecroppers and brown migrants on the other.” Otherwise radical leaders like Hickey did not combat this racism. Some of the m, likeRebelpublisherEO Meitzen, were blatant race-baiters and nativists. To their credit, leaders like Ameringer, Branstetter, andTenant Farmereditor Pat Nagle defended the rights of black and brown people and courted their support. In 1912, they and others successfully campaigned to add an explicitly anti-racist plank to the party is platform through a membership referendum. Two years earlier, in 1910, Oklahoma party leaders campaigned against the Democrats’ successful referendum to disenfranchise black voters in the state. Some party members voted for it, but Green concludes that a majority of Oklahoma Socialists voted against it. In light of these struggles, Ameringer denounced “the bitter race hatred that has been a nightmare to every clear-seeing Socialist working man in the South.” Many rank-and-file Socialists agreed with him. There were some important examples of interracial organizing in the region, particularly among miners and timber workers oriented toward industrial unionism. The BTW, which organized black and white workers in the piney woods spanning west Louisiana and east Texas, was exemplary in this regard. It proved much harder, however, to convince white tenant farmers to unite with blacks in common organizations instead of fearing them as competitors. The movement as a whole was weaker than it should have been as a result. The SP maintained a fairly steady level of membership and electoral strength in the Southwest and interior West until the USs entered World War I in 1917. But the combination of repression and a severe cotton crisis triggered by the war arrested the movement is growth and set the stage for its eventual defeat. The organized strength of Socialism stirred the region is ruling classes to wage a reactionary countermovement. Timber workers, miners, and tenant farmers clashed with bosses and landlords in bitter strikes and confrontations. At the same time, left-wing “Reds” in the Oklahoma party took aim at social democratic “Yellows” like Ameringer and Branstetter, and ousted them from their positions in 1913. These dynamics inverted the story that was playing out elsewhere in the movement at the time. As Green observes, the heightening of Southwestern class conflict around 1913 boosted the fortunes of local left-wingers and direct-actionists at the same time the likes of Haywood were being ousted from national leadership positions. The Oklahoma Socialists made solid gains at the ballot box in 1914, when UMW militant Fred Holt stood as the party is gubernatorial candidate. With the state is cotton farming districts racked by drought and a collapse in prices, the party waged a robust campaign against the Democrats and Republicans. Holt won 21 percent of the statewide vote, polling more votes than Debs in his 1912 presidential campaign. His coattails, and those of other effective candidates like Nagle, swept a wave of Socialists into office at the state, county, and local levels throughout Oklahoma. While the party made big gains in Oklahoma and held ground in Texas, it did not fare as well elsewhere. In 1914, lumber barons smashed the BTW in Louisiana, which effectively defeated the Socialist movement in the state. At the same time, Democrat-sponsored suffrage restrictions and election “reforms,” combined with the devastating cotton crisis, pushed increasingly desperate tenant farmers to adopt guerrilla tactics. In 1915, an underground conspiratorial organization called theWorking Class Union(WCU) began dynamiting vats in protest of Oklahoma is tick eradication law, which fell hardest on poor tenants. (The vats were used to dip cattle in arsenic to kill ticks, but only wealthier farmers and cattlemen could afford to comply with the rule.)These and other militant actions like night-riding were understandable, even predictable, responses to economic hardship and political repression. But as Green notes, the turn to social banditry brought repression “where the party had already suffered serious losses as a result of blacklisting campaigns organized by Democratic businessmen, landlords, and politicians.”To its lasting credit, the SP — unlike many of the other parties of the Second International — took a strong stand against entering World War I Their reward was ruthless repression. The most damaging anti-Socialist measures came from the postmaster general, who removed party papers from the mail, impacting nearly every Socialist periodical of importance in the country. For the movement in rural areas — which relied heavily on the mail to organize, educate, and agitate — the postal crackdown was especially devastating. Oklahoma was the site of the most militant antiwar activity, including a failed armed uprising in 1917 called theGreen Corn Rebellion. The SP was officially against these tactics, but since many of its members were involved in armed resistance the state is ruling Democrats attacked the Socialists in a fury of patriotic repression. By 1918, the once-mighty Oklahoma Socialist Party was crushed. The party organization dissolved itself out of fear of further repression, and many of its key leaders and militants fled the state. In 1918 alone, Weinstein notes, “some 1,500 of the more than 5,000 Socialist Party locals were destroyed, mostly in small communities” and disproportionately in areas west of the Mississippi. By the time of the 1918–19 split, which decimated the SP and birthed two fractious Communist parties, the movement in Oklahoma and the trans-Mississippi region in general was already crushed by vicious wartime repression. Rural socialism continued to find expression in theNonpartisan Leaguesand Farmer-Labor movements of the Midwest. But over the subsequent decades socialism became a predominantly urban phenomenon, particularly as the Communists and various Trotskyist groups focused much of their attention on workers in the mass production industries. Communists played an important role in the early years of the Southern Civil Rights Movement, as Robin Kelley documents inHammer and Hoe, and the Communist Party made some limited headway among Midwestern farmers, particularly in the Dakotas amid the farm protests of the 1930s. Socialists led the formation of the Southern Tenant Farmers’ Union (STFU), founded in 1934 to unite black and white tenants in the SP is old Southwestern strongholds. The union recruited tens of thousands of members by the late 1930s, but it ultimately could not survive the combined pressures of New Deal farm relief, violent landowner repression, and the growing mechanization of agriculture, which radically reduced the scope of both agricultural wage-labor and farm tenancy. By the latter decades of the twentieth century, the social layers that formed the base of classical American Socialism were in severe decline. Thousands of family farms were permanently wiped out in the 1980s, bringing rural communities down with them. Deindustrialization and the attack on labor decimated the ranks of the UMW and other unions with a rural presence. The economic base of rural Americashiftedlargely from agriculture, mining, and manufacturing to the service sector, particularly healthcare and food services. In this sense at least, urban and rural areas have actually grown more alike — potentially making it easier to craft demands and programs that bridge seemingly insurmountable geographical divides. In any case, the dramatic transformation of the American “heartland” means that the contours of democratic-socialist politics in these regions will look very different today. Many rural areas are in a dire state. As Marc Edelman describes in his sobering survey of rural America, since the 1980s, “Mutual savings banks and credit unions, cooperatives, mom-and-pop businesses, local industries and newspapers, health and elder care facilities, schools, and libraries have all fallen victim to relentless austerity policies or private-equity raiders.” The disintegration of rural communities opened the door to reactionary demagogues like Donald Trump and Markwayne Mullin, who point the finger at everyone except those who really deserve the blame: the corporate interests who have plundered and abandoned Main Street, USA The Left has a dual imperative to rebuild its base in small-town America. The severe distress and deprivation that prevails demands relief for its own sake. People are suffering, and the Left should do all it can to relieve that suffering. There is a more practical reason, to o: the USs’ system of political representation is structurally biased against urban and metropolitan areas. Organizations like DSA are growing in membership and building power in the nation is most urbanized districts, but cities often lack the economic and political capacity to solve their own problems. They will need support from the states and the federal government, which likely will not come if rural and small-town representatives are not willing to grant it. Consider, for example, the wave of preemption laws right-wing state governments have passed to stop municipalities from raising wages, implementing anti discrimination ordinances, reining in police power, or building municipal broadband systems. The old Socialist movement made many of its first rural inroads by deftly using mass media, particularly newspapers. Today is left should attempt to replicate this by developing media aimed specifically at rural and small-town audiences. The decline of local print media has allowed a vacuum for Fox News and right-wing radio hosts to fill, but the Left can reach people who want an alternative to this steady diet of reactionary demagogy. A wave of public school strikes swept GOP-dominated states likeOklahomain 2018–19, which briefly revived a dormant militant tradition and pointed to a potential political opening among educators and other public service workers. The disintegration of rural communities has had terrible social consequences. At the same time, it gives the Left a chance to create even small circles that give people a social outlet and focal point for community life. As Green observes inGrass-Roots Socialism, “in many of the rural sections of the Southwest the party local served as a little Socialist community, a sort of surrogate for the declining ‘country community.’”The old Socialists also capitalized on people is discontent with established Christian denominations that catered to their exploiters. The “prosperity gospel” that is so popular today demands a new social gospel that resonates where evangelical Christianity is a central aspect of daily life. We should link social and spiritual appeals to a program of material demands, including land reform. As Levi Van Santhas argued, a land reform program that challenges concentrated land ownership and ecologically destructive corporate agriculture could bridge geographical divides and underpin a multiracial, working-class alliance. Rural areas are commonly assumed to be monolithically white, but that perception is far from the reality. Immigrants from Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere work onfarmsandmeatpacking plants, and substantial communities of Native Americans, blacks, and Latinos live throughout rural America. A strong, consistent message of racial equality must be an integral part of this agenda — not only to combat the racism and nativism of the Right but to appeal to core components of our potential base. In addition to the land question, a left-wing program would support funding for public schools and libraries, widening Medicare/Medicaid eligibility, mental health and substance abuse services, transportation investments that reduce auto dependence, high-speed broadband, and an expansion of the US Postal Service — including reestablishing postal banking to combat predatory check-cashing services and payday lenders. Marginalized urban communities share many of these same interests, which could make it easier to unite periphery and metropole around a common program than it initially appears. We ca not simply transpose what the Socialists did a hundred twenty years ago to our own time. But there is much to learn from this history, particularly when it comes to building a radical movement in apparently inhospitable territory. The legacy of Ameringer, Hall, and Debs can help us turn some of the most seemingly intractable corners of Republican America a deeper shade of red.

Did that help anyone?,-12.33,36.33,https://www.mic.com/p/the-second-presidential-debate-was-relatively-quiet-did-that-help-anyone-40154775,https://adfontesmedia.com/mic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-23,25,"When all is said and done, the award for ""most compelling person on stage"" during Thursday night issecond and final presidential debate could very well go to first lady Melania Trump, who forcefully — and very conspicuously — rejected her husband is half-hearted advances toward her as the pair posed for post-debate photographs. That alone should tell you all you need to know about the evening is proceedings, and just how much it seemed like everyone involved wished they could be doing something —else. It would be a dramatic understatement to call the debate a low-energy affair, despite it being the last scheduled chance for President Trump and Joe Biden to look one another in the eye and spout carefully rehearsed (or not) sound bites right to one another is face. And yet, with just weeks to go before America finishes voting for the next president of the USs, neither candidate seemed to have much to say on Thursday night, nor did they seem all that interested in saying it. There were no ""breakout moments,"" no jaw-dropping admissions or quintessentially Trumpian boasts, or anything particularly new at all. In part, that can be chalked up to the fact that it feels like this election has lasted decades, not months, and after all that is happened — remember when the president, his wife, and son all got coronavirus anddid not tell anyone for days? Remember when Biden? — it would be hard for anything to surprise us at this point. Still, given the potential gains from appearing before a massive national audience for the last time together, you would think Trump and Biden would act like they cared about being there. For Biden, the understated performance makes a degree of sense. Ahead in the polls, and running a campaign predicated on not rocking the boat, all he had to do was not screw up. If he landed a punch on Trump, all the better, but his job was to simply maintain what he had. He did have some good moments; his jabs at Trump is handling of the coronavirus pandemic were not exactly knockout blows, but they felt solid enough to get Biden is point that Trump has absolutely botched his pandemic response across nicely. It is an obvious point — 223,000 people have died in the US, with more to come — but an effective one nonetheless. Trump, on the other hand, was uncharacteristically demure (at least by his standards) for the first half of the debate. And even when he abandoned all pretense of his version of civility toward the end, he still seemed only half-heartedly enthusiastic in his jibes and retorts. In part, it seemed like Trump was struggling to stifle his screaming id in the hopes that he could come off as even moderately ""presidential"" — or at least not like a raving lunatic, which is the sort of thing the ""Suburban Housewives of America"" he so transparently feels he needs to win over probably do not love to see from him. Consider his performance in the first presidential debate, where his overly malicious attacks on Hunter Biden is history of drug addiction only served to give the former vice president one of the best moments of the night, and contributed to Biden isoverall debate win. Trump, meanwhile, saw potential voters repulsed by his performance in crucial battleground states, likely contributing to his attempt to come off at least slightly less manic this time around. That is, until about halfway through the night, when he either could not, or would not continue the charade anymore. He instead reverted back to his pugnacious true self, trotting out his campaign rally boasts like insisting to moderator Kristen Welker,who is Black, that he was the ""least racist person in this room.""Even so, it seemed like too little too late to actually make a difference for Trump. His attempt came off as tired and uninspired, his lines of attack were predictable and lacked any real enthusiasm. He was,to use his own words, extremely ""low energy.""All told, it is hard to see how anyone is opinion on either candidate could have been affected by the final debate. (Although it can be hard to see how anyone could possibly still be an undecided voter at this point, too.) If anything, the night was a relative wash for both Biden, who simply needed to not fail, and Trump, who was uncomfortably stuck between wanting to land bodyblows, and wanting to come across as something more than just a brawler. Which brings us back to Melania. For better or worse, when she pulled her hand away from her husband is grip during the post-debate denouement, it was one of the only moments that night where viewers could see someone who, like the m, was done pretending.",1,1,Mic

How did the media do?,-8.67,36.67,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/the-election-is-over-how-did-the-media-do/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-07,24,"Is not it ironic?For the past four years, President Donald Trump has beaten up, verbally abused, assailed and ridiculed the media. He has called them fake news and the enemy of the people. He has tweeted insults, yelled put-downs and tried to discredit them every chance he could. He has used rallies and press conferences to mock and bash them. As ABC is Jonathan Karl, the former White House Correspondents’ Association president, said on air Saturday, “(Trump) told people not to believe what they saw with their own eyes. He told people not to believe what they saw in newspapers and on television newscasts.”And yet as Election Day turned into Election Week and closed the curtains on Trump is anti-media presidency, the media shined. Yes, the past five days had the entire country on edge. The country was frustrated watching the results come in at what felt like a sloth is pace. We kept wondering when it was all going to be over. Tuesday night turned into Wednesday. Wednesday turned into Thursday. Thursday into Friday. Each day, we wondered if this was going to be the day it all ended. It all seemed like one long day broken up by short naps. Our diets consisted of hot coffee and cold pizza. We wore out our remote controls. We watched MSNBC is Steve Kornacki and CNN is John King work their big boards. We watched NBC is Chuck Todd break down the outstanding votes. We watched PBS is Judy Woodruff, ABC is George Stephanopoulos and CBS is Norah O’Donnell lead panel discussions. We saw Gloria Borger argue with Rick Santorum on CNN and Chris Christie argue with Rahm Emanuel on ABC We watched Fox News’ Chris Wallace bring common sense, wisdom and even-handedness. We started to see Chris Cuomo, Joy Reid, Wolf Blitzer, Brian Williams, Savannah Guthrie, Bill Hemmer and Gayle King in our sleep. We’d doze off to a map of Georgia on our TVs and wake up to a map of Nevada. We constantly hit refresh on the home pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post. We constantly checked the Twitter feeds of people such as Maggie Haberman and Nate Silver. We suddenly became experts on counties like Allegheny, Fulton and Maricopa. We learned the difference between mail-in ballots and provisionals. And while the country seemed stretched to its very limits, practically begging for the networks to just call the race already, especially as Joe Biden looked to be on his way to victory for a couple of days now, the news outlets did the right thing. They waited. They reported what they knew when they knew it. They offered possibilities about the future, but no guarantees or assurances that they could not back up with facts and numbers. They said the thing that is often so hard for media outlets to say: “We do not know.”In other words, they practiced responsible journalism. It was not easy. It was sometimes messy. But it was right. As CBS News’ John Dickerson appropriately put it: “The media does not call this race more than the weatherman makes it rain when he says it is raining outside. We are observing a thing that is happening, we have experts who know how that thing plays out, but we are doing nothing more than observing it.”Yes, there was a time when some observers grew restless and impatient, worried that a delay in calling the election for Biden was giving life to Trump is claims that the election was rigged. But the news outlets held fast to their standards, delaying a call until it was absolutely certain that Biden had secured the votes to become president. There appeared to be no major gaffes — a state projection that had to be walked back, for instance. Meanwhile, most networks showed outstanding instincts by pulling out of a Trump speech in which the president falsely claimed that he had won the election and would only lose if he was cheated. Anytime he tweeted or put out a statement, they immediately fact-checked him and shot down the claims that the election was rigged. Throughout the coverage, as commentators discussed what was happening, all outlets deftly walked the fine line of not declaring a victor, acknowledging that Biden appeared to be on his way to winning and, especially, debunking Trump is groundless allegations of fraud. Despite all this pressure to call a winner, the networks waited until they were sure, and that finally happened Saturday morning. So what is next?The work continues. Not just for Biden and the country. But for the media. As Karl said, “I think we have a challenge now as reporters and news organizations to — because (Trump) has effectively eroded the trust in much of this country in what they see in the mainstream media — and I think it is completely incumbent upon us as we are to rebuild that trust. He had the biggest bully pulpit in the world and he used it for four years to undermine largely what we do.”But you could make a strong case that the media used their work over the past four days to rebuild that trust. The media can be proud of its work covering this election, of responsibly covering the end of the presidency of a man who constantly criticized that media for four years. Is not that ironic?If 2023 felt tumultuous, 2024 seems to have gone completely off the rails. Poynter is media business experts dig into the causes — and effects. It is not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or make stuff up.

Last week, a federal judge dismissed lawsuits filed by theFederal Trade Commissionand a group of state attorneys general that accused the social media giant of engaging in anticompetitive practices.

That is been an issue for Facebook and Google, among others. The order also calls for regulation of companies that operate ""dominant online retail marketplaces"" that sell their own products as well as those of other businesses, encouraging the Federal Trade Commission to apply laws that bar unfair competition on such platforms.

Will other states come along for the ride?,-5.0,45.33,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2021-04-29/solar-power-water-canals-california-climate-change-boiling-point,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-29,25,"This is the April 29, 2021, edition of Boiling Point, a weekly newsletter about climate change and the environment in California and the American West. Sign up hereto get it in your inbox. Something remarkable happened over the weekend: California hit nearly 95% renewable energy. I will say it again: 95% renewables. For all the time we spend talking about how to reach 100% clean power, it sometimes seems like a faraway proposition, whether the time frame is California is 2045 target or President Biden ismore aggressive 2035 goal. But on Saturday just before 2:30 p.m., one of the world is largest economies came within a stone is throw of getting there. There are several caveats. For one thing, Saturday is 94.5% figure — a record, as confirmed to me by the California Independent System Operator — was fleeting, lasting just four seconds. It was specific to the state is main power grid, which covers four-fifths of California but does not include Los Angeles, Sacramento and several other regions. It came at a time of year defined by abundant sunshine and relatively cool weather, meaning it is easier for renewable power to do the job traditionally done by fossil fuels. And fossil fuels actually were doing part of the job — more than the 94.5% figure might suggest. California was producing enough clean power to supply nearly 95% of its in-state needs, but it was also burning a bunch of natural gas and exporting electricity to its Western neighbors. It is impossible to say exactly how much of the Golden State is own supply was coming from renewables. That said, what happened on Saturday is definitely a big deal.“It sends chills down my spine. It is amazing,” said Elliot Mainzer, president and CEO of the California Independent System Operator, which runs the state is main power grid. “These types of transitions are not always pretty. But we are getting a lot of renewable generation online, making a real dent in the state is carbon emissions.”I will get to the bit about the transition not always being pretty in a minute. For now, here is a chart based on data from the grid operator iswebsite, showing how various sources of power supply changed hour by hour on Saturday:That green line at the top is renewables; you can see how it jumps up in the morning and falls in the evening, reflecting sunrise and sunset. The orange line under that is natural gas. The red line at the bottom is out-of-state imports. It sinks into negative territory in the middle of the day because California has so much solar power that it is selling some to other states. The 94.5% record may have been fleeting, but it was not some isolated spike. Most of Saturday afternoon, the renewables number to pped 90%, with solar and wind farms doing the bulk of the work and geothermal, biomass and hydropower facilities making smaller contributions. Add in the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant — which is not counted toward California is renewables mandate — and there was enough climate-friendly power at times Saturday to account for more than 100% of the state is electricity needs. So California has lots of clean power. The important thing now is making sure the puzzle pieces of the grid fit together on hot summer evenings, like the ones last August when insufficient supplies after sundown led to rolling blackouts. State officials are taking many steps to avoid a repeat of last summer is emergency, some of which are more controversial than others. They are also beginning to focus on the longer term. Mainzer is grid operator recently urged the California Public Utilities Commission to order electric companies to add 10,000 megawatts of power by 2026 — about one-eighth of the state is entire generating capacity! — in part to make sure the re is enough supply on the grid when the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant closes.“That is not an inconsequential investment,” Mainzer said. No, it is most definitely not. But while some of the clean energy solutionsCalifornia is almost certain to need will carry a high up front price tag, others are much less expensive. In fact, some produce immediate savings. Case in point: the Western Energy Imbalance Market. I have avoided writing too much about theWestern EIM(acronym alert!) because it gets very wonky, very fast. But it is absolutely worth knowing about. It is a unique program that makes it easier for utility companies across the American West to share extra electricity, with a goal of saving money for rate payers (i.e. you and me) and reducing planet-warming emissions. How does it work? As I explained in a2017 deep dive for the Desert Sun, the program allows out-of-state utilities to participate in California is real-time electricity market, where they can buy power to fill in last-minute gaps between supply and demand. So if California has more solar power than it can use on a sunny afternoon — a growing trend each spring— it can send some of that cheap electricity to Arizona, which the n might be able to burn less coal. Or if the wind is ripping in Wyoming — home to some of the country isstrongest, most consistent gusts— California can tap into that clean power rather than firing up a gas plant. A key barrier to this type of cooperation in the past was mistrust: Red states worried about blue states shoving renewable energy down their throats, and blue states worried about red states forcing them to buy dirty energy. And nobody wanted to risk finding the mselves short on electricity in a pinch because some out-of-state utility made a higher bid for their power. But in the seven years since California launched the Western EIM, that mistrust has started to fade. There are now14 electric grid operators participating in the imbalance market, from Arizona Public Service in the Southwest to Idaho Power in the Northwest to Warren Buffett-owned Rocky Mountain Power in the Intermountain West. Several utilities joined this month,includingthe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which has long zealously guarded its independence. Several more are preparing to join, as far from California as NorthWestern Energy in Montana and El Paso Electric in Texas. By 2023, the market will cover 83% of electricity demand in the West. Here is a map of the current and planned participants:The program is growing so fast in part because of the measurable economic benefits. Through the end of 2020, participants collectively saved nearly $1.2 billion. Mainzer told me another $101 million in savings accrued in the first quarter of this year.“California has seen about $300 million of those benefits, and the state has not had to pay a penny to see that market get up and running,” he said. “It is just been a smashing success.”At the same time, political obstacles still stand in the way of a fully integrated Western power grid that could do a whole lot more to limit costs, reduce climate pollution and ultimately prevent power outages — “one grid to rule them all,” to borrow a phrase Ifirst saw used by Utility Dive journalist Herman K Trabish. Three years of discussion overexpanding the EIM, for instance, have not yet resulted in an agreement among the participants. A proposal from the n-Governor Jerry Brown that would have transitioned California is grid operator to a truly regional power authority — again, see my2017 deep dive— was defeated several times in the state Legislature, amid opposition from lawmakers who worried the plan would result in fewer in-state jobs and cede too much power over California is energy mix to other states. Some of those other states are similarly wary of Mainzer is Independent System Operator, which is led by appointees of the California governor. The agency is primary responsibility is serving Californians, even as it runs the EIM for the whole region. Those tensions came to a head last week when the grid operator is leaders voted to prioritize California is electricity needs during crunch times on the grid this summer, to the possible detriment of out-of-state utilities that typically have been able to send energy through California is power lines without much trouble. Arizona and Nevada is major utilities wrote that the plan was “not equitable or fair.” Mainzer is former employer, the Portland-based Bonneville Power Administration,was not happy either.“We take our obligations to California dead seriously,” Mainzer said. At the same time, he added, “we definitely are very motivated to help the broader West.” As California should be. The state will not make much of a difference on climate change unless it can bring the rest of the country and world along for the ride. At the moment, Mainzer is focused on keeping the lights on this summer. He is also happy to celebrate the 95% renewable energy record, even if only for a moment.“We have to remember the positives of the story as well,” he said. And now, here is what else is happening around the West:There is a growing recognition in California is Central Valley that the farm economy will shrink as droughts worsen and farmers face the consequences of pumping too much groundwater. That is one takeaway from this story by my colleague Louis Sahagún, who wrote about how farmers and farm workers are affected by increasingly scarce (and often polluted) water supplies, including many Latino families who face the risk of their drinking-water wells running dry. Columnist Michael Hiltzik, meanwhile, writes that westerners must come to term swith what John Wesley Powell told a Los Angeles irrigation conference in 1893: “You are piling up a heritage of conflict and litigation over water rights, for there is not sufficient water to supply the land.”President Biden is new climate target is more ambitious than California is. Biden pledged that the USs will slash its planet-warming pollution at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030, compared to the 47% the Golden State is aiming for, as Tony Barbozareports for The Times. (Tony also compiled abri ef history of US climate pledges.) America is new goal is roughly double what President Obama had sought to achieve, per The Times’ Chris Megerian. Biden ended his climate summit last week by making the case that global warming i sa challenge but also an economic opportunity, my colleague Anna M Phillips reports. Lest he be one-upped by Biden, Governor Gavin Newsom announced that California would study phasing out all oil production by 2045. He also said the state wills top issuing new f racking permits by 2024, Phil Willon and Taryn Luna report for The Times. By way of context, f racking accounts for a tiny fraction of oil and gas extraction in California; ending oil production would be a much bigger deal. See also my story from last week on scientists who say the state is falling behind on climate leadership. At this point, it seems like almost a given that California will see another historic fire season. So writes our new wildfire reporter, Alex Wigglesworth, in this piece previewing what we might face in a few short months. The short version: Nobody knows exactly how bad things will be, but a combination of meager rainfall, depleted snowpack and dry vegetation spells trouble. A stunning DDT dump site off the coast of Los Angeles is much bigger than scientists expected. My colleague Rosanna Xia writes that scientists aboard the research vessel Sally Ridewere so overwhelmed by the images sent up by deep-sea robots that it was like “trying to count stars in the Milky Way.” The research mission was prompted by Rosanna isincredible reporting on the hidden history of the country is largest DDT manufacturer dumping its pesticide waste into the Pacific Ocean. California officials are poised to order Nestlé to stop bottling and selling millions of gallons of water from San Bernardino National Forest. The proposed order comes six years after reporter Ian Jamesrevealedthat the company was taking water from the national forest under a permit that was supposed to expire in 1988. Here is the latest on what happens next from Ian and Janet Wilson at the Desert Sun. (Ian also has a scary piece for the Arizona Republic on the state of play on the Colorado River, including the fact that Lake Powell could dip low enough in the next few years that it stops being able to generate hydropower.)Water regulators continue to debate a proposed desalination plant in Huntington Beach. The facility faces all the usual tensions: It would generate clean drinking water while using lots of energy and harming marine life, as Bettina Boxall reports for The Times. One outstanding question is whether the developer, Poseidon Water, should not be allowed to sell water until it is ready to start its environmental mitigation work, which includes wetlands restoration at the nearby Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. A Texas-based group is pushing county governments in Colorado and other states to pass resolutions opposing Biden is goal of protecting 30% of US lands and waters by 2030. The hard-right American Stewards of Liberty was founded by the daughter of some of the original Sagebrush Rebels. She argues that the “30 by 30” goal — which was also endorsed by Governor Gavin Newsom — is “anti-capitalism,” “anti-individual liberty” and “anti-American,” as Nancy Lofholmreports for the Colorado Sun. President Biden is climate summit did not yield new commitments from most of the world is major polluters. One exception was South Korea, which pledged tos top financing new overseas coal plants, as Chris Megerian and Anna M Phillips report for The Times. Anna also put together a helpful rundown on how the world is biggest emitters are doing on their existing climate pledges. Back at home, the White House bolstered its own climate pledge by announcing it would push for a law requiring 80% clean electricity nationwide by 2030. A new analysis from researchers at Energy Innovation and UC Berkeleyconcludes that target is feasible, per Reuters’ Valerie Volcovici and Nichola Groom. Reuters’ Timothy Gardner also reports that the Biden administration will offer more than $8 billion in loans to support clean energy by expanding and upgrading the power grid. The Biden administration is also proposing to once again allow California to set its own tailpipe pollution rules. This was expected, but it is still a big deal forgetting America is largest source of climate pollution under control, Anna M Phillips reports. LA Times columnist Michael Hiltzik, meanwhile, explores a new report from the Environmental Protection Agency is inspector general finding the Trump administration deliberately locked out EPA scientists as it weakened tailpipe emissions rules.“Too many people drive like demons because they think they will not get caught. Knowing they might be on camera could help reduce the carnage.”That is Times columnist Steve Lopezmaking the case for two bills in Sacramentothat would seek to slow down drivers by allowing automated speeding enforcement. You will remember my recent piece about my friend Jim Pagels, who was killed in a car crash after years of advocating for safer streets that work for cyclists and pedestrians, not just drivers. REI says climate change is an existential threat — but it spent Earth Month helping Ford market a gas-guzzling SUV The outdoor recreation company has made environmental stewardship a core part of its branding, but that did not stop it from making ads promoting the Bronco Sport, and alerting its members with the email subject line “Load Up. Gas Up. Get Out,”per my story for The Times. I also learned that REI is director of sustain ability said he was “not aware of the advertisement before its release.”A new UN report says reducing methane emissions from oil and gas infrastructure is one of the best ways to keep the planet from heating up too quickly. More details herefrom Hiroko Tabuchi at the New York Times. In related news, the US Senatevoted 52-42 to reinstate Obama-era methane restrictions, per my colleagues Sarah D Wire and Anna M Phillips. Natural gas utilities are happy to slash methane emissions, but they have fought efforts to phase out gas in favor of clean electricity, arguing they can be part of the long-term climate solution. San Diego Gas & Electric just pledged to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045, joining its corporate sibling, Southern California Gas, as Rob Nikolewski reports for the San Diego Union-Tribune. It is not yet clear how either utility will reach that target. In the meantime, parent company Sempra Energy continues to seek Biden administration approval for anat ural gas export terminal in Mexico, as I reported earlier this year. Here in Southern California, a natural gas leak in Downey prompted a small evacuation Thursday after a SoCalGas pipeline was cut by a contractor in a residential area. Read more here, from The Times’ Priscella Vega and me.

447,A whistleblower speaks out over excavation of Native sites,-3.0,48.33,https://www.hcn.org/issues/52.12/indigenous-affairs-archaeology-a-whistleblower-speaks-out-over-excavation-of-native-sites,https://adfontesmedia.com/high-country-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,16,"In 2009, while excavating prehistoric artifacts, graduate student archaeologists from the University of California-Davis found Indigenous funerary objects and fragments of human bone. But despite what the law requires, according to internal documents obtained by, the archaeologists kept digging at the site. They continued the excavation, and apparently left a local tribe in the dark about their findings for years. The remains were likely relatives of either the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation or Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians, who are based in Mariposa and Tuolumne counties in the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The researchers collected at least 72 fragments and much of a human skull. At the time of this article, officials with the Bureau of Land Management — the agency that approved the digs — had not repatriated the remains, despite requests from tribes. “I have not even seen the artifacts and human remains yet,” said Southern Sierra Miwuk Tribal Chairman Bill Leonard. Stephanie Bergman, a former archaeologist at the BLM is Mother Lode Field Office in El Dorado Hills, California, where the digs were authorized, blew the whistle on what she alleges was misconduct by the university and her former employer. The case illuminates the often-fraught relationship between archaeological study and Indigenous rights, and the BLM is failure to hold violators accountable. Bergman, who now works for the National Park Service, hopes that her experience will shed light on these issues. Unanswered questions abound, and the BLM has failed to confirm even basic facts. But Bergman provided with a patchwork of internal documents that reveal a bureaucratic process that can leave tribes disenfranchised when they try to protect their ancestors’ still-buried remains, or recover them once they are unearthed — especially if that tribe is not federally recognized.those UC Davis students were pulling human remains out of burial sites in the first place. The problems began in June 2009 in the central Sierra Nevada foothills. UC Davis anthropology professor Jelmer Eerkens had a BLM permit to dig on federal land in Mariposa County, where his students hoped to find obsidian artifacts from the Indigenous communities who lived here over 3,000 years ago. Three digs revealed shell beads and a shell pendant, along with fragments of cranium, ribs, scapula, clavicle and other remains of six individuals. They halted some portions of the digs “due to the discovery of human remains,” according to a student dissertation that Bergman acquired. The puzzling part is why they continued with the rest, pulling dozens of bone fragments out of the ground, according to internal emails, rather than immediately stopping so the BLM could consult tribes, as is required by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). Seven years later, in 2016, Eerkens notified the BLM that the students had only just realized, upon closer review in a lab, that they had excavated fragmentary human, not animal, bones. Yet the dissertation claims the students knew they had encountered human remains at those sites, at the time of the digs: “Excavation of three of the units had to be halted … due to the discovery of human remains,” the student wrote. “The remaining six units were excavated.” Both Eerkens and the former graduate student declined to speak with. Following Eerkens’ notification, the BLM sent a letter to inform the Tuolumne Me-Wuk, the closest federally recognized tribe in the area, about the remains. The Tuolumne Me-Wuk suggested contacting the Southern Sierra Miwuk: “We realize that they are not Federally Recognized but are probably the (most likely descendants). If you are not allowed by law to consult with the m, we wish to initiate consultation on this matter.”But Southern Sierra Miwuk Chairman Leonard did not hear about the issue until 2018. “If the re is no federally recognized tribe in the county, (BLM officials) do not go through the protocols they should because we do not have that government-to-government relationship,” he told. In 2018, the two tribes asked that the relatives and funerary objects be repatriated. The agency declined to answer why repatriation has not yet happened. Where are the remains and artifacts now? That is also murky. Since the excavations occurred on BLM land, the agency has legal control. But spokes people would not answer questions on the topic. According to Chairman Leonard, his most recent information places the remains at UC Davis. Yet an employee with the university is anthropology museum told the remains are not there. Bergman, the former BLM archaeologist, says that Eerkens explained during a meeting in 2018 that he had at least some of them in his personal possession — even though federal law requires storage in a federally approved facility. “I was thinking, ‘Are these things in his garage, and how many does he have?’ ” Bergman recalled.that issues with the university is field school — and the BLM is permitting and consultation practices — continued well past 2009. In the summer of 2010, the school planned more fieldwork in Mariposa County. “I know that this type of information is very valuable to research and it will help others to understand our ancestors and their way of life,” wrote Tuolumne Me-Wuk Cultural Director Stanley Cox in a letter to the BLM before the digs began. “But we cannot condone excavating archeological sites just in the name of research so a graduate student can make a name for the mselves.” The letter was dated a week past the Archaeological Resources Protection Act deadline to air grievances. The crunched time line was a pattern, according to Bergman. Both she and her predecessor, now an archaeologist in Wyoming, received last-minute permit proposals from UC Davis that left less than the legally required 30 days for tribal consultation. “I think they were doing this knowing that I/the BLM/ would not have time to scrutinize the application, nor would the tribes,” Bergman later wrote in an internal complaint. “I was too new and too busy to question it all or know the difference.” It is unclear how the archaeologists responded to the Tuolumne Me-Wuks’ letter, or whether burials were found that summer, but the BLM did authorize a permit. If any field schools took place between 2010 and 2016, records for these projects were missing, as of a 2018 internal BLM investigation. In the summer of 2017, part of a human skull was unearthed in Mariposa County when a wildfire crew bulldozed an area in response to a blaze. The sheriff was notified, as is standard procedure. A deputy called Leonard, who quickly came to the site, and together they found the cranium. “We prayed over it and put it back in the ground,” Leonard told. Two months after Leonard reinterred the remains, the BLM authorized UC Davis to excavate at the same site, according to site numbers on the research proposal and other documents. It is unclear whether that dig took place or why the agency authorized work at a site known to have human remains. The BLM also apparently approved a “human remains discovery protocol” that year on how to handle inadvertently discovering burials. The protocol, submitted by a UC Davis researcher, provides a window into where the process may be breaking down, stating: “Upon discovery of human remains, excavation in the unit of discovery will cease immediately. … While the protocol for human remains discovery is being undertaken, work will continue at the site in areas away from the unit where the human remains were discovered.” This policy received mixed reviews from several experts in archaeology and cultural resource law — perhaps a reflection of varying interpretations of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. One California archaeologist said it seemed like standard procedure — that NAGPRA only requires excavation tourgently stop in the burial is immediate area, not necessarily at the entire site. Other legal experts were alarmed. Leonard and his two predecessors told me it would be highly unusual to let archaeologists continue digging anywhere near a burial. For her part, Bergman emailed her supervisors about the UC Davis protocol: “(It) gives the field school and the BLM the authority to not comply to NAGPRA.” She sent her concerns to Emily Palus, at the time deputy division chief of cultural resources for the entire BLM Palus told over the phone that she did have concerns about the “university is write-up” and “per protocol, I contacted Tony Overly, the BLM cultural lead in the (California) state office.” The BLM did not answerHCN is multiple requests to interview Overly.archaeologist in 2018, Bergman had to review requests from developers, researchers and anyone else whose work on BLM land might have archaeological impacts. Within a week of her new job, she noticed unresolved questions regarding the UC Davis field school. Bergman, who was concerned when she heard burials had been excavated in 2009, could not find much documentation of previous field schools. But while searching the office, she discovered something else disconcerting. “Stephanie (Bergman) was … reviewing our very old files on this, dating back to the late 1990s,” the n-field manager Bill Haigh wrote in an email to colleagues. “While doing so she discovered a plastic bag filled with what appear to be human remains. In our files. Related to the first (UC Davis) field school.” The bag was labeled with the name of a former field office archeologist from the ’90s and stored with a folder labeled “NA Remains.” Bergman never learned what became of the remains. Bergman began to worry that this was more than just a single mistake by a well-meaning graduate student or overworked BLM manager — that it was an ongoing problem. Weeks before the field school was to start that summer, Bergman convinced her superiors to deny UC Davis any new fieldwork permits. She the n complained to the Office of Inspector General about the constellation of issues surrounding the BLM is archaeological permitting practices — from apparently allowing burial excavations in 2009, to the bag of bones at the office. OIG officials kicked her complaint to the BLM The land agency complete da basic review of records related to the complaint, as well as a rigorous law enforcement investigation of its employees’ conduct. One of the investigative reports, whichobtained, said documentation of 2009, 2010 and 2017 digs was missing from the BLM is files. “There are no field maps, field notes, artifact catalogs, locational data, periodic updates or a final report in the files,” Colorado BLM archaeologist Daniel Haas said in the report. “The permit records do not show that reporting was completed in a timely fashion, if at all.” Haas noted that the principal investigator on the BLM permit, likely the professor in this case, needed to provide more oversight of graduate student fieldwork in the future. The BLM also referred the case to the US Attorney is Office in Sacramento. Experts say it can be difficult to convince federal attorneys to take on NAGPRA or ARPA cases. “Crimes of violence, common law crime, people hurting people, those are easy (for federal attorneys) to see as important,” said David Barland-Liles, a National Park Service law enforcement manager and National NAGPRA Office Investigator. “But crimes against resources, particularly resources of a cultural nature … presenting those to the US Attorney is Office — those are harder sells.” A public information officer with the US Attorney in Sacramento declined to comment on whether they investigated the case. By October 2019, the “BLM Director” referred the case to the California state director for “administrative action,” according to internal emails. It is not clear whether California BLM did take any internal disciplinary actions. The only repercussions the university archaeologists faced appear to be a letter from the BLM In 2018, the agency drafted a missive, noting that the school had violated the terms of its Archaeological Resources Protection Act permits, as well as NAGPRA In June 2020,asked the BLM about the status of the letter, whichHCNobtained. Three weeks later, in July, the agency issued a finalized letter to Eerkens, requiring him to send reports and deposit the ancestral remains and funerary objects at an approved curatorial facility this fall. “The BLM is assessing the adequacy of the University is performance with regards to the permits,” Martha Maciel, a public information officer at the time, wrote in an email. “The BLM will work to bring it into conformance.”At the time of this article, the agency did not respond to multiple requests to interview James Barnes, who helped shepherd the UC Davis permits in 2009 and 2010, and is now head of California BLM is tribal relations. Calls to the Tuolumne Me-Wuk have also gone unanswered. Eerkens told by email that the Tuolumne Me-Wuk are “working with the BLM” regarding the remains and objects excavated in 2009, “and out of respect to the tribe and their ancestors, they asked me not totalk about this further. I apologize.” Eerkens did not mention the Southern Sierra Miwuk, whose territory his graduate students excavated.“It is difficult to f athom archaeologists did not know they were excavating a Native American burial.”, the real problem underlying this tangled mess is that his tribe is not federally recognized. “If we were recognized, the BLM could not dodge us,” he told me. Since 1982, the tribe has actively sought recognition. The US government said in its latest rebuff that the Southern Sierra Miwuk do not constitute a modern “community.” Being unrecognized means the tribe is not always protected under federal archaeology laws. It must work alongside a recognized tribe in order to participate in the consultation that the BLM is required to do before archaeological digs.“We have to go to our big brother over in Tuolumne or someone else and say, ‘Hey (the government is) picking on me.’ ” Leonard said. In the case of the Mariposa County excavations, the Tuolumne Me-Wuk Tribe is assisting in the stalled repatriation process. “We are fortunate to have a tribe there to help us. … Without them we’d have been just bulldozed over in a sense.”Without recognition, Leonard also ca not access various funding sources for administrative staff. That makes consultation nearly impossible. “Even when they say you have the right to participate, yeah, it is kind of like access to health insurance. You can buy it if you have got enough money,” Leonard said. “(The BLM will) pick a tiny spot out of thousands of acres and the n say, ‘What are your concerns?’ ” Leonard said with a shrug. That kind of question takes time and resources to answer — two things he has in short supply. This is a problem not just for the tribe, but for the BLM, whose attempts at consultation can fail if the tribal chairman is unable to respond. Over the years, however, Leonard said, working with universities and the federal government on archaeology and repatriation has gotten “a lot better.” While the BLM process is still challenging, he is optimistic that the issue of the Mariposa County excavations will be resolved. He received a letter from the BLM this summer that said the agency wanted to conduct tribal consultation. Bergman, meanwhile, left the BLM in frustration over how she says her superiors handled these issues. Leonard spoke with the new archaeologist at the Mother Lode Field Office a few months ago and was encouraged by her attitude. “I think we are going to have different results in the future,” he said. Until Leonard gets his ancestors back, he will be banking on promises. “I felt like she was going to make sure that these things did not happen in the futureAs long as she was there.”High Country Newsin California.

449,Holcomb rejects bill limiting local health department actions in third veto of session,0.0,45.33,https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2021/05/04/gov-holcomb-vetoes-bill-limiting-local-health-department-actions/4945283001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/indianapolis-star-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,19,"Governor Eric Holcomb vetoed a bill that could have made it more challenging for local health departments to implement COVID-19 business restrictions and require masks. Until this legislative session, Holcomb had only used his veto powers twice. Now he is vetoed legislation three times this session alone, just the latest sign of discord between the Republican legislative super majority and Holcomb, a fellow Republican. Throughout the pandemic, Holcomb allowed cities and counties to enact more stringent restrictions than his own, a power that Indianapolis especially found necessary to use. Senate Bill 5, though, would have required restrictions from those local health departments to be approved by their local legislative bodies and, in the case of local cities, by the mayor. In Indianapolis, that means the city-county council and Mayor Joe Hogsett. Opponents to the bill worried that adding that extra level of bureaucracy would cause unnecessary delays in times of emergency. Holcomb agreed, arguing in his letter on the veto that the legislation would ""restrict necessarily flexibility in the law, and further undermine local responses to future public health emergencies.""Four months into office, Spartz announces reelection campaign in 5th Congressional District""(Local health officers) and their departments must frequently make urgent, complex decisions to safeguard public health where time is of the essence and expertise is critical,"" Holcombsaid in the letter, which was addressed to Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray. Holcomb also argued the legislation could have far reaching impact beyond the COVID-19 pandemic with other illnesses.""Right now it is critical that we maintain our local health expertise, flexibility and all tools needed to respond,"" Holcomb wrote. ""We must not do anything that jeopardized this as our heroic local health officials remain critical in the months to come as we accelerate our recovery and work to vaccinate many more Hoosiers.""Senate Bill 5 also would have allowed people to appeal local health department actions during an emergency to the local legislative body. Likewise, a health officer would need approval from a legislative body to go to court to enforce an order if needed, another step opponents worried could slow the process. The bill also required local legislative bodies to approve the appointment of health officers, and enabled them to remove them for good cause. Holcomb criticized those provisions as well. Local health officials had widely condemned the bill as it moved through the legislative process, but the discussion became much more relevant after Holcomb ended the statewide mask mandate and all business restrictions in April, after months of pressure from conservative lawmakers. Local communities were the ones left making decisions on what restrictions should be required to limit the spread of COVID-19. Some communities, including Marion County, opted to continue their mask mandates. Health advocacy organizations worried this legislation would hinder local officials' ability to make those informed decisions rapidly without political pressure. Lawmakers who supported the measure, however, argued the bill in fact was pro-local control.""This language is not a knee-jerk reaction or a combative response to any enforcement action,"" said bill author Senator Chris Garten, R-Charlestown when the Senate approved the legislation April 21, ""Senate Bill 5 simply creates a structural check and balance on a position that has unparalleled authority under these emergency orders.""Because lawmakers only recessed and did not officially adjourn when they finished their business last month in order to redistrict in the fall, they could come back at any time and override Holcomb is veto. They would only need a simple majority to override it. The final version of Senate Bill 5 passed the House by a 65-29 vote, and passed the Senate by a 37-12 vote. When asked by IndyStar, Bray, a Martinsville Republican, did not indicate whether lawmakers would move to overturn the veto.""My caucus and I felt that SEA 5 created another productive check and balance on our government,"" Bray said in a statement to IndyStar. ""I have only just learned of the veto and will discuss the matter with my caucus before we decide how to proceed.""House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, did not immediately respond to request for comment. Holcomb had already vetoed two measures this year: one that would allow the General Assemblyto call itself into a special session and another that would have increased labeling for ethanol fuel at gas stationsThe former veto was overridden before lawmakers left the Statehouse last month. Last week,Holcomb filed a lawsuit asking a Marion County judge to stop the law regarding the special session, an action he took over the objection of Attorney General Todd Rokita. Holcomb thinks the state constitution only allows the governor to call lawmakers into session. Lawmakers, though, think they can call what they termed a special session. It was clear from the beginning of this session that Holcomb and lawmakers were not entirely on the same page. Early on, they voted to override a veto from the 2020 legislative session that prohibited local units of government from regulating most aspects of the landlord-tenant relationship.",2,2,Indianapolis Star
450,Missouri voters narrowly approve Medicaid expansion,-3.33,49.33,https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-voters-narrowly-approve-medicaid-expansion/article_197d1897-5978-5daa-b9dc-3017e3a0ae06.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/st-louis-post-dispatch/,2020-08-05,19,"JEFFERSON CITY — Ignoring pleas from Republican leaders, Missouri voters approved a plan Tuesday to expand Medicaid coverage to more than 230,000 low-income people in the state. Missouri voted to expand its Medicaid program, as 53% of voters supported the measure. Missouri now joins 37 other states that have already expanded the federally subsidized health insurance program. The decision will mean adults between the ages of 19 and 65 whose income is at or below 138% of the federal poverty level will be covered. As of this year, that amounts to $17,608 for an individual and $36,156 for a household of four. The vote comes after repeated rejections by the GOP-controlled Legislature after the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 allowed states to expand who can get coverage. The constitutional amendment marks the latest setback for Republicans when it comes to ballot initiatives. Voters also approved a minimum wage hike and rejected a right-to-work law pushed by former Governor Eric Greitens in 2018.“Our campaign could not have happened without the work of countless Missourians across the state who have been working towards expanding Medicaid for years. We would not be here today without the hard work of so many for so long. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank everyone who has worked toward this moment,” organizers of the Yes on 2 campaign said in a Facebook message Tuesday night. The federal government now covers about 65% of Medicaid costs, while the rest comes from the state. But populations covered under Medicaid expansion would have 90% covered by federal funding. An analysis by the Washington University-basedCenter for Health Economics and Policyfound that expansion would add 231,000 adults and 40,500 children to the rolls, costing the state $118 million a year. But that additional cost would be offset by savings elsewhere, as well as an increase in tax revenue because of a boost in spending on health care services. The bottom line: Missouri would save $39 million a year by expanding the program. Supporters also say the increase in federal money flowing to doctors, hospitals and other providers could spur the creation of thousands of jobs. A fiscal note filed by Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat running for governor, suggests the expansion will either save $1 billion or cost $200 million. BJC HealthCare president and CEORichard Liekwegearlier told the Post-Dispatch that he believes Medicaid expansion would be an economic boost for the state.“It will keep small, rural hospitals open that are operating on a thread of an operating margin to day,” Liekweg said. “For large systems — like BJC, SSM, St. Luke is in Kansas City, CoxHealth in Springfield, Mercy Health — it will allow us to continue to keep all of our doors and access points open.”Hospitals bankrolled the “Yes on 2” campaign with more than $10 million in contributions. In the week leading up to the vote, opponents said the added cost would result in less funding for schools, universities and other social service programs. Governor Mike Parson warned the strain of the pandemic on state coffers made it the wrong time to expand.“I do not think it is the time to be expanding anything in the state of Missouri right now. There is absolutely not going to be any extra money whatsoever,” the Republican governor said. But other states that have expanded the program have not seen a massive drain on their budgets. Rather, studies have found that expansions resulted in reductions in uncompensated care costs for hospitals and clinics, which has helped stabilized struggling, rural hospitals. In neighboring Arkansas, which expanded Medicaid in January 2014, a2015 Gallup report showed the state is uninsured rate had been cut roughly in half, dropping from 22.5% to 11.4% ― the biggest reduction in the nation.

451,New unemployment officials reveal plans to get jobless in Nevada help,0.0,49.0,https://www.reviewjournal.com/business/new-unemployment-officials-reveal-plans-to-get-jobless-in-nevada-help-2097904/?itm_source=parsely-api,https://adfontesmedia.com/las-vegas-review-journal-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,24,"The new leaders tasked with managing the state is unemployment crisis say they do not know the extent of the claims backlog. But they are 10 days in and working to find out — and tell everybody else, too.“We just really want to get a good sense of those and the n be open and transparent and put it on the website. And every week we would update it,” said Barbara Buckley, head of the state is new rapid-response effort aimed at working through the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation is worst problems. Buckley and Elisa Cafferata, the new acting director of DETR, have their work cut out for them. Cafferata is the department is third director since March, when Governor Steve Sisolak ordered a statewide shutdown to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The previous two resigned. Cafferata is immediate predecessor, Heather Korbulic, resigned June 19 out of fear for her safety. The department has been flooded with applications from Nevadans desperate for financial relief as the state is jobless rate, just 3.6 percent in February, shot up to a staggering 30.1 percent in April before it tumbled the past few months, state and federal data shows. DETR reported that it had received nearly 621,000 new unemployment claims since the week ending March 14, when Sisolak ordered sweeping business closures to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The department reported roughly 398,000 additional claims for the benefits program for self-employed workers and independent contractors, Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.“There are two systems with two sets of rules and a group of people eligible in one, a group of people eligible for another, and a third group of people eligible for both,” Cafferata said. She and Buckley represent the new leadership in the ongoing unemployment crisis. Their first priorities are to implement quick system fixes, bolster staffing and beat back fraud. System glitchesThey identified technical tweaks and a larger staff as immediate solutions to speed up claims processing. Buckley and Cafferata said they are looking for common denominators in claims that have been automatically flagged to find a way to move them along in bulk.“Let is say, for example, we need a tax return filed for PUA, (and you can) say, ‘Just look, is it there? OK, boom. I am going to do, what, a thousand in two days and get those moving,’ ” Buckley said. Technical fixes could allow for mass adjudication and faster approvals, she said. Other issues or categories could include early filers, people eligible for both PUA and traditional benefits and claims needing additional identity verification, Buckley said. Additionally, the state is identifying ways to increase staff through hiring or borrowing from state agencies. It has already identified 300 potential workers in the Department of Health and Human Services’ division of welfare and supportive services who are willing to work overtime for DETR.“We are pushing on every lever we possibly can to help bring staffing resources in,” Cafferata said. She and Buckley said they are also hearing from retired employees with DETR is employment security division who are interested in helping and would not require training. Buckley said she has recruited volunteers for the task force she is heading, including Anthony Pearl, general counsel for The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas; Steve Fisher, administrator for the state is welfare division; Vanessa Alpers, a longtime state employee; and Michael Schmidt, senior intelligence manager at Siemens.‘Fraud is not an excuse’DETR and state officials have pointed to rampant fraud as a significant roadblock to paying out claims. Many states are dealing with the same issues. Fraud is as big a problem as it is made out to be, Buckley said, “conservatively” estimating 200,000 fraudulent benefits applications in Nevada. In court documents produced last month, DETR estimated that between 133,748 and 185,484 possibly fraudulent jobless claims have been filed.“Fraud is not an excuse to not pay eligible folks, but they clog up the pipeline,” Buckley said. “And they cause staff to spend time they should not be spending on claims when you have an eligible, deserving Nevadan waiting.”The state brought aboard Bill Strong, the former chief fraud investigator in the state is welfare agency, to help “build out” DETR is fraud unit, Cafferata said. That will take some time to do, but in the meantime, the department is working with the offices of the US attorney and the state attorney general to combat and prosecute bogus claims. Additionally, the state recently approved language for an automated response that will go out to those who report fraud. The response details next steps for possible fraud victims and assures them that their report has been received, Buckley said. Buckley said the state is compiling fraud data and will release that to the public. DETR will work to be responsive to the public in its work, but Cafferata said she knows that the strongest way to regain the trust of a frustrated public is to pay claims.“Our goal is to pay everybody who is legally eligible and the n do a better job of communicating with folks if they do not meet (those) requirements,” she said.

452,Why the Stop Internet Sexual Exploitation Act could be the end of internet porn,-18.0,31.0,https://www.dailydot.com/debug/sisea-internet-porn/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-dot-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,15,"In an effort to crack down on revenge and child pornography, a pair of senators have proposed legislation that critics say will be the death knell for most internet porn. The bipartisanStop Internet Sexual Exploitation Act(SISEA) is proposed by Sens. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). The act requires internet companies to establish standards intended to protect people from sexual exploitation online, a well-known and devastating phenomenon that has ruined countless lives.“For years,Pornhuband its parent company Mindgeek monetized rape, abuse, and child exploitation. While these suit-wearing traffickers got rich, their victims have lived with the pain and fear,” Sasse said i na release. “That has to end now. Our bill is aimed squarely at the monsters who profit from rape.”While admirable in purpose, SISEA is written so broadly, and is so burdensome, that most web sites would have little choice but to stop hosting pornographic content. If it passes, internet porn could disappear entirely or, more likely, move to servers in foreign countries and the dark web, where protections are fewer and the content more insidious. SISEA requires companies to establish 24-hour hot lines for take-down requests by victims, and demands that sites remove content within two hours of a request. It also bans downloads entirely, as well as re-uploads of content that is been taken down under the act. It additionally requires the attorney general to create a database of all individuals who do not consent to having their images uploaded. Internet companies must “ensure that no individual who appears in the pornographic image is listed in the database” prior to allowing content to be posted. For each piece of content, they must upload signed consent forms that include performers’ ages, names, the content the form applies to, and where it can be distributed. Financial penalties for violations are also severe. Sites that host content without a consent form can be fined up to “$1,000 for each day or fraction the reof during which a pornographic image is hosted on the platform.” These funds are earmarked for the attorney general is office to provide services to victims, including mental healthcare, medical care, and legal services. Further, under SISEA, victims can sue platforms. Such lawsuits would be subject to strict liability, meaning that a plaintiff need not prove actual harm or negligence by the platform to be compensated. Even absent these financial penalties, the 24-hour hotline, two-hour removal window, and database requirements are so onerous and expensive that most, if not all, web sites would be forced to stop hosting pornography altogether. This impacts not only the companies the mselves, but also the sex workers who make a living on sites likeOnlyFans, which has gained a significant following in the last year. SISEA would likely have a disproportionate impact on marginalized sex workers, such as transgender people and racial and sexual minorities, for whom the internet provides a safer means of earning a living in what is a particularly dangerous profession for such groups. So, a little PSA:#stopSISEA#stopSISEA#stopSISEAThis bill is not only attempting to ""civilize"" the Wild West of our generation; the internet, it also causes widespread damage to it and minority communities that rely on and call it home by slamming down on NSFW content.pic.twitter.com/JMK5ySSefd#stopSISEAthis bill is going to kill sex workers, trans people and bi po c but the people campaigning for it do not care.@AOC@SenGillibrand@SenSchumerPLEASE listen to what sex workers and content creators who are educated on the subject have to say before you vote for it. This bill is attempt to protect revenge porn and child sexploitation victims uses a ham-handed approach that fails to provide sex workers with the same level of protection. The database allows people to refuse to have image of the mselves uploaded, but does not apply to sex workers who may want to keep particular images of the mselves off the internet. This seems based on the false belief that sex workers are not also potential victims of revenge and child porn. SISEA also forces sex workers to reveal their true identities to the government, a less-than-enticing prospect for many. Its provisions even apply equally to both actual and computer-generated images, so SISEA could decimate cartoon,furry, and other CGI pornography—all in the name of cracking down on revenge and child porn. Sex workers, their allies, and advocates for internet freedom alike have joined voices in opposition to this far-reaching bill. “Now is not the time to target sex workers,” commented one of thousands tweeting#StopSISEA Many are urging people to contact their representatives in Congress.#StopSISEAplease i need more people to call their senators because mine wont do a damn thing about it🖋 Sign “Stop SISEA” and I will deliver a copy to your officials:📨 Number 1 is from Sophie to@GillibrandNY, @RepJohnKatko and@SenSchumer#NY24#NYpolitics#NYpolpic.twitter.com/5ykoHyXB6zThe vast majority of people agree that revenge, child, and sexual assault pornography is a scourge on the internet.

Since his 2018 election, DeSantis has thrilled the GOP base by governing like a mini Trump. He defied public health guidelines during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic last year and kept Florida virtually free of a statewide lockdown. In May he perpetuated Trump is 2020 election lie and signed a restrictive voting rights bill live on Fox News. And last month hedispatchedFlorida law enforcement agents to Texas to “secure [the] southern border.” According to one recent conservative poll, DeSantis beat Trump with a 74% approval rating (Trump scored 71%). But in the wake of the Surfside condo collapse, DeSantis is claim to the MAGA mantle is facing its biggest test, with DeSantis putting management of the tragedy ahead of Trump is need for blind loyalty.

On July 1, DeSantis appeared alongside Presidentand praised him for the federal government is response to the tragedy. (The moment recalled the greeting between New Jersey governorChris ChristieandBarack Obamaafter Hurricane Sandy.)In recent days I spoke with a half dozen GOP insiders about the recent flare-ups between DeSantis is and Trump is camps. The sources agreed that DeSantis and Trump are on an inevitable collision course as the 2024 GOP field takes shape. “There is going to be a blowup,” a prominent Republican said. “Trump fucking hates DeSantis. He just resents his popularity,” a Trump confidant told me. Asked for comment, Trump spokespersonsaid: “Governor DeSantis has shown great respect.”Part of Trump is irritation with DeSantis is that Trump famously claims credit for anyone in his orbit who gains attention. “Trump tells people, ‘I made Ron,’” the prominent Republican said. “Trump says that about a lot of people. But in this case it is actually true.” According to sources, the n congressman DeSantis cultivated Trump is support during the 2018 gubernatorial primary by hanging out at Trump is Washington, DC, hotel. “Ron basically ran his primary campaign out of the hotel. He buttonholed Trump supporters and his friends,” the prominent Republican said. For much of the 2018 gubernatorial primary, DeSantis trailed Florida agriculture commissionerBut after Trump endorsed DeSantis in June, DeSantis zoomed12 points ahead. DeSantis won the primary by nearly 20 points. Once in office, DeSantis irked Trump by demonstrating an ability to push back, albeit in private.

DeSantis has also built an impressive fundraising operation of his own that gives him leverage in his budding rivalry with Trump.

Spokespeople for DeSantis and Griffin declined to comment. DeSantis needs to walk a tightrope as he seeks to position himself for a 2024 run.

Except none of that appears to be true. She appears to have been in her office, away from the events entirely. AOC was quick to respond to the new reports. She made statements about the reports on Twitter. People were trying to rush and infiltrate our office buildings – that is why we had to get evacuated in the first place. The attempts of attackers & publicly available communications show how they tried to gain access and share location info on finding members for physical harm.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)February 3, 2021She states that the reports are examples of the manipulative right and that no one understands the layout of the Capitol complex. You can see the layout above and see that the is clearly not near the Capitol building that was breached. Rioters never breached the Cannon building. She also claims that Trump supporters planted bombs around her offices. While those bombs were relocated outside the RNC and DNC offices, neither of those are located in the Cannon building. The closest is the RNC, which is in an adjacent block. It looks more like AOC is the one manipulating here. She appears to be manipulating her story to create an emotional response.

In an emergency meeting called with 20 minutes’ notice, the Charlottesville City Council voted unanimously to cancel another piece of public art targeted by left-wing activists.“I feel that it should just be melted down,” Rose Ann Abrahamson, a Sacagawea descendant,said during the council meeting, The Daily Progress reported. “I feel that it is entirely offensive and it should be obliterated.”Within minutes, a city work crew — the same group that had dismantled equestrian statues of Gens. Robert E Lee and Thomas “Stonewall” Jackson earlier Saturday — arrived with ropes, a crane, and pry bars to wrench the artwork off the plinth where it had stood on Charlottesville is West Main Street since 1919. Local observer Molly Congerdocumented the process on Twitter.“Getting right down to business, not even taking the cherry picker off the truck,” Conger wrote. Lewis, the famous American adventurer who was sent by President Thomas Jefferson to explore the land west of the Mississippi River in 1804, was a local hero born in Charlottesville is Albemarle County. The bronze statue cast to honor the Lewis and Clark expedition includes the two men and Sacagawea, their Shoshone guide and interpreter. In recent years its design has been criticized for its portrayal of Sacagawea, who appears in a crouching position behind the standing white men — which activists have seen as disparaging. But some historians contend that her posture shows her in action as a tracker and is not meant to place her in a subservient stance.

In the wake of the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, when Trump supporters violently stormed the building to prevent congressional certification of Joe Biden is election as president, the suit alleges that Wesley Scott sought to fire employees he believed had made pro-Trump posts on social media. Scott, president of the Kain & Scott law firm, terminated two employees — and the n fired three of his law partners after they told him his actions were violating Minnesota law, according to the legal complaint. The partners whom Scott fired — William Kain, Margaret Henehan and Kelsey Quarberg — are suing for wrongful termination from the St. Cloud-based law firm that specializes in bankruptcy cases. On its website,Kain & Scotttouts itself as ""Minnesota is largest and nicest bankruptcy firm."" In addition to St. Cloud, the firm has offices in eight other Minnesota cities including Brainerd, Duluth, Mankato and Rochester, and in the Twin Cities metro, Eagan, Maple Grove, Eden Prairie and Roseville. The three former partners charge that Scott accused them of planning a ""coup"" against him, according to the suit. On Tuesday, Scott said he had not seen the legal complaint and could not comment until he'd had a chance to read it. Quarberg said that she and the other former partners have been advised by their attorney not to comment. According to the complaint, Scott was disturbed by the Capitol riot and sent an e-mail in April to all the firm is lawyers, saying that the ""traitors on January 6"" should have been shot. He the n told the firm is operations manager to fire two employees he labeled ""racist"" because they had pro-Trump and pro-police posts on their social media accounts. When she refused to fire the employees, Scott fired her, according to the complaint. Scott the n fired an additional employee and threatened to fire another. The three partners confronted Scott, according to court documents, and told him that firing an employee for political beliefs is against state law. Scott the n fired them and called St. Cloud police to remove Quarberg, claiming she was trespassing and physically threatening him. Scott cut off the partners' phones and e-mail accounts and changed the locks on the offices, the complaint says. He told other law firm employees that the partners had been fired for insubordination, according to the complaint, and disparaged them in an online meeting with the firm is staff.""We have three employees … who are way over the top violating everything that is dear to us and I will not let it happen,"" the complaint quotes Scott as saying. Since firing the three partners, the suit alleges, Scott has tried to prevent them from collecting unemployment and health care benefits. What is more, the firm is ownership is in limbo. The three fired partners together own 50% of the firm, with Scott owning the other half. According to the suit, the fired partners negotiated a buyout under the firm is partnership agreement, but Scott reneged after first agreeing to it.""Scott engaged in conduct at the firm that was inappropriate for an employee, let alone the president of the firm,"" the complaint says. The three fired partners are seeking a number of remedies including back pay and benefits, as well as a judicial order to dissolve the firm and pay them for their shares under the buyout that they said had been negotiated.

According to CBS News, at least 120 initiatives were on the ballot in 32 states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. Ballot initiatives offer voters a chance to directly change state laws or a state constitution. The highest profile initiative was in California, where Proposition 22 determined if app-based companies like Uber, Lyft and others could continue classifying workers as independent contractors instead of company employees. Fifty-eight percent voted in favor of the proposition. Here are some of the other higher profile initiatives voted on Tuesday.• Fifty-two percent of Puerto Ricans voted in favor of a non-binding statehood initiative. The results have yet to be certified. Currently, Puerto Ricans are US citizens but do not have voting representation in Congress.• Sixty-one percent of Floridians voted in favor of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026. The results have not yet been certified. The initiative would raise the wage to $10 per hour in 2021 and raise it by a dollar every year until it reaches $15 per hour.• Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota passed measures to legalize recreational marijuana for individuals 21 and older.• Californians voted in favor of allowing people on parole to vote.

463,You Can Now Order Abortion Pills Before You are Pregnant in All 50 States,-13.67,35.0,https://jezebel.com/you-can-now-order-abortion-pills-before-youre-pregnant-1847910143,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-21,15,"Just beforeTexas’ 6-week abortion ban took effect on September 1, online medication abortionproviderAid Accessbegan to let Texans who are not pregnant order the pills to prepare for a future unwanted pregnancy. This is a concept known as “advance provision,” and it is akin to having emergency contraception waiting in your medicine cabinet before you actually need it. It is especially helpful for people living in rural areas or in places hostile to birth control and abortion. Now,Aid Accesshas quietly rolled out advance provision of abortion pills to people capable of pregnancy in all 50 states—a move that could revolutionize how people obtain and think about early abortion care in the US Dr. Daniel Grossman, professor of gynecology at University of California, San Francisco, and the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), told Jezebel that this model could help people access abortion earlier in pregnancy than they would otherwise if navigating layered state barriers. In 2018, Grossmanpublished data showing that 45 percent of 7,000 people surveyed are interested in advance provision, even more so than they are in getting the pills over the counter or online without interacting with a clinician.“I have been talking about it for a few years and it is been hard to get any traction, either among researchers or among providers,” Dr. Grossman said. “My hope is that this will spark a conversation among mainstream healthcare providers to think about how should this model be integrated and how should it be tested and be part of mainstream medicine, where we could also the n advocate for insurance coverage.” He also noted that it could help familiarize more people with medication abortion. “I am still amazed how many people do not even know about this option or are confused between that and Plan B.”The medications mifepristone and miso prost ol have been available in the US for more than 20 years, and the combination of meds, which essentially induce a miscarriage, is FDA-approved for use through 10 weeks of pregnancy. But they are highly regulated—you can only be handed the pills in a doctor is office, not a pharmacy, and you typically have to be pregnant in order to get them. Plus, until the pandemic hit, theFDA did not allow the pills to be mailed outside of a sanctioned clinical study. A Dutch physician, Rebecca Gomperts,launched Aid Access in 2018as a humanitarian effort to help people seeking abortions in highly restrictive areas of the US, like the South and Midwest. During the pandemic, they started working with US-based providers who were newly able to mail the pills. And now they have expanded their services to include nationwide advance provision. In 18 states that both permit medication abortion to be prescribed via tele medicine and where Aid Access has providers, a US-based provider will review the web consult and write the script, the patient will pay $150, and the package will arrive in a few days. In other states, an overseas provider will write the script, patients will pay $110, and get the pills from a pharmacy in India in two to four weeks. (Financial help is available for either option.)Aid Access notes that people should contact them immediately if they become pregnant in the future so they can guide them through the process. They advise checking the expiration dates when you receive the medicines and note that most pills can be kept up to two years after receiving them. Dr. Grossman said that, ideally, a provider prescribing these medications in advance would counsel people on how to track their period as well as on the early signs of pregnancy, and offer support to people when they plan to use the pills. It would also be beneficial to study the practice as he noted that the FDA considered data on advance provision of emergency contraception (brand name Plan B) when evaluating whether to make it available over the counter,another model he is studied for abortion pills. As for the inevitable criticism from anti-abortion lawmakers and activists (and some pro-choice ones) that services like this will lead to people giving pills to others seeking to terminate a pregnancy, aka “diversion”—this could be happening now. Since FDA labeling changes in 2016, patients are no longer required to take the first pill in the office; they can start the process at a time of their choosing. Since people take the pills at home, it is possible that diversion occurs, though the re is no scientific evidence of that happening, Dr. Grossman said. And some health providers are already writing prescriptions for people who are not pregnant because they are going to a country or region with limited abortion access for an extended period of time, like the Peace Corps, he said. While one site prescribing pills in advance of pregnancy will help some people, it is important to emphasize that abortion pills alone will not solve the access problem in the US First, Aid Access is not covered by insurance and some might pay out of pocket for care that would be covered in a clinic. Other patients will not learn they are pregnant or know they need an abortion until they are beyond the medication abortion window. For some, it is not safe to have a miscarriage at home because of abusive partners or religious family members. And many pregnant people will still prefer in-clinic procedures because they are over faster and allow them to get back to their jobs, schooling, or families the next day. Plus, managing your own abortion is explicitly criminal i zed in three states(Oklahoma, South Carolina, and, after 22 weeks, Nevada) and could be legally risky in many more. Robin Marty, journalist and author of the and head of operations for West Alabama Women is Center, an abortion clinic in Tuscaloosa, offered some advice to mitigate those risks. Whether ordering on your phone or a computer, use private browsers and clear your cache afterward. Since the pills are good for about two years, people could run into trouble even for a future wanted pregnancy that ends in miscarriage or stillbirth if someone remembers you talking about ordering pills. If people want to tell trusted friends, doing so in person or over the phone are the safest options, followed by encrypted, disappearing messages on an app like Signal, Marty told Jezebel. Overall, this move by Aid Access is a good thing, Marty said, but it will have consequences. “I have always been a huge proponent of people being able to access medication abortion as quickly as possible and before they actually need it, and Aid Access appears to be the first one who is able to make this occur [on a broader scale],” she said.“I would definitely encourage people who are interested in this in doing this while they can,” she said. “The response to this is going to be a far more aggressive stance and [states] starting to criminalize directly any person who performs their own abortion.”Miscarriage + Abortion Hotlineat (833) 246-2632 for confidential medical support, or theRepro Legal Helplineat (844) 868-2812 for confidential legal information and advice.",1,0,Jezebel

Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood and Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami will be among the first five hospitals across Florida to store the vaccine while they wait for final approval to use it, officials said Wednesday. The vaccine stored by hospitals will be whichever the government approves first, possibly Pfizer is. The other three hospitals are AdventHealth Orlando, formerly Florida Hospital Orlando, as well as Tampa General Hospital and UF Health Jacksonville. The first vaccines would start arriving in mid-December and another shipment is expected in January. The plan to start supplying hospitals with the vaccine comes as a ray of hope as Florida is COVID-19 infections continue to rise. The number of new cases has followed monthlong trends of increases across the state, based on health department data. Infectious disease specialists warn that a rate over 5% shows the virus is not under control, and all three major South Florida counties have exceeded that level this month. There will be a phased approach to vaccination by creating priority groups.“During the first phase, the vaccine will be available for front-line health care workers in hospitals, long-term-care staff and residents, and first responders,” said Lidia Amoretti, spokeswoman for Jackson Health System. The Florida hospitals were chosen by the state because they are in heavily populated areas and have the ability to maintain ultra-cold storage. Memorial Regional Hospital has “purchased freezers capable of storing the vaccine at the appropriate temperature,” said hospital spokeswoman Kerting Baldwin.“We put in an order three weeks ago so we would have more capacity. We had a freezer but we ordered another larger one,” said Aurelio Fernandez, the president and chief executive officer of Memorial Healthcare System. “We saw that Pfizer was getting close so we ordered a larger freezer.”The US will get 40 million vials and the governor told him Florida will get about 2 million of those, Fernandez said. The Pfizer vaccine requires two shots so that means about one million people will benefit from the Pfizer vaccine. Jared Moskowitz, the director of Florida is Division of Emergency Management, told the South Florida Sun Sentinel on Wednesday that the deployment of vaccines to hospitals is part of a plan that kicked off earlier this year. Months ago, the emergency management division started “preparing for the vaccine and procured millions of syringes and gauze so that we would have the supplies ready to help deploy the vaccine,” Moskowitz said. “We are ready to deploy the vaccine. But while we wait to get it, people need to continue to wear masks and do mitigation measures.”Pfizer recently announced that an early analysis showed its vaccine candidate was more than 90% effective. The vaccine, developed with the German company BioNTech, has to be stored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius until shortly before it is injected. Pfizer said Wednesdaythat new test results show its coronavirus vaccine is 95% effective, is safe and also protects older people who are most at risk of dying. Another company,Moderna, said Mondayits COVID-19 vaccine appears to be 94.5% effective. The news from both companies puts them on track to seek permission within weeks for emergency use in the US One of the main goals of the federal government isOperation Warp Speedwas to work with drug companies to manufacture the vaccines even before clinical trials were completed, so that millions of doses would be ready to go if a vaccine was successful. Lubby Navarro, director of legislative affairs for Memorial Healthcare System, whose flagship hospital is Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, told Broward mayors at a closed-door meeting Monday that they are seeing a “third wave of increases” of new coronavirus patients. Memorial is one of the five hospital locations in Florida designated to have the vaccine, and “we should be receiving it in a couple of weeks,” she told the mayors, according to records obtained by the South Florida Sun Sentinel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will manage the distribution, Baldwin said. There is no word yet if the vaccines will be approved for children, or only adults.

Newsom the signed Assembly Bill 3121 into law on Wednesday. The bill opens the door to the state paying reparations to Black Californians, especially those who are descendants of slaves. It specifically calls out insurance companies:Existing law requests the Regents of the University of California to assemble a colloquium of scholars to draft a research proposal to analyze the economic benefits of slavery that accrued to owners and the businesses, including insurance companies and their subsidiaries, that received those benefits, and to make recommendations to the Legislature regarding those findings. Related StoriesLegalRon DeSantis Wins One: Disney Suit Against Florida Governor Tossed By Judge; ""Will Not End Here,"" Mouse House DeclaresNewsThe Go-Gos, Ava DuVernay And Los Lobos To Be Inducted Into California Hall Of FameExisting law requires the Insurance Commissioner to request and obtain information from insurers licensed and doing business in this state regarding any records of slaveholder insurance policies issued by any predecessor corporation during the slavery era. Existing law requires insurers to research and report to the commissioner on insurance policies that provided coverage for injury to, or death of, enslaved people. AB 3121 does not commit to any specific payments. It calls for a nine-person task force that will make recommendations for how reparations could happen, whether through compensation or restitution. The task force created by the bill will consist of five gubernatorial appointees and four people chosen by the state legislature. “The Governor shall call the first meeting of the Task Force to occur no later than June 1, 2021,” it states. The task force is instructed to deliver recommendations no more than 12 months from that date. The task force is powers, according to the law, include:-Holding hearings and sit and act at any time and location in California-Request the attendance and testimony of witnesses-Seek an order from a Superior Court compelling testimony or compliance with a subpoenaRead the full text of 3121here. For those who think slavery did not exist in California, there are these passages — and many others — from the state is officialHistorical Societyon the subject:California is constitution proclaimed that “neither slavery nor involuntary servitude, unless for punishment of a crime, shall ever be tolerated.” Yet archives statewide contain evidence that slavery was practiced out in the open. In 1848 when the gold rush hit, white southerners flocked to the state with hundreds of enslaved Black people, forcing them to to il in gold mines, often hiring them out to cook, serve, or perform a variety of labor. Sometimes fortunes were amassed on the backs of this free labor. Yet California is place in the nation is history of slavery is missing from most historical accounts and many are surprised to learn of its practice in the golden state. Among those on the Zoom call for the signing were members of the California Black Caucus, the Chicano Caucus and also Ice Cube, who was singled out specifically by the bill is sponsor, Assemblywoman Shirley Weber (D-San Diego), as “one of our real champions” who has supported the effort. He also got a “thank you” from Newsom just before the signing. Cube later tweeted his thanks to the governor. Thank you Governor@GavinNewsomfor signing AB3121 Thank you@ADOSLosAngelesfor bringing the bill to my attention so we could push from all angles.— Ice Cube (@icecube)September 30, 2020Weber called the bill “ground breaking,” and pointed out the bills were authored last year, long before the death of George Floyd and so many others sparked protests. “A lot of people think we are responding to the moment,” said Webber, before pointing out that the imperatives go much further back. “We are responding to the history of California.”The task force can also make recommendations on eliminating state laws and policies that perpetuate discrimination and on issuing a formal apology “for the perpetration of gross human rights violations and crimes against humanity on African slaves and their descendants,” according to the bill.“California has come to terms with many of issues, but it has yet to come to terms with its role in slavery,” said Weber, who chairs the black caucus and introduced the Assembly Bill 3121, said at the bill signing ceremony. “AB 3121 is ground breaking for the USs, to basically say this state is going to deal with the issue of reparation and we will make a difference as the result of that.”In related news, Assembly Bill 3070, also introduced by Weber, was made law on Wednesday by Governor Gavin Newsom. The law combats racial discrimination in jury selection. It establishes a presumption that certain reasons for excluding jurors are proxys for racial discrimination. The law seeks to root out implicit or unconscious bias in jury selection. Newsom also signed AB 979 which requires publicly-held corporations headquartered in California to have at least one director from an underrepresented community by the close of 2021, was jointly authored by Assembly members Chris Holden (D- Pasadena), Cristina Garcia (D-Downey) and David Chiu (D-San Francisco), with Assemblywoman Eloise Gomez Reyes (D-San Bernardino) and Senator Ben Hueso (D-Chula Vista) as principal co-authors.“The new law represents a big step forward for racial equity,” Holden said. “While some corporations were already leading the way to combat implicit bias, now, all of California is corporate boards will better reflect the diversity of our state. This is a win-win as ethnically diverse boards have shown to outperform those that lack diversity.”At one point one assmblymember expressed what were likely the sentiments of all present.

During a break in the conversation, “a white gentleman pulled me aside,” she says, and told her that all of the white men up for the role were “selling that they’d conquered the moon”—while she was focused on explaining what she saw as the weak spots in her résumé. If Tita-Reid wanted the position, he said, she would need to turn everything she had into an asset. So she went back into the interview and laid out her biggest selling point: She was the best person for the job because she was a Black woman in the USs. She was used to being the only person in the room who looked like her. The “cultural competency” the hiring managers were looking for was not a skill she’d had to learn for work; it was something she’d had to master to just get by in her everyday life. “I can get the nuances of every culture because this is what you have to do as an African-American,” she told them. “You have to shape-shift to survive.” She sold it, she says, “and it was all true.”Tita-Reid got the promotion, running Western Europe for the company out of London.

But in the years since she made that first move to London, she is become part of a cohort of Black American ex pats who have chosen to stay abroad because they have found that the professional benefits of working overseas are far more profound than the usual résumé-building check mark. Working in Europe, Tita-Reid says, has been like wearing an oxygen mask. It is allowed her to breathe—to lead and perform without feeling the crushing weight of America is dysfunctional racial dynamics at every moment. I’d never been an American first andBlack. It is a refreshing change. With her friends, Tita-Reid calls it the “James and Josephine effect”—a hat tip to James Baldwin and Josephine Baker, Black Americans who fled the racial persecution of the US during the first half of the 20th century and ended up with thriving careers in Europe. “It is not a new phenomenon at all,” she says. “I feel like part of that legacy.”The decision to work and live abroad has been brought into sharp relief for many Black American ex pats this spring and summer as they watch a national movement take hold back home in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. There is a sense of guilt at not being on the front lines, mixed with affirmation of why they did not want to return. Working abroad, these executives say they left behind the fatigue that many described as routine forBlack people in corporate America: the exhaustion brought about by being asked to solve your company is diversity issues; living by the unwritten rules that dictate how you present yourself at work; having top rove every day that you deserve to be in your role. Once abroad, with the weight of their companies behind the m, many Black expatriates said they felt instantly valued and treated with a level of respect and deference from their colleagues they had not known in the US The benefits extend far beyond the office. The prevailing message in more than a dozen interviews with Black Americans who are working or have worked overseas: Their international experience was the first time race was not the primary frame of reference through which they were viewed. “You are an American, you are not African-American,” says Shaundra Clay, who lived in Europe for eight years as a health care executive. “You are not made to feel like you are carrying the burden of anything. You are carrying the power of something.” She said it was a level of privilege she had never experienced before in her life. In the US, Nancy Armand, an executive at HSBC Bank USA, was always conscious of her gender and race, she says. In the UK, she was always conscious of her nationality first. “I’d never been an American first and the n Black,” Armand says. “It is a refreshing change.”And yet these jobs can be isolating. Rarely does Tita-Reid see another Black woman at her level. “On a day-to-day basis,” she says, “I am alone.” That is in part because the exp at universe is running 20 to 30 years behind the larger corporate world in terms of diversity and inclusion, says Adrian Anderson, a partner in KPMG is global mobility services. He has both personal and professional experience here: For more than 25 years, Anderson has worked in the industry, which helps multinational organizations manage their workforces’ foreign assignments; he has also lived abroad as a Black American executive. Most of these coveted international roles come through word-of-mouth networks, which have historically boxed out Black employees. Or they are reserved for developing those expected to move into the executive suite—a space that has also long passed over Black talent. Anderson says most global organizations prefer that executives have international experience in order to move into to p-level roles, making the lack of access to the exp at world a systemic barrier that has kept Black employees from reaching the top echelons of corporate America. Black executives who pack their bags and leave the US behind are quick to point out that they are by no means moving to any sort of utopia. “I am very clear that wherever I go, I am perceived as a Black man,” says Warren Reid, Tita-Reid is husband and founder and CEO of Nemnet Minority Recruitment, a diversity recruitment and consulting firm that works with educational institutions. “Unfortunately, in the overwhelming majority of the globe, I do not have a positive brand image. I am mindful and not naive about that.” Despite such awareness, Reid and others interviewed for this story said they had not realized how heavily the stress of being Black in America weighed on them until they left. Even when they faced bias abroad, they never feared for their lives or their children is the way they did in the US Says Ini Archibong, a designer and business owner originally from California who now lives in Switzerland: “The brand of racism in America is unique.”Black executives are used to having to tell peoplethey are the boss. Otherwise, says Tita-Reid: “When you walk into a room in the US and you are five levels above your sales rep who is a white man, they look at him and shake his hand and give you the bag.” But soon after transferring to the UK, she had a meeting with a client who immediately identified her as the person in charge. “You are a Black American female, and you are here, so you have to be the best,” she recalls him saying. It was the first time anyone had labeled her the “best” at anything, she says. “I almost cried.” Reid distills the dynamic this way: In the US, he says, the question is always, How did you get in the room, and who let you in? In the UK, the assumption is that if you have made it into the room you deserve to be there. But working in Europe means adjusting to more subtle forms of racial prejudice—which often intersect with a strong vein of classism, say many Black execs who have done tours abroad. Arlene Isaacs-Lowe, a 22-year vet of Moody is, transferred to the UK in 2015 to run relationship management for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa for the ratings agency. The day she met her new UK team, she recalls being repeatedly introduced as an alumna of Howard University and a board member of its business school, followed by a recitation of Howard is famous alumni. It stuck her as odd, she says, until she realized it was a way of establishing the bona fides of the historically Black university—and by extension, proving her “pedigree” as fellow member of the upper class. Once that fear lifted from me, I realized I was never going to move back. In 2017, Tita-Reid joined a health food company as global CMO, and the family moved to Switzerland. In her new home, nationalism was the dominant force, she says. Swiss people support Swiss people first, she says: “If you do not happen to be of that culture, it has nothing to do with you.” She recalls a conversation with a German businessman, who felt that there was bias against his nationality throughout the country. To Tita-Reid, it was a relief that everyone was considered an outsider. “We are all equal-opportunity excluded,” she says. “To me, that is amazing. It is the first time I have ever been equally excluded.” She explained to the businessman that unlike when he returned to Germany and felt accepted, when she went back to the US, she still felt like an outsider. “The negativity of being an American in Europe is not as bad as being a Black American in America,” she says. Three years ago, Tita-Reid had a chance at a job that would take her back to the US, but she turned it down. It was not just a career decision but one for her family. “The stress that I felt in the US and concern for my husband and son was gone,” she says. “It was more of a weight than I had ever realized.”I spoke to Reid overZoom, where he sat outside their Zurich home on a sunny day with birds chirping in the background. He told me about the family is first night in London when they were living in temporary housing. He was going back and forth between the hotel and the flat late at night when he saw two police officers walking toward him. “I remember in that moment, I went through my mental checklist of no sudden moves, communicate, make sure you are seen.” The police officers walked past him with nothing more than a good night. “That blew my mind,” he said. After we talked, Reid sent me a follow-up email, quoting James Baldwin: “To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in a state of rage almost, almost all of the time.” Living abroad, Reid was free of that rage, he said: “It does not consume or preoccupy me in the way that it did and does when I return home.”the narrative of the Black American exp at who thrives abroad holds true—until you want to get hired by a European company. If you have the wealth of America behind you, “you are welcomed with open arms,” he says. “When you ask for a job, things change.”Léger made the move abroad 15 years ago. His the n-wife is Swedish and wanted to live closer to her family, and Léger had always been intrigued by the idea of an international career. In 2004, he left journalism behind to get a graduate degree in international relations at Harvard, and the following year ended up in Geneva with the World Economic Forum as a partnership and communications manager. (Léger worked at from 1999 to 2002, but we never overlapped.)Over a decade, Léger says he tried repeatedly to secure a full-time role with the UN, or as a corporate communications executive with a multinational company. Léger, who is Haitian-American and speaks both English and French, says at the UN he was repeatedly passed over; the jobs ended up going to Brits who were not perfectly bilingual—a supposed prerequisite for those roles. In the corporate world, interviews abounded, but he says the leads would turn cold once he showed up in person. One would-be employer went as far as explicitly citing his race as an issue, he says, telling him, “Our investors will have a problem with a Black spokesperson.” Eventually Léger started following the European practice of putting his photo on his résumé to spare himself the grief. Once he did, even the interviews dried up. Léger attributes part of his struggle to a lack of formal or informal support structures. The number oft op Black executives in the US is woeful, but in Europe Léger found the situation to be far worse. “There are no senior Black executives anywhere,” he says, “so the re is no network of us to look out for each other.” Several Black men, including Léger, told me it was often assumed that they were visitors, because otherwise how could they be eating in this fancy restaurant in this nice part of town?Now, with his oldest child thinking about attending college in the US, Léger was back in New York, living in Midtown Manhattan. When we spoke in June, he was regularly encountering the Black Lives Matter protests in the city and feeling nervous every time he saw a police car. “I did not miss that,” he says. But he was still glad to be home. “I like my odds of finding a stable full-time job in media,” he says, “of getting the job that eluded me in Europe, even in the middle of a pandemic and the ongoing fight for racial justice here.”of transferring abroad is the struggle that comes with moving back. All of a sudden, executives’ worlds felt much smaller, their jobs narrower. Clay returned to the US in 2016 after eight years in Europe. She described the experience as akin to going back to your hometown after decades away, and having your successes celebrated but no one fully understanding how much you have grown and changed. But for Black Americans, repatriation also came with unique baggage. Clay said the racism she had always seen and experienced in the US now emerged with a different sense of clarity. “The longer you are away, the more stinging and shocking it becomes,” she said. “All the burdens become your burdens again, and they feel heavier because you have lost the muscle of carrying them.” She and others I spoke to said they now had less tolerance for the racism they regularly experienced. Those who have remained abroad have faced their own new personal struggles this spring and summer, describing feelings of deep conflict in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd and protests that have followed. Reid says by being abroad he is meeting his primary obligation to provide a safe and affirming environment for his family; his children have not had to wrestle with some of the issues he did as a Black kid growing up in the US “That is been the good side,” he says. “The other side is there is a movement that is going on, and I am removed from it. There is a little guilt that goes along with it: How could I bring to bear my education, resources, and network to move the movement forward?”Archibong, the American designer based in Switzerland, says it is difficult not to be in the US right now. But while Switzerland has its own problems, he says, it is not enough to make him want to go back. The power of escaping that constant existential fear described by so many of the Black American executives I spoke to is too strong. “Once that fear lifted from me, I realized I was never going to move back,” he says. Not being constantly concerned with his physical safety has allowed him to “clear up space” in his head and be more creative in his work. A few years into his move to Europe, Archibong stopped wearing the collared shirts he’d long worn every day—even if it meant being overdressed for the occasion. The formal look had started as an aesthetic choice, he says, but at some point he realized it had become a kind of armor. In the US, he’d felt safer when he was dressed up, he says, and the dressier clothes had helped him command the same professional respect that other, non-Black designers got even when casually attired. In Switzerland, he no longer feels the need; now he pulls out the suit and tie only when he is in the mood. Tita-Reid struggled to articulate what it is been like watching the current movement in the US from afar. She, like her husband, says she feels somewhat guilty that she is an ocean away. It has been both sad and validating to see all of the concerns that had kept her from wanting to return bubble up to the surface. It is also made her acutely aware of all the good things she had left behind. “You do give up something, which is having your culture, your people, your friends and family,” Tita-Reid says. “It is at a cost.”Experts say Black executives have less access to global assignments, contributing to the systemic bias that Black professionals face in corporate America. Some employers are now focusing on ensuring that international assignments do not exclude women and people of color, but it is still a long way from being a top priority for most. This shift could have an outsize impact on Black executives, who are already less likely to land foreign assignments because of the informal way they are doled out.

467,Pensions for local public safety employees are skyrocketing,5.0,37.67,https://capitolweekly.net/pensions-for-local-public-safety-employees-are-skyrocketing/,https://adfontesmedia.com/capitol-weekly-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-11,15,"Growing public pension deficits have plagued our nation for years, but in the midst of some of the harshest fiscal blows from the pandemic, this problem is something we can no longer ignore. While California champions itself as a leader of positive change in the USs, we also happen to be the leader in skyrocketing pension obligations. And there are no signs of this unsustainable pattern slowing down. In 2018, Transparent California found that the average pension for city or county public safety employees was $108,000 a year. According to CalPERS, that retirement benefit of $108,000 at age 50 is worth $1,673,000 invested in a private single-life annuity, and somewhat higher with survivor benefits (which most safety workers choose). With this exorbitant retirement pay, it is no wonder that eachCalifornia household is on the hook for $81,634. Although many tax measures for fire funding are successful, voters in some of the most liberal parts of the state have started to push back and vote against them. To add to the enormity of this problem, consider that there are more retired firefighters than active firefighters in this state. Even slashing beneficial community programs is not enough to meet the union promises made to these workers. As a result, many unions have turned to tax increases as a potential solution. Although many tax measures for fire funding are successful, voters in some of the most liberal parts of the state have started to push back and vote against them. In fact, a½ sales tax pushed by the fire unions, despite threats of extended response times, was recently voted down in Sonoma County. In the face of this opposition, union leaders are finding other ways to drum up a steady cashflow, whether it is through a first responder fee or taking over ambulance services from private industry veterans. For years, California localities have relied on private emergency ambulance companies to provide quality, efficient emergency services. And to combat inequity in access to ambulance services, the state moved primarily to countywide-run ambulance systems overseen by the County EMS Agency. This mix of public and private collaboration has been conducted successfully for over 50 years, until now. Arecent study by Reason Foundation identified fire departments in California that have recently been pursuing, and in some regions established, what is called an “Alliance Model,” in which the fire department is given, “the decision-making power of a full EMS agency, but without the oversight of an EMS agency.” This means they are getting all of the responsibility without any accountability—and while the fire departments may reap a short-term windfall from collecting ambulance fees, they are only adding to their long-term pension obligation. The bottom line is that fire departments have a huge problem on their hands when it comes to their pension obligations. A proposed state law –Assembly Bill 389– would codify the Alliance model and make all of its anti-competitive antics legal. Ultimately, the Alliance model puts the fire department is interests before the taxpayer or patient. This backwards model came to fruition in Contra Costa County in 2016, and even after rejection from the Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA), the county still moved forward with implementation. Not only does this model result in reduced industry competition, but it also diminishes quality of care and response times for patients. Despite these concerning outcomes, the cities of Chula Vista and Oxnard are now in the process of reviewing possible implementation in their own localities. Models like these are designed to cut corners to benefit the bottom line, not to prioritize the individual relying on emergency services for help. This is also reflected in fire departments that seek to take over ambulance services in what is called an “Ambulance Operator Programs.”Because public agencies must provide the same expensive pension benefits and early retirements to their EMTs as they offer to other workers, in fire department run Ambulance Operator Program, EMT positions have to be filled with inexperienced workers at lower wages. Governments will have a monopoly, residents and their insurance companies will likely pay more for ambulance services, and our communities will be served by less senior EMTs and paramedics. All so that the public employees may continue padding their retirement funds. The bottom line is that fire departments have a huge problem on their hands when it comes to their pension obligations, and the only solution their unions can seem to come up with is attacking the private ambulance providers who have loyally served Californians for generations. Contracting these services back to the government to clean up their own mess is just wrong. Taxpayers want the best services for the lowest cost, and it is clear that private ambulance providers are the only option that satisfies that need. Californians deserve better.

Yang Jiechi, the head of the Communist Party is foreign affairs office, will travel to Greece and Spain next week, and possibly also Portugal. His trip follows foreign minister Wang Yi is recent visit to Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, France and Germany. The rare back-to-back trips come at a time when the US is pushing for support from its European allies over its stance towards China. Europe has criticised China is handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, its increasing combative diplomacy, its human rights records and the Hong Kong national security legislation. Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China, said: “President Xi has a lot of political capital at stake in the September summit. If the investment talks do not get a push at that time, it will be politically difficult for [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel to discuss China issues at the European Council meeting on September 25, particularly at a time when the US is putting enormous pressure on Europe to fall in line with its position.”He said a substantial progress in September would make it possible for “a successful conclusion to a political agreement to the investment deal” in December. A European diplomatic source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the investment treaty would be a “test case” for the two sides’ relationship. In the previous two rounds of negotiations China was open to discuss core issues such as state-owned enterprises, subsidies and sustainable development, but there is no clear evidence that it has acted to address the issues, the source continued. They said China has yet to address concerns about state-owned businesses and noted that Beijing faced difficulties in improving transparency about local-level subsidies. Wang Yiwei, a professor in European studies at Renmin University in Beijing, said China had recently published a three-year trial plan to op en cross-border data flow and other service sectors in selected cities, which he said was a sign of its determination to open up and attract foreign investment. Beijing also hopes the EU will commit to market openness in the hi-tech sector, including 5G contracts, although Wang said that risked a backlash from the US.“The US has closely followed the progress of China-EU investment talks. Any commitment Beijing agrees on structural changes, such as SOE protection and subsidies, is likely to be met with tougher demands from the US,” Wang said. The US has long called for changes to China is state-led economy, but the phase one trade deal between the two sides sidestepped the issue.“China should consider all factors in negotiations with the EU and try to avoid getting on America is nerves,” said Wang. But observers warned that if a deal cannot be reached this year, China may find itself in a more difficult situation in the future, with Merkel due to leave office next year.“China has a very trustworthy counterpart in Europe with Angela Merkel. The Chinese side knows exactly where she stands and they have 15 years of experience working with her,” said Wuttke. Germany currently holds the EU is rotating presidency and Merkel has shown “the political finesse and power to get things agreed upon in Europe” he continued.“It is the refore very much in China is interests to move on the investment agreement now, and not delay things until January next year when Portugal takes over the EU presidency”. The EU has now free trade agreements with over 70 countries. It concluded a free-trade agreement with Japan last summer, and signed a free trade and investment protection deal with Vietnam in June and is now in talks with India. It has declined Beijing is proposal to start talks on a free-trade agreement and insists on finishing the investment treaty talks first.",2,1,South China Morning Post

Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds has included 41 of Iowa is 99 counties in her state disaster declaration, according to the Associated Press. Several rivers in the region — including the Missouri and the Mississippi — have swelled to dangerous levels, flooding small towns and breaching more than a dozen levees. Three people have died as a result of the flood waters and two men in Nebraska have been missing since Thursday, according to the Associated Press. Emergencies have been declared in 74 cities and 65 counties according to the Nebraska Emergency Management Agency, and water levels are expected to rise with more rain expected and snow continuing to melt. According to the National Weather Service, 9 million people across 14 states are still under flood warnings. Vice President Mike Pence is traveling to the Midwest Tuesday to survey the damage in Omaha, Nebraska, where hundreds of homes have been damaged and tens of thousands of acres covered in water, according to the Associated Press. Devastation has been particularly concentrated in eastern Nebraska. The Nebraska Emergency Management Agency described the flooding as one of“the most devastating disasters in recent history.”Towns like Fremont have been completely surrounded by water, making relief and rescue efforts particularly challenging. Pilots have been flying supplies in to people who are stranded,according to local media. Video footage from an airplane show fields and roads in the area completely submerged. Roads and highways have also been severely damaged in areas surrounding the city of Omaha. The flooding has so far had an estimated cost of$550 million on the public sector in Nebraskaand $90 million on private infrastructure. In Iowa, failing levees in Mills County forced residents to evacuate. Buildings in the towns of Hornick and Pacific Junction were overwhelmed by water, forcing more than 400 people to evacuate, according to the Des Moines.

471,What the Ben & Jerry is Decision Reveals About Israel,-12.0,35.33,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/07/ben-jerrys-decision-israel-settlements/619537/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"Backlash to the ice-cream maker is decision to distinguish between Israel and the territories it occupies has shown that, for many Israelis, the distinction no longer exists. No company does progressive politics quite like Ben & Jerry is. The Vermont-based ice-cream maker has a reputation for corporate activism, owing to its support for a wide array of left-wing causes, including marriage equality, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter. But when the company announced this week that it will no longer sell its products in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, it faced an outcome that every ice-cream maker fears most: a meltdown. The matter of Israel is settlements, which the international community regards as illegal under international law but which the Trump administration said will need to be resolved through a political and not a judicial process, has long been a thorny issue in Israel. (The Biden administration has yet to articulate its own policy on this.) When it comes to ice cream, though, the country is notoriously fractious political sphere is virtually unanimous. Israel is right-wing prime minister, Naftali Bennett, said that Ben & Jerry is has decided to brand itself as an “anti-Israel ice cream.” His centrist coalition partner, Yair Lapid, called the move a “shameful surrender to anti-Semitism.” Israeli President Isaac Herzog of the center-left, who once committed to removingIsraeli settlements in the West Bank, called Ben & Jerry is decision to shun them “a new kind of terrorism.” The newly minted opposition leader, Benjamin Netanyahu,suggestedthat Israelis should boycott the brand. One centrist cabinet minister dutifully pos teda TikTokof herself chucking a pint of what looked like Dulce de Leche into the trash. That an ice-cream maker could cause such an uproar at the highest levels of Israeli politics says a lot about how sensitive Israel is to the very notion of boycotts against it—even those that, like Ben & Jerry is, are limited in scope. More fundamentally, the dustup reveals a growing divergence between how the world sees Israel and how the country sees itself. While the international community, including the USs, continues to distinguish between Israel and the territories it occupies, the reaction to the Ben & Jerry is decision has shown that, as far as many Israeli politicians are concerned, that distinction no longer exists. On its face, Ben & Jerry is move to end its business in the occupied territories, which the company described as being inconsistent with its values, poses an arguably negligible problem for Israel from a practical standpoint—one that would affect, at most, the roughly 6 percent of the population living in one of the country is sprawling settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, both of which have been under Israeli control since 1967. Ben & Jerry ishassaidthat it will continue to sell its products in Israel itself. Both Ben & Jerry is and its parent company,Unilever, declined to comment further, but the implications of the move are clear: While Israeli citizens living in settlements such as Ariel and ​​Ma’ale Adumim may no longer be able to buy Chunky Monkey in their local supermarket, they can find it nearby. (The same cannot be said for Palestinians in the West Bank, who are not afforded the same right to freedom of movement.)In other words, Ben & Jerry is decision “has no material impact on Israel whatsoever,” Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israel-based pollster and political strategist, told me. But it does have a political one—and, to the Israelis who feel the need to defend their sovereignty, an existential one. By ending its business in the occupied territories, the company has effectively refused to profit from or legitimize the status quo in the region, a status quo that Israel is deeply invested in protecting. It has also made clear that it will recognize Israel only within its democratic borders. “It is all symbolic,” Scheindlin said, “but symbolism is huge.”Why does Israel care about what an American ice-cream brand thinks of its policies? When I put this question to Scheindlin, she told me that for many Israelis, criticism of Israeli policy is often conflated with an existential threat to Israel itself. To hear many Israeli politicians tell it, “criticism from abroad of our policies is anti-Israel, it is anti-Zionist, and it is anti-Jewish, or anti-Semitic,” Scheindlin said. “And that is really the narrative that we have been hearing.” There is also the fear that what started with Ben & Jerry ismight not end the re; once one company boycotts Israeli settlements, what is to stop others from joining it?Not all Israelis subscribe to this view, of course. Those on the left, including members of the Meretz Party, havedefendedBen & Jerry is. But these voices have largely been drowned out by the uproar of the majority. Read: ​​Why an effort to thwart some boycotts of Israel fails the free-speech testNot doing business in the settlements is not a new concept. Indeed, much of the Zionist left—includingMeretz, the left-wing advocacy groupPeace Now, and the prominent American Jewish commentatorPeter Beinart—have advocated settlement boycotts for years. Activists within the Palestinian-ledBoycott, Divestment, and Sanctions(BDS) movement, which calls on countries and organizations to sever financial ties with Israel as a means of applying economic and political pressure on the country to end its occupation, have been doing so for even longer. (Unlike BDS, which targets Israel writ large, Ben & Jerry is decision was limited in scope—a distinction that meant little to theIsraeliandUS officials who erroneously conflated them. Although the BDS movement welcomed the news, it would have preferred that Ben & Jerry is end its operations in all of Israel, not just the occupied territories.)Relatively few international corporations have actually followed through with the BDS call, however, which is why when one as high-profile as Ben & Jerry is finally did, following pressure from pro-Palestinian activists, it led to such an uproar. (A notable exception is McDonald is Israel, whose chief executive, Omri Paden, an Israeli citizen and a founding member of Peace Now,refused to open any branches in the West Bank.) But Israel is reaction speaks to more than just its particular sensitivity to outside criticism. Not long ago, Israeli politicians would openly say that the country is settlement policy threatened its long-term security, as well as its prospects for peace with its neighbors. But under the leadership of the country is recently deposed prime minister, Netanyahu, those voices became quieter as the Israeli government went to great lengths to normalize the occupation and expand the country is settlement enterprise. Netanyahu is no longer in power, but the fact that lawmakers across the political spectrum are united on this issue is a feat in itself, given the fractious nature of Israeli politics. “It really is very much a reflection that the Israeli consensus is that there is no ‘green line,’ there is no occupation, there is no occupied territory,” Mairav Zonszein, a senior analyst on Israel and Palestine at the International Crisis Group, told me. “There is just one big lump of land that is under Israeli sovereignty, and not doing business in any part of it is somehow anti-Semitic or anti-Israel.”Read: A new word is defining the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in WashingtonRegardless of whether Ben & Jerry is sticks with its decision (or whether it succumbs to pressure to reverse course,as has happened with other companies), it has already revealed the extent to which Israeli leaders across the political spectrum support the de facto,if not de jure, annexation of the occupied territories by Israel. Despite Israel is new government of change, much remains fundamentally the same.“The right to the left all kind of agree that the facts on the ground are what they are,” Zonszein said, “and they are not planning on changing.”",1,1,The Atlantic

473,The Day of Reckoning Is at Hand,30.25,20.5,https://spectator.org/the-day-of-reckoning-is-at-hand/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-12,23,"This week before the Senate Appropriations Committee Attorney General William Barr gave testimony that is guaranteed to induce panic throughout the DC swamp. Regarding spying on Donald Trump is 2016 presidential campaign, he testified as follows:ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR:SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN (D., NH):BARR:SHAHEEN:BARR:SHAHEEN:BARR:Coming from Barr, a most measured and serious man, this explosive testimony portends a bleak future for all those FBI, Department of Justice, and intelligence community operatives who used their official positions and enormous — bordering on limitless — governmental powers to undermine the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, and, failing that, to undo the results of the 2016 election. So it is that Barr is description of the possibility of such political surveillance as a “big deal” is understatement of the first order. As “big deals” go, the stakes could not be any higher. On cue, the Democrats and their wholly owned mainstream media subsidiary have tried to dull the impact of Barr is testimony. One bedraggled party flak claimed on network television that, since Barr merely spying had occurred, he had not confirmed that it had really, truly and actually happened. And, resorting to the left is default position on all things Trump,Washington Postcolumnist Jennifer Rubin has called for Barr is impeachment. These unhinged responses to Barr is testimony are similar to the type of desperate, fantasy-based gibberish you might expect from a barricaded man facing imminent death at the hands of a SWAT team. Clearly the left knows that, with Barr running the show, trouble is on the way. Although Barr tried to avoid making any definitive statements about the ultimate outcome of the current and future investigations, he did let slip certain tidbits that should cause many sleepless nights throughout what we in the Justice Department used to call the Seat of Government. In that regard, Barr effectively stated that the investigation would be to determine whether the Obama administration had engaged in electronic surveillance of the opposing political party is presidential campaign and candidate without a proper legal basis. When Barr questioned whether the spying on the Trump campaign was “adequately predicated,” he was obviously talking about the unverified and salacious Steele dossier that was used to obtain FISA warrants to intercept the communications of Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Such an investigation will necessarily encompass the genesis of the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign is bought-and-paid-for opposition research that constitutes the basis of the dossier, and its knowing, dishonest, and illegal use by James Comey is FBI and Loretta Lynch is Department of Justice to deceive the FISA court into authorizing the electronic surveillance of Page and by extension all of the persons in or out of the Trump campaign with whom he communicated. As we now know, in sworn testimony given in the United Kingdom, not even Christopher Steele would vouch for the dossier is accuracy. And equally damaging, in testimony before Congress, FBI lawyer Lisa Page stated that, contrary to standard FBI procedure in counterintelligence operations, the Trump campaign, purportedly the target of Russian infiltration, had not been warned of the Kremlin is nefarious efforts because the FBI did not deem the Steele dossier reliable enough to compel such a warning. Page is testimony sets up an irresistible line of inquiry. If the dossier was not reliable enough to justify a warning to Trump is campaign about the Kremlin is plot, how could it even remotely serve as the basis for obtaining FISA warrants to spy on the campaign? By her benighted testimony, Page has framed the issue nicely and invited a full vetting of who, what, where, when, why, and how the dossier was used to dupe the FISA court. Barr also made clear that, beyond the FBI and Justice Department, the investigation will also be looking at “intelligence agencies.” This makes sense given that low level Trump campaign associates such as George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis were approached by foreign operatives with CIA ties in an effort to plant the seeds of the Trump-Russia collusion illusion. As for the FBI, Barr made clear that, while he does not think that there is an “endemic” problem at that agency, he thinks that “there was probably a failure among a group of leaders the re, at the upper echelon.”No kidding. And, of course, any investigation into the spying must logically and inexorably lead to the clandestine state-sponsored plot to unwind the 2016 election and remove President Trump from office. In short, the subject matter of any proper investigation will necessarily encompass the first attempted coup d’état in our nation is history. So here we are. After suffering through Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ comatose stewardship of the Justice Department, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein is underhanded machinations, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller is protracted rear guard action to protect the anti-Trump deep state conspirators, the day of reckoning is at hand. Attorney General Barr is testimony portends a long overdue cleansing of the government temple the likes of which has never before happened in this country. This will be history in the making. In ancient times, when nations reached such dramatic inflection points, there were poets, authors, artists, and philosophers who formulated, explained, and preserved for posterity the meaning of events and their impact upon their societies. As I listened to Barr is astounding testimony, I realized that America was at such an historic milestone. Who, I mused, will step forward to explicate and place these momentous events into their proper context? Does America have a Homer or a Cicero to properly express the gratitude and exaltation of our fellow citizens at the approach of long desired and overdue justice? And the n the answer suddenly came to me as my shrinking brain flashed back to the immortal words of that long ago anthem of righteous adolescent retribution,, to wit:(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend is back)You see him comin’ better cut out on the double(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend is back)Here isa link to The Angels’ singing on the Ed Sullivan Show. Their performance is at once entertaining and seemingly prescient. As you watch them sing, imagine that they are making eye contact with James Comey, Rod Rosenstein, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, John Brennan, Bruce Ohr, Lisa Page, Sally Yates, Glenn Simpson, Christopher Steele, and all the rest of the conspirators. It is pretty amusing. To a remarkable degree, the lyrics are apt and convey the mood of all of us who have had a belly full of the deep state. As for all of those swamp dwellers who have corrupted and degraded our government to this historical low point, let me paraphrase the best line in the song:. Where at?

WASHINGTON — Boeing, General Atomics and Kratos will create prototypes for the Air Force is Skyborg program and have a mere five months to build the first test vehicles of the autonomous combat drone. As part of the Skyborg program, the Air Force hopes to build a family of low-cost, at trit able drones that can be reused, but are cheap enough that losses in combat can be financially and operationally tolerated. The project is meant to produce a family of unc rewed aerial systems that can move into contested spaces and conduct aerial missions that might be too dangerous for human pilots to perform. The Air Force announced contract awards December 7 for the three companies that will produce prototypes for the air vehicle portion of Skyborg and compete in a series of experiments in the hopes of winning a production contract. Three companies are under contract for a two-year period of performance:• Boeing, which received $25.7 million;• General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, which received $14.3 million;• Kratos Unmanned Aerial Systems Inc., which received $37.8 million. Military officials expect the first prototypes to be delivered no later than May 2021 for initial flight tests. The prototypes will the n proceed into flight experiments beginning in July 2021 that will test each drones’ ability to team with manned aircraft, the service stated in a news release.“This award is a major step forward for our game-changing Skyborg capability — this award supporting our operational experimentation is truly where concepts become realities,” said Brig. Gen. Dale White, head of the Air Force is program executive office for fighters and advanced aircraft, which manages the program alongside the Air Force Research Laboratory. One key differentiator between Skyborg and past combat drone programs is the development of artificial intelligence that will allow the aircraft to operate autonomously and potentially learn from prior training missions. Over the past several months, the program has focused on developing the technologies necessary for the “Autonomous Core System,” the hardware and software that will enable the Skyborg drone to operate semi-independently from a human operator, who will be able to issue commands but will not have to physically fly the system. The system is being designed by Leidos, using input from the Air Force and other Skyborg vendors. After prototypes are delivered, the Air Force will outfit them with that autonomy module. The three prototype manufacturers must also prove their aircraft is capable of incorporating payloads and mission systems being supplied by the other 10 companies on contract to potentially supply capabilities for the Skyborg program. In July and September, the Air Force awarded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract worth up to $400 million to e stablish a pool of 13 vendors that would compete to offer Skyborg hardware and software — everything from the drones the mselves, to sensors, weapons and algorithms. Those companies include: AeroVironment Inc., Autonodyne LLC, BAE System Controls Inc., Blue Force Technologies Inc., Fregata Systems Inc., Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, NextGen Aeronautics Inc., Northrop Grumman, Sierra Technical Services, and Wichita State University, as well as the three companies tapped to build air vehicle prototypes.“There will be competition throughout the entire period of performance of these awards. The effort will consist of multiple phases, meant to continue evaluation of the performance of the vendors,” the service stated. Valerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

The number of deaths in the USshad reached about100,000 deaths each month over the winter, but the rate of deaths in the country has slowed from thousands of new deaths per day to 170 new daily deathsreportedMonday, as more people have been vaccinated. New daily cases have also slowed from 300,000 new cases in January to 12,710 new cases Monday. The slower rate of infections and deaths in the USs as more people become vaccinated has prompted loosening of COVID-19 restrictions. In New York, Governor Andrew Cuomoannounced that theEmpire State Building and other landmarks statewide would be lit blue and gold on Tuesday and there would be fireworks at 10 sites to celebrate 70% of New York adults receiving at least one dose of COVID-19 vaccine.

476,Reproductive Rights Books — 25 Books About Reproductive Rights Everyone Should Read,-12.67,41.33,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a46566/reproductive-rights-books/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cosmopolitan-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,16,"ICYMI: Reproductive health advocates have been worried about the future of abortion access since President Trump took office. Since 2016, he quickly reinstated the global gag rule and appointed two conservative justices to the Supreme Court. But when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg—a bastion of reproductive rights—died just a month before the November 2020 election, it felt like the last nail in the coffin of. With a decisive conservative majority now in the Supreme Court, the future of abortion and other reproductive health services appears unclear. If you are wondering how activists survived in a world beforeRoeor about the many barriers to care still facing communities of color to day, here are the books you must read. For fifty years,has been the introductory book for reproductive health care. What was once focused solely on women is health issues like pregnancy and menopause has expanded over the years to address issues like poverty, race, and gender identity and their impact on reproductive health care, making it stand the test of time. Trans Bodies, Trans Selves: A Resource for the Transgender Community, edited by Laura Erickson-Schroth:Inspired by the classicOur Bodies, Ourselves,Trans Bodies, Trans Selvesis the reader is comprehensive guide for caring for their body. Just asOur Bodies, Ourselvescovered reproductive health issues like menstruation and pap smears,Trans Bodies, Trans Selvesgets into topics like medical and surgical transition, parenthood, and mental health. Written entirely by transgender or gender queer authors, each essay is a helpful guide for understanding trans health. Before there was legal abortion, there was the battle for contraception itself and the ability to prevent a pregnancy from occurring in the first place. Eig is book is a highly detailed, highly informative account of the social and financial stumbling blocks that the creators of the first birth-control pill faced in trying to get their product developed. It also does not shy away from the problematic aspects of the story in regards to medical consent or the controversial histories of the figures involved in the ground breaking achievement. When Abortion Was a Crime: Women, Medicine, and Law in the USs, by Leslie Reagan:Roe vs Wadewas not the beginning of abortion—it was just the beginning of legal abortion. Reagan is book details the nearly 100 years leading up to theRoedecision and how abortion went from illegal but mostly ignored to targeted by medical professionals and driven underground, only to eventually resurface and gain legal acceptance. The Story of Jane: The Legendary Underground Feminist Abortion Service, by Laura Kaplan:While abortion was illegal, some women took matters into their own hands. The Story of Janeis a slightly fictionalized account of the women in Chicago who learned to perform abortions the mselves and became a safe haven for illegal but safe procedures. The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe vs Wade, by Ann Fessler:Of course, not everyone who got pregnant pre-Roewas able to access an abortion…or even wanted one. But for many of those—often teens—who did give birth, they did it in secrecy and their children were stolen from them and given to “better” families to raise. Fessler is interviews with those who lost their babies during what became known as the Baby Scoop Era is a heartbreaking reminder of why adoption must be entered into willingly and uncoerced. In Wicklund is memoir, she explains what motivated her to become a provider: her own experience obtaining an abortion. In a candid, first-person account, Wicklund tells her own history, starting with an abortion in her family is past and continuing through the constant harassment and fear of being an abortion provider in the ’80s and ’90s., by Carole Joffe:What was it like to offer clandestine abortions before they were legal? How did doctors decide to add abortion as a service once it became legal? What professional and societal pressures were put on them once they chose to openly offer care? Joffe, a sociologist, talks to a number of early providers who tell their stories in their own words. Fetus Fanatics: When Government Collaborates With Anti-Choice Zealots, by Peggy Bowman:In 1991, Operation Rescue brought hundreds of “pro-life” activists to Wichita, Kansas, and shut down the abortion clinics for weeks in what was known as the Summer of Mercy. Bowman, a pro-choice activist working for Dr. George Tiller, was at the center of the action and tells about how the local government turned a blind eye, allowing the siege on the city is clinic to continue unabated, which she believes led to the escalating hostility that eventually resulted in abortion providers nationwide becoming direct targets of violence. There are an endless number of first-person anti-abortion accounts, but none have had the detail or quality of writing thatoffers. Miller, an anti-abortion activist and photographer, tells the story of how she joined up with some of the most notorious anti-abortion activists of the ’80s and how their secret trips to recover the remains of aborted fetuses from Chicago clinics eventually became the foundation for many of the graphic images seen on posters and placards today. Quite possibly the best look inside the mind and motivations of an opponent of abortion. Beyond the Abortion Wars: A Way Forward for a New Generation, by Charles Camosy:Despite Camosy is best intentions, few who support reproductive justice will see his very strict exceptions for when abortion should be legal and how it should be performed in those rare cases to be any sort of workable “compromise.” But what Camosy does offer in his book is a seldom seen and very earnest advocacy for reforms like paid pregnancy leave, more health care, universal pre-K, and child care support plus even more penalties for domestic violence or refusing to provide child support—reforms both sides of the aisle should be able to get behind. Wrath of Angels: The American Abortion War, by James Risen and Judy Thomas:Starting with the legalization of abortion and the early days of the Rescue movement—those activists best known for barricading clinic doors in the ’80s and early ’90s—the book follows the struggle to keep clinics open until the introduction of the FACE (Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances) Act. The two reporters detail the lives of some of the most passionate and persistent anti-abortion advocates, including the power struggles within their own movement. Likely the most accessible book on the birth of the “pro-life” movement. While abortion rights and access to birth control have been under continuous assault since the 2010 election, the dismantling of these rights began even earlier. Feldt, the former president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, documents the beginning of the onslaught, which escalated during the Bush administration, in her now-16-year-old but still relevant book., by Christina Page:According to Page, the religious right does not just want to overturnRoe—they want to end access to contraception too and make sex a thing only married people do and only when they want to have children. She explains the many-pronged ways they are trying to undermine your sex life, from pharmacist refusals of birth-control prescriptions to abstinence-only sex ed in school, and the n champions the somehow controversial idea that sex for enjoyment alone is actually a good thing. Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights, by Katha Pollitt:Can people win back their reproductive rights when they are ashamed to even talk about abortion? That is the premise behindPollitt is boo kas she urges everyone to delve into the abortion wars to better understand that abortion is not shameful. Shout Your Abortion, edited by Amelia Bonow and Emily Nokes:When Congress tried to de fund Planned Parenthood in 2015, Bonow disclosed her own abortion experience and started a movement with the hasht ag #ShoutYourAbortion. SYA quickly spread across the country, with people sharing their abortion stories through art, music, comedy, and fashion. This 2018 book documents those projects with essays and photography that reject the notion that abortion is supposed to be shameful and instead celebrate the right to choose. Nelson is book brings to the forefront the women of color vocally advocating for legal abortion rights—often in opposition to those in their own community. It is a must-read for those who want to learn how the battle for abortion rights evolved into reproductive justice. There is perhaps no more important book when it comes to tracing the history of reproductive oppression faced by Black women in the USs. From slavery to coerced sterilization to welfare caps, Roberts lays out centuries of assault on Black women and families with regard to when and if they are allowed to control their own reproductive lives. Taking Children: A History of American Terror, by Laura Briggs:Reproductive justice has always been about much more than the right to choose—it is also about the right to safely parent the children you choose to have. InTaking Children, Briggs dives into the sweeping 400-year history of the USs separating Black, Native, and Latinx children from their parents—from slavery to the Native American boarding school system. Although family separations at the border have sparked outrage in recent years, Briggs is book shows that the practice is nothing new. Reproductive Justice: The Politics of Health Care for Native American Women, by Barbara Gurr:You may have heard that the Hyde Amendment prevents federal dollars from funding abortions, meaning that folks on Medicaid cannot use their insurance for abortion care. But did you know that the same rule applies to other federal programs, including the Indian Health Service? InReproductive Justice, Gurr examines access to reproductive health care on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota—from abortion access to care after sexual assault and prenatal appointments. Our Bodies, Our Crimes: The Policing of Women is Reproduction in America, by Jeanne Flavin:Flavin explains in detail how women are targeted and punished through the court system while pregnant or raising children, especially when they do not conform to society is standard idea of what constitutes being an ideal mother. Policing the National Body: Race, Gender, and Criminalization in the USs, by Jael Silliman and Anannya Bhattacharjee:There is no reproductive freedom without actual freedom, and for poor communities and communities of color, incarceration is a daily threat. Policing the National Bodyfocuses on how reproductive rights are limited in a society ready to punish those who are undocumented, poor, or of color and speaks directly to the populations often underrepresented in the mainstream reproductive rights movement. Just like the Hyde Amendment prevents any federal dollars from funding abortions in the US, the “global gag rule” prohibits any health care organization abroad from even mentioning abortion if it receives US funding. The rule has been reinstated under every Republican administration since Ronald Reagan, and in 2017, Donald Trump went even further by expanding the policy. In her book, Rodgers argues that the global gag rule does not actually reduce abortions but instead cuts funding for vital contraceptive, prenatal, and child care programs. Solinger is book explores abortion, assisted reproductive technologies, “personhood,” and other reproductive issues in simple, straightforward language that anyone—academic or layperson—can digest. With its brief summaries and documentation of how each particular reproductive issue has evolved over time due to political changes and pressure, you can think of it as a Reproductive Rights 101 textbook. Every Third Woman in America: How Legal Abortion Transformed Our Nation, by David A Grimes, MD:Written by a doctor, this book is a bit drier and more medical than many others on the list but also involves far more scientifically accurate and fact-based information about abortion is impact on those who undergo them and on society on the whole. In addition to telling of his own time as an abortion provider, Dr. Grimes patiently explains away the myths that anti-abortion activists have inserted into the debate, such as abortion causing breast cancer or the likelihood of injury during a procedure.",1,0,Cosmopolitan

479,“Do not You Work With Old People?”: Many Elder-Care Workers Still Refuse to Get COVID-19 Vaccine,-2.67,44.0,https://www.propublica.org/article/dont-you-work-with-old-people-many-elder-care-workers-still-refuse-to-get-covid-19-vaccine,https://adfontesmedia.com/propublica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,24,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they are published. They are two sisters in two states. Both are dedicated health care professionals who watched in horror as COVID-19 swept through the nation is nursing homes, killing a staggering number of residents and staff alike. One sister is now vaccinated. The other is not.“Heidi Lucas text ed her sister Ashley in May from her home in Jefferson City, Missouri. Ashley Lucas text ed back from Orbisonia, Pennsylvania. Heidi wrote. Neither sister is budging as the Delta variant brings a new spike in coronavirus numbers across the nation. Their divide mirrors America is larger one, where the vaccine to combat COVID-19 is eagerly embraced by some, yet eyed with suspicion and rejected by others. It is the refusal group, including a significant percentage who work in the nation is nursing homes, that has confounded and alarmed health care officials who are at a loss as to how to sway them. Nursing homes faced a shocking mortality rate during the pandemic. In the US, COVID-19 killed more than 133,000 residents and nearly 2,000 staff members between May 31, 2020 and this July 4, according toCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services reports. The true toll is thought to be even higher as data gathering lagged in the early months of the crisis, health experts say. Working in a nursing home became one of the “most dangerous jobs” in America in 2020, according to an analysis of work-related deaths by Scientific American. Yet seven months after the first vaccines became available to medical professionals, only 59% of staff at the nation is nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are fully or partially vaccinated — with eight states reporting an average rate of less than half, according to CMS data updated last week. Twenty-three individual facilities had vaccination rates of under 1%, the data showed. Staff vaccinations have lagged even as the overall rate for residents climbed to 83%, according to the CMS data. The strong vaccination percentage among nursing home residents is credited, in part, to an early campaign to bring the vaccine directly to facilities. That suggests availability is not necessarily the issue behind staff going without. So, what is?The question defies easy answers. Vaccine refusal is regional and often aligns not only with individuals’ political alignment but also with their preferred news sources and which social media they follow. Last week, President Joe Biden took aim at Facebook and other social media giants for failing to police vaccine misinformation that amplifies conspiracy the ories and discourages people from getting vaccinated. “They are killing people,” he said, directly blaming the platforms. On Monday, he recast the accusation to say it was specific individuals posting dangerous information who are culpable. On Tuesday, US Senator Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pleaded to “anyone out there willing to listen: Get vaccinated.” While not mentioning skeptics specifically — including those in his own party — the Republican leader urged the unvaccinated to ignore “demonstrably bad advice.”COVID-19 cases are now surging in every state, with new hospitalizations and deaths almost entirely occurring among the unvaccinated. “This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky warned last week during a White House briefing. In May, CMS began requiring weekly reports on vaccinations of residents and staff at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. The emerging data confirms many health care experts’ worst fears, especially for Southern states. Louisiana has the lowest statewide average: Just 44.5% of the staff at its long-term care facilities have been at least partially vaccinated, according to CMS data released last week. Florida, the second lowest-vaccinated state, had a rate of just under 46% among its nursing home and long-term care staff, with Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi and Wyoming all showing rates of less than 50 percent, according to the data. Vaccination rates in assisted living facilities are not included in the data. A separate American Association of Retired Persons analysis,released last week, showed that only one in five of the nation is more than 15,000 nursing homes were able to hit a goal, set by two industry trade groups, of vaccinating 75% of their staff by the end of June. While cases in nursing homes have recently slowed, and most of the new COVID-19 infections are among younger people, some experts still worry of a return to darker days. The CDC recently launched an investigation into deaths of residents at several western Colorado senior facilities possibly linked to unvaccinated staff, the Associated Press reported Wednesday.“We need to sound the alarm,” said Susan Reinhard, senior vice president of AARP and director of its Public Policy Institute. “Nursing homes were devastated by COVID-19, and many residents remain highly vulnerable to the virus.”Nationally, more than 89% of people 65 or older have received at least partial vaccination, the CDC reported this week. Still, public health experts have warned that even if fully vaccinated, the elderly may be vulnerable to “breakthrough” coronavirus infection because of compromised immune systems and other underlying health problems. In Missouri is southern region, the overall rate of full vaccination in some rural counties is less than 20%, according to state health department and CDC tracking. The latest surge of the delta variant has turned the area into a “tinderbox,” Steven Edwards, CEO of the CoxHealth hospital system in Springfield, recently told reporters. On Thursday, 160 patients were being treated for COVID-19 at CoxHealth, a spokesperson told ProPublica. On May 14, there were 18. Heidi Lucas directs the Missouri Nurses Association. She is pro-vaccine and has been pushing hard for nurses to get vaccinated, especially those on the front lines of patient care. Lucas said it is impossible to separate the lack of vaccination among staff from the lack of vaccinations in individual communities. “Nurses are people too,” she said. “They are on social media and are inundated with false information. How do you fight it?”Her sister, Ashley Lucas, lives 900 miles away in Orbisonia, a small town of around 500 people about an hour south of State College. She is a traveling certified nursing assistant at area nursing homes and chose to skip the vaccine. Her fiance and her children, ages 12 and 13, are also unvaccinated. “I do not consider myself an anti-vaxxer,” she told ProPublica, bristling that some might see her as reckless or ill-informed. Instead, she said her decision was carefully considered. It never made sense to her, she said, that the virus seemed to strike randomly, with some residents getting sick while others did not. She said she is not convinced the vaccine would change the odds. She is also concerned after hearing that the vaccine could interfere with fertility — a contention that has been deemed false by theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionand theWorld Health Organization. It all leads her to believe more research is needed into the vaccines’ long-term effects.“This is just a personal choice and I feel it should be a free choice,” she said. “I think it is been forced on us way too much.”Certified nursing assistants make up the largest group of employees working in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, providing roughly 90 percent of direct patient care. They are typically overworked and underpaid, most earning about $13 per hour and receiving no paid sick leave or other benefits, said Lori Porter, co-founder and CEO of the National Association of Health Care Assistants. Porter said she is not completely surprised by the low vaccination rate. It comes down to trust, she said, both of the vaccines and of facility administrators who now say staff must get vaccinated. Refusal may feel like empowerment. “It is the first time ever they have had the ball in their court,” Porter said. On March 31, Houston Methodist Hospital mandated that all of its 26,000 employees be vaccinated by June 7 or lose their jobs. Jennifer Bridges, a nurse, sued along with 116 other employees, claiming the health care system had overstepped its rights and that she and the others refused to be “human guinea pigs,” evoking the Nuremberg Code, a set of ethical standards established in response to Nazi medical experimentation in concentration camps. On June 12, US District Judge Lynn N Hughes dismissed the closely watched case, taking offense to likening the vaccine to the Holocaust, which he called “reprehensible.” Ten days later, 153 Houston Methodist employees either were fired or quit after refusing the vaccine. The judge is ruling has been appealed. A handful of long-term care chains have similarly sought to mandate worker vaccines, but such action is far from widespread in the industry. One sticking point has been whether vaccination can legally be required, since all three available vaccines have only emergency use authorization, not full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. The thornier issue, though, is whether the facilities can risk losing staff when they are already short-handed. Many workers have vowed to quit rather than be forced into vaccinations. Aegis Living, a long-term senior care provider in three Western states, made vaccines mandatory for its roughly 2,600 employees on July 1. Dwayne Clark, founder and CEO, said initially 400 employees refused but when the deadline arrived, only about 100 left rather than be vaccinated.“We lost some staff that we did not want to lose,” Clark told ProPublica, “but it felt like the right moral protocol to impose.”Recently the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionissued guidelines stating that employers can require workers to be vaccinated as long as medical or religious exemptions are permitted.“Nursing home workers certainly have the right to make decisions about their own health and welfare, but they do not have the right to place vulnerable residents at risk,” said Lawrence Gostin, a health law professor at Georgetown University. “Nursing homes do not just have the power to require vaccinations, they have the duty.”Still, the issue is far from resolved.“America is a highly litigious country,” Gostin said, “I expect the courts to consistently uphold nursing home mandates, because they are entirely lawful and justified. But there will likely be lawsuits at least until it is quite clear they are futile.”Diane Peters is a registered nurse in the Chicago suburbs who last year worked at a nursing home and is now working at a senior rehabilitation center. She does not trust the science behind the vaccine and is unvaccinated. So is her fiance. Everything about the rollout felt like propaganda, she said. Development was too rushed. Clinical trials typically take years, she said, not months. “I do not think it is safe right now, it needs more time,” she said she tells patients if they ask. Read MoreMost do not, she said. Neither do her co-workers. She has only been asked once by her employer if she was vaccinated, she said, declining to name the company. Peters guesses about 40 percent of her colleagues are also unvaccinated, but said no one likes totalk about it because the divide surrounding the vaccine is “surreal.” Staff members are tested regularly and are required to wear masks, she said. She is doubtful mandates would stick. “They can threaten,” she said, “but a lot of nurses would walk.”She trusts her instincts and her own research for now. When asked what would change her mind, she had one word: “Nothing.”A caption with this story originally misstated Heidi Lucas’ job description.

The State Department said Austin and Blinken “exchanged views” with Ghani on the security situation, with the secretary of state confirming that the US “remained committed to support a political solution to the conflict” and both officials stressing that “the USs remains invested in the security and stability of Afghanistan.”The department also said Austin and Blinken informed Ghani that America would be “reducing our civilian footprint in Kabul in light of the evolving security situation” and promised to pick up the pace of flying out Afghans who have worked with US and NATO forces and could be marked for extra-brutal retaliation by militants. The Taliban seizure of Kandahar in the southeast and Herat in the west of Afghanistan marked the biggest battlefield successes so far for the hard line fighters. Witnesses described seeing Taliban fighters once detained at Herat is prison freely moving on the streets. Meanwhile, a Twitter account attributed to Taliban spokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadireported that Kandahar is prison had been “completely conquered” after “a long siege and violent attacks.”“The personnel surrendered and all the prisoners were released,” the message added, giving no indication of what happened to the prison staff. Witnesses told the AP that the governor of Kandahar province and other officials fled the onslaught, catching a flight to Kabul. In all, the Taliban have captured 12 of the country is 34 provincial capitals since beginning their latest offensive in May One of those captured cities, Ghazni, sits on a major highway linking Kabul and Kandahar. Its fall effectively cuts off Ghani is government from the southern provinces of Afghanistan. Ghazni provincial council member Amanullah Kamrani alleged that the provincial governor and police chief made a deal with the Taliban to flee after surrendering. Taliban video and photos purported to show the governor is convoy freely passing by insurgents as part of the deal. The swiftness of the Taliban is advance has led US officials to warn that the fall of Kabul could come within 30 to 90 days,according to the Washington Post. Thirty days from Thursday is the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on America, as well as the initial date Bidengave for ending America is combat mission in Afghanistan. Earlier Thursday, the Pentagon announced that 3,000 US troops would reinforce the more than 600 forces already working at or near the embassy, with press secretary John Kirby saying US officials did not want to “wait until it is too late” to secure the safety of diplomatic personnel. Separately, the United Kingdom said 600 of its troops would be deployed on a short-term basis to support British nationals leaving the country. Late Thursday, the Associated Press reported that Canadian special forces would be sent to Kabul to help with the evacuation of embassy staff. CTV News reported that “sensitive documents” were being destroyed at the Canadian embassy in anticipation of an evacuation. The White House has insisted that Afghan security forces have all the manpower, equipment and training they need to stem the Taliban tide. But video clips of militants riding on American-made Humvees and pickup trucks with M-16s slung across their shoulders has led to recriminations in Washington.“Afghanistan is careening toward a massive, predictable, and preventable disaster,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said in a statement Thursday. “And the Administration is surreal efforts to defend President Biden is reckless policy are frankly humiliating.”“President Biden is decisions have us hurtling toward an even worse sequel to the humiliating fall of Saigon in 1975,” added McConnell, who urged Biden to commit more support to the Kabul government is forces. “Without it, al Qaeda and the Taliban may celebrate the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks by burning down our Embassy in Kabul.”At the UN, Reuters reported Thursday that a statement was being drafted by diplomats from Estonia and Norway that would condemn the Taliban attacks, threaten sanctions, and affirm the non-recognition of an Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. In Qatar, where peace talks are ongoing, international envoys who met with Afghan government negotiators and Taliban representatives reaffirmed that foreign capitals would not recognize any government in Afghanistan “imposed through the use of military force.”",2,1,New York Post

482,Mind the gap: The basketball world is catching up to the US,0.0,44.33,https://apnews.com/article/2020-tokyo-olympics-sports-nba-basketball-59b2b3cf1af82153b21980014c6af991,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"SAITAMA, Japan (AP) — When the Dream Team era started in 1992, most of the NBA players in the Olympics represented the USs. David Stern knew what would happen from there.“In time,” the former NBA commissioner predicted in 1995, “that will change.”Stern was right. The number of international players in the NBA has steadily risen since -- and the gap between USA Basketball and the rest of the world has tightened as well. There will be more players in this tournament with NBA experience than ever before, with nearly 70 players in the Tokyo Olympics either current or former players in the league. More than four dozen of them played in the league this past season. And only 12 of that group are in Japan to compete with “USA” across their chests. That is why, when this men is Olympic tournament opens Sunday, the medal possibilities may be as wide open as they have been since that first team of NBA stars took the court in Barcelona. That group — which featured 11 future Hall of Famers on a 12-man roster — showed the rest of the world how much they had to do to catch the red, white and blue.“The gap is smaller and smaller every year as far as talent is concerned,” US coach Gregg Popovich said. The US is seeking a fourth consecutive gold medal an dis the big favorite to do just that according to FanDuel,The Americans are the only team in Tokyo with 12 NBA players. But like Popovich said and Stern anticipated years ago, the talent gap has drastically dwindled. Nigeria, which beat the Americans in an exhibition, has eight NBA players. Australia, which also defeated the US in a warm-up game, has seven. So does France, the first US opponent in this tournament on Sunday and the nation that knocked the Americans out of contention at the Basketball World Cup two years ago. That setback sent the team spiraling to a seventh-place finish, the worst showing in any tournament ever for an American roster composed of NBA players.“I think every team wants to beat us,” US forward Kevin Durant said. “Everybody wants to see us lose, so every game has a little bit more pressure to it.”There is only one current All-NBA first team player in these Olympics. He does not play for the US Slovenia is Luka Doncic garnered more first-team votes in the All-NBA voting this season, 55, than the entire US Olympic roster got combined. This is Slovenia is first time in the Olympics, but with Doncic leading the way, medal talk does not seem misguided.“Slovenians, we know how to fight, man,” Doncic said. “We are not going to go down easy.”Doncic willed Slovenia to a win in the Olympic qualifying tournament that ended on July 4 and gave the tiny nation a spot in the Tokyo field. And what he is done in his NBA tenure with Dallas has only shown the world that the buzz he arrived with was more than appropriate.“He is a spectacular player, as we all know,” Popovich said. “He is one of the best players in the world. And I emphasize, in the world. He showed himself early on in Europe, and he was a fast study in the NBA for sure. He is fun to watch. His skills, his competitiveness, his size, his innate basketball IQ is so impressive. You put four hardworking people around him and you have got a hell of a team.”Some of what to watch:There are 12 teams in the field; four will have to wait until Monday for their Olympic openers. Sunday is schedule has Iran vs the Czech Republic, Germany vs Italy, Australia vs Nigeria and the n the US vs France. The Monday men is openers are Argentina vs Slovenia and host Japan vs reigning World Cup champion Spain. The Miami Heat have four players at the Olympics, but only one plays for the US The Heat have three players on Nigeria is roster (KZ Okpala, Precious Achiuwa and Gabe Vincent Nnamdi), with Bam Adebayo playing for the US The only men is team in the Olympic field without a current NBA player is Iran. That roster does, however, have a former NBA player — Hamed Haddadi, who appeared in 151 games over parts of five NBA seasons for Memphis and Phoenix. He last appeared in the NBA in 2013. The women is game is going on the same trajectory as the men is when it comes to having more international players with WNBA experience in these Olympics than in any previous games. The US has 12 WNBA players on its roster, while Australia has nine current or former WNBA players and Canada has eight.

483,America Is Headed for an Unprecedented Wave of Evictions,-12.45,37.36,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/rent-evictions-homelessness/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,25,"Just before she called me one day in late July, Dawn Miller is phone lit up with calls from one particular number: the management office for her apartment building in Flatbush, Brooklyn, where she is lived since 2009. She has not paid rent in five months. She ca not. Before the pandemic, she worked at a food kiosk at Brooklyn College selling coffee and sandwiches. But the n the campus shut down, throwing her out of work. She had to borrow money just to afford food. She did not start receiving unemployment benefits until June, and even the n the money had to go to paying back what she had borrowed to travel to her home country of Jamaica when her sister recently died. Rent had to wait. Up until June 20, she was protected from eviction by a statewide prohibition on all evictions issued by Governor Andrew Cuomo. But once that blanket protection expired, Cuomo narrowed who was protected to those who were unable to pay rent because they suffered direct financial hardship due to the pandemic. That means landlords can still take their tenants to court and the burden falls to renters to prove to a judge that they qualify. The city is courts have also paused eviction proceedings through at least August 5, but without an extension, thousands of renters like Miller may be caught up in the gears of the system when it reactivates. There were also protections that the federal government put in place. When Congress passed the CARES Act, it included a moratorium on evictions in any federally subsidized housing. Any landlord with a federally subsidized loan through, say, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or who accepts Section 8 rent vouchers, could not legally evict tenants. But those expired on July 27 as Congress failed to pass an extension. “I am not certain what is going to happen,” Miller said. Even if her college campus reopens, she is not sure they will want to have people buying food from kiosks. “I do not know if I am going to have a job in the future,” she said. She is certain her landlord will try to evict her as soon as he can, so she is been trying desperately to enroll in the state is rent relief program, which was launched in mid-July. But the online system kept shutting down before she could complete her application. Miller lives with her youngest daughter and two grandchildren, and she is the sole provider; her daughter is in nursing school full-time. “I am worried about becoming homeless with my family,” she said. “Trust me, I am truly stressed.” Miller is one of millions across the country facing that stress. When the pandemic first hit and officials ordered businesses to shut down, many also instituted protections to ensure that people were not thrown out of their homes just when they were being told to stay inside them to stem the spread of the disease. Many were temporary measures under the assumption that by now the virus would be under control, and yet US case counts keep going up. Even after some states have allowed businesses to reopen, unemployment is horrifyingly high: More than 30 million people are either receiving unemployment benefits or have applied for them. One in five renters was behind on rent at the beginning of July, while about a third of American households missed their housing payment that month. The disappearance of eviction moratoriums will almost certainly lead to a housing crisis the likes of which the country has not seen in a generation. Estimates vary: One puts the number of households at risk of eviction at 17 million, while another predicts that between 19 million and 23 million people could face eviction by the end of September. Another found that as many as 28 million people could face eviction or foreclosure. No matter which number proves to be accurate, the potential hardship is vast. In all of 2016, landlords filed 2.35 million evictions. “The courts ca not handle it, the states ca not catch the people who go through the system and end up unhoused,” said Emily Benfer, a visiting professor of law at Wake Forest University. “It is a really catastrophic situation.” The country is poised to witness an even worse housing crisis than the one during the 2008 recession. “The USs has never seen this level of housing instability or threat of eviction, especially in such a truncated amount of time,” Benfer said. During that downturn, nearly 10 million people lost their homes to foreclosure in the span of eight years. It seems certain that, without policy-makers’ acting, far more will be displaced by the current crisis. An economist at Columbia University predicts that homelessness could increase by 40–45 percent this year. “We will see increases in homelessness the likes of which we have not seen in our country since the Great Depression,” predicted Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “This will be a humanitarian disaster of our making if there is not intervention,” Benfer. The eviction moratoriums cities and states put in place at the start of the pandemic varied considerably. Some protected everyone from eviction; others targeted only those who could prove that the pandemic had caused them financial hardship. Some blocked landlords from filing evictions in the first place; others allowed the whole process to move forward but merely barred sheriffs from carrying them out, which could still leave a black mark on a renter is record. “The only thing they have in common is that they expire,” Benfer said. Still, overall, Benfer said, “the moratoriums worked.” Where they are in place, eviction filings are still low. “There is no doubt that the federal, state, and local eviction moratoriums prevented evictions,” Yentel agreed. “That we can say with certainty.” But where they have lifted, evictions have quickly jumped. New Orleans offers a glimpse of what is in store for other places as protections expire. The state is eviction moratorium was lifted on June 15. Jane Place Neighborhood Sustainability Initiative, a community land trust and housing rights organization, estimated that about half of all tenants in the city were still protected by the CARES Act moratorium. To enforce that, Breonne DeDecker, the group is program director, and her fellow organizers posted flyers in buildings they knew were supported by federal money. But landlords do not want the information to be shared; they kept taking the flyers down. “It is not uncommon for organizers to go into common areas and put up fliers,” DeDecker said, “only to watch the property manger come by five minutes later and rip everything down and throw it away.” Now that federal protection has lapsed, “we really expect the deluge to start,” DeDecker said. Landlords had already moved to evict more than 230 city residents by the end of June, before the federal protection expired. Legal aid attorneys say they are fielding triple the number of eviction cases as compared to last year. DeDecker is group used to meet once a month; now they are meeting twice a week, trying to produce strategies to stem the tide. They have sent hundreds of letters to local and state judges asking them to halt eviction court, as well as contacting the governor asking him to reimpose the eviction moratorium. On July 30, a group of activists blocked access to the courthouse to protest the resumption of eviction cases. The disappearance of these protections is colliding with the expiration of the extra unemployment benefits Congress passed in response to the pandemic, money that many say has allowed people to keep paying rent. “That is really been the only break wall stemming the tide here,” Benfer said. Those in dire straits seem to have turned to assistance for food—requests for food pantries doubled in March—in order to use their limited resources to pay rent. They are “putting a priority on staying housed,” Benfer said. “Which makes sense. The primary response to Covid-19 is to shelter in place, so housing is literally preventative health care.” As the pandemic rages, with cases increasing in 15 states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C, and the prospect of businesses’ returning to any semblance of normal months, if not over a year, away, Congress still does not have a deal to extend benefits. Democrats want to keep them at the same level, while Republicans have proposed cutting the extra benefits from $600 a week to $200, which would cut Americans’ benefits by a cumulative $10 billion a week. The current outbreak has many governors reimposing lockdowns on different businesses, including in California, Louisiana, and Texas. Even in states that have allowed businesses to reopen and, in the best-case scenario, many of these renters were able to return to work, they have still likely accrued months of back rent that they owe. “Getting a job is not enough to help pay that off,” Benfer noted. And without the pandemic under control, allowing businesses to reopen does not mean they can keep their doors open safely or that customers will feel safe enough to return. Many will still remain out of a job. In New York, 279,400 low-income renter families will be at risk of not being able to pay rent and facing eviction when unemployment benefits expire. Another 111,500 families have experienced job loss without receiving unemployment benefits and are at immediate risk of eviction. Even though proceedings to evict people have been on hold, landlords have still been able to file the paperwork on new cases by mail. “We do not have any idea really how many,” said Judith Goldiner, attorney-in-charge of the Civil Law Reform Unit at the Legal Aid Society. Last year during the same period, she said, there were about 50,000 cases filed, so she thinks that is a baseline—likely a vast undercount—of how many people will face eviction once the system is up and running. “There is the possibility that tens of thousands of cases, maybe more than 100,000 cases, could be brought,” she said. “Landlords are chomping at the bit to bring these cases.” Housing advocates are baffled by the rush to evict. “I do not see how [landlords] are going to get blood from a stone,” Goldiner said. Even if they are able to push nonpaying tenants out, there are not likely many who can take their place and make rent when so many are still out of work. Initially, Goldiner advised clients to try to negotiate with their landlords, given the circumstances. “Over and over people told me, ‘No one responds,’ or they say, ‘No, we will not do anything for you,’” she said. “It is crazy to me they would not be trying to work something out.” The pain of eviction will not be felt evenly. Black and Latinx New Yorkers were already more likely to face eviction before the pandemic, a trend that the crisis has only exacerbated. Half of Black renters and nearly a quarter of Latinx renters in New York State fell behind on their rent between late April and early June, compared to just 6 percent of white ones. It is the same case nationwide: 30 percent of Black renters and about a quarter of Latinx renters are behind on their rent, compared to 13 percent of whites. Those who are covered by the federal eviction protections in the CARES Act should, in theory, have been protected until they expired toward the end of July, and will have 30 days to pay rent after landlords file a notice. But it is been very difficult to enforce. “The burden is on the renter to know whether or not they have any protection,” Yentel said. And they will struggle to figure it out. “Tenants certainly do not know,” Goldiner said, whether their landlord has a mortgage backed by the government. There are also no penalties for landlords who flout the rules and move to evict tenants anyway. ProPublica found landlords moving to evict in April despite being barred by the federal moratorium in four states. “The main thing tenants are experiencing in this exact moment is a lot of confusion,” said Cea Weaver, campaign coordinator for Housing Justice for All in New York. “People are really scared. They are scared because of the uncertainty and scared because of the lack of protections.” In mid-July, New York Governor Cuomo announced the creation of an emergency rental assistance program for low-income state residents who lost their income during the pandemic. But the $100 million he allocated only covers a small portion of the estimated $2 billion rent shortfall in the state, and applications were only open for two weeks. He “either does not understand this is a crisis, or he does not seem to care,” Goldiner said. “It is just boggling to me that the re is been so little coming from him.” “We are still in Covid,” Miller argued, frustrated at how little assistance she has been able to get to stave off her eviction. “So come on, do something for the people. What has he done? Nothing.” Many other states and cities have also created rent relief programs and have seen their resources vastly outpaced by need. Thirty percent had already been shut down after running out of funding by late July, according to Yentel. “In some places they were having to shut down within hours or days,” Yentel said. Louisiana is program ran out in three days. Houston is program was depleted in 90 minutes “Congress must act,” Benfer said. “The states have done everything that they can. They have depleted the funds that they have.” States are facing down enormous budget shortfalls due to a drop in tax revenue and a greater outlay in assistance. Extending moratoriums is not a solution but a bridge, advocates stress. Many want to buy time until Congress passes substantial rental assistance. Democrats included $100 billion in emergency rental assistance in the HEROES Act, which passed the House, along with a 12-month eviction moratorium for all renters who ca not pay rent. The Senate has not taken it up, even though Democratic senators have introduced stand-alone bills to extend a moratorium and offer significant rental assistance. Republicans are instead offering their own package that does not include an eviction moratorium and has far less assistance for renters. Other advocates just want to see rent canceled. “Every time [organizers] have to fight for an extension of a moratorium, it is like a yo-yo,” said Pam Phan, national field organizer with the Right to the City Alliance. Renters bounce between the security of knowing they will not face immediate eviction to having that security stripped away. In Florida, for example, the governor keeps extending it month by month, forcing advocates to fight for it over and over again, all the while bracing for evictions as they near the expiration. In June the governor extended it four hours before it would have elapsed. “It is becoming clear the visionary solution is actually the most logical one,” Phan said. That visionary solution is, for her, Congress passing a bill introduced by Representative Ilhan Omar and cosponsored by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Pramila Jayapal, and Ayanna Pressley in April that would cancel all rent and home mortgage payments throughout the duration of the pandemic while offering a relief fund for landlords and mortgage holders to cover losses. Right to the City is network of local advocates is trying to put pressure on state and local lawmakers to demand Congress actually pass it. Even as each state tackles the problem in different ways, “it is a larger systemic problem, because it is happening to all of us at once,” she said. “The message to Congress is they need to act.” But all advocates are united in one thing: Something must be done, or unimaginable suffering will follow. “The one positive is that this is entirely preventable. We can stop this,” Benfer said. “It does not have to end with all of these catastrophic outcomes.”",1,1,The Nation

486,Nothing Is More Threatening to the British Press Than a Black Woman in Control of Her Story,-4.0,39.0,https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a35727663/meghan-markle-british-media-racism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/harpers-bazaar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-05,16,"The British media isobsessionwith Duchess Meghan is distinguishable from its regular and, arguably, unhealthy scrutiny of other royals—or in Meghan is case, ex-royals—by some marked observations: The preoccupation is often racialized, if not patentlyracist. It is gendered, in this case, reeking ofmisogynoir. And it also contains subtle hints ofanti-foreignsentiment. Put together, the distinct Meghan fixation is as predictable as it is dangerous, and a reminder that media outlets anywhere save their most antagonistic portrayals for women everywhere, often punishing those who attempt ownership and control of their narratives. That Meghan is a Black, biracial woman exercising command of her story, opposing the account tabloids have sold about her, threatens the mirage of the monarchy as a secure institution, and the media outlets that feed into the machine they benefit from. When Meghan and Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex, stepped down from their duties as senior members of the British royal family in early 2020, those unfamiliar with the nation is press apparatus could be forgiven for thinking the initial brouhaha would eventually die down. Alas, more than a year later, even after the couple left the United Kingdom for North America with their infant son, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, the British media is penchant for adversely dissecting every detail of Harry and Meghan is life has not eased. Following the Sussexes’announcementin mid-February that they are expecting a second child, another wave of weary, if foreseeable, anti-Meghan punditry has come to the fore. The intensity of this wave has now been heightened by reports on Tuesday from that Meghan faced bullying complaints from some of her aides in 2018. Meghan has denied this through her lawyers, who referred to it as a “calculated smear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation,” in a statement to the British paper. Her lawyers also added that these accusations are “being used by Buckingham Palace to peddle a wholly false narrative,” which comes ahead of Meghan and Harry is CBS Primetime Special with Oprah Winfrey, airing this Sunday. In a highly unusual move, Buckingham Palace released a statementWednesday saying that it will investigate the claims. Notwithstanding the bullying allegations against Meghan, much of the pseudo analysis the British tabloids advance is not really about Meghan and Harry is perceived faux pas, or a sincere contemplation of the intentions and impact of their public acts. Indeed, it is less about Harry than it is about Meghan. Never mind that Harry will never be king. Never mind, too, that Harry is contempt for the press is practically legendary and predates Meghan—a fact seemingly lost on commentators who have blamed her forth e couple is mistrust of the press and their departure from the United Kingdom. But these demonstrable truths are less significant than what Meghan symbolizes. As Meghan is detractors see it, that a biracial, Black American celebrity divorcée who had the nerve to enter, and the n worse, exit, the royal family (in spectacular fashion) is unacceptable. That she appears to have done so while maintaining her self-respect and individuality insults the sensibilities of a press who both indulged in and resented her presence, often for cheap, ridiculous, and vicious fodder: Thethat referred to “how Meghan is favorite avocado snack … is fueling human rights abuses” comes to mind. What is so seemingly offensive to the British press and at least some of the British public is Meghan is independence and desire to control her destiny in the public eye—a common objective for celebrities. It is why her exit was always likely to the discerning mind. But it is also why she remains a persona non grata to those accustomed to covering culture, celebrities, and/or entertainment with little to no apparent ethical responsibility, or who disregard the duty of care they have to the people they write about the public that reads it. This fact is especially pertinent in light of the recentNew York Times-produced documentary,Framing Britney Spears. While chronicling the pop star is rise, fall, reemergence, and conservatorship restrictions, the film has also prompted a conversation on how the media covers public figures and, in particular, women. Any direct comparison between Meghan and Spears is, of course, incongruent. From the impact of race to their family backgrounds to their claims to fame: Spears is a pop star; Meghan went from being an actor to marrying into the most famous royal family in the world. Meghan is also autonomous in a way that Spears is seemingly not. A more accurate comparison might be made and has been made between Meghan and Princess Diana, whom the press was also unkind to; some still consider the media at least partially responsible for the latter is death. But what unites the stories of all these women—and many more—is an exhibited pleasure with which the media to ok, and in Meghan is case,in harping on any perceived slight or any deviation from norms or protocols, or in foiling their attempts to exercise authority over their lives and public images. What the press owes its subjects remains a tricky conversation, especially in entertainment or culture journalism that sometimes occupies a contradictory space in the media and the public. The subjects and people reported on and commented about are sometimes treated as frivolous, yet they reflect what and who a society deems desirable, relatable, worthy of worship—and paradoxically—who it feels entitled to in terms of surveillance and unfettered condemnation. What is clear in how the press covers women as public figures, regardless of their domains or class of celebrity, is that the media system replicates the same hyper scrutiny and projects the same limited space of as society offers ordinary women in general. Though Meghan is move to the USs may allow for a certain physical protection from the tentacles of at least the British media, there remains a danger in how her representation has been distorted by bad-faith press actors, notably in Britain. And what does it say about British media culture, British culture—British racism and sexism—that even the most multi-privileged Black/biracial women are at the receiving end of such ire? (And what does it say for those who share the same identity sans privilege?) The answer is obvious and ugly: Britain, which often imagines itself as occupying a “less racist” predisposition as its European and North American counterparts, remains a society embedded in racist, sexist, chauvinistic pathologies. Ignorant to its reality, Britain has huge swaths of its population that are unwilling to address these matters in terms of structure—including the media—and interpersonally. The less spoken part of this entire affair is that there are credible reasons to critique Meghan (and Harry). With this new bullying allegation, however suspicious the timing, it is also not impossible to imagine harmful behavior from people with power; but in this case, it must be considered in a racialized context, where black women are often on the receiving end of bullying accusations. These criticisms can exist alongside critiques of a British press that continue to be repugnant—and within a larger context of how the media reproduces biased and bigoted representations of women and people of color. Yes, including those who are privileged by skin shade, class, and/or celebrity. It is inevitable that in the interview with Winfrey on Sunday, Meghan and Harry will address their treatment by the British media. Previews have already revealed as much, including one teaser in which Meghan implicates the palace in “perpetuating falsehoods” about the couple. How the British, American, and global public will respond is worth watching for. It may, and perhaps should, include thoughtful criticism of where and how Meghan (or Harry) may have faltered—she is still a flawed public figure and human being after all. But even if one withholds compassion for the rich and privileged in this instance, perhaps there can still be room for reflection and discernment on her damaging portrayal, given what we know about the press is legacy on covering women in culture. It will certainly be more than what the British press is likely to afford her, if the past is any guide. And truthfully, it is not a tough bar to clear.

487,"To Build Stronger Families, Reframe the Fight Over Mayor Pete is Parental Leave",5.33,29.33,https://pjmedia.com/columns/stacey-lennox/2021/10/16/to-build-stronger-families-reframe-the-fight-over-mayor-petes-parental-leave-n1524408,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-16,25,"Recently, the media disclosed that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg took two months of parental leave following the adoption of twins. This news led to arguments online about whether he should have done so during a global supply chain crisis, whether men should take parental leave, and why the privileged class gets so much time. That misses the more significant opportunity. To defend his absence, the left and Democrats had to loudly declare the importance of parents spending time with their children. They had to advocate for families spending time together and note the importance of parent-child bonds. Agree with them wholeheartedly on these points. Then challenge them on the very policies they have pushed for years that discourage family formation by extending adolescence, making housing more expensive, and deemphasizing the role of fathers. It is time for conservatives to change the strategy of screaming “Stop” while standing athwart history and say, “No, we are not doing that. We are doing something completely different.”Young adults in this country are marrying less and having fewer children. This trend is a feature of a society in decline. Strong families are the building block of a free and prosperous society. You only need to look at the history of any authoritarian regime to know the family is one of the first things they destroy. Mao is cultural revolution may be the most horrific example when the culture war destroyed the Eastern tradition of honoring your elders. Young revolutionaries reported on, beat, and even murdered older relatives. Our tax and social policies enforce the politically correct view that all family configurations are equally desirable. One could even argue that many of them discourage traditional marriage by imposing monetary penalties when fathers remain in the home. This view ignores decades of research that confirms that children in intact heterosexual marriages are more successful as a population. It is no surprise that the decline in traditional marriage and childbearing accelerated with the passage of legislation purported to wage war on poverty under President Lyndon Johnson is Great Society. It is no shock that one of the architects of those programs wasMichael Harrington,founder of the Democratic Socialists and a committed Trotskyist. Trotsky envisioned perpetual revolution on a global scale, which cannot occur when solid families and a prosperous middle class with economic mobility exists. Harrington is view on the disenfranchised in America and how the state should care for them was notably paternalistic. The government as daddy was the goal. In his book, he asserted that millions of Americans lived in a “culture of poverty.” Harrington argued that this culture rendered the poor incapable of improving their situation. He believed a capitalist society could not provide the poor with opportunities for a more dignified life, and they must be cared for by the state. To put it in a nutshell, Harrington described a system that could only create a permanent underclass. The best expression of Harrington is world view is “The Life of Julia,” an Obama campaign video scrubbed from the internet because most Americans, even in 2012, found it horrifying. Now, the “Build Back Better” plan includes a raft of policies to discourage strong families. It encourages putting children in government-funded care shortly after a paid parental leave ends, which is supposed to excite you. It increases the marriage penalty for the Earned Income Tax Credit. It also extends adolescence by paying for 13th and 14th grades. The government-run education of children for 18 years in a pre-K-12 system produces horrible results, so let is do two more. Even the PRO Act seeks to reduce the freelance and contract opportunities that allow parents to work from home and spend less on child care and more time with their children. In 2013, the left-leaning Brookings Institute noted the decline of the traditional family is a class issue:A report from the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia summed up the data well: “Marriage is an emerging dividing line between America is moderately educated middle and those with college degrees.” The group for whom marriage has largely disappeared now includes not just unskilled blacks but unskilled whites as well. Indeed, for younger women without a college degree, unwed childbearing is the new normal. An additional trend now is having fewer children, period. The birth rate hit anew record low for the sixth consecutive yea rin 2021. It remains below replacement rates. Problems include financial barriers to successful family formation created by prolonged adolescence, dependence on two incomes, the cost of childcare, and skyrocketing housing costs. Rather than increasing the salaries of child care providers and expanding child care subsidies in the “Build Back Better” boondoggle, conservatives should advocate providing tax credits. These credits need to be a substantial percentage of the last year is W-2 earnings for one parent to stay home and care for their child until they are six. And substantial means 50%. A structure like this is better for families, including the child care workers who may want to have children of their own. Think about it. Couples could structure their monthly expenses to live within the means of a more substantial portion of the working parent is salary. Based on average wages on Indeed, a welder and medical office secretary in Pennsylvania could count on an additional tax credit of $13,936 on top of the standard deduction. They would have no child care expenses and none of the fuel, food, and other costs associated with commuting to work. The average American couple could save and spend in line with the goal of starting a family. Employers would benefit from the planning by having months to recruit, train, promote or transition another employee into the vacant position left by the parent staying home. It would also make returning to the workforce for a stay-at-home parent a common occurrence instead of having an employment gap that can be difficult to overcome. Women are not returning to the workforce as often post-pandemic. The media assumes they ca not. Perhaps they prefer to stay home with their children. The most important beneficiaries of policies that encourage family formation are the children. Brookings also noted:These differences in family formation are a problem not only for those concerned with “family values” per se, but also for those concerned with upward mobility in a society that values equal opportunity for its children. Because the breakdown of the traditional family is overwhelmingly occurring among working-class Americans of all races, these trends threaten to make the US a much more class-based society over time. The well-educated and upper-middle-class parents who are still forming two-parent families are able to invest time and resources in their children—time and resources that lower- and working-class single mothers, however impressive their efforts to be both good parents and good breadwinners, simply do not have. If we lose economic mobility for the next generation, we lose the American Dream. That is not a bargain most Americans are willing to make. So let is make more families at every income level.

In a110-page ruling released on Wednesday, judge Linda Parker of the federal district court in Detroit ruled that the attorneys who alleged widespread election fraud in Michigan presented unsubstantiated claims and abused the justice system.“This lawsuit represents a historic and profound abuse of the judicial process,” Parker wrote. “This case was never about fraud – it was about undermining the People is faith in our democracy and debasing the judicial process to do so,” she added. Parker ordered the lawyers to pay legal fees to the city of Detroit and state of Michigan, and will require them to attend legal education classes on pleading standards and election law within six months. She also referred the lawyers to the Michigan attorney grievance commission and other appropriate disciplinary authorities, where they could face further investigation and potential suspension or disbarment in the state. In a frenzied effort in the swing state of Michigan, the n president Donald Trump last November met withRepublican leaders from the sta teat the White Housein an increasingly desperate attempt to subvert democracy after a series of courtroom defeats over his and his campaign is allegations of voter fraud. This was all despite officials at the local and federal level declaring it the most secure election in American history. The Michigan lawsuit, which was filed in late November, was one of a series of lawsuits known as the “Kraken” cases that Powell filed across the country, alleging that Dominion Voting System is voting machines were deliberately tampered with. The lawsuit argued that Biden is win was fraudulent and asked Parker to declare Trump the winner of the state is 16 electoral college votes. Parker rejected the request in December,writing: “If granted, the relief would disenfranchise the votes of the more than 5.5 million Michigan citizens who, with dignity, hope, and a promise of a voice, participated in the 2020 general Election.”Wednesday is ruling marked the latest development in a series of legal woes mounting against pro-Trump attorneys who promoted election conspiracies.

Daniel Hokanson, chief of the National Guard Bureau, said Thursday that this year is fire season is shaping up to be one of the worst on record.“1987 was one of the worst fire seasons on record, and currently they are on pace to exceed that,” said Hokanson, speaking to reporters. “If you go back to the beginning of fire season earlier this year, within the state of California they burned about 1.6 million acres, which is roughly the size of the state of Delaware.”The fires have destroyed more than 3,200 structures, including homes, and there have been eight deaths. More than 12,400 people remained evacuated Thursday. Maj. Gen. Matthew Beevers, assistant adjutant general of the California National Guard expressed confidence in the ability of guardsmen in his state to provide sustained response to wildfires. New classes of California Guardsmen are constantly being trained to respond to fires. Last month, a news release reported that more than 270 soldiers began training. Beevers said the Guard is presently training another 550 members who will rotate into the mix of current crews to prevent burnout. In addition to the human resources the Guard provides, Beevers expressed that the 16 bucket helicopters, 4 modular airborne firefighting systems-equipped C-130s, and surveying drones have also been an invaluable resource.

That is a significant decrease from June, when COVID-19 and civil unrest pushed numbers to a peak of nearly 120,000 members activated. Despite the workload 2020 has handed guardsmen, Hokanson said the force has remained capable and ready.“At the same time, we met every one of our overseas deployment requirements, and it had no impact there at all,” Hokanson said, referencing the high levels of domestic missions. Of the 64,000 currently activated, more than 18,000 are still tasked with COVID-19 relief missions across all 54 states and territories. Federal support for such missions was extended until 2021at the beginning of last month.“National Guard forces around the country have provided critical support to governors as the governors work to address the needs of those populations within their respective states and territories,” President Donald Trump is executive memorandum stated. Another nearly 4,000 soldiers and airmen continue to provide relief to communities in Texas and Louisiana in the wake of Hurricane Laura. Airmen on the ground have been working to clear roadways of fallen trees and debris, the Louisiana Air National Guard reported. There are a lot of people in need,” said Senior Airman Alejandro Peralta, a structural engineering journeyman, in a news release. “Hopefully, they are comforted and feel supported when they see the Louisiana Air National Guard working in the area.”This year is hurricane season has a 60 percent chance of above-normal activity, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,and the season will not end until November 30. As hurricane and fire seasons continue on opposite coasts, civil unrest also rolls on across the country. Most recently, Wisconsin Governor Tony Eversrequested out-of-state assistance for protests following the police shooting of Jacob Blake and subsequent killing of two demonstrators. Military police companies from Michigan, Alabama, and Arizona responded.

490,Senate GOP report finds Biden administration spending $2B to suspend border wall construction,13.33,35.33,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/senate-gop-report-biden-administration-2b-suspend-wall-construction,https://adfontesmedia.com/fox-news-com-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"Dek: Fox News’ Mark Eiglarsh discusses the legal fallout from Texas' plans on ‘Your World’A new report by Republicans on a Senate subcommittee has concluded that the Biden administration is spending a minimum of approximately $2 billion to suspend construction of the wall at the southern border,even amid a continuing migrant crisis. The report by the minority staff of the Government Operations and Border Management Subcommittee of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee found that efforts to suspend or terminate wall construction projects at the Defense Department have cost between $1.8 billion to $2 billion and the administration is spending $3 million every day.""These interim findings show that the Biden administration is efforts to stop border wall construction constitute significant waste of taxpayer resources,""the reportsays. ""As of the drafting of this report the Biden administration has paid border wall contractors at least $2 billion and counting to not build the border wall.""""This $2 billion comes directly from DOD is budget, and the Biden administration is continued waste of these funds poses risks to national security and border security,"" it says. Biden ended the Trump-era wall project, which saw 450 miles built during the Trump administration, on his first day in office with hundreds of miles still funded and contracts already underway. Biden ordered a review of the federal government is obligations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has since announced a plan on what to do with money assigned to the wall, while the administration redirected transferred funds from Pentagon accounts to the original projects for which they had been appropriated. The Defense Department (DOD) had $10 billion transferred from border wall construction and related projects. After the order to suspend construction, the committee found that the Defense Department was initially occurring $6 million a day in ""suspension costs,"" but that was reduced to $3 million after layoffs. The money is being spent on ""make safe and site security"" projects.""This means that the federal government is paying contractors on these seven projects $3 million per day to drive out to project sites and guard the unused pallets of steel and other construction materials,"" the report said. To get to the $2 billion figure, the report uses DOD is estimates laid out in court documents. Those estimates include ""suspension costs"" for the project, which the subcommittee staff says either ""significantly undercounted"" the daily accrual of $3 million a day or was not fully included.""If the daily accrual of $3 million represents a separate cost not accounted in the broader DOD estimate of termination costs, the n the total suspension costs will still be significantly higher than the estimate DOD provided to the Biden administration and to the courts,"" it says. According to the report, the total amount spent could be higher than $2 billion due to uncertainties about plans for contracts acquired by DHS, questions about the Pentagon is estimation of suspension costs, and the 12- to 18-month time line it will take to exit the contracts. Pentagon spokesman Chris Mitchell told Fox News that the Defense Department ""will not comment publicly on matters that are in active litigation or settlement discussions.""Senator James Lankford, R-Okla., the lead Republican on the subcommittee, slammed the Biden administration over the findings.""It is absolutely absurd that Americans are paying contractors to guard metal gates that President Biden refuses to install because he wants to ‘study’ the wall,"" he said in a statement. ""Stubbornly refusing to spend money approved for the wall is not ‘executing’ the law. It is ignoring the law and ignoring the very real national security concerns posed by illegal entry across our very open southern border. For years I have called out federal waste, but the Biden Administration is literally ‘going for broke’ with this nonsense.""The report says that the estimation on exactly how much is being wasted could be higher, as it does not factor in Department of Homeland Security accounts, as well as other costs related to some of the DOD projects.""These estimates do not include an analysis of DHS accounts and the refore do not represent the full extent of waste by the Biden administration, nor do they include the ongoing daily costs related to DOD is suspension of projects funded by its 284 accounts,"" the report says. ""Given these caveats, President Biden is likely wasting significantly more taxpayer resources than estimated in this report on his efforts to stop building the border wall.""The Republican report also cast its findings in light of the ongoing crisis at the southern border, which has seen more than a million migrant encounters in Fiscal Year 2021 and more than 188,000 in June alone.""Our border patrol agents are doing their best to secure our border, but they need additional barriers, roads, and technology to help keep us safe,"" Lankford said. ""Instead, President Biden is paying professional construction contractors to babysit metal to the tune of $2 billion and counting, while at the same time we have seen a 20-year high number of migrants crossing our open border.""The report comes just as the Department of Homeland Securityannounced that it has canceled contracts for more than 30 miles of border wall construction in the Laredo Sector in Texas.

491,Why Do Democrats Want to Ban Members of Congress From Carrying Firearms in the Capitol?,16.0,30.0,https://thenewamerican.com/why-do-democrats-want-to-ban-members-of-congress-from-carrying-firearms-in-the-capitol/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,16,"A clique of liberal Democrats is urging leaders of both parties in the House of Representatives to ban lawmakers from carrying firearms while on Capitol Hill. While members of the public are barred from carrying weapons of any kind on Capitol grounds, a decades-old rule lets the members of Congress the mselves carry guns in most areas of the Capitol complex. So far, at least 21 Democrat anti-gunners have joined the effort to trash the exemption. Theysent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and to Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) this week in which they argued that armed members of Congress make everyone on Capitol Hill less safe, in part, because Capitol Police are unaware who is armed and who is not. This group hopes that party leaders will adopt a rule change banning firearms for everyone in the next Congress. “Ultimately, the current regulations create needless risk for Members of Congress, their staff, members of the Capitol Police, and visitors to the Capitol grounds,” the Democrats wrote in their letter. The group is composed of well-known gun control advocates, such as Representatives Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), Representative Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), and Representative Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) — who was shot and wounded as a staff member during the 1978 congressional trip to the Jonestown cult settlement in Guyana, a shooting in which four others were killed. Pelosi reportedly likes the idea of prohibiting guns for members of Congress. She has long wanted stricter federal gun laws and wants the incoming Congress to expand background checks. The idea, however, does not sit well with McCarthy or the Republican caucus. It is currently unknown just how many lawmakers on Capitol Hill exercise the ability to carry. The policy as it now stands was adopted in 1967 by the Capitol Police Board after Congress passed a Capitol ban on firearms for the general public. The issue came into the spotlight last month when it became known that Lauren Boebert, a 33-year-old Colorado Republican newly elected to the House, approached Capitol Police during new member orientation to inquire about Capitol Hill firearm policies. Boebert often carries a gun on her hip and made the Second Amendment a central focus of her campaign, in which she defeated 10-year incumbent Scott Tipton in the Republican primary. Representative Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who is leading the movement to ban congressmen from carrying in the Capitol Complex, says one of the problems is that there are no guidelines to ensure safe storage of guns in representatives’ offices or anywhere else in the Capitol.“As you know, Member offices are open to staff, visitors, and the general public, and a firearm that is not secured could easily end up in the wrong hands,” the letter reads. His group also argues that while the House Sergeant at Arms was said to brief the newly elected members on the Capitol is gun rules, older members have never received the same instructions.“Most returning Members are likely not aware of any regulations whatsoever regarding firearms on Capitol grounds,” the Democrats wrote. “As a result, there is a total lack of uniformity and procedure surrounding Members of Congress carrying firearms, which fosters an environment where Members may unwittingly be putting the mselves and others in danger.”That is a pretty weak argument, however. If that were really the issue, it could easily be remedied by a simple memo or orientation for veteran members of the chamber. Unfortunately, the House rules package for the 117th Congress is currently being drafted by members of the Rules Committee, led by Democrat Representative Jim McGovern (Mass.). Adopting rules for the chamber will be one of the House is first votes when the body convenes on January 3 to begin the next session. While Democrats’ majority has thinned due to Republican gains in the 2020 election cycle, they nevertheless retain control of the chamber, making it possible that the restrictive gun rules Huffman and his colleagues want will be passed, especially as it could please the new wave of radical Democrats such as Alexandria Ocasio-Corte (D-NY), who are tired of Pelosi and the party is old guard. It would be a shame and a loss for the Second Amendment if they removed lawmakers’ ability to carry. In such turbulent times, patriotic, constitutionalist statesmen should carry to protect the mselves against reprisals from the Left and the establishment. After all, even being within the walls of the Capitol does not guarantee your safety if you are a high-profile political target. Just ask Julius Caesar.",1,0,The New American

Ocasio-Cortez called on the IOC to “reconsider its suspension” of Richardson, as well as any other similarly “penalized” athletes, arguing that the criminalization of cannabis is an “instrument” of policies related to racism and colonialism.“The criminalization and banning of cannabis is an instrument of racist and colonial policy,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “The IOC should reconsider its suspension of Ms. Richardson and any athletes penalized for cannabis use. This ruling along w/ IOC denial of swim caps for natural hair is deeply troubling.”The criminalization and banning of cannabis is an instrument of racist and colonial policy.

This ruling along w/ IOC denial of swim caps for natural hair is deeply troubling.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)July 2, 2021AstheNew York Postnoted, “Following the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) relaxed the threshold for what constitutes a positive marijuana test from 15 nanograms per milliliter to 150 nanograms per milliliter in an effort to detect use during competition rather than in the days and weeks before.”“However, marijuana remains on WADA is list of prohibited substances, with THC — the chemical Richardson tested positive for — classified as a so-called ‘Substance of Abuse’ along with cocaine, ecstasy and heroin due to their use in society outside of a competitive context,” the Post added. Despite Ocasio-Cortez is claims, colonialism was actually a driving factor behind the cultivation of cannabis. Indeed, one of the three primary crops George Washington grew at Mount Vernon was hemp. It was not until the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 that cannabis products were required to be accurately labeled, which the n opened the door to regulation and criminalization. While Ocasio-Cortez is somewhat accurate when it comes to racist elements of the history of cannabis criminalization, the argument that the IOC is the refore racist is arguably unfounded, given that it is applied to all athletes, regardless of race.“The rules are clear, but this is heartbreaking on many levels; hopefully, her acceptance of responsibility and apology will be an important example to us all that we can successfully overcome our regrettable decisions, despite the costly consequences of this one to her,”saidUSADA CEO Travis T Tygart of Richardson is suspension. Indeed, Richardson herself did not make any accusation of racism against the IOC.“Honestly, I just want to apologize for my actions,” Richardsonsaid. “I know what I did. I know what I am supposed to do, I am allowed not to do, and I still made that decision. Not making any excuse, or looking for any empathy in my case.”“At the Olympic trials, Richardson ran the 100 meters in 10.86 seconds, even though she informed the world after the race that her biological mother had passed away the week before,”The Daily Wire isJoe Morgan reported. “Richardson admitted to using marijuana in order to cope with the loss.”“We all have our different struggles, we all have our different things we deal with. But to put on a face, and have to go in front of the world, and put on a face and hide my pain,” shesaid. “Who am I to tell you how to cope when you are dealing with a pain, or dealing with a struggle that you have never experienced before?”",1,1,Daily Wire
493,Supreme Court sides with Nestle and Cargill in case alleging child slavery,-0.67,48.33,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/supreme-court-sides-with-u-s-companies-in-case-alleging-wrongdoing-abroad/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cbs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-18,25,"The Supreme Court sided with food giants Nestle and Cargill on Thursday and threw out a lawsuit that claimed they knowingly bought cocoa beans from farms in Africa that used child slave labor. The justices ruled 8-1 that an appeals court improperly let the lawsuit against the food companies go forward. The companies had been sued by a group of six adult citizens of Mali who claimed they were taken from their country as children and forced to work on cocoa farms in neighboring Ivory Coast.""Although respondents' injuries occurred entirely overseas, the Ninth Circuit held that respondents could sue in federal court because the defendant corporations allegedly made  amajor operational decisions' in the USs. The Ninth Circuit erred by allowing this suit to proceed,"" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a majority opinion for the court. The case had been twice dismissed at an early stage before being revived by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. When the case was argued in December, the n-President Donald Trump is administration backed Nestle and Cargill. The Malian citizens had argued that Minneapolis-based Cargill and the American arm of Switzerland-based Nestle ""aided and abetted"" their slavery as children by, among other things, buying cocoa beans from farms that used child labor. The group sued, seeking to bring a class action lawsuit on behalf of the mselves, as well as who they say are thousands of other former child slaves. Nestle and Cargill have maintained throughout the case that they have done nothing wrong and that they have taken steps to combat child slavery. In statements following the ruling both Nestle and Cargill repeated that they remain committed to working to combat child labor in the cocoa industry. The case involves a law enacted by the very first Congress in 1789, the Alien Tort Statute, which permits foreign citizens to sue in US courts for human rights abuses. But Thomas said this case was not properly in US courts.""Nearly all the conduct that they say aided and abetted forced labor — providing training, fertilizer, tools, and cash to overseas farms — occurred in Ivory Coast. ... But allegations of general corporate activity — like decision making — cannot alone establish domestic application of the ATS,"" he wrote. Attorney Paul Hoffman, who argued the case for the Malian citizens at the high court, said in a statement that he was ""disappointed that the Court has delayed our clients' long quest for justice."" But he said it was not the end of the case. He said intends to ask a lower court to be allowed to amend the group is lawsuit and allege that Cargill and Nestle ""controlled the system of forced labor from the USs.""The high court in recent years has limited the use of the Alien Tort Statute. In 2018, the court ruled that foreign businesses cannot be sued under the law. In that case, the court rejected an attempt by Israeli victims of attacks in the West Bank and Gaza to use US courts to sue Jordan-based Arab Bank, which they said helped finance the attacks. The case is Nestle USA vs Doe I, 19-416, and Cargill Inc. vs Doe I, 19-453.",2,2,CBS News

495,Trump Organization indictments for Allen Weisselberg a small but important step,-15.33,31.0,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/trump-organization-indictments-allen-weisselberg-small-important-step-n1272896,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-01,25,"One need only recallAl Capone is tax fraud conviction to recognize that many tax cheats historically flout other laws, too. As of Wednesday, we have added another character to the books with news that the Manhattan district attorney officially filed criminal tax charges against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer,Allen Weisselberg. (Weisselberg plans top lead not guilty to the charges, his attorney said.)A growing chorus of pundits, politicians and even academics thus depict the law as being grounded in irrationality and being just political. It is no surprise that the corporate defendant in the New York criminal case is owned by former President Donald Trump. This is the same Trump who repeatedly called the Russia investigation a “witch hunt”and verbally abused special prosecutor Robert Mueller and his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions. This is the same Trump who showed contempt for elections in November 2020 when he asked the Georgia secretary of state to “find 11,780 votes,” and when that did not work met with top advisers to consider declaring martial law to redo the election — and finally incited an insurrection at the Capitol on January 6. Trump is four-year presidency can be summed up in the words of the New York State Bar Association statement condemning his 2020 pardon of convicted felonRoger Stone, a key witness in the Mueller investigation: “This is a perversion of justice, plain and simple.”The former president may soon fade from the political scene as his legal troubles worsen. But even without Trump, we must confront the perversion of justice that typifies the modus operandi of so many others like him in business, the entertainment industry and politics. Bernie Madoff, Harvey Weinstein and countless others in positions of power and prestige showed contempt for the law. They pervert justice because they think the law is an obstacle to be overcome. First, the powerful claim they are immune from the law. Often, they prove this to be true. Some likeBill Cosbyclaim immunity from prosecution because their lawyers negotiated a strategically advantageous deal with prosecutors. Others claim immunity from prosecution because they are US presidents. They hide behind a constitutionally dubious presidential immunity theory blessed by the Department of Justice in three separate memoranda written during the presidencies of Nixon, Clinton and Trump. Donald Trump is own lawyers, appearing before the 2nd Circuit in their effort to prevent the Manhattan DA from subpoenaing Trump Organization tax records, claimed the president was immune from subpoena and even could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and still be immune from prosecution. Trump is defenders would have us believe that it is the law, not his actions, that are wrong. Others in positions of power — many child molesters, for example — claim immunity because they avoided getting caught until after the statute of limitations expired. Still others think their immunity stems from their social class. As New York real estate mogulLeona Helmsleyfamously told her maid, “Only the little people pay taxes.” Unfortunately for Helmsley, she was not immune from prosecution and was carted off to prison. A second approach is to attack those who enforce the law, whether it be Mueller and his band of “angry Democrats,” the four agency inspectors general fired by Trumpin the middle of investigations, the USs attorney in Manhattan also fired by Trump in 2020, or now the verbal assaults launched at the Manhattan DA from Mar-a-Lago. Trump is strategy appears to be: When caught violating the law, deflect one is own narcissism onto law enforcement and hope that sticks in the court of public opinion. A third related strategy is to denigrate the rule of law itself. Claim that the law is perverse, either because the law is just political or because the law is irrational in making some things illegal and others not. A growing chorus of pundits, politicians and even academics thus depict the law as being grounded in irrationality and being just political. In the far-right media, if Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden did it, it is per se criminal. If Trump did it, it is perfectly legal and any prosecutor, inspector general or member of Congress who suggests to the contrary is just on a witch hunt. Many on the left have a similar narcissistic attitude, even if not the media platform to express it, often insisting that law is defined by politics and has no moral integrity on its own. The law is not perfect and neither are those who enforce it. But the law is not simply perverse or political either. For over a century, nihilistic legal commentators have re-enforced this view. The German theologian and legal philosopher Carl Schmittin the 1920s published “The Concept of the Political,” in which he argued that law is not based on neutral principles but is simply a byproduct of politics. Academic commentators on the far right and far left today quote Schmitt, who joined the Nazi Party in 1933, frequently for the same proposition: Law is all about politics. There is no objective truth, no just concept of right and wrong underlying the law. This nihilism, like bad wine, is poured into the fancy bottles of academic theory, but it is peddled to a far larger audience under the more plebeian labels of right-wing radio, TV and internet. Finally, there are the many clever ways to get around the law. In the 1970s, before Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan reduced taxes on the rich, some academic economists sympathized with those who did not want to pay whatever taxes the legislature deemed to be their fair share. Arthur Seldon of the London School of Economics and a group of co-authorscoined the term “avoision”to describe manipulative tax strategies that combined ethically problematic but legal tax avoidance (for example, moving from one jurisdiction to another to pay lower tax) with illegal tax evasion (for example, pretending to have moved from one jurisdiction to another in order to pay lower tax). Another common avo i sion strategy is paying an employee is rent, private school tuition or other benefits rather than paying reportable income. This, of course, is what the Manhattan DA now alleges the Trump Organization and its CFO did to avoid paying taxes. By the 1990s Seldon is phrase “avoision” was so widely used that it appeared on “The Simpsons” as Bart Simpson explained why Krusty the Clown was in prison for tax fraud: “I do not say 'evasion.' I say 'avoision.'”According to a 2019 New York Times article, several generations of the Trump family have been doing just that to “avoid” taxes since the 1970s. And on Wednesday, the Manhattan DA, after a lengthy fight just to get the Trump Organization is financial records, and a 2020 victory in the Supreme Court, finally had enough evidence to hand down an indictment. Trump is the epitome of the avo i sion man. And the law may be catching up with him. But we cannot just focus on Trump without looking at the underlying problem ­— the narcissistic view of the law that gave rise to Trump and caused so many to celebrate him first as a real estate tycoon, the n as a media star and finally as a president. The law is not perfect and neither are those who enforce it. But the law is not simply perverse or political either; it is grounded in a collective sense of right and wrong. One of the law is imperfections is that those who flout the law, who think they are too powerful ever to get caught or prosecuted for violating it, are far too often right. That is about to change with the small but important step taken by the Manhattan DA on Wednesday. Respect for the law, and enforcement of the law, are crucial to maintaining the rule of law. And that goes for everyone — even a business empire run by a man who once was president of the USs. Richard W Painter was the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007 under President George W Bush. He is the S Walter Richey Professor of Corporate Law at the University of Minnesota and is a graduate of Harvard College and Yale Law School.",1,1,MSNBC

Bossing folks around is, after all, a lot more fun than being bossed around. So, it is refreshing to see in this deeply divided country at least tentative steps towards bipartisan agreement that not every issue should be settled by dictates issued from the nation is capital. As encouraging as it is, though, this grudging acceptance of live-and-let-live does not go far enough.""American federalism has always been a partisan issue — the GOP are the modern advocates,""notesDemocratic political adviser and former legislator Frank Pignanelli in theDeseret News.

""[T]his immense federal intervention comes at the risk of making states even more subservient to the federal government, both financially and with more federal regulation and mandates.""Pignanelli is not the first Democrat to discover the attractions of decentralization.""In the wake of the presidential election, as Democrats realized that Republicans will soon control all three branches of the federal government, progressives disinclined to secede from the Union rediscovered another exit strategy: states' rights,"" Jeffrey RosenwroteforThe New York Timesin 2016. Democrats spent the next several years battling for local governance against the Trump administration is insistence on federal control over matters such asimmigrationandmarijuana. Since the n, Democrats have recaptured the presidency, the House, and (sort of) the Senate. Now they are back to insisting that beltway preferences should prevail—at least when their party is positions on issues such asgunsandtaxesdiffer with local preferences. This back-and-forthing on the value of local control vs central supremacy is exhausting, not to mention overtly opportunistic. As Pignanelli adds, with Webb is agreement, ""Federalism must be a bipartisan issue. Otherwise, it will continue to be subject to the inconsistent whims of elections.""To some extent, this opportunism is baked into American politics, argued Ernest A Young, the n of the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, in a2004Brooklyn Law Reviewarticleabout attitudes towards federalism during the War on Terror. He saw switching preferences on central vs local power as inherent to a system in which elections are won and lost, rotating factions through control of the federal government and localities. ""Federalism is about dividing power; nothing much depends on what the power in question is being used for,"" Young wrote. But ""[i]t is also about providing institutional space for a diversity of political views"" and so is inherently important beyond its utility to whoever lost the last federal election. State and local autonomy functions ""as a rallying point for political opposition to national policy"" and ""assures that a particular faction cannot become entrenched and unaccountable in power.""Or, as Webb put it in theDeseret News, ""On issues like gun control and the minimum wage, why not let Wyoming be Wyoming and New York be New York? Half of congressional dysfunction could be eliminated by modestly accepting the diversity of our country.""That political differences are coming into dangerous conflict is obvious not just from the formal contests observed by Pignanelli, Webb, and Young, but from the national tensions and strife of recent years. Februarypolling by CBS News/YouGovfound that 57 percent of Republicans think of Democrats not as political opponents, but as ""enemies""; 41 percent of Democrats return the sentiment.""The country is increasingly split into camps that do not just disagree on policy and politics — they see the other as alien, immoral, a threat,"" Nate CohncommentedinThe New York Timeslast month. It is not an unprecedented problem, he notes, and other countries that have divided into mutually loathing camps have kept the peace and held together through arrangements including ""power-sharing agreements, devolution or home rule.""Power-sharing, devolution, or home rule sounds a lot like federalism, come to think of it, and for good reason. Decentralization of power reduces the danger that people will resent to p-down decisions that are contrary to their own preferences – and that may even be maliciously intended to hurt ""enemies"" in a sectarian society. If you believe that people of varied values and preferences should not be forced to live in lockstep, it makes sense to embrace ""space for a diversity of political views"" and to largely ""let Wyoming be Wyoming and New York be New York.""But the federalism of the Constitution was designed for a nation of about4 million people; many states and even some counties are now more populous than the whole country was at the founding. Are you really allowing free range for diverse views by devolving control down to the level of aCaliforniaor aTexasthat each contain multitudes sufficient to entertain many more conflicting ideas than the original USs could have contemplated? EvenLos Angeles County, with 10 million people, is far larger than the entire USs of 1790. At this point,realfederalism, through the devolution of power, requires more than paying lip service to the existence of states and their ability to set independent policies. Decision-making has to go further down the food chain, at least to the county level, to revive something like the federalism of the Constitution. To the extent possible, power should devolve to individuals whose right to make their own decisions and govern their own lives should be respected. Individual self-rule is about as pure an expression of the distributed power embodied by federalism as you will find.

498,The White House refuses to say whether or not Trump will accept results of the election,-25.33,31.67,https://occupydemocrats.com/2020/08/19/the-white-house-refuses-to-say-whether-or-not-trump-will-accept-results-of-the-election-1/,https://adfontesmedia.com/occupy-democrats-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-19,25,"A core component of the Republican Party is strategy to reelect Donald Trump is consistently and unapologetically lying about just about every political issue on the table. Yet there are some things that Donald Trump says about his future intentions that the American public must take deadly seriously — his refusal to confirm that he will abide by the results of an election that he is already calling rigged before a single vote is cast and while he is doing everything in his power, including destroying the US Postal Service, to suppress the ability of Democrats to vote against him. This unprecedented refusal to commit to an orderly transfer of power once the election results are confirmed was the subject of a question posed to White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany today during a press briefing. McEnanay was asked to explain Trump is comment earlier this week that “the only way he would lose this election was if this election was rigged” and whether there was “any circumstance under which he could lose the election fairly.”The Press Secretary is answer was a perfect example of why she is been dubbed “Kay-lie” by many observers who are amazed at her ability to spout misinformation and outright fa bul ism in her defense of the president. Actually, it is difficult to fault the truthfulness of McEnany in the opening line of her response to the question since she couches it with the qualifier “The president believes” which could provide an excuse for a large multitude of delusional notions.“The president believes that he has done a great for the r American people and he believes that will show in November,” the Press Secretary began her answer. “He believes that, uhh, that voter fraud is real, in line with what we see all across the country, particularly wir th mail-in ballots which are prone to fraud,” McEnany concluded by repeating Trump is false talking points. While this level of misinformation regarding phony claims of mail-in voter fraud is frightening, what McEnanay said in response to a follow-up question should result in many a lost night is sleep for anyone who values our nation is democratic principles. A reporter asked whether Trump is claims — that the only way he will lose will be if the election is rigged — means that he will not accept the election result she wins.“The president has always said he will see what happens and make a determination in the aftermath,” McEnany replied.“He wants a free election, a fair election, and he wants confidence in the results of the election, particularly when you have states like Nevada doing mass mail out voting to their voting rules and when they tried this in the primary, it was a massive failure, ballots were piled up in trashcans, ballots were pinned to apartment dart boards, and with that being the system, the president wants to take a hard look at this and make sure these are fair election results and not subject to fraud,” the Press Secretary replied, rapidly repeating her talking points with barely a breath between her words. McEnany is regurgitation of Trump is self-serving attempts at reducing the confidence in an absentee ballot practice that has functioned without major problems – with the exception ofRepublican-planned election fraud— for decades is a dire forecast for an era of post-election turmoil as the president is already preparing the nation for the monumental tantrum he will throw if his attempts at skewing the playing field through voter suppression and the summoning of foreign interference do not yield the desired victory that he foolishly believes that he deserves.

( July 18-19, 2020.) As most of you probably know these demonstrations have been going on in front of the Federal Justice Center for over 50 straight nights. Since Trump called in the Feds, the turmoil and violence has escalated. We all know what Trump is doing, the Feds are baiting the demonstrators, and when they react to the police violence, Fox News is there to convince the American people that the demonstrators are the bad guys, and the police are the good guys. This is a political recipe that is as old as lying itself. The Feds and the News want to shape public opinion that these violent protests are being committed by mobs of anarchists and thugs. Now, if the American people really want to know about mobs and thugs, they can go back in history and examine the US Empire, when their military is sent all over the world to steal and murder for corporate profits. But, I am getting ahead of myself, as the US swarming locust have come to Portland to convince people all over the nation that the Federal Government is protecting us from violent descent. The murder of George Floyd, and so many other Black Americans has set off a powerful Rebellion. Black Lives Matter has awakened, and it has become the consciousness of a sleeping giant. The last couple of nights have been very intense, as I have been tear gassed and shot at with a projectile round while carrying 2 Nikon cameras shooting as fast as I can take pictures. I am 75, but when the adrenaline is pumping and you are running from the cops, my engine body is 35. It is either that, or you fall flat on your face and inhale mass quantities of CS gas. If you are close to the cops, you never know what they will launch. In this article, I am including two photographs. The first photo was taken on July 18, 2020. I was very fortunate to get this image, because shortly after I took it, I got consumed by CS gas. That gas makes you very humble, as you just turn and get the hell out of that space. Shortly after that I got my eyes washed out by a medic. This picture, as you might recognize, is now a video that has gone viral with over nine million hits. The protester in the picture is a Navy vet, Christopher David, who is 53, and a graduate of the US Naval Academy. This was his first demonstration, and he made a huge introduction into the world of bearing witness. If you look at the picture closely, his right hand is trying to block the cop is hand as the cop is hitting him with pepper spray, which you can see. While this is going on, another cop his hitting Christopher David on the legs with a long baton. That cop also hit him in the hand and broke two bones. And, while this is all going on CS gas is everywhere. Seconds after I took this picture, this Navy vet turns the opposite direction and flips the cops off with both fingers. This is a remarkable story, as this protester stood his fucking ground. The bottom phot is an image I took on July 19, 2020. On this particular night, the cops chased us a couple of blocks. They the n started firing projectiles at us from a couple of different weapons, to include more tear gas. As you can see in this picture, the cop on the far right has just fired a munition round. One round set off a fire, which the protesters quickly put out. I took a few more pictures of the cops firing what they like to call less than lethal riot munitions. As the cops backed away from the intersection, one of them fired a round at me, as I saw it coming and hurriedly stepped out of the way, as it missed me by a few feet. I ca not imagine taking a direct hit from one of these rounds, because it can kill you if it hits you in the head. This is exactly what almost happened to a 26-year-old man last week who was hit in the head by a projectile across the street from the Federal Justice Center. His name is Donavan La Bella. He was knocked unconscious, and you can still see his blood on the sidewalk. He was sent to the hospital where emergency reconstructive surgery was performed. He will survive. It is hard to tell where this stand-off with the police is going. The Feds do not know this town, so they think they can control the tens of thousands of activists who live in Portland, Oregon, which George HW Bush labeled, ” Little Beirut.”The Feds are playing a chess game with Portland. If there is more overwhelming violence against protesters, and more people get injured, or possibly killed, the call from social media will bring out 50 thousand people to the streets. I have been around these black belt protesters a lot, they are fearless, and I might say, they have become professional. As John Lewis once said: ” Find a way to get in the way.” His legacy is now in Portland, Oregon. I need to close, as John Lewis is calling me to prepare for another night.

501,The Nature of Money,-9.33,39.67,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/01/trumps-taxes-and-the-nature-of-money,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-23,25,"Even as the pandemic and financial crisis introduce us to new and grotesque ways to suffer, it seems as if the rich have been spared the worst of it. Their net worth has increased by$637,000,000,000while poor friends of mine beg for rent money on social media. It can feel as if there are two economies, one for us and another for the rich. This is wrong, however. There is only one economy. The difference between how the wealthy and the working classes experience the same world is not just in the amount of money we have and what that can buy—it is built into the nature of money, as I learned when I was studying to become an accountant. The first two classes in an accounting major outline a handful of extremely basic equations, standard forms (like the balance sheet and the statement of cash flows), and the theoretical underpinnings of accounting. They are considered “washout” courses—ones so difficult a significant number of people drop the major—and it is not because of the math. Accounting requires no more than middle school algebra. If you want to know why it is so difficult, here is one of the very first thought problems I was presented with in one of my classes:There are multiple answers. For internal figures (called managerial accounting), the painting is worth whatever management would find most useful at any given time. How that is done, and what figures are recorded the re, is unregulated. On the other hand, when preparing numbers for people outside the company, the rerules. For tax reporting purposes, the hospital (with some exceptions) needs to have it assessed and recorded at fair market value. Fair market value is a different figure—usually a more conservative one—than what you’d expect the painting to fetch at auction. For the purpose of enticing investors or seeking a loan, the re is yet another answer: it depends on what the hospital plans to do with the painting in the near future. If they are willing to sell it in the next year or two (especially to repay a debt) the n they should report it at fair market value. But if they would not part with it under any circumstances, it should be recorded at the price it was acquired for—a dollar. The painting is worth a lot of money, but if they are not planning to make use of that value, the n they ca not treat it as a resource. To summarize, there are two correct ways to record the value of the painting, either “fair market” or “acquisition” value (i.e. the original purchase price), and neither of them are what the painting would actually “be worth” in the conventional sense. Which value the accountant chooses depends not on anything objective, but on what the business plans to do with the painting. This example breaks the kind of people who find an accounting major attractive. We are creatures who love objectivity and order, and accounting is not that. The thought experiment about the painting is not a weird edge case—it is a typical day on the job. I used to audit natural gas companies, and there are many whose distribution systems are bringing in tens of millions of dollars a quarter, yet their infrastructure is worth $0. The first time I saw a company claiming to literally be worthless, I brought it to my boss because I swore it could not be right. He said, “depreciation,” and I to ddled off back to my desk. We record the wear and tear infrastructure goes through as depreciation—we slowly reduce its value, in other words—and we do that in a standardized way. Usually this involves an evenly allocated reduction of value per year over the expected life of the asset—for example, if a new oil pipeline is expected to last 10 years, we might subtract 10 percent each year until it is worth nothing. For other industries or assets, the rate of depreciation might be based on the number of units produced—the more widgets are made, the less the widget stamping machine is worth. The different models are used so we can compare companies apples-to-apples. We do this regardless of whether their infrastructure is still functioning or not. This is not a mistake: it is the right way to record the value for the purpose of comparison to other companies and for taxes. But if I worked for that same company and wanted to sell it to a buyer, the considerations would be totally different. For example,depreciation for tax purposes is usually accelerated faster than actual wear and tear. A car with a 15 year life, for tax purposes, has to be depreciated over five years. This is the government encouraging companies to build and buy more for political reasons. Depreciation is an expense that is deducted from income to arrive at taxable profit, and so accelerating it is effectively a tax break—but one only companies that rapidly build and expand can reliably use. However, that same infrastructure, when being assessed for sale, is often worth more money than even its depreciated value. When buying or selling infrastructure, businesses take into account how much cash that infrastructure is generating regardless of its age. These differing considerations change the numbers on the page. Therefore, a business infrastructure is value may swing millions of dollars based on the market and the needs of a business. A 1992 Geo Metro is value will not. That giant fluctuation is characteristic of assets which make money (like an oil pipeline or intellectual property) and assets which store value (like fine art or some kinds of real estate). The same holds true for the portfolios of rich people. The wealthy who depend primarily on their assets to sustain them (rather than wages) will have many, many large assets, and their entire net worth will swing millions of dollars simply based on their plans for the coming year. Accounting is less of a science and more of a language with grammar, vocabulary, and ideological underpinnings. Recording something with a number, especially one with decimal places, gives a false sense of precision and objectivity to what is being quantified. Even in the “hard sciences,” which also use numbers with decimal places and high degrees of certainty, there is a subjectivity. A human being chooses what to count and what the criteria is for counting it for an intended audience. That influences what number makes it onto the page. Accounting as a field is perhaps more aware of this subjectivity than most disciplines that work with numbers. Business accounting is grammar is set by an organization called the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which regularly publishes guidance on how to present figures for public consumption. Those standards evolve as part of an ongoing process of polling the industry and holding open discussions, along with formal appeals. In short, accounting is an ever-evolving language that records the day-to-day workings of a life or a business. It is designed to describe the flow of assets, assess it, and make arguments about what should be done. It is not objective because it ca not be. All I can do as an accountant is be clear about the purpose of why I am presenting specific numbers, what assumptions I am making, which set of accounting standards I am using, and how closely I hew to those standards. We know shockingly little about the me ga rich. Lists like the Forbes 400 are the only available resources we have on who is wealthy because governments do not really track individual wealth, and the wealthy the mselves do not advertise. The first Forbes 400 was an immense feat of journalism, digging through public property records in order to compile estimates. But roughly half of wealth is either privately held or in cash—not a matter of public record, and so unavailable to journalists. Even the public record is easy to evade. The rich routinely use shell corporations and trusts and elaborate tax evasion schemes. We gained a small window into that complex web of financial entities the wealthy use to evade taxes through thePanama Papers. That leak, which comprised millions of documents, detailed many billions of dollars of schemes (legal and not) from only one law firm. One estimate says about 8 percent of the world is wealth is in offshore tax havens, and 80 percent is untaxed. Because of the sheer complexity of where the wealthy keep their money and how it is accounted for, it can be literally impossible for a rich person to quantify what they the mselves are worth. The richest person on earth may have no idea they the richest person on earth. The wealthier someone is, the more the relationship between value and currency breaks down, and so the title “wealthiest person on earth” may actually be meaningless. On the scale we workers live, money seems very precise because itprecise. For young accountants, that is the appeal. They come into adulthood with some experience of money. A Coke costs $1.75. If they have ever filed taxes before arriving at school, the accounting was very straightforward. It was either correct or not correct, with an accuracy to the dollar. But all that lovely order and certainty falls apart outside the realm of small personal finance. This precision in the micro and lack of it in the macro comes down to the function of money. The purpose of money is to establish an exchange rate between labor and finished goods. It allows capitalists—not us, we are not the primary “users” of the tool—to compare worker to worker, good to good, investment to investment, and translate between them. It does a pretty good job of describing the lives of wage earners because that is what it is designed to do. Our hours worked, productivity, and consumer habits are all numbers in a spreadsheet. But any attempt to turn it back on capitalists is like an amoeba trying to look at a human being with a microscope—the lens does not go both ways. A poor person is tax liability can be calculated to the cent. But when a wealthy person does their taxes, there are a number of arguments to be made about how much they own, how much they made, and how much they lost. Your net worth is a number. A capitalist is worth is a conversation. That difference has material outcomes. Among the capitalist class, fraud is rampant. In 2001, Enron—an energy and commodities trading company from Texas—committed fraud on such a large scale (and more importantly, sound ermined the credibility of the entire industry is figures) that it prompted a reform of accounting practices. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act greatly tightened the standards on how figures must be reported outside of a company. The “language” of accounting became more standardized. Financial statements presented to investors must now be audited by independent, outside accountants. And while these reforms seem necessary given the stakes, I ca not find firm figures either way on whether they helped at all. I am not a fraud investigator myself, but as an auditor I was privy to how several fraud investigations turned out. Without exception, my experience is that whether law enforcement is called is a matter of how much money was stolen. Petty theft is always prosecuted. But if someone embezzles $10 million, a company tends to prefer to keep that person employed with them and treat it like a loan. Someone in a position to steal that much money has connections. One white-collar criminal who comes to mind—I personally had some contact with him—was in a niche industry. He was a deal broker for commodities, and his customers would only deal with him. 10 million dollars is a lot of money, but in relation to his commission, it was not that much. His placement in the industry, his relationship to labor, was what made him wealthy, not merely the dollar amount of his salary and his assets. He himself did not work to produce a product, or really provide a service. He maintained a set of relationships with business owners (who also did not make anything with their own hands—they had employees for that) and acted as a gatekeeper of information about who needed what. Within the very specific parameters of his work, he was trusted. Of course his embezzlement was not brought to the police. Focusing on the numbers rather than seeing their movement as descriptive of something, as pointing towards his relationships, is the same kind of mistake a dog makes when you point at the moon and he sniffs your finger. This gets at whatDavid Graeberwas talking about when he outlined the origin of money in his book. Before the wide use of currency for everyday transactions (which only became common in the 1800s), poor workers relied on credit almost exclusively. Credit in this sense meant “trust.” People did not directly barter (e.g., eight eggs for one shoe), they kept track of what they owed one another over time and paid as they could. These were relationships built on trust. The switch to currency-only transactions had to be imposed by state force. For example, in the very early days of industrial capitalism in England, shipyards were routinely a year or two behind on wages, so workers took tools and food and other things they could barter to pay their rent and their grocery bills. This was not a sign of economic collapse—thiswasthe economy. In order to force a switch to currency, the government criminal i zed taking tools and goods from the shipyards (previously it was not just legal, but precisely how compensation worked), and the shipyards instituted whippings for this now-theft. Samuel Bentham, an architect, redesigned ship yards with a new central surveillance tower to curb this new kind of the ft, an idea lifted by his brother, the architect Jeremy Bentham, for the now infamous prison panopticon. Before that, in medieval Europe, the legal penalties for defaulting on a debt were harsh and involved mutilation or death. However, they were almost never used. Debt was considered a private matter between two individuals, worked out between them in whatever units of barter and time frames suited them. As Graeber put it, capitalism is “the story of how an economy of credit was converted into an economy of interest; of the gradual transformation of moral networks by the intrusion of the impersonal—and often vindictive—power of the state.” Relationships have always been the fundamental underpinning of money: the thing money reflects for the wealthy and destroys for the poor. In a way, the wealthy frauds ter I met is a throwback to an older, kinder, more personal concept of money—one most of us will never experience. Today, prosecution rates for white collar crime are the lowest they have ever been and trending downwards. Theft itself becomes a conversation, rather than just a crime, when a wealthy person does it. When one capitalist robs another, my experience is that they tend to discuss among the mselves how to restore the thief to good standing without destroying anyone is life, livelihood, or privacy. There are of course exceptions. Bernie Madoff and his$50 billioninvestmentPonzi scheme springs to mind. But Madoff is position was dependent on resources and connections that turned out to be fictional. He had no realistic means to ever repay the investors he scam med (or even to return their initial investment), and so he went to prison. But for those that genuinely are well connected and do have the means to repay the people they rip off, the wealthy already have the restorative justice prison abolitionists fight for. Petty the ft, on the other hand, is prosecuted mercilessly. I find this especially strange given how much more of a problem fraud is than theft. The FBI estimates that burglary and petty theft cost Americans about$3.4 billion in property losses. White collar crime costs between$426 billion and $1.7 trillion annually. This kleptocratic culture is not harmless. Enron was a natural gas company whose entire business was propped up by fraud. When they were no longer able to continue to hide the extent of their debt, they both crashed that industry and spurred massive reforms in accounting practices and fraud controls. Perhaps those reforms worked, but I doubt fraud has dropped at the rate fraud prosecution has. Personally, I wonder if the lesson companies learned was about keeping a lid on scandal rather than about curbing white collar crime. They preserve the social relations that money points to at risk to everyone else. And I guess it is easy to see why—it seems on the surface short-sighted to protect thieves who can crash an entire economy, but the frauds ters and their wealthy connections are not the ones who suffer in a crash. They still have the power which underpins money, which their money merely gestures towards. The figures in a spreadsheet are shadows cast by power, and during financial crises their power preserves them. The wealthy are so completely insulated from the consequences of what they do, good or bad, it is very hard for me to understand what motivates them at all. The future itself feels obscure. Here, the lack of imagination that makes me a good accountant makes me a poor visionary: I am not sure what to do about money beyond believing something should be done. Depending on the study, betweeneightand26people own half of the world is wealth, and if money is not a good means to describe the m, the n that is a failure to describe the world as it is. Marx advocated abolishing money, as do some foundational anarchists. There are also thinkers on the left (likePierre-Joseph ProudhonandDavid Graeber) who believe public ownership of the means of production is more important than exactly how we account for it, and so are fine with markets and currency, albeit in forms that would be nigh unrecognizable. A full survey of left thought on money and a weighing of the pros and cons of each approach is beyond the scope of a single article. However, on the road to a better society, we will have to grapple with money as it exists. As of now, it is a tool used to describe workers with the goal of extracting wealth and labor from them. It is an incredibly poor tool for holding the wealthy accountable, and so we will have to come up with other methods.",1,1,Current Affairs
502,"After 2020 surge, Colorado gun sales continue at record pace in 2021",-1.67,44.67,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/10/colorado-gun-sales-2021/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"Coloradans since last year have bought guns at such a rapid pace that gun store owners struggled to keep their shelves stocked. Bristlecone Shooting, Training and Retail Center in Lakewood generally carries several hundred guns at any time, but during the pandemic, the shop is stock sometimes dropped to as few as 10, co-owner Jacquelyn Clark said. The store is supply of guns has improved, but it is still limiting how much ammunition people can buy.“There is been a massive increase in demand at every level,” Clark said. More Coloradans than ever before bought guns last year and data from the first five months of 2021 show the record pace of purchases continues. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation approved 487,097 gun sales in 2020 — a 45% increase over 2019 and the highest number ever recorded in the state,data collected by the agency shows. More gun sales were approved in 2020 than were recorded in 2000, 2001 and 2002 combined.“The manufacturers could not keep up with the demand,” said Chuck Lawson, a customer service representative at Centennial Gun Club. “It was a number of factors that really changed everything. When COVID hit, people rushed out and bought toilet paper and guns. Then the riots hit, and people bought guns. Then there was the election, which are always good for gun sales.”In the first five months of 2021, CBI approved 205,918 gun sales. If that rate continues, this year is sales will exceed those recorded in 2020. The pre-purchase background checks conducted by CBI and other law enforcement agencies do not necessarily equate to a gun sale, but academics and the firearms industry use the number of checks as a way to keep track of demand and firearm sales trends since there is no centralized database of gun sales and ownership. Monthly data shows background checks spiked 59% month-over-month in March 2020 — the same month Governor Jared Polis declared a state of emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic. The checks dropped slightly in the following months, but remained higher than pre-pandemic averages. Gun sales bumped up and down, but remained largely elevated, during the months following massive racial justice protests in many Colorado communities during the summer of 2020, data shows. Sales ticked back up near their early-pandemic level in January 2021, the month President Joe Biden took office following the riot at the US Capitol that interrupted the certification of the election results. Many of the customers who came to Bristlecone Shooting in the last year were people who never owned a gun before and were looking to purchase something for self-defense, Clark said. People were searching for a way to feel safe as COVID-19 spread across the US and upended normal life, she said.“We had people coming in every day saying, ‘I have never held a gun in my life,'” Lawson said. According to CBI data, about 57% of guns sold in Colorado last year were handguns, which are often peoples’ preferred type of firearm for self-defense. Wait times for CBI to complete the necessary background checks also skyrocketed during the pandemic. In 2019, the average wait time never exceeded 11 minutes, CBI data shows. In 2020, the maximum average wait time was 3 days and 23 hours. Demand for the classes required to obtain a concealed carry permit also skyrocketed, Clark said. Between March and December 2020, sign-ups for the safety classes at Bristlecone Shooting were up about 300% compared to the year prior. That is a good thing, she said, because people are seeking training on how to use guns as safely as possible.“You need to know how to safely operate it and you need to know how to safely store it,” Clark said. The surge in gun purchases in Colorado is part of a national trend, federal data shows. TheNational Instant Criminal Background Check System in 2020processed 39.7 million firearm purchase background checks — the highest annual number ever recorded and a 40% increase from 2019. Like in Colorado, sales started to spike in March 2020. Phillip Levine, a statistics and economics professor at Wellesley College, pointed to an analysis published by the Brookings Institute that found3 million more guns were sold between March and July of 2020than would be expected if previous years’ trends held.“The primary driver of gun sales is uncertainty,” Levine said. “When Americans are uncertain about aspects of their lives, they turn to firearms.”Those uncertainties can take many forms. Gun sales often shoot up if there is talk of enacting new gun regulations and sometimes after mass shootings — but generally only when those tragedies spur calls for more gun control and there seems to be the political will to enact it, he said. Political uncertainty and the election of Democrats also fuel sales. Levine found that the rate of sales in states did not correlate with COVID-19 death rates or increases in unemployment. It is also impossible that 2020 is nationwide surge in firearm purchases was fueled by people in cities where large racial justice protests took place after the murder of George Floyd, he said.“It is not really localized, these responses. People are responding to the national mood,” Levine said. Clark and Lawson both said that sales have started to slow in the last month or two, just as supply chains are improving. The staff at Centennial Gun Club no longer has to spread out merchandise on the shelves to keep them from looking bare. But gun sales remain high. Two decades of CBI data show that Coloradans continue to buy guns at a higher rate than they did at the beginning of the millennium. Colorado is population grew from 4.1 million in 2000 to 5.8 million in 2020 and the per capita rate of gun sales has more than doubled in that time. In 2000, CBI approved 3.3 gun sales per 100 residents. In 2020, that number rose to 8.7 sales per 100 people.",2,2,Denver Post

Afghanistan, which has already suffered through four decades of wars and instability, is facing a humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Monday in his opening remarks to the high-level ministerial conference on Afghanistan. Speaking to the media after the conference in Geneva, Guterres said the UN could not yet determine how much money had been pledged in response to its direct appeal for $606m and how much was promised to support other efforts or neighbouring countries. Al Jazeera is Diplomatic Editor James Bays, reporting from Geneva, said that while the UN chief was “very pleased” with the response of the international community, he had warned the prospect of an economic collapse was a “serious possibility”. Guterres said many Afghans could run out of food by the end of this month, while the World Food Programme (WFP) said 14 million people are on the brink of starvation. The Taliban was previously in power in Afghanistan from 1996 to the US-led invasion of 2001, which ended their hard line government based on a strict interpretation of Islamic law that proscribed almost all public activity for women and girls. It swept back to power last month as the US-led NATO troops withdrew, with little to no resistance from the Western-backed government is forces. But the Taliban is facing a major challenge as it has not been officially recognised by the international community, and Western countries and international financial organisations suspended aid to Afghanistan, depriving it of billions of dollars needed to finance vital food imports. Guterres remarked to journalists on the sidelines that it would be “impossible” to provide humanitarian assistance inside Afghanistan without engaging with the Taliban.“I do believe it is very important to engage with the Taliban at the present moment for all aspects that concern the international community,” he said. Speaking to Al Jazeera in Geneva, UN humanitarian coordinator Martin Griffiths said the UN wanted to make sure the money went directly to humanitarians on the ground who are delivering services to the Afghan people, calling the situation “very dire”. Neighbours China and Pakistan have already offered help. Beijing last week promised$31m worth of food and health suppliesand, on Friday, said it would send a first batch of three million coronavirus vaccines. Pakistan sent supplies such as cooking oil and medicine to authorities in Kabul and called for the unfreezing of Afghanistan is assets.“Past mistakes must not be repeated. The Afghan people must not be abandoned,” said Pakistan Foreign Minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi, whose country would most likely bear the brunt of any exodus of refugees.“Sustained engagement with Afghanistan in meeting its humanitarian needs is essential.”Both China and Russia said the main burden of helping Afghanistan out of crisis should lie with Western countries.“The US and its allies have a greater obligation to extend economic, humanitarian and livelihood assistance,” said Chen Xu, China is UN ambassador in Geneva. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the conference Washington was providing nearly $64m in new humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan.“Let us commit today to meeting this urgent appeal for financial support, commit to standing by humanitarian workers as they do their all-important work, and to stepping up humanitarian action in Afghanistan so we can save the lives of Afghans in need,” she said. Meanwhile, France said it will contribute 100 million euros ($118 million) to the UN is flash appeal.“Half of the (Afghan) population is now at risk, including more than four million women and around 10 million children. It is our responsibility to be at their side in this new ordeal,” Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a high-level ministerial meeting in Geneva on Monday. Even before the Taliban is seizure of Kabul last month, about half the Afghan population – or 18 million people – were dependent on aid. That figure looks set to increase due to drought and shortages of cash and food, UN officials and aid groups have warned. About a third of the $606m being sought would be used by the WFP, which found that 93 percent of the 1,600 Afghans it surveyed in August and September did not have sufficient food, mostly because they could not get access to cash to pay for it.“It is now a race against time and the snow to deliver life-saving assistance to the Afghan people who need it most,” said WFP Deputy Regional Director Anthea Webb.“We are quite literally begging and borrowing to avoid food stocks running out.”The World Health Organization, another UN agency that is part of the appeal, is seeking to shore up hundreds of health facilities at risk of closure after donors backed out. Al Jazeera is Charles Stratford, reporting from Kabul, said the situation at health clinics in the country was “completely shocking”.“We visited a few days ago a rural clinic just outside of Kabul that had a number of women who were expecting to give birth any day. They did not even have rubber gloves. There were no antibiotics, no antiseptics,” he said.“There were people coming in with colds and sore throats and the nurses and doctors could not even give them simple painkillers.”",2,2,Al Jazeera
506,Supreme Court is Interesting New Math: 3-3-3,0.0,40.33,https://www.newser.com/story/307565/supreme-courts-interesting-new-math-3-3-3.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/newser-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-18,24,"When Amy Coney BarrettreplacedRuth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court last year, it resulted in what is usually described as a 6-3 advantage for conservatives over liberals on the court. But two big decisions Thursday—one on ObamaCareand the other on a Catholic group that refuses to work with gay couples—suggest that a different kind of breakdown is happening on the court. Coverage:In an analysis atCNN, Joan Biskupic writes that 3-3-3 seems to be the new pattern. One trio is the ""center-right"" of Chief Justice John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Another trio is made up of liberals Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. And the last is made up of conservatives Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch. In Thursday is rulings, the three liberals joined the center-right (as did Clarence Thomas) in the ruling that dismissed a challenge to ObamaCare. And though the court sided with the Catholic group in the other case, the protection offered was limited, and the decision went nowhere near as far as the more conservative justices wanted. AtPolitico, Josh Gerstein notes that the three more conservative justices, particularly Alito, issued sharply worded critiques seemingly aimed at the other GOP appointees. ""Some liberal legal commentators noted that the most carefully dissected rhetorical sparring is now taking place among members of the new six-justice conservative majority, with the three remaining liberal justices often left as mere spectators,"" Gerstein writes. Alito, for instance, wrote in the Affordable Care Act case that ""no one can fail to be impressed by the lengths to which this Court has been willing to go to defend the ACA against all threats."" And in the other case, which involved a foster care agency in Philadelphia, he complained that the court ""has emitted a wisp of a decision that leaves religious liberty in a confused and vulnerable state."" As South Texas College of Law Professor Josh Blackman puts it to Politico: ""I think Alito was just pissed.""The outcomes of Thursday is cases ""mean the court potentially will close out Justice Amy Coney Barrett is first term with no watershed conservative victories,"" writes Greg Stohr atBloomberg. ""Although the court still has 15 remaining cases, including a clash over the Voting Rights Act, the term is the me so far has been more incrementalism than revolution."" Stohr notes, however, that a truer test might come in the fall, when Roberts has scheduled an abortion case with the potential to dismantle Roe vs Wade. Matt Ford at the digs more into the Philadelphia decision and sums up the narrow outcome: The court ""is still strongly inclined to favor litigants who bring religious freedom claims before it, and has handed down a series of major rulings in their favor in recent years,"" he writes. But ""the justices appear unwilling to rule conclusively that religious beliefs can overcome anti-discrimination laws that protect gay and transgender Americans in all cases—at least for now.""(Did former President Trumpinadvertently save ObamaCare?)",1,1,Newser
507,"Even with a Ceasefire, Israel Must Face a Changed Reality",-1.33,44.67,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/even-with-a-ceasefire-israel-must-face-a-changed-reality,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-21,25,"The cease fire between Hamas and Israel went into effect at 2local time on Friday, and seems to be holding. Israelis woke up to their military claiming to have “achieved all our operational goals.” Many Gazans, in turn, celebrated in the streets through the night—among them Khalil al-Hayya, a leader of Hamas is slate in the now essentially cancelled Palestinian parliamentary elections, whose home in Gaza City was bombed. “This is the euphoria of victory,” he said. Theviolencelasted eleven days, long enough for the Israeli military to give its operation a name, Guardian of the Walls, though its briefings to the media have mainly been about tunnels. Hamas has built a web of the m, many dozens of miles long, under Gaza is cities; the defense establishment commonly refers to the m, with perverse respect, as the Metro. Israel has mapped the m, owing to “very high-quality intelligence”—so the leader of the Southern Command, Eliezer Toledano, told television reporters, last Sunday evening. By Tuesday morning, a military spokesman had claimed that the Air Force had bombed nine launch sites, including some in the tunnels, destroying sixty-five weapons launchers. It even bombed parts not immediately involved in the current action, Toledano added, just to send a message to the Hamas military leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammad Deif—themselves now targets—that the tunnels are a “death trap.” Before the ceasefire, the Israeli military claimed to have destroyed more than a hundred kilometres—sixty-two miles—of the tunnels, which is, notionally, the main goal “achieved.”Some buildings above the tunnels also became death traps. The Jerusalemreports that the military claims to have destroyed buildings containing “10 government offices, 11 internal security targets, and five banks that manage terror funds.” The Gaza Health Ministry reports that at least two hundred and forty Palestinians, including sixty-six children, have been killed; the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports that seventy-five thousand people have been displaced or made homeless. Israeli government spokesmen, in contrast, say that two hundred and twenty-five militants have been killed, including twenty-five senior commanders—numbers that, for obvious reasons, do not quite match up. By midweek, Israel is strategic logic seemed to have been reduced to destroying more tunnels and, collaterally, what was around the m, including vital infrastructure such as the water and power supply; and destroying alleged command centers in multistory buildings—including, now famously, the Gaza headquarters of the Associated Press and Al Jazeera. By Friday morning, more than four thousand rockets had been launched toward Israeli cities, especially Ashkelon, on the coast; many of the rockets got through the Iron Dome anti-missile shield. Thirteen people were killed in Israel, including two Thai workers; among the Israeli victims were an Arab father and his sixteen-year-old daughter, in the city of Lod. The mayhem is Hamas is fault, Israeli officials say, as they often do, because Hamas attacks Israeli civilians and hides behind civilians in Gaza. (TheNetanyahu government is clearly more comfortable briefing diplomats and reporters about rockets and tunnels than about settlers enforcing evictions inSheikh Jarrahand Israeli police officers harassing Palestinians during Ramadan—actions which sparked disturbances the previous week.) The point of Israel is operation seems to have been new entries in a grotesque ledger, shared with Hamas, whose bottom line is “deterrence,” a more strategic-sounding word than “intimidation.” “No question,” Channel 12 is military correspondent, Roni Daniel, said, “the longer this fighting lasts, the more direct hits—this will push the next round further off into the future.” By Thursday, talk of deterrence was superseded by President Joe Biden is demand for de-escalation, and the imminence of a ceasefire. So military analysts began speaking instead of an anticipated final flurry of Hamas rockets, and final Israeli bombing runs, expecting each side to try for,asput it, an “image of victory.” In the end, thankfully, both sides satisfied the mselves with the images that they already had. It is an indication of how stale such tit-for-tat rhetoric has become that a segment by the comedian John Oliver, mocking the phrase, has gone viral, even in Israel. The Israeli military is claims fall especially flat, he said, because Israel has an enormous power advantage—which has yielded the disproportionate number of deaths. (That is true, though of course it does not exonerate Hamas.) Oliver further argued that the Gazan civilians who are paying that price have no collective power over what Hamas does. He might have added that, as many Israelis have suggested, if Gazans did have such power, the Israeli government might have prompted them to exert it by, say, distributing-19 vaccines, or offering to rehabilitate the power station, rather than conducting air strikes. But the military is rhetoric has grown stale in Israel for a quite different reason. This latest escalation has given Israel a glimpse of a widening potential threat thatBenjamin Netanyahuand his military, whatever their specific contingency plans, have not prepared the public for: emboldened defiance, from the West Bank to the Lebanon front, and from the streets of Lod to Washington, DC Palestinian euphoria derives from justified Israeli anxiety. A potential sequence of resulting events seems all too obvious now. The suffering in Gaza might spark protests in the occupied territories including East Jerusalem, or vice versa; Israeli responses to such protests could provoke accelerating violence, much like what happened with the al-Aqsa intifada, which Ariel Sharon provoked, in 2000, and which led to the deaths of three thousand Palestinians and a thousand Israelis. (On Friday afternoon, just hours after the ceasefire, tens of thousands of Palestinians took part in afternoon prayers at al-Aqsa, some waving Palestinian flags; by the end of the afternoon, there were fresh confrontations with Israeli police.) Such violence could cause further unrest in Israel, which, during the past week, has experienced street fighting between its Arab and Jewish citizens. That, in turn, could well incite Palestinians in Jordan, who are ambivalent about the Hashemite monarchy is legitimacy and impatient with its peace treaty with Israel. The chaos would almost certainly mobilize Iranian-backed Hezbollah cadres in Lebanon, who have seen the damage that volleys of rockets can do. Netanyahu, or any right-wing successor, would be hard-pressed to counter such a changed landscape, on multiple fronts, without America is backing. But a growing number of Palestinian supporters in the USs (and particularly in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party) would argue that the Prime Minister and his decade-long Likud dominance in the Knesset brought the catastrophe on the mselves. And they would not be wrong. Hamas drove the Fatah leaders of the Palestinian Authority from Gaza, in 2007. When Netanyahu took office for the second time, two years later, he dissociated himself from the progress that his predecessor Ehud Olmert had made with the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, within the scope of the Oslo peace process. Netanyahu redoubled the government is commitment to settlements and an exclusive claim to Jerusalem, implying that Palestinian sovereignty could be endlessly deferred, and Greater Israel persistently built, as long as the Palestinian leadership was riven. It served Netanyahu is interests to keep Palestine divided; indeed, he instigated the last round of attacks on Hamas in Gaza, in July, 2014, in part to foil the unity agreement that Abbas and Hamas is Ismail Haniyeh had implemented that June. In 2015, the Knesset member Bezalel Smotrich, a settler zealot and Netanyahu ally, put it bluntly: “In the international arena, in the game of delegitimization,” he said, “the Palestinian Authority is a liability, and Hamas is an asset.” The challenge was to keep Hamas both solvent and in check: the former by allowing Qatar to subsidize the organization, the latter by periodically attacking it—like “mowing the lawn,” as some in the military grimly put it. This all now seems desperately outpaced by events. To think that pure force and “very high-quality intelligence” could preserve the status quo is to engage in, well, tunnel vision. The Hamas leadership is staying put in Gaza, in part because Israel has no stomach for a full-scale invasion to remove it. Major General Yitzhak Brick, the former Army ombudsman, warned, in 2018, that the military might not have the ground capability, either, given how much it had invested in technology and airpower. In any case, an invasion would risk a high civilian death toll, just as the air strikes have done. It suddenly seems clear that Hamas can, at will, threaten to heat up Israel is borders and roil its cities by sending another rocket in the direction of Jerusalem. Some asset. In the West Bank, Palestinians currently have no reliable political process by which to give their leaders legitimacy. Recent polls show that increasing numbers of young people are willing to endorse armed struggle. “The real failure here is Abbas is inability to unify and rejuvenate the Palestinian political system,” Sam Bahour, a management consultant and activist in Ramallah, told me. In the lead-up to the most recent violence, Hamas, for its part, had “failed in their governance of Gaza, and their problems were mounting.” It was “poised to be legitimized” by participating in parliamentary and Presidential elections, and when Abbas called off elections that had been scheduled for this month, “the rug was pulled out” from under them. By resorting to violence, Hamas could “remain relevant.” But Abbas is supporters and Fatah-aligned militants are now struggling to remain so as well. Thousands of mainly young people spontaneously demonstrated at Israeli checkpoints. Eleven were killed by security forces last Friday, and hundreds have been injured. Abbas mobilized the Palestinian Authority is security forces to maintain order in the West Bank. What if, next time, he does not?This may all seem far removed from Hezbollah, in Lebanon. But, last Saturday, Haniyeh, who is still the Hamas chairman, made a speech to a crowd in Qatar, depicting Hamas as the defender of Jerusalem. The same day, he was on the phone with Esmail Ghaani, the military head of Iran isQuds Force, on which Hezbollah depends. Hamas rockets, Ghaani reportedly said, are a “unique and successful answer” to Israel. Hezbollah, for its part, is reported to have more than a hundred thousand rockets—and several thousand medium-range and several hundred long-range missiles with guidance systems. Then there is the situation in Israel itself. The violence and destruction in the cities have been widely reported. Hundreds of rioters have been arrested. On Tuesday, Israel is Arab Higher Monitoring Committee, which coördinates Arab civil-society organizations in the country, called a general strike, which was also honored in the West Bank. Mudar Younis, the chairman of the Committee of Arab Local Council Heads, told that more than half of Arab-Israelis participated. The Israel Builders Association said that only a hundred and fifty out of sixty-five thousand Palestinian construction workers went to work. Large parts of the private sector, from retail to tourism, could be paralyzed by actions of this type, and many employers would likely not countenance dependency on Arab employees, exacerbating the polarization. None of this denies that, in Israel is mainly Hebrew-speaking civil society, much of the Arab community is successfully integrated. Arabs make up perhaps a fifth of Israel is population, but, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics, just under a fifth of the country is doctors, a quarter of its nurses, and half of its pharmacists, are Arab. Sixteen per cent of undergraduate college students are Arab; at Haifa University they make up forty per cent. The sixteen-year-old girl killed by a rocket in Lod was a student at the ORT High School, part of the experimental “Tovanot” chain of high schools, funded and ment ored by Israeli Jewish entrepreneurs, organized by the veteran investor Yossi Vardi. For the first time in the country is history, Arab political parties are negotiating for key roles in governing coalitions. And yet Netanyahu is neo-Zionist revanchists, wedded to theocratic forces in the Rabbinate and the Knesset, have been openly pushing Arabs and other non-Jews to the margins. Thenation-state law, framing Israel as the state of the Jewish people alone, and calculated to counter the legal right to equality, has enraged even the Druze community, which serves in the military. The Arab poverty rate in Israel is four times higher than the Jewish poverty rate. A recent study by Nasreen Haddad Haj-Yahya, a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute, and Merav Shaviv, a former research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School, shows that nearly thirty per cent of Israeli-Arab males between nineteen and twenty-four—some thirty thousand young men—are neither in school nor employed. These youth are often implicated in gang warfare, which the Israeli police have done little to address. The spontaneous attacks on Jews in or near Arab towns—including Umm al-Fahm, which protested en masse against police neglect in March—are hard to explain without understanding how youth violence may be channelled into anti-Israel rage. And there are similar militant Jewish youth gangs. An Israeli monitoring group, FakeReporter, has identified some twenty thousand Jewish extremists using social media to organize attacks, and another eighty thousand far-rightists fomenting anti-Arab sentiment on Telegram and WhatsApp. In my neighborhood in Jerusalem, the words “Under Jewish Management” have suddenly appeared on the local hummus shop, presumably to stave off attacks from those gangs. The situation, in short, is fluid, agitated, and reminiscent of the atmosphere after the 1973 war, when, in spite of a putative Israeli victory, the idea that military force was all the foreign policy Israel needed—and that the Palestinian question would wait—was suddenly revealed to Israelis as delusional and arrogant. Before that war, the government spoke not of deterrence but of “security borders,” which neighboring Arab states, it claimed, would not dare attack. They did. Now, as the n, there is a growing sense that Israel cannot come out of this crisis the same country it was when it went into it. On the right, there is more bravado: calls to disarm Gaza, and to suppress Israeli Arabs as a fifth column. On the left, which has found renewed energy, there are calls for reëngagement with the Palestinian question, and, correspondingly, for democratic norms that are vital enough to resist theocracy and to lessen anti-Arab discrimination. All sides are suddenly turning to the Biden Administration, which must realize, despite an understandable desire to stay out of the region, that cannot elide the Palestinian question—that, in fact, as in 1973, the sudden blow to Israeli certainties creates diplomatic opportunities. Netanyahu, whose tenure may well be extended by the violence, is hardly the leader to inaugurate the necessary changes. Yair Lapid, the centrist leader who is still trying to form a government to replace the Prime Minister, has called the escalation before this violence “convenient” for Netanyahu. Biden, in any case, need not wait for either. A ceasefire, and a renewed peace process, may yet advance a Palestinian state and save Israel from the worst. The next round, or the next, will almost certainly invite it.",2,1,The New Yorker

In June, New York City started its Behavioral Health Emergency Assistance Response Division, or B-HEARD, to provide more targeted care for those struggling with mental health issues and emergencies such as suicide attempts, substance misuse and serious mental illness. During the first month of the pilot program, B-HEARD teams — consisting of fire department paramedics and social workers — responded to calls in northern Manhattan, which includes parts of Harlem and receives the city is highest number of mental health emergency calls. From June 6 to July 7, B-HEARD received roughly 16 mental health calls each day in this zone. In 95% of cases, people accepted care from the B-HEARD team, data from the city shows. That is compared with 82% for traditional 911 response teams, which include police. Additionally, 50% of people treated by B-HEARD were transported to the hospital for more care, a far lower number than the 82% who are transported to the hospital with traditional 911 response. The city said that 911 operators routed 138 mental health emergency calls — 25% of the number of calls during the pilot period — to B-HEARD and expect that number to grow to 50% in the coming months.""This is great news.

In his announcement, Biden also signaled his desire to have a less combative relationship with the White House press corps (perhaps easier said than done), one that would be in contrast to the highly toxic relationship during the Trump years, which began with Sean Spicerlying about the size of Trump is inauguration crowd and is ending with McEnany refusing to answer a question from a CNN reporter by saying, “I do not call on activists.” (That reporter, Kaitlan Collins,respondedby saying, “I am not an activist and you have not taken questions since October 1…. That is not doing your job. Your taxpayer-funded job.”).“Communicating directly and truthfully to the American people is one of the most important duties of a president, and this team will be entrusted with the tremendous responsibility of connecting the American people to the White House,” Biden said in his statement. McEnany lashed out at the on social media on Sunday, criticizing the paper, which first broke the story, for calling the new appointments the first all-female White House communications team, saying that President Trump, Vice President Pence, and First Lady Melania Trump also have senior female press aides. “The completely DISCREDITED @washingtonpost once again reveals their blinding propagandist Fake News proclivities,” shewrote, with a link to thePostarticle. But, as the pointed out, “Unlike the team that Biden has chosen, Trump is communications staff includes spokesmen who are regularly quoted, including Judd Deere, the White House deputy press secretary, and Brian Morgenstern, the White House deputy communications director.

513,"Early Voting Begins in the Georgia Runoffs Today, With Control of the US Senate at Stake",-9.33,45.0,https://www.vogue.com/article/ossoff-warnock-early-voting-georgia-senate-runoffs,https://adfontesmedia.com/vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-14,23,"Today, as Georgians begin early voting in two races that will determine which party controls the US Senate for the next six years, Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock are taking to the road, spreading the message that their opponents are unfit to hold office. Ossoff and Warnock, both of whom are trying to unseat incumbent Republicans, have been conducting a largely joint campaign that mixes in-person and virtual events (the latter featuring guest appearances by such notable figures ast he comedian Leslie Jonesand former president Barack Obama) as they try to win a state that has not elected a Democratic senator since 1996. But history—and the changing demographics of Georgia—may be in their favor: Joe Biden won the state in the presidential election, the first Democrat to do so since Bill Clinton in 1992. (President-elect Biden will join the two candidates at a campaign rally in the Atlanta metro area on Tuesday.)And the two senators they are facing, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler—Perdue seeking his second term, Loeffler her first full one—may well be vulnerable. Both have faced scrutiny over questionable stock transactions that may have benefited from inside information the two received at Senate briefings. It is an idea that both Ossoff and Warnock have leaned into on the campaign trail—bestowing on Loeffler and Perdue the catchy nickname “the Bonnie and Clyde of Political Corruption”—and one that Ossoff has been particularly enthusiastic about in his messaging, mostly on his very active Twitter account:This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. Ossoff went for the jugular in his first debate, held before the November 3 election, as he attacked a visibility uncomfortable Perdue for failing to aggressively respond to the health and financial crises that Georgians have suffered because of the coronavirus. “Perhaps Senator Perdue would have been able to respond properly to the COVID-19 pandemic if you had not been fending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading,”Ossoff said. “It is not just that you are a crook, Senator. It is that you are attacking the health of the people that you represent. You did say COVID-19 was no deadlier than the flu. You did say there would be no significant up tick in cases. All the while, you were looking after your own assets and your own portfolio.”That exchange might have been the reason Perdue skipped the runoff debate on December 6, leading to the slightly surreal scene of Ossoffconfronting an empty podium across the stage. At the debate, Ossoff called Perdue a “coward” and slammed him for not showing up. “It shows an astonishing arrogance and sense of entitlement for Georgia is senior US senator to believe he should not have to debate at a moment like this in our history,” Ossoff said, gesturing toward the empty podium. “Your senator is refusing to answer questions and debate his opponent because he believes he should not have to. He believes this Senate seat belongs to him. This Senate seat belongs to the people.” (On that same day, Warnock and Loeffler held their own debate, an exchange mostly notable for the number of times that Loefflerrefused to acknowledge that Joe Biden was the president-elect.). Ossoff also hammered away at Perdue in his Instagram Live conversation with Leslie Jones, telling her that his opponent “has been treating his Senate office like an E-Trade account.”Democratic PACs, including one associated with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are pouring millions of dollars into this race, investing in commercials and campaign literature that stress the the me that Perdue and Loeffler are ethically compromised. “We plan to fully expose their unethical and potentially illegal behavior in the weeks ahead,” JB Poersch, president of Senate Majority PAC,recently told Politico. “Georgians simply ca not trust David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler when they are knee-deep in the swamp and profiting at their expense.”If Ossoff and Warnock win, the Senate will be split 50-50, with Vice President–elect Kamala Harris having the power to cast the deciding vote. If Perdue and Loeffler win, the Republicans will hold a slim 52-48 majority, made even more precarious by the possibility that one or more senators will be struck by COVID in the coming months, rendering them unavailable for floor votes. (At least ahalf-dozen Republican senator shave already tested positive for the coronavirus in the past few months, including Loeffler herself.)One wild card in the race is Donald Trump. When the president is not pursuing yet another hopeless challenge to the presidential election, he is attacking Georgia is elected officials, including the governor and secretary of state (both Republicans, by the way), for helping Joe Biden is campaign “steal” the race. At a campaign rally in Valdosta, Georgia, nominally held to help get out the vote for Perdue and Loeffler—both of whom Trump casually called up on stage and the n ushered off a few minutes later—Trump spent most of the hour and a half bemoaning his loss.“They cheated and rigged our presidential election, but we will still win,” Trump told a crowd of about 10,000 supporters, many of whom chanted, “Stop the steal!” And he renewed his attacks on Governor Brian Kemp, who had run as a Trump-faithful candidate just two years ago. “Your governor could stop it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing,” the president said. Some Republicans fear that Trump is relentless attacks on the voting system could depress voter turnout between now and January 5. “You ca not say the system is rigged but elect these two senators,” Eric Johnson, a campaign adviser to Kelly Loeffler and a former Republican leader of the Georgia Senate,recently told the. “At some point he either drops it or he says I want everybody to vote and get their friends to vote so that the margins are so large that they ca not steal it.”Today, as part of his Health, Jobs, and Justice Bus Tour, Ossoff will lead a march to the polls in the town of Duluth and later attend an outdoor campaign event in Atlanta alongside Reverend Warnock. If the Democrats are to win, turnout is key, particularly in counties like Fulton and Gwinnett, in the greater Atlanta area, which we rekey to Biden is razor-thin victory in the state. That surge of newly Democratic votes is largely attributable to the efforts of Stacey Abrams, who, after narrowly losing the 2018 governor is race to Kemp, has spent the last two years focusing on ballot access and voter registration, particularly in the Black community. Abrams has built a network of organizations, includingNew Georgia ProjectandFair Fight, that highlighted past voter suppression in the state and have helped register an estimated 800,000 new voters in Georgia. There was a strong turnout of early voters on a rainy Monday morning, withCNN reporting that in Marietta, part of the key Democratic stronghold of suburban Atlanta, lines of voters began forming before sunrise and “people wrapped the mselves in blankets, carried umbrellas, and huddled under lawn chairs.”After speaking to a crowd of labor union canvassers on Friday,Warnock said early turnout would be key to the race:“It is how we won in the general and it is how we are going to win in the runoff.”",2,1,Vogue

Ryan made his remarks during a Thursday evening address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. He was critical of both Republicans and Democrats, though he saved his sharpest barbs for Trump, who is by most measures the leader of the modern-day Republican Party.“It was horrifying to see a presidency come to such a dishonorable and disgraceful end,” Ryan said, referring to the deadly attack on the US Capitol that Trump inspired on January 6.“Once again, we conservatives find ourselves at a crossroads,” Ryan continued. “And here is the reality that we have to face: If the conservative cause depends on the populist appeal of one personality, or on second-rate imitations, the n we are not going anywhere. Voters looking for Republican leaders want to see independence and mettle. They will not be impressed by the sight of yes-men and flatterers flocking to Mar-a-Lago.”It is unclear how much impact Ryan is words will have in the broader fight for the future of the GOP, if any. Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, was among the most respected Republicans in the nation is capital before Trump is rise, but two years out of office, his open contempt for Trump is not in line with the vast majority of Republican voters and elected officials. A tiny but growing group of anti-Trump Republicans has struggled to steer the party in a new direction, even as Trump continues to promote the same false claims — that he would have won the 2020 election if not for mass voter fraud — that inspired the Capitol insurrection. At the same time, Trump is openly contemplating another presidential run in 2024. One of Trump is most vocal allies on Capitol Hill, Representative Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., lashed out at Ryan on Twitter ahead of the speech.“It really is amazing that Paul Ryan, who is the reason the GOP lost the House in 2018, is going to come out today and blame Trump for the problems in the GOP,” she said, adding a shot at another Trump critic, Representative Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. “Paul, the problem is you and your pal Liz.”Ryan spoke Thursday as the opening speaker for the Reagan library is “Time for Choosing” series, which will later feature 2024 Republican presidential prospects such as former Vice President Mike Pence, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Those close to Ryan, 51, do not expect him to run for public office again, but they suggest he is paying close attention and remains concerned about the future of the party.

He lamented the GOP is interest in culture wars and “identity politics” at the expense of conservative principles.“Culture matters, absolutely yes, but our party must be defined by more than a tussle over the latest grievance or perceived slight,” he said. “We must not let them take priority over solutions — grounded in principle — to improve people is lives.”The Republican Party has an opportunity to win elections and address critical policy challenges, as long as they do not get in their own way, Ryan continued.“If we fail this test, it will be because the progressive left will have won by default,” he said. “It will be because the conservative cause ... lost its way and followed the left into the trap of identity politics, defining itself by resentments instead of by ideals. It will be because we mistake reactionary skirmishes in the culture wars with a coherent agenda. It will be because we gave too much allegiance to one passing political figure and were not loyal enough to our principles.”By STEVE PEOPLES, AP National Political Writer",2,2,Tampa Bay Times

518,"TikTok banned: 6 ways the app is countering US scrutiny, Trump is ban threat",-5.0,43.67,https://fortune.com/2020/07/22/tiktok-us-ban-counter/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,25,"The Trump administration is considering banning TikTok, the wildly popular short video platform, over national security concerns and TikTok is alleged vulnerability to Chinese government censorship and data sharing. TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based tech firm ByteDance Ltd. and has 30 million monthly active users in the US, has denied US claims about its susceptibility to Chinese government influence. But President Donald Trump is targeting of the app has only increased since he mentioned a potential ban earlier this month; new Trump campaign ads on Facebookthis week claimed, “TikTok is spying on you.”TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment for this story. Growing political scrutiny of TikTok in 2019 had already prompted the app to increase transparency, distance itself from ByteDance, and deny claims that it shares user data with Beijing or complies with its censorship requests. Scrutiny of the app has only accelerated in recent weeks with India is TikTok ban in late June and the US is subsequent threat of a ban. TikTok no doubt has become aflashpointfor the West is disputes with China. In response, the app has taken six actions that seem aimed at underscoring its commitment to the US and proving its operational independence from its Chinese parent—and from China is government:At the start of 2020, TikTok had 500 full-time staff in the US; that number has since increased to 1,400. On Tuesday, TikToksaidit plans to hire 10,000 employees for “good-paying jobs” in the US over the next three years, a long-term commitment to the market that could foster good will in Washington. TikTok has offices in New York City, Silicon Valley, and Los Angeles. A sharp increase in staff is not the only way TikTok is expanding its US presence. The company has hired more than35 lobbyists to advocate on its behalf in Washington to persuade lawmakers that it is committed to US regulations and not beholden to the Chinese government. TikTok had no lobbying presence in Washington a year ago,according to theTikTok has made other signals of commitment to the US market. In March, the company sai dit was setting up a “transparency center” in its Los Angeles office to “provide outside experts an opportunity to directly view how our teams at TikTok go about the day-to-day challenging, but critically important, work of moderating content on the platform.”Even before the threat of a US ban, the company came under fire for allegedly censoring content deemed politically sensitive to the Chinese government, a charge TikTok denies. TikTok blocked and the n unblocked one US user who posted a video criticizing China is government for its treatment of Uighur ethnic minority people. The company said a “human moderation error” caused the removal of the video. TikTok has made moves to localize its US business and show the international market that it is separate from its China-based parent company. In May it hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, who is American, to run TikTok. (Mayer holds dual roles as TikTok is CEO and ByteDance is chief operating officer.) TikTok has pointed to Mayer is US roots when asked about the Chinese government data-sharing allegations.“TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders across safety, security, product, and public policy in the US,” a company spokespersontoldCNBC in July. TikTok also taken cues from US-based Internet giants in responding to political issues related to Beijing. After the Chinese government enacted a controversial national security law in Hong Kong,Google,Facebook,Twitter, and others announced they were halting some operations in the region while they reviewed the law, which grants Hong Kong authorities far-reaching power over Internet data. TikTok went further,announcingon July 6 that “in light of recent events,” it was withdrawing from Hong Kong entirely. The company did not directly name the national security law, but analysts say the decision to pull out of Hong Kong was a direct response to the law and an effort by TikTok to illustrate its distance from Beijing and willingness to take issue with Chinese government data controls. Some US-based ByteDance investors are in talks with ByteDance management to buy a majority stake in TikTok, The Informationreportedon Tuesday. Such a sale would make TikTok majority-owned by US shareholders rather than by Beijing-based ByteDance, and potentially could convince US lawmakers that a ban of TikTok is not necessary. Larry Kudlow, a White House economic adviser,said last week that a TikTok spinoff from ByteDance would be better than a ban on the popular app.“I think TikTok is going to pull out of the holding company, which is China-run, and operate as an independent American company,” Kudlowsaid,declining to comment on whether US companies could acquire TikTok. Even before the Trump administration publicly leveled the threat of the TikTok ban, the app was looking beyond the US market and its tens of millions of American users. In November, when US lawmakers escalated their scrutiny of TikTok, ByteDance founder and CEO Zhang Yimingsaidin an internal staff note that the company needed to “diversify TikTok is growth,” “increase investment in weaker markets,” and improve its skill in “handling global public affairs,” without specifically mentioning US pressure. The number of countries where TikTok is facing pressure has grown this year. Outside of the US, TikTok was banned in India last month, and some politicians have called for bans in Australia and the UK TikTok has been mulling a global HQoutside of Chinasince late last year to distance itself from its Chinese owner, and it is reportedly stillconsideringLondon—its existing hub in Europe—as a base. The ongoing UK-China feud, which saw the UK recently ban Chinese tele coms equipment maker Huawei from its 5G rollout, had cast doubt on whether TikTok would continue its UK expansion plans.“It is very clear that ByteDance [is] trying to do as much as [it] can to make TikTok a separate company that operates globally, thinks globally, and does not think and act like a Chinese company,” Dev Lewis, a fellow at Hong Kong–based research think tank Digital Asia Hub, told earlier this month. Whether its efforts succeed remains to be seen since, as Lewis said, “TikTok will always be caught in the middle” of China is geopolitical disputes.",1,2,Fortune

This has a double meaning: The death of faith, per se, in America. And the death of “faith in America.”You could say the death of religion and we still have religion, but do we still have faith?I will talk about the differences between faith and religion, glimpses of God in things we see and do. I will talk about how Christianity seems to be dying while Islam is growing. I will discuss the crucifixion and what Christ means if you are not a Christian. I will talk about my early days, my travels to the South Pacific islands collecting medicinal plants, and how they had a deeper meaning than I may have known at the time. I discussed spirituality with the indigenous peoples of the South Pacific islands. All good religions teach “Do unto others, as you would have them do unto you.” There is not a religion on earth that does not teach that except one. The Jewish religion is the hardest to follow because it is complicated. I will discuss the meaning of the garden of Eden, and the land of nod. And I will tell you how religion and faith connects you to the power of the universe. Let me begin with this. We now have churches in America, let is call them the “United churches of the woke.”A friend of mine wrote and said, ""Michael, churches will not be destroyed or repurposed under the new communism as they were in Russia. Rather, communism is the new religion and the churches, their indoctrination facilities, are woke.""""The new Bible interpretation is really communist indoctrination. The plague spreads. It is a full on attack on every institution,"" the friend added. ""And we ask what is next? Evil knows no limits.""What began with Karl Marx and the Unitarian church is now infecting traditional churches as well. You have to go back to the schizophrenia of Christianity itself, faith versus good works, which is an ambiguity that goes all the way back to the disciples and early councils. Faith is about personal belief and a relationship with Jesus: confession and salvation. Good works is about living your life as the man Jesus supposedly did. Christianity was almost entirely faith-based for many centuries, but in the 20th century the faith interpretation took a beating from science. Darwin bashed creationism. Freud bashed religion as an illusion based on childish impulses. And the n totalitarian regimes used science as leverage to gain control. As you know, Marx called faith “the opiate of the masses” and right now communists are burning churches, especially in Canada. In the 20th century, faith became unfashionable among Western intelligentsia. There were notable exceptions, such Albert Einstein, but even the Catholics got in on it with Vatican II It was intended to update the church; they killed the Latin liturgy. And now the current Pope — whom I call “the bouncer” — is lecturing us on immigration and climate change. If you can believe this? A Pope lecturing us on immigration and climate change!At the middle of the 20th Century there was the advent of secular humanism, which filled the gap left behind by the death of faith. Remember the famous saying “Is God dead?”And the n along came the thoroughly secular Unitarian church, the main front organization for secular humanism. ""Atheists with children.""Their tenets contain not even a hint of faith. Here they are from the Unitarian Universalist website:“The inherent worth and dignity of every person.”“Justice equity and compassion and human relations.”“Acceptance of one another and encouragement to spiritual growth in our congregations.”“A free and responsible search for truth and meaning.”“The right of conscience, the use of the democratic process within our congregations & society at large.”“A world community with peace, Liberty, and justice for all.”“Respect for the independent web of all existence in which we are all a part.”And the n of course the tenet that drives it all is that poor people are good, and rich people are bad. This flows directly from the good works interpretation of Christianity. Jesus supposedly said to his disciples “Truly. I tell you, it is hard for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again, I tell you that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God.

520,"Violence in the Capitol, Dangers in the Aftermath",-1.33,43.67,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/violence-in-the-capitol-dangers-in-67f,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-07,16,"after the 9/11 attack, Americans were largely united in emotional horror at what had been done to their country as well as in their willingness to endorse repression and violence in response. As a result, there was little room to raise concerns about the possible excesses or dangers of the American reaction, let alone to dissent from what political leaders were proposing in the name of vengeance and security. The psychological trauma from the carnage and the wreckage at the country is most cherished symbols swamped rational faculties and thus rendered futile any attempts tourge restraint or caution. Nonetheless, a few tried. Scorn and sometimes worse were universally heaped upon them. On September 14 — while bodies were still buried under burning rubble in downtown Manhattan — Congresswoman Barbara Leecast a lone vote against the Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF). “Some of us must urge the use of restraint,” she said seventy-two hours after the attack, adding: “our country is in a state of mourning” and thus “some of us must say: let is step back for a moment, let is pause just for a minute, and think through the implications of our actions today so that this does not spiral out of control.”For simply urging caution and casting a single “no” vote against war, Lee is Congressional office was deluged with threats of violence. Armed security was deployed to protect her, largely as a result of media attacks suggesting that she was anti-American and sympathetic to terrorists. Yet twenty years later — with US troops still fighting in Afghanistan under that same AUMF, with Iraq destroyed, ISIS spawned, and US civil liberties and privacy rights permanently crippled — her solitary admonitions look far more like courage, prescience and wisdom than sedition or a desire to downplay the threat of Al Qaeda. Others also raised similar questions and issued similar warnings. On the left, people like Susan Sontag and Noam Chomsky, and on the right people such as Ron Paul and Pat Buchanan — in different ways and at different times — urged US politicians and Americans generally to resist unleashing an orgy of domestic assaults on civil liberties, foreign invasions, and an endless war posture. They warned that such a cycle, once initiated, would be very difficult to control, even more difficult to reverse, and virtually guaranteed to provoke even greater violence. ShareThese few who dissented from the instant consensus were, like Congresswoman Lee, widely vilified. Both Sontag and Chomsky werebrandedanti-American Fifth Columnists, while David Frum,writing in, denounced Buchanan and others questioning the excesses of the War on Terror from the right as “Unpatriotic Conservatives”: no different, proclaimed the neocon, than “Noam Chomsky, Ted Rall, Gore Vidal, Alexander Cockburn, and other anti-Americans of the far Left.”In retrospect, it is hard to deny that those who defied, or at least questioned, the potent 2001 emotional consensus by urging deliberation in lieu of reactionary rage were vindicated by subsequent events: the two-decade expansion of the war in Afghanistan to multiple countries, the enactment of the Patriot Act, the secret implementation of mass surveillance systems, the trillions of dollars of taxpayer wealth transferred to weapons manufacturers, and the para militarization of the domestic security state. At the very least, basic rationality requires an acknowledgement that when political passions and rage-driven emotions find their most intense expression, calls for reflection and caution can only be valuable even if ultimately rejected.of the Capitol by a Trump-supporting mob has certainly generated intense political passion and pervasive rage. It is not hard to understand why: the introduction of physical force into political protest is always lamentable, usually dangerous, and, except in the rarest of circumstances that are plainly inapplicable here, unjustifiable. It was foreseeable that an action of this type would result in deaths. The most surprising outcome is that “only” four people died: an unarmed woman, a Trump supporter and Air Force veteran, who was shot in the neck by a law enforcement officer, and three other protesters who died from unspecified “medical emergencies” (one reportedly died due to accidentally ta sering himself, inducing a heart attack). The US Capitol remains a potent and cherished symbol even for Americans who are deeply cynical about the ruling class and political system. Its nobility is something continually engrained deep into our collective psyche since childhood, and that meaning endures even when our rational faculties reject it. It is the refore not hard to understand why watching a marauding band of hooligans invade and deface both the House and the Senate, without any identifiable objective other than venting grievances, reflexively engenders a patriotic disgust across the political spectrum. It is unhinged to the point of being obscene to compare yesterday is incursion to the 9/11 attack or (as Senator Chuck Schumerdid last night) to Pearl Harbor. By every metric, the magnitude and destructiveness of those two events are in an entirely different universe. But that does not mean there are no applicable lessons to be drawn from those prior attacks. One is that striking at cherished national symbols — the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, the Capitol — ensures rage and terror far beyond body counts or other concrete harms. That is one major reason that yesterday is event received far more attention and commentary, and will likely produce far greater consequences, than much deadlier incidents, such as the still-motive-unknown2017 Las Vegas mass shooting that killed 59 or the 2016 Orlando shooting that left 49 dead at the Pulse nightclub. Unlike even horrific indiscriminate shooting sprees, an attack on a symbol of national power will be perceived as an attack on the state or even the society itself. There are other, more important historical lessons to draw not only from the 9/11 attack but subsequent terrorism on US soil. One is the importance of resisting the coercive framework that demands everyone choose one of two extremes: that the incident is either (a) insignificant or even justifiable, or (b) is an earth-shattering, radically transformative event that demands radical, transformative state responses. This reductive, binary framework is anti-intellectual and dangerous. One can condemn a particular act while resisting the attempt to inflate the dangers it poses. One can acknowledge the very real existence of a threat while also warning of the harms, often far greater, from proposed solutions. One can reject maximalist, inflammatory rhetoric about an attack (a War of Civilizations, an attempted coup, an insurrection, sedition) without being fairly accused of indifference toward or sympathy for the attackers. Indeed, the primary focus of the first decade of my journalism was the US War on Terror — in particular, the relentless erosions of civil liberties and the endless militarization of American society in the name of waging it. To make the case that those trends should be opposed, I frequently argued that the threat posed by Islamic radicalism to US citizens was being deliberately exaggerated, inflated and melodramatized. I argued that not because I believed the threat was nonexistent or trivial: I lived in New York City on 9/11 and remember to this day the excruciating horror from the smell and smoke emanating throughout Lower Manhattan and the haunting “missing” posters appended by desperate families, unwilling to accept the obvious reality of their loved ones’ deaths, to every lamp post on every street corner. I shared the same disgust and sadness as most other Americans from the Pulse massacre, the subway bombings in London and Madrid, the workplace mass shooting in San Bernardino. My insistence that we look at the other side of the ledger — the costs and dangers not only from such attacks but also the “solutions” implemented in the name of stopping them — did not come from indifference towards those deaths or a naive views of those responsible for them. It was instead driven by my simultaneous recognition of the dangers from rights-eroding, authoritarian reactions imposed by the state, particularly in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event. One need not engage in denial ism or minimization of a threat to rationally resist fear-driven fanaticism — as Barbara Lee so eloquently insisted on September 14, 2001. Human memories are usually short and the dominance of social media has abridged them even further. Many have forgotten that the Clinton administration seized on the 1995 courthouse bombing in Oklahoma City to radically expand law enforcement powers and escalate its demands for full-scale backdoor access to all encrypted internet communications. The fear necessary to justify such draconian measures was fueled by incessant media hyping of weekend citizen militias in places like Idaho and Montana said to be plotting armed insurrection against the federal government. One of the first major War on Terror attacks on core Constitutional rights which Iwrote about was Newt Gingrich is2006 speech suggesting that the First Amendment is free speech guarantee to fight terrorism should be “modified”. The former House Speaker approvingly citedaarticleby former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy — entitled “Free Speech for Terrorists?” — insisting that some ideas are so dangerous, especially in the era of terrorism and the internet, that the First Amendment must be limited to permit greater censorship powers:With an enemy committed to terrorism, the advocacy of terrorism—the threats, the words—are not mere dogma, or even calls to “action.” They are the mselves weapons—weapons of incitement and intimidation, often as effective in achieving their ends as would be firearms and explosives brandished openly. . . . Do we so lack confidence (except in the sacrosanct status of speech itself) that we are unable to say with assurance that some things are truly evil, and that advocating them not only fails to serve any socially desirable purpose but guarantees more evil? Must our historical deference to opinion, however noxious, defer as well to a call to arms against innocents, or a call to destroy a form of representative government that religious and political freedom? May we not even ban and criminalize the advocacy of militant Islam and its métier, which is the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians? . . . In America is bumptious, bounteous marketplace, there are no limits on words as the building blocks of ideas, or on ideas as the legitimate instruments of persuasion. Terror has no place in such discourse. It is the function of law to express our society is judgments. Ours should be simple and humane: words that kill are not words we need abide. As a free speech advocate and civil libertarian, I was naturally repelled by this notion that some political ideas could be deemed so dangerous by the state that they can be legally suppressed. In response, Iasked rhetorically in 2006: “Are the reAmerican values at all in which Bush followers and neo cons actually believe -- any constitutional principles that are sacrosanct and whose violations they would oppose if undertaken in the name of fighting The Terrorists?” I concluded: “It certainly does not appear so.”Beyond raising alarms about civil liberties erosions, I also often insisted that the underlying causes of terrorism aimed at the US should be considered if for no other reason than to understand how to address it without destroying core liberties for Americans. While religious fanaticism may sometimes be the cause, far more often, I argued, such attacks were motivated by rage over the killing of innocent people, including children, by the US Government is bombs, drones and tanks in Muslim-majority countries. Right-wing advocates often demonized such arguments as pro-terrorist or as “justifying” terrorist attacks, but the left largely supported the inquiry into motivating causes, just as they have long supported the attempts to understand what motivates violent crime, on the ground that misguided actions are often driven by valid or at least widely shared redressible grievances. But the view that we should attempt to identify the core motives of terrorist acts or violent crime, rather than just label them evil and vow to destroy their perpetrators, was largely deemed taboo in mainstream discourse.now as every War on Terror rhetorical tactic to justify civil liberties erosions is now being invoked in the name of combatting Trumpism, including the aggressive exploitation of the emotions triggered by yesterday is events at the Capitol to accelerate their implementation and demonize dissent over the quickly formed consensus. The same framework used to assault civil liberties in the name of foreign terrorism is now being seamlessly applied — often by those who spent the last two decades objecting to it — to the threat posed by “domestic white supremacist terrorists,” the term preferred by liberal elites, especially after yesterday, for Trump supporters generally. In so many ways, yesterday was the liberals’ 9/11, as even the most sensible commentators among them are resorting to the most unhinged rhetoric available. Within hours of the Capitol being cleared, we heard truly radical proposals from numerous members of Congress. Senators and House members who objected to Electoral College certification, or questioned its legitimacy, should be formally accused of sedition and expelled from the Houseif not prosecuted, argued Representative Cori Bush (D-MO), with other House members expressing support. Even those unarmed protesters who peacefully entered the Capitol should, many argued, be hunted by the FBI as domestic terrorists. Calls proliferated for the banning of the social media accounts of instigators and protest participants. Journalists and politicians cheered the decision by Facebook and Twitter to temporarily bar the President from using their service, and the n cheered again when Facebook is CEO Mark Zuckerbergannounced on Tuesdaythat the ban on Trump extended through Biden is inauguration. Some journalists, such as is Oliver Darcy,complainedthat Facebook had not gone far enough, that more mass censorship was needed of right-wing voices. The once-radical 2006 Gingrich argument — that some opinions are too dangerous to allow to be expressed because they are pro-terrorist and insurrectionary — is now thriving, close to a consensus. These calls for censorship, online and official, are grounded in the long-discredited, oft-rejected and dangerous view that a person should be held legally accountable not only for their own illegal actions but also for: meaning the actions others take when they hear inflammatory rhetoric. That was the distorted mentality used by the State of Mississippi in the 1970s to try to hold NAACP leaders liable for the violent acts of their followers against boycott violators after hearing rousing pro-boycott speeches from NAACP leaders, only for the Supreme Court in 1982 to unanimously reject such efforts on the ground that ""while the State legitimately may impose damages for the consequences of violent conduct, it may not award compensation for the consequences of nonviolent, protected activity,"" adding that even ""advocacy of the use of force or violence does not remove speech from the protection of the first amendment.""The complete reversal in mentality from just a few months ago is dizzying. Those who spent the summer demanding the police be de funded are furious that the police response at the Capitol was insufficiently robust, violent and aggressive. Those who urged the abolition of prisons are demanding Trump supporters be imprisoned for years. Those who, under the banner of “anti-fascism,” demanded the firing of a top editor for publishing an op-ed by Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) advocating the deployment of the US military to quell riots — a view deemed not just wrong but unspeakable in decent society — are today furious that the National Guard was not deployed at the Capitol to quash pro-Trump supporters. Antifa advocates are working to expose the names of Capitol protesters to empower the FBI to arrest them on terrorism charges. And while Representative Cori Bush is proposal to unseat members of Congress for their subversive views went mega-viral, many forget that in 1966, the Georgia State Legislature refused to seat Julian Bondafter he refused to repudiate his anti-war work with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, the n considered a domestic terrorist group. Those who argued in the summer that property damage is meaningless or even noble are treating smashed windows and looted podiums at the Capitol as treason, as a coup. One need not dismiss the lamentable actions of yesterday to simultaneously reject efforts to apply terms that are plainly inapplicable:. There was zero chance that the few hundred people who breached the Capitol could overthrow the US Government — the most powerful, armed and militarized entity in the world — nor did they try. Perhaps many view it as more upsetting to see august members of Congress hiding in fear of a riot than to watch ordinary small-business owners weep as their multi-generational store burns to the ground. Undoubtedly, national reporters who spend much time in the Capitol and who have long-time friendships with Senators and House members are more horrified, far more so, by violent gangs in the Capitol rotunda than on the streets of Portland or Kenosha. But that does not mean that rational restraint is unnecessary when searching for sober language to accurately describe these events. There is a huge difference between, on the one hand, thousands of people shooting their way into the Capitol after a long-planned, coordinated plot with the goal of seizing permanent power, and, on the other, an impulsive and grievance-driven crowd more or less waltzing into the Capitol as the result of strength in numbers and the n leaving a few hours later. That the only person shot was a protester killed by an armed agent of the state by itself makes clear how irresponsible these terms are. There are more adjectives besides “fascist treason” and “harmless protest,” enormous space between those two poles. One should not be forced to choose between the two. It has long been clear that, in the post-Trump era, media outlets looking to keep viewers hooked, and government officials looking to increase their power, will do everything possible to center and inflate the threat posed by right-wing factions. I have said this more times than I can count over the last year at least. Like all inflated threats, this one has a kernel of truth. As is true of every faction, there are right-wing activists filled with rage and who are willing to engage in violence. Some of them are dangerous (just as some Muslims in the post-9/11 era, and some Antifa nihilists, were and are genuinely violent and dangerous). But as was true of the Cold War and the War on Terror and so many other crisis-spurred reactions, the other side of the ledger — the draconian state powers clearly being planned and urged and prepared in the name of stopping them — carries its own extremely formidable dangers. Refusing to consider those dangers for fear of standing accused of downplaying the threat is the most common tactic authoritarian advocates of state power use. Less than twenty-four hours after the Capitol breach, one sees this tactic being wielded with great flamboyance and potency, and it is sure to continue long after January 20.",1,1,Glenn Greenwald

Hodge, who lives in Atlanta, lost her job in the service industry because of the coronavirus pandemic. And, like so many others, she is also facing eviction at the end of the month should Congress allow a federal eviction moratorium to expire December 31. One report says anywhere from 30 million to 40 million American renters could be evicted from rental housing by the end of 2020. No state will be untouched, the report warns, and people of color are especially vulnerable. Hodge worries about herself and about her 9-year-old granddaughter, whom she is raising.""I also do not have anywhere to go because places are so high and I do not have much income,"" Garnell told CNN In Houston, Texas, although 29-year-old mom Kenia Madrigal eventually found a home with the charitable help of others, she stared down real fear earlier this year as she tucked her four children in for the evening in a small SUV that had become the family is home. For a time, her mind had swirled with questions: How could she possibly keep her kids safe from the coronavirus, which hurtled them into crisis when she lost first her job and the n the mobile home she had been renting for two years? How could she keep them safe from unseen dangers the nighttime brings? How could she shield them from the emotional wounds homelessness inflicts?""You have to go day by day,"" Madrigal said. ""You never know what the next night will bring, or the next day.""A day after the nation recorded yet another record number of COVID-19 deaths, a second coronavirus vaccine received emergency approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. The decision paves the way for the vaccine to help fight a pandemic that is now killed nearly 314,000 Americans. The emergency authorization of Moderna is vaccine comes just a week after the US Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to a similar vaccine by drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech. Prior to the FDA is decision, Gen. Gustave Perna, who oversees Operation Warp Speed and the federal effort to distribute vaccines, said the government was preparing to ship almost 6 million doses of the Moderna vaccine to 3,285 locations in the week following approval. To show trust in the vaccine is safety, Vice President Mike Pence on Friday received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on live television. In doing so, Pence became the highest-ranking US official to receive the vaccine. During the broadcast, Pence celebrated the milestone as ""a medical miracle"" that could eventually contain the raging pandemic. Second lady Karen Pence and Surgeon General Jerome Adams also received shots during the White House event in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Later in the day, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also received the first doses. Meanwhile, Congress on Friday pushed off a decision on a new coronavirus relief package by passing a two-day stop-gap funding bill, averting a government shutdown and buying itself two more days to negotiate final terms of the $900 billion aid package. Since the measure is looped into a $1.4 trillion government spending bill, Congress originally had until midnight Friday to approve the bill and avoid a government shutdown. If approved, the proposed aid could deliver additional ""paycheck protection"" subsidies to businesses, an additional $300 per week to the unemployed, and stimulus payments to most Americans, likely in the amount of $600. As the federal government continues negotiations, California has turned into the new epicenter of the crisis in the USs. The state reported more than 50,000 new cases on two separate days this week, a surge that is already overwhelming hospitals — statewide, California reported3 percent availability of ICU bed son Thursday.""I have seen more deaths in the last nine months in my ICU than I have in my entire 20-year career,"" Amy Arlund, a nurse at Kaiser Permanente Fresno Medical Center, told the AP In many California counties, intensive care unit capacity is at less than 1 percent, and morgue space is also running out. New York, the original epicenter of the virus, broke its own record Thursday for most positive tests reported on a single day, Governor Andrew Cuomo said Friday. The number, 12,697, exceeded the previous high of 11,571 on April 14, when about one-ninth as many tests were being conducted. The total number of coronavirus cases in the USs to pped 17 million on Thursday, just five days after the country surpassed 16 million. India is the only country that has more than half the number of cases reported in the US At least 2,878 new coronavirus deaths and 242,838 new daily cases were reported in the USs on Friday, according to aWashington Post database. Over the past seven days, the USs has averaged more than 219,300 cases each day. As of Saturday, 48 states and Puerto Rico remained above the positive testing rate recommended by theWorld Health Organizationto safely reopen. To safely reopen, the WHO recommends states remain at 5 percent or lower for at least 14 days. Currently, only Hawaii, Vermont and Washington, DC are under that threshold.

522,Orange deputy said trainer threatened him. The agency is probe led to his own firing,0.0,48.33,https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/orange-county/os-ne-orange-deputy-terminated-untruthful-flawed-case-20201102-r7qrlclogvf7hokdhd2fojltae-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/orlando-sentinel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-02,22,"During one of his first weeks as a provisional Orange County deputy sheriff, Jacob Stewart said his field training officer became angry and threatened to kill him — pulling out a gun and a knife, before threatening to use his bare hands and “bury him in the woods.”But when the Sheriff is Office began investigating the incident 18 months later, Stewart said he quickly went from being treated as a potential victim of aggravated assault, to the target of an internal investigation into whether changes in his testimony amounted to lies. That probe led to his firing from the agency for being untruthful, after OCSO investigators said he initially claimed Deputy First Class Keith Mobley pointed the gun and knife at him, but conceded in a follow-up interview that he did not see the Mobley point the weapons at him. Stewart — who has now twice appealed his firing without success — says the investigations that led to his termination were biased against him, that he felt coerced to change his story and that the probes violated his rights as a crime victim and officer under investigation. The truthfulness violation also landed him on the Orange-Osceola State Attorney is OfficeBrady list, which tracks officers with credibility issues. He said his inclusion is unwarranted.“Nothing I said about it is untrue, and that is what disheartens me the most,” Stewart, 24, told the Orlando Sentinel. “I wanted to be as open and honest. … I have been brutalized during this entire process.”Stewart and attorneys for the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 93, which represents OCSO deputies, said the yare now considering filing a lawsuit, having exhausted internal reviews. Michelle Guido, an OCSO spokeswoman, said the agency affords officers accused of wrongdoing “all elements of” the state is Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights. Stewart says the incident occurred in June 2018, during one of his first weeks of in-the-field training. He was driving when he missed an update on his laptop about a call to which he and Mobley were responding, angering Mobley. From the passenger seat, Mobley grabbed the steering wheel while the vehicle was moving, forcing Stewart to pull over, the OCSO investigative report said. Stewart said he the n heard the “distinct sound” of Mobley is agency-issued firearm being removed from its holster, and in his peripheral view saw Mobley holding the gun “pointed directly at [him],” the report said. Mobley re-holstered it, but continued to threaten Stewart, this time with a knife, Stewart said. Mobley the n threatened to kill him with his bare hands and bury his body, Stewart said. Mobley told investigators he remembered getting upset and possibly yelling or cursing at Stewart, which he said was in response to an insubordinate comment by the new deputy. But he denied ever threatening to kill him or pointing any weapons at him, describing the incident asa training “misunderstanding.”There was no video evidence and only Stewart and Mobley were in the vehicle. Stewart reported to a supervisor that he was threatened by Mobley, and soon after requested a new field training officer, but the OCSO probe was not opened until about 18 months later. It began after a colleague who Stewart had told about the incident reported it to the Professional Standards Division. After talking to Stewart, investigators interviewed six deputies and Stewart is wife, who he’d told about what happened. All said Stewart had described being threatened by Mobley, though some said they thought Mobley only threatened to beat him up. Two recounted the full scenario Stewart had described to investigators. One said he’d heard Stewart was threatened only with a knife, but had learned from Mobley that was not the case. Investigators the n spoke again to Stewart “to clarify discrepancies in his initial testimony,” the report said. After officials pressed Stewart on whether he embellished any part of his testimony, he conceded that he did not see the gun pointed at him or know for sure if it had been. Under Florida law, an assault charge requires only that person made a credible threat “by word or act to do violence” to another, and an assault is considered aggravated when any deadly weapon is involved. There is no distinction made for whether the weapon was pointed. Stewart attributes his uncertainty to the difficulty of trying to relay a traumatic incident months after the fact. He also feels he was coerced into changing the story.“To me it was clear I was going to be held in that room… until they got what they wanted,” Stewart said at his appeal hearing Monday. But OCSO investigators determined the coercion claim was “not reasonable” because he was a deputy with two years of experience. Though Stewart is appeals were rejected, a captain tasked with reviewing his first appeal found the investigations were biased, as Stewart claimed, and the findings should have been overturned. Capt. Susan Wallis noted investigators asked another deputy if Stewart may have “embellished” the incident, before that word had come up in interviews with Stewart. She also felt investigators were “accusatory and argumentative” with Stewart, while Mobley is interviews were “cordial, calm, polite and professional.”Wallis also found investigators did not press Mobley on questionable training practices he described using, like “frightening verbal commands” and changing his voice tone and speed to “intentionally induce stress.”Without adequate explanation, Mobley is admission that he used those methods “gives validity” to Stewart is claim of having felt threatened, Wallis wrote. Investigators also interviewed 16 deputies who were trained in recent years by Mobley. None said he ever pointed a gun or weapon at the m, but three mentioned they had concerning interactions with him. One said he would “randomly start to yell,” almost causing her to crash her car, while two others said Mobley mentioned that if the deputies got into a physical fight, Mobley would watch until they were near death before helping,the report said. Wallis said she was also concerned by the lack of separation between the two investigations: the criminal probe into whether Mobley had threatened Stewart and the administrative probe to determine if Stewart had lied. Both were conducted by the professional standards division, as is OCSO is procedure, but assigned to different investigators. Wallis said Stewart was not quickly enough granted the rights that officers are afforded when they are under investigation. But Sheriff John Mina is administration — which has the final say in all disciplinary decisions — overruled Wallis’ findings. At Monday is hearing, three OCSO officials voted to uphold the investigation and his termination. Stewart said he still wants to return to being a deputy, because it is always been his goal to serve the community. Other than the incident with Mobley, he said he enjoyed working for OCSO and even encouraged his wife to join the civilian staff.“That is how highly I thought of it, I brought my family in,” Stewart said. “The Stewart name is still helping the citizens of Orange County. I take pride in that.”gtoohey@orlandosentinel.com",2,2,Orlando Sentinel

New York state has launched its own version. But the Florida governor isorderclaimed “requiring so-called Covid-19 vaccine passports for taking part in everyday life – such as attending a sporting event, patronizing a restaurant or going to a movie the ater – would create two classes of citizens”. The order says the prohibition is the refore “necessary to protect the fundamental rights and privacies of Floridians and the free flow of commerce within the state”. It also says “noFloridagovernment entity” or its officials “shall be permitted to issue vaccine passports, vaccine passes, or other standardized documentation for the purpose of certifying an individual is Covid-19 vaccination status to a third party, or otherwise publish or share and individual is Covid-19 vaccination record or similar health information.”Despite the order is line about protecting the “free flow of commerce”, DeSantis is order also says business are “prohibited from requiring patrons or customers to provide any documentation certifying Covid-19 vaccination or post-transmission recovery to gain access to, entry upon, or service from the business”. Vaccine passports have become the latest flash point in increasingly politicized battles over coronavirus policy. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a controversial far-right Georgia Republican, has said vaccine passports are Joe Biden is “mark of the beast”, the Hillreported. She has also introduce da bill to ban such passports and fire Dr Anthony Fauci, Biden is chief medical adviser. In the mainstream of the Republican party, DeSantis has emerged in many eyes ast he heir to Donald Trump is throne, should the former president not run again in 2024. Many observers and proponents of vaccine passports have pointed out that some countries already require documentation of yellow fever vaccination for entry. Upon getting a yellow fever vaccine, for example, recipients receive a yellow card called the “International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP)”. The controversy surrounding vaccine passports comes amid a burgeoning fourth wave of Covid-19. While public health officials have repeatedly pleaded with state and local officials to maintain mask mandates and social distancing regulations, states are increasingly loosening restrictions.

The migrants freely entered illegally by wading across the Rio Grande while facing little opposition. Texas law enforcement authorities patrolled the riverbanks rounding up those that crossed but still could not hold back Friday is traffic. Breitbart Texas spoke to one group of migrants from Ecuador on Friday as they waited alongside a roadway for Border Patrol agents to arrive. In the group of eight migrants were several infants carried by their mothers as they withstood the midday heat. The group says they spent several months traveling to the USs and that they have exhausted all their funds. They were happy to finally see the Border Patrol agent arriving a short time later.

Biden said July 2. ""As we get prepared to celebrate Independence Day, to day is job news brought us something else to celebrate: This morning we learned that, in June, our economy created 850,000 jobs.""Biden went on to say, ""We have now created over 3 million jobs since I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history, thanks to the incredible work of the entire team.""Presidents’ claims about job creation on their watch can be troublesome. So how did Biden do?Biden was right on the numbers, we found, but he glossed over some important context. Theofficial government data shows that between January 2021, when Biden took office, and June, the number of employed Americans rose from 142.7 million to 145.8 million, or a gain of just over 3 million. In numerical terms, that is a bigger gain in jobs than for the equivalent period under every post-World War II president who first came to office in an election. (This comparison leaves out Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford, each of whom initially assumed the office without being elected.)The closest competitor to Biden was Jimmy Carter, with a gain of 1.8 million jobs. Biden is claim leaves out at least four important bits of context. A fairer metric for comparison is the number of jobs gained divided by the starting level of jobs when the president took office. By this metric, Biden scores well, but he is not Number 1. That distinction goes to Carter, who oversaw job gains of 2.2%, compared with Biden is 2.1%. Put another way, if the gains from June can be replicated each month, it would take until February 2022 for all pre-pandemic jobs to be recovered (setting aside subsequent increases in population). Given the severity of the pandemic recession, that would be a significant bounceback — but it has not happened yet. Most other presidents — aside from Barack Obama, who took office during a spiraling economic downturn — have entered the White House amid a growing economy. But the precise timing of their inauguration can play a big role in how a president is first few months go, so Biden is comparison to his predecessors is not really apples-to-apples. That said, experts say that Biden does deserve some credit for the job gains on his watch, given the gains in coronavirus vaccinations and the passage of his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which provided coronavirus aid and economic relief. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Biden said, ""We have now created over 3 million jobs since I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history.""Biden is right on the numbers and on how they compare with his recent predecessors in the Oval Office. However, this talking point glosses over the reality that the US economy remains almost 6.8 million jobs under its pre-pandemic peak. Meanwhile, comparing presidents as Biden did is highly sensitive to the economic conditions around the time of their inauguration; Biden entered office during a deep recession, but he took over on the upswing, a situation that not all presidents have benefited from.

526,Americans From Both Parties Want Weed To Be Legal. Why Does not The Federal Government Agree?,-0.33,48.67,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marijuana-legalization-is-super-popular-why-hasnt-it-happened-nationally/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-23,25,"Tuesday marked the international holiday for marijuana— and consumers of the plant had lots to celebrate this year. New York,VirginiaandNew Mexicoall passed legislation in 2021 legalizing marijuana,1bringing the total number of states wherere creational consumption is legal up to 17, along with Washington, DC At the federal level, the House of Representativespassed a bill this week which allows banks to conduct business with cannabis-related companies in states where marijuana has been legalized,with the support of about half of the chamber is Republicans and almost all of its Democrats; the bill now awaits its fate in the Senate.passed the House in 2019but was not brought to a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate. But even if Biden may not be ready to pivot on marijuana legalization just yet (decriminalization, not legalization for recreational use, was part of his campaign platform), the polling on the issue has been loud and clear: People want weed to be legal. Gallup has asked Americans about whether they support legalizing marijuana since 1969, when only 12 percent of Americans supported the idea. As of their most recent poll last November, that number has ticked up to 68 percent, the highest level of support on record. And perhaps unsurprisingly, the number of states where recreational marijuana is now legal has also steadily increased since the Obama administration announced in 2013 that it would not block state laws that legalized the drug, provided that marijuana was strongly regulated. And if recent polling in states where marijuana is not yet legal for recreational use is any indication, it is possible that even more states will change course. Although, as the chart above shows, legislators have often been slow to legalize marijuana for recreational use: Thirteen of the 18 states where marijuana is legal have done it via voter-driven ballot initiatives rather than legislation. That said, legalization is broadly popular even in more Republican-leaning states like Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina and Texas. Polls of support for legalizing marijuana in states where recreational use is not yet legalIncludes both polls that ask specifically about recreational use as well as polls that ask about legalizing marijuana for any purpose. Does not include polls that only asked about legalizing marijuana for medical use. Source: PollsMarijuana legalization may appeal to voters in both very blue and red states, in part, because it is an issue with bipartisan support. According to a recent poll from thePew Research Center, 72 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Republicans supported marijuana legalization for medical and recreational use. Further, Pew found that exceedingly few adults of any age were “opposed to the legalization of marijuana,” though it did find that older Americans were less likely than younger Americans to be in favor of legalization. Only 27 percent of Republicans 65 and older supported legalization, the lowest level of support among any group Pew surveyed. But just because legalization is broadly popular does not mean we should expect federal legislation on the issue soon. For starters,not all Senate Democratsback Schumer is plan, and Senate Republicanshave yet to show any support for legalization. Additionally, while legalizing marijuana is popular, itis not a top priority for many voters. That may be, in part, due to the success of legalization efforts at the state level. More than one in three Americanslive in states where marijuana is already legal for recreational use, and a sizable majority live in states where marijuana is legal for medical use. For those who already have access to the drug, it may not matter whether it is their state government or the federal government making that allowance. Finally, as my colleague Perry Bacon Jr. pointed out earlier this year,electoral politics are increasingly disconnected from policy, meaning that despite the popularity of marijuana legalization, there may simply not be a to n of electoral benefit for Biden for taking up the issue. Still, if the polling is any indication, legalizing marijuana is hugely popular, and Biden may yet change his mind, depending on how the politics of the bill play out. And if he does, he may even get some brownie points from Republican voters who support legalization. But if things start to get politically messy, Biden may not have a lot to lose by passing on championing this particular issue. According to FiveThirtyEight is presidential approval tracker,453.3 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 40.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of +13 points). At this time last week, 52.8 percent of Americans approved of Biden, while 40.8 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of +12 points). One month ago, 55.1 percent of Americans approved of Biden, compared to 39.1 percent who disapproved.",2,1,FiveThirtyEight
527,"Say Her Name: On Average, Police Kill One Black Woman A Month",-14.67,46.67,https://therealnews.com/stories/say-her-name-police-brutality-kill-black-women,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-news-network-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-24,23,"Historically, Black women like Fannie Lou Hamer, Atatiana Jefferson, Breonna Taylor, Korryn Gaines, and Eleanor Bumpers, who were killed or brutalized by police officers, receive less community outrage and media coverage than their male counterparts. Eddie Conway: Welcome to The Real News. I am Eddie Conway, your host coming to you from Baltimore. We have been witnessing worldwide protests, strikes, demonstrations, destruction of monuments. When you look in the crowds you see men, women, children, white, black, brown, yellow, red, etc. And you hear more often than not a lot of names being shouted, or posters being bannered with Eric Garner is name. Trayvon Martin is name, Tyrone West is name, Mike Brown. And of course we know all of this started with the killing of George Floyd. But what is missing in this whole scenario, and not getting a lot of publicity is the name of women. Now of course we are Breonna Taylor is name, because that is an incident that is closely associated with this whole thing. And some of us are aware of Sandra Bland, some of us are aware of other names of other women. But in looking back at our history, of course we could go back all the way to slavery, but in looking back in our history, we can see names like Fannie Lou Hamer is, being beaten by police, that affected her for the rest of her life. We see a case that I looked at in particular, was a case in Tyler, Texas in which an 84 year old … 82 year old grandmother was sleeping in her bed, police mistaking her house for a place to raid raided her house, charged upstairs and shot her six times in her bed. And walked away from the whole thing. The Grand Jury in Tyler, Texas found that it was an accident, the black community was outraged, they decided to do jury nullification. They in turn decided that they was not going to convict any black person that did not do harm to the black community. And that was in ’92.:So young women, as young as seven, has been murdered in their beds by police. And women as old as 92 has been murdered in their houses by police. And so I wonder why we do not hear more voices in these protests about the women that has been murdered by police. This is not a black male thing, this is a people of color thing at this present time. So joining me today totalk about this a little bit is Dominique Conway, who is also my wife, writer, activist, organizer, educator. Also joining me is Professor Talitha LeFlouria. Thanks for joining me, Dominique and Talitha. Talitha LeFlour…: Thank you for having me. Dominique Conwa…: Thank you for having me. Eddie Conway: Okay, my first question goes to you, Talitha. Over the years it seems that the police have killed one black woman a month. On average, which means sometimes there was two and the n sometimes there might have been a month and a week passed by. But, why do not we hear black women is name? Why is this disparity between what the protestors are shouting out and what is really happening in our lives?Talitha LeFlour…: Thank you, Eddie, that is a … a wonderful question. And a question that I have thought a lot about. Because as we know, the silence is deafening, right? And the level of outrage that we see shown toward the killing of black men and boys is just not shown when it comes to black women and girls. And I thought really hard and very long about this, and I ca not say that I have the answer, but one thing that I will say is that I believe that the numbers game has something to do with this. The fact that black women are killed in seemingly negligible numbers when compared with black men. So those staggering statistics that you shared, if one black woman is killed a month, the n that means probably 10 black men are killed a month, right?And so unfortunately people minimize the murder of black women and girls, because their numbers do not compare with black men. But when you compare those numbers with the white women who are not being killed by the police, the n that changes things. That helps us to see this in a different light, right? And so I am not one who supports of promotes comparative suffering, and I believe that we need to move away from this narrative that somehow well, the numbers of black men that are being murdered are so much more, that we have to address that issue first, and the n we can get to the black men. No, all black lives need to matter equally, including the lives of black women. And Kimberle Crenshaw recently said something that was so eloquent, and I want to share it because I think that it applies to what I am saying now. She said that if your story does not exist within a movement, that story is not entirely for you. And so we have to lift up the stories of black women and girls, and we have to convey the message to the rest of the world that all black lives matter. Because if we do not do it, if we show indifference toward the killing of black women and girls as a result of vigilante violence and state sanctioned anti-black violence, the n if the black community does not show outrage, the n why should the rest of the world show outrage?Eddie Conway: Okay, Dominique, the same question, why you think this silence around the death of black women at the hands of vigilantes, of police correctional officers, because a lot of black women are also killed in prisons. Dominique?Dominique Conwa…: Yeah, I pretty much agree with what Talitha has said. I also do think it is a difficult question because there are so many complexities. I think history, the devaluation of black women and the black female body, the black body in general, but particularly the black female body lends easily to that. So I think it is very complex. I feel that white supremacy has set up a system in which there is a hierarchy. And even sometimes within struggles we reinforce that hierarchy, and I think we have to undo our thinking about how we view people within our own groups. And so I think that that is part of the difficulty of really answering the question. And I also do not want to get into reinforcing a hierarchy and saying that well, it is more important that we view the deaths of black women versus black men. No, we need to look at all of this because it is not just black men, it is not just black women, it is our children, too. We are pretty much all in the scopes of the rifle, and I think we need to view this as a war. And war takes everybody out. Eddie Conway: Well Talitha, and I heard you say that it is our story, we need to raise these stories up. What is the role of black men in this, and what is the role of black women? Because I see black women out there on the line also, talking about Trayvon Martin, and supporting protests around Eric Garner. And most of the time, and to be quite honest, most of the movements that I have witnessed throughout history and studied throughout history are actually led by women, and they are actually supported and pushed forward by women. And women has, from the time we got on the boats apparently, has been protesting, fighting, pushing, and in fact keeping us alive to fight the next day. But whose responsibility for bringing our story, the story of black women is deaths also, whose responsibility is that?Talitha LeFlour…: In response to your question, Eddie, about whose responsibility is, I think that it is our collective responsibility to lift up the stories of black women and girls who have been killed by the police, or who have died at the hands of vigilantes. As Dominique said, white supremacist violence is indiscriminate. And so … but one of the things that I want to say is that as you mentioned black women have been doing a lot of this work. Black women have essentially been carrying the labor, they are the ones who are showing up at the protests and who are committed to the defense of black women. So when black men show up, even though unfortunately black men have not shown up at the same level that black women have, when black men show up for black women in these spaces and for black girls, what it says is that our lives are worthy of protection. That our lives are worthy of saving. As Dominique mentioned before, historically black women have not been afforded the same protections as white women. Black women and girls, their lives have not been seen as worthy of the same protection. The dehumanization that slavery … the types of dehumanization that black women and girls and black people experienced during slavery, I think is part of the reason why we see this complete disregard for black life, and it is part of the reason why black people can be killed with impunity. It is because slavery set that precedent that our lives did not matter. And so when a black woman is killed, or harmed, or injured, or when a black man is killed, or harmed, or injured, we are all hurt. Eddie Conway: Okay, Dominique, I have heard you say thousands of times that black men has a certain responsibility to speak up to other black men around this issue. Talk a little bit about that protest of Black Lives Matter activist, a young lady that reported a rape and after a rally she disappeared. Could you talk a little bit about the safe space, or the lack of safe space, and what is the role of men in all of this?Dominique Conwa…: Yeah, I feel like I do not know enough about her particular situation to really speak to it. I have gleaned a few bits of information. So I do not want to like go into that because I do not … I just do not feel comfortable speaking about her situation not knowing enough about it. But I think in general … I mean, as a black woman it is very difficult to feel safe in the belly of the beast. History has told me enough to know that I am not safe, my children are not safe. When I have grandchildren, they will probably be … not be safe until this whole paradigm here is changed. But I do feel that it is not just necessary for men to kind of take responsibility and acknowledge the deaths of these women as well, I feel like men need to be conscious of how they take up space when it comes to speaking to these issues a lot of times. My experience here in Baltimore and what I saw in 2015 was men taking up a lot of the talking space. But out on the streets I saw mothers, I saw grandmothers, I saw little girls. But when you looked at the interviews, what was reflected back very often were men who were not necessarily doing the organizing. And so I feel like brothers need to be conscious about taking up that space. Just like we tell white folks they need to be conscious about taking up our space, we need to look at who is really being afforded ample room within our spaces. Eddie Conway: Okay, and I [inaudible 00:14:06] one of the questions I was going to ask, and I realize that it is probably not necessarily a valid question, considering that a lot of these cases that I have looked at of black women being killed, has happened in the spaces in their houses. They have been in their bedrooms, they have been in their living rooms, they have been away from videos and so on. So the video footage is not the re, but I am wondering about the 17 year old young lady that video ed George Floyd is case, now I understand she is receiving death threats, and she is got to be hidden and protected. What should we be doing about stuff like that? Talitha, do you have any opinion on that?Talitha LeFlour…: Wow, that is a tough question to answer. I believe that we all have to obviously rally behind her, and support her, and support anybody who is a victim of white racial terror, even if it does not result in death. Our community is being tremendously impacted, our public health … I mean, excuse me, our mental health is being affected. Racism is a public health issue. It is a public health crisis. And so we as a community need to get around her and support her and lift her up, but we also need to hold the people who like, for example, people who provide mental health services, and social services, hold our local governments, our state governments, and any entity that could provide these kinds of resources in lieu of hiring additional police officers. Part of the de funding of the police could involve channeling more resources into public health. Yeah, public health and mental health services for people in our community, including that young woman who I understand now is extremely agoraphobic and ca not even leave her house at this point because she is afraid that she is going to lose her life or that she is going to be bullied or terrorized. People kill the mselves when they are harassed and when they are terrorized in this way. So I just pray for her mental health and that she will be able to get the kind of healing and the attention that she deserves on an individual level, but we as a community need to also champion around her and other people who are brave enough to film these murders, and who are brave enough to speak out against these atrocities. I think about Ida B Wells. That young woman is the Ida B Wells of our generation. She documented that horror, she documented that lynching, right? And so we have to get behind our brothers and sisters who are willing to document and put everything on the line, including their lives and their safety on the line to document these lynchings. Eddie Conway: Dominique, and I guess this is like the final question, I would like for you to give us an idea of what should happen. I mean, we talk about de funding the police, some people talk about disbanding the police. Is that the real problem, or is the problem deeper than that, or what you think should happen to kind of like … the outcome of all this worldwide protests?Dominique Conwa…: One, I do feel that it is necessary to abolish police forces, but also I see the police as simply being the armed wing of a government that is at war with us and has been at best indifferent to our suffering, but a lot worse than indifferent. When you consider black Wall Street, and consider what happened in Tulsa, when you consider the attacks upon people of African descent, our communities as well as what is done to indigenous communities in this land. So I think yeah, it is very necessary to abolish the police, but I think we also need to begin to determine … we need to determine our own destinies, and I hope that does not sound too cliché at this point, but it is true. And part of that is determining who is going to really protect the communities. I feel like if we were in that kind of position, there would not be no question about protection for this young woman. As you all were talking about that situation I am thinking we need a Deacons for Defense, we need some folks that is going to stand outside that house armed and assuring her safety. Or whatever she feels would assure her safety, because that might not be it for her. And so it is a matter of giving voice to everybody in the community to determine what their destiny is going to be, and what makes them feel comfortable. So I think that it is very hard for me to say what needs to come out of this, because so much needs to come out of this, it is been 500 years, okay? I think we have enough time for me to even go through the long list of things. But I think more important is that this is a young person is game at this point. It is their future, they need to be able to determine how they are going to live that future, how they are going into that future, and if there even is going to be a future. Eddie Conway: Okay, Talitha, you get the final word. Do you have any final comment to share with our audience?Talitha LeFlour…: So I just want to first of all thank you, Dominique, for your final word, and I agree with you wholeheartedly. I want to say that it is critical and it is paramount that we say the names of black women and girls. That we do not perpetuate or continue to perpetuate the invisibility that black women and girls face when it comes to these issues around police violence, and police brutality, and police terror. Black women and girls should not be a footnote, they should be at the center of these stories, at the center of our public discourse around police violence and anti-black violence. And it is our responsibility to make sure that all black lives matter. So whenever we can, we need to lift up the voices and the stories of black women, and join activists, local activists, nationally recognized activists who have really large platforms to speak out on these issues, including the African American Policy Forum. I would encourage you to contribute to and to support the Say Her Name movement. And to plug into the work that Kimberle Crenshaw and the African American Policy Forum and people who are committed to this work, and amplifying these stories all over the country are doing. And so that would be my final word. Eddie Conway: All right, thank you. There is a rally to day, in fact, to support Say Her Name. So thank you for joining me Talitha and Dominique. Talitha LeFlour…: Thank you. Dominique Conwa…: Thank you. Eddie Conway: Okay, and thank you for joining this episode of The Real News. ",2,1,Real News Network
528,Covid got California Governor Newsom into this recall mess. He is banking it will get him out.,-5.67,43.0,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/covid-got-california-gov-newsom-recall-mess-he-s-banking-n1277314,https://adfontesmedia.com/nbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-11,25,"WASHINGTON — Covid-19 restrictions got Gavin Newsom into this mess. Now he is counting on them to get him out of it. Amid a contentious national debate over masks and vaccines, California is embattled Democratic governor is betting his political life on turning next month is recall election into a referendum on some of the nation is strictest mandates.""What is at stake in the Sept. 14 recall? It is a matter of life and death,” the narrator ofNewsom is latest television adstates, arguing the top Republican candidate “peddled deadly conspiracy the ories and would eliminate vaccine mandates on day one.”Recent polls show a dead heat among likely voters on whether to fire Newsom, despite the state is overwhelmingly Democratic tilt. It is starting to show with some nervousness by Newsom. Vice President Kamala Harris, who won statewide in California three times, will campaign with Newsom next week, and President Joe Biden may visit soon, too. While overall support for recalling Newsom has remained steady around 35 percent — about what former President Donald Trump earned in California last year — Republicans are far more motivated to turn out. Democrats, on the other hand, overwhelmingly assume Newsom will win and are telling pollsters that means they are less likely to bother.""The big question,"" according to Eric Schickler, a pollster at the University of California, Berkeley, is whether Newsom and his allies ""are able to get Democratic voters more engaged.""Newsom this month made California the first state in the nation to require all K-12 teachers to be fully vaccinated or submit to mandatory weekly testing and has implemented new masking requirements on school buses and in classrooms. The governor also was the first to require health care worker sand state employees to be vaccinated or submit to weekly testing.“I have no interest in taking us off the Covid cliff,”Newsom told a Bay Area TV station, alluding to states like Florida and Texas, where Republican governors have tried to prohibit local schools from implementing vaccine and mask mandates.""Just consider the Republican candidates,"" he added. ""Not only do they all share one thing in common — their support for [former President Donald] Trump — but they also support eliminating mask mandates in our public schools, eliminating vaccine verifications.""It is an ironic turn of events for a governor whose job might not be in jeopardy had there not been a pandemic. The petition to recall Newsom, while not mentioning Covid-19,gained traction in the backlash to the first wave of lock downs and mask mandates Newsom implemented last year. Organizers were only able to collect the 1.5 million-plus signatures needed to trigger the recall election after a judge extended the deadline by four months, citing the pandemic is impact on canvassing. And Newsom is lowest political moment came when he defied his own restrictions and was caught dining inside without a mask at one of the nation is ritziest restaurants, The French Laundry, which further fueled the recall effort. In a state where Republicans are outnumbered 3 to 1, some recall proponents have tried to broaden their appeal by focusing on less polarized issues like homelessness, the rising cost of living, power blackouts, crime, water shortages and wildfires.“One of the challenges with these recall elections is people get grumpy and they start to feel like they can cast votes out of grumpiness,” said David Atkins, one of California is Democratic National Committee members. “What is happening with Covid is it makes the stakes clear. It makes it harder for Republicans to tap into that generalized grumpiness.”The governor and his allies are hoping to jolt awake Democrats and independents who have tuned out the race by warning them the re is a real chance California could end up with a Republican governor. The quirk of the recall ballot is that if a majority of voters who show up on election day say yes to recalling Newsom, it practically guarantees a Republican governor.""They actually could do it if Democrats do not show up, so it is time to ring the alarm bells and let them know what is at stake,"" said Dan Newman, a top political adviser to Newsom. ""There are just two very very different paths on how to end the pandemic.""Newman called the race a ""binary choice"" between Newsom and Larry Elder, a Black conservative talk radio host who is the clear polling leader among challengers. Elder is an appealing foil for Newsom in a Democratic-leaning state. The longtime radio host, who helped former Trump adviserStephen Millerget his start in politics, has a long history of provocative comments about everything from working women to the minimum wage(he believes it should be $0). A recent spat of negative stories about Elder has made Republicans think Newsom is worried about him gaining polling strength and is trying to push opposition research. Elder said he'd repeal Newsom is mask and vaccine mandates before breakfast on his first day in the governorship. While there are 46 candidates of various parties vying to replace Newsom, every leading Republican opposes mandates. Several say they favor a statewide ban on local mask and vaccine mandates, like Florida is.“We must draw the line and protect people is freedoms,” said John Cox, who was the GOP gubernatorial nominee in the last general election and is running again. Vaccine and mask opponents are a vocal minority, large enough to form the nucleus of the recall, but polls show most Californians favor an approach to the pandemic more like Newsom is. California has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country, and 59 percent of respondents to a recentCBS News/YouGov polls aid people who refuse to get vaccinated are “putting people like me and my family at risk.” Just 27 percent said they respect the decision to not get the shot. Still, as Biden and other Democratslearned last year, turning out and even reaching voters during the pandemic is harder for Democrats, since their base takes the issue more seriously.“We are so Covid-sensitive, our voters are so Covid-sensitive,” said Michael Trujillo, a Los Angeles-based Democratic strategist, “but Republican volunteers are happily going knocking on doors and voters are happily opening their doors.”Democrats say they have had a harder time recruiting canvassers, with most volunteers preferring to make phone calls or send text messages, which have been shown to be less effective. Of particular concern is Latino voters, with a recentEmerson College/Nexstar poll showing a majority of likely Latino voters support firing Newsom, due in part to Republican Latinos being more engaged. Newsom has focused on campaigning in heavily Latino areas like East Los Angeles in recent days and is rolling out endorsements from prominent Hispanic figures like comedianGeorge Lopez.

529,Kentucky AG Admits Homicide Charges Were Never Presented Shortly After Agreeing to Release Breonna Taylor Grand Jury Recordings,-7.33,48.0,https://atlantablackstar.com/2020/09/29/kentucky-ag-admits-homicide-charges-were-never-presented-shortly-after-agreeing-to-release-breonna-taylor-grand-jury-recordings,https://adfontesmedia.com/atlanta-black-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-29,15,"On the same day Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron agreed to release grand jury recording for theBreonna Taylorcase after an anonymous grand juror filed a motion in court, he quietly dropped a bombshell: he never recommended a homicide charge to the grand jurors to consider against the Louisville Metro Police Department policemen involved in Taylor is slaying. Cameron agreed to release the recordings on Monday, hours after the grand juror requested all recordings and transcripts from the proceedings be released so “the truth may prevail,” as reported by The Louisville Courier Journal.“The full story and absolute truth of how this matter was handled from beginning to end is now an issue of great public interest and has become a large part of the discussion of public trust throughout the country,” wrote Kevin Glogower, a lawyer representing the juror, wrote in court documents. The juror, who wishes to remain anonymous, also wants jurors to be allowed to give up their confidentiality so they can speak freely about the proceedings. The request includes any talk about “any potential charges and defendants presented or not presented.”Cameron, likely anticipating that the grand jury proceedings would reveal which charges were not recommended, said in a statement about the grand jury recordings emailed to news outlets on Monday that homicide charges against the three LMPD officers were never on the table.“Our prosecutors presented all of the evidence, even though the evidence supported that Sergeant Mattingly and Detective Cosgrove were justified in their use of force after having been fired upon by Kenneth Walker,” Cameronstated, referring to Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, two other officers who participated in the shooting. Neither of them were charged.“For that reason, the only charge recommended was wanton endangerment.”In last week is news conference announcing the outcome of the grand jury proceeding, Cameron never mentioned whether that body was presented with homicide charges to consider. In Kentucky, like in many other states, a prosecutor does not have to wait for a grand jury indictment to bring charges against a defendant, nor is a prosecutor precluded from presenting charges to a second or subsequent grand juries if the initial one fails to indict on charges presented. The grand juror is motion accused Cameron of using the grand jury “as a shield to deflect accountability and responsibility for those decisions” which planted “more seeds of doubt in the process.”The motion added that Cameron has tried to lay the grand jury is decision solely “at the feet of the grand jury while failing to answer specific questions regarding the charges presented.”The “Attorney General Cameron attempted to make it very clear that the grand jury alone made the decision on who and what to charge based solely on the evidence presented to them.“The only exception to the responsibility he foisted upon the grand jurors was in his statement that they ‘agreed’ with his team is investigation that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in their actions.”Last week, outrage spread across the nation after the grand jury indicted former Louisville Metro Police Detective Brett Hankison on one count of wanton endangerment for shots that hit an apartment next door to Taylor is home. Taylor died on March 13 after Hankison and two other officers fired shots into her apartment while executing a narcotics warrant related to her ex-boyfriend. Cameron previously had refused to release details related to the grand jury session due to supposed concerns about confidentiality and tainting of a potential jury pool.“We stand by our belief that such a release could compromise the ongoing federal investigation and could have unintended consequences such as poisoning the jury pool,” Cameronsaid in Monday is statement. Despite his misgivings, he agreed to release the recordings on Wednesday to comply with an order issued by Jefferson County Circuit Judge Ann Bailey Smith, who ordered Monday: “The recording of the grand jury proceedings shall be filed in the court file by noon of Wednesday this week.”Cameron, faced with the judge is order, complied. “The Grand Jury is meant to be a secretive body,” his statement said. “It is apparent that the public interest in this case is not going to allow that to happen. As the special prosecutor, our team has an ethical obligation not to release the recording from the Grand Jury proceedings, and we stand by our belief that such a release could compromise the ongoing federal investigation and could have unintended consequences such as poisoning the jury pool.”In a statement provided to Atlanta Black Star, Taylor family attorneys Ben Crump, Sam Aguiar and Lonita Baker called for the release of all transcripts for the proceedings.“Since the grand jury decision was announced, we have been saying that Daniel Cameron clearly failed to present a comprehensive case that supported justice for Breonna. That conclusion is supported by the grand juror who came forward to say that the attorney general misrepresented the grand jury is deliberations,” the statement read.“We fully support the call to release the entire proceeding transcript as the only way to know what evidence was presented and how the grand jury instructions led to this outcome. In America, law-abiding citizens — including Black citizens — have the right to live peacefully in their homes, without police breaking down their doors in the middle of the night, and they have a right to protect the mselves and their property from intruders,” the statement continued.“The police cannot claim their use of force was justified when they wrongly broke into Breonna is apartment in the first place. We urge the Attorney General to release a COMPLETE and UNEDITED copy of the recording, along with any and all evidence in Bre is case.”",2,2,Atlanta Black Star
530,Montgomery County issues new order to block in-person classes at private schools until October,-3.33,51.33,https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-elrich-hogan-schools-20200805-2k6mwqglknf7rhqfxecf2id64e-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/baltimore-sun-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,24,"Montgomery County officials doubled down on their efforts to keep private and religious schools closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, issuing a new order Wednesday to block in-person classes until October. That county has been in a dispute with Governor Larry Hogan for the last several days over who has the authority to determine whether private schools can bring students back to campus. Montgomery is health officer, Dr. Travis Gayles,issued an order last week preventing any in-person classes through October 1. The Republican governor responded Monday with his own orders tripping health officers of their ability — which Hogan had extended earlier in the pandemic — to close or modify county rules for school opening, with the goal of negating Montgomery County is order. Gayles responded Wednesday evening with a fresh order to keep the schools closed, citing a different portion of state law that authorizes health officers to act to prevent the spread of communicable diseases.“The purpose behind what we are doing is to keep kids safe,” Gayles said earlier Wednesday. Gayles said the transmission rate and number of new cases in the county and the region remain too high to safely open schools for in-person classes. Montgomery County has had nearly 18,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 755 deaths since the virus emerged in Maryland in March. It is second only to Prince George is County in number of cases and ranks first in the state for related deaths. Most public school systems in Maryland, including Montgomery County, have chosen to offer online-only classes to start the school year, decisions that were made by local boards of education. Some private schools, however,are planning to offer in-person instruction. Private and parochial schools argue their parents and students want in-person classes and the schools are better able to meet safety recommendations. Non-public schools typically have fewer students than public schools, and some have large campuses and additional facilities that allow students and staff to maintain their distance from each other. The dispute over limiting in-person classes is another example of how student swill have different access to education during the pandemic depending on where they live, their family wealth or which school they attend. Montgomery County, with some of the state is best public and private schools, has become the epicenter of the growing national debate. A group of Montgomery private school parents is challenging Gayles’ order in federal court. A hearing on a request for a preliminary injunction is scheduled for August 14. County Executive Marc Elrich said Hogan is action to strip health officers of the authority to proactive ly shut down schools showed “no logic.”“I was surprised. I do not think it was appropriate. I do not think it is supported by data,” said Elrich, a Democrat, during an online briefing with reporters Wednesday.“It makes no sense to have a policy to, on one hand, say: ‘I am perfectly fine with the entire public school system of every county that wants to close it to close.’ And the n, on the other hand, just saying: ‘I am OK with private schools opening,'” Elrich said. “There is no logic.”Elrich said children and employees at private schools are just as at risk of contracting and spreading the corona virus as children and employees at public schools.“I do not understand the separation of the problem as more serious for one group than another group,” said Elrich, a former public school teacher. Hogan spokesman Mike Ricci responded to Elrich is comments with a statement: “The governor has made himself clear: private and parochial schools deserve the same opportunity public schools have had to make reopening decisions based on public health guidelines. The county is blanket closure mandate was overly broad and inconsistent with the powers intended to be delegated to the county health officer.”",2,2,Baltimore Sun

Death rates have actually gone down as more cases have been reported, and more people recover with improved treatments, even though the overall death toll continues to climb. That rate would be even lower as the actual number of cases around the world is believed to be much higher than reported — perhaps 10 times higher in the US, according to the CDC — given testing limitations and the many mild cases that have gone unreported or unrecognized.

532,It is Fight Night on Capitol Hill,-2.0,43.33,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/09/infrastructure-biden-agenda-fight-night-on-capitol-hill.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2021-10-01,25,"The conventional wisdom about House Democrats has long been that the left would fold in a fight with moderates over the size of social programs, making concessions to get half a loaf instead of nothing, as they have before. That is not the case anymore. In the fight over Joe Biden is agenda on Capitol Hill, the progressive caucus has stood their ground, with roughly four dozen members who are ready to vote down the moderates’ prized infrastructure bill until ab roader reconciliation billpasses. On Thursday night, Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders punted the infrastructure over the progressive holdouts. In particular, they do not trust Senate moderatesJoe ManchinandKyrsten Sinemato support a reconciliation bill and its $3.5 trillion price tag and see the bipartisan bill, which both support, as leverage. Leadership just made it official: no votes tonight. Have a good one, everybodypic.twitter.com/GE1LM5qtELThe House stayed in session late Thursday night as frantic negotiations were underway to find a formula that would allow Manchin and Sinema to support the reconciliation bill and thus free progressives to vote for the infrastructure legislation by Pelosi is deadline of that same night. Negotiations continued Friday, with White House staff joining in, with the hopes of a deal being cut before the week is out. The left is distrust of Manchin and Sinema had been fueled by the duo playing coy about what provisions, if any, they wanted to see in a reconciliation bill. On Manchin, at least, progressives have made some incremental progress. He made his preconditions for a reconciliation bill public on Thursday, saying he wanted $1.5 trillion in spending. Sinema has not made her demands public, although a spokesman for her said in a statement that she “continues to engage directly in good-faith discussions” with Biden and Schumer to “find common ground.”In recent days, members of the media have swarmedPramila Jayapal, the leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, with the same intensity once reserved for a key moderate like Manchin. “Love it or hate it, Jayapal is the first Progressive Caucus chair to make the position relevant in shaping the debate in years,” one veteran Democratic aide observed with admiration. Their increased clout is a shift from the Obama years, which conditioned Democrats to expect the left to crumble under Biden during debates over Obamacare and the 2009 stimulus. “Some of our progressive values have become quite mainstream,” said Jared Huffman, a five-term Democrat from California. “I also think that sometimes in the past, our progressive community/caucus might have been treated as, or assumed to be, adversaries and outsiders and not had a seat at the table. And I think we have been treated as allies by the administration and by everyone else.”Progressives are also buoyed by the sense of fatalism in so many Democrats about their party is chances in midterm elections and see the reconciliation bill they want as a rare chance to pass transformative social legislation before Republicans return to power.“For 40 years before Joe Biden took office, I think Democrats controlled the presidency, the House, and the Senate for four total years, two with Clinton and two with Obama,” explained Andy Levin of Michigan on Wednesday. “And, despite those four little years — and even during them — the working people of the country have gotten the short end of the stick, so that they do not even believe in government. They are like, ‘What is government doing for me?’ This, the Build Back Better Act, does so much more for the people.”The situation in the Democratic caucus bears a resemblance to the arch-conservative House Freedom Caucus, which notoriously tried to drag every key bill to the right and fueled government shutdowns and debt-limit standoffs in the process, against the wishes of Republican leadership. “The knock on the Freedom Caucus is they know how to start a fight but not how to end one,”Matt Gaetzof Florida, a member of that group, told Intelligencer. “The current energy from progressives seems to suggest that they will end it, they will bring down the infrastructure bill if it does not pave the way to their spending ambitions.”The lessons from the right go both ways, according to Gaetz. “The progressives trying to get their way now have observed the flaws that the Freedom Caucus used to try to get their way on health care,” he said. “The Freedom Caucus fundamentally ended up empowering McCain in the end to kill [Obamacare repeal] and I do not think progressives want to do that with Manchin and Sinema.”",1,1,New York Magazine

Of course not: Ignoring the will of the American people and insisting that they remain victims while criminal enterprises destroy their communities are bipartisan objectives of the One Party State. Is she enraged that ""green"" fascists have joined forces with Federal Reserve currency-manipulating oligarchs to spike gas prices and send inflation spiraling to the moon? Both parties abandoned Main Street businesses decades ago (and despise President Trump is ""America First"" policies), so as long as Wall Street can still make a buck and her lobbyists are sitting pretty, why should she care?So what has Cheney frothing at the mouth these days (besides herlong-overdueboot from the ranks of Republican ""leadership"")? President Trump, obviously, and his dogged refusal to allow the greatest election theft in American history to go unanswered. Consider what a ""huuuge"" tell that is.

InveterateliarLiz Cheney is running from one news camera to the next like a chicken with its head cut off. Is she screaming about the Biden regime personallyfundingHamas, Hezb'allah, and Iranian terrorists in their war to exterminate Israel? Nope. Is she furious that the White House has intentionally instigated a crisis of epic proportions at the southern border by dismantling President Trump is effective deterrents and actively aiding and abetting the business operations of drug-traffickers and slavers throughout the USs? Of course not: Ignoring the will of the American people and insisting that they remain victims while criminal enterprises destroy their communities are bipartisan objectives of the One Party State. Is she enraged that ""green"" fascists have joined forces with Federal Reserve currency-manipulating oligarchs to spike gas prices and send inflation spiraling to the moon? Both parties abandoned Main Street businesses decades ago (and despise President Trump is ""America First"" policies), so as long as Wall Street can still make a buck and her lobbyists are sitting pretty, why should she care?So what has Cheney frothing at the mouth these days (besides herlong-overdueboot from the ranks of Republican ""leadership"")? President Trump, obviously, and his dogged refusal to allow the greatest election theft in American history to go unanswered. Consider what a ""huuuge"" tell that is. Big Tech, Big Media, and Big Government have done everything in their power to silence President Trump, and this one man is voice is still too threatening for Liz Cheney. She talks a big game about freedom and the Constitution safeguarding the rule of law and the n immediately takes exception to the First Amendment is protections for those speakers she deplores (including those political prisoners still being held without bail under the government is contention that they be treated as ""insurrectionists""). And the contrast between her rage against President Trump is words and her absolute silence over the last five years of Deep State subversion says everything about her twisted loyalties to a ruling class that seeks not justice, but the removal of Donald Trump from power at any cost.

They also exposed torture that the USs military instructed officers to ignore.“In our release of these 400,000 documents about the Iraq War, the intimate detail of that war from the US perspective,” WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange hoped to correct some of the attacks on the truth that occurred “before the war, during the war, and which [had] continued on since the war officially concluded.”“The stated aims for going into that war, of improving the human rights situation, improving the rule of law, did not eventuate,” Assange added. “In terms of raw numbers of people arbitrarily killed, [that] worsened the situation in Iraq.”Ten years after their release, Assange is in Belmarsh prison in London and faces an extradition request from the US government on charges that he violated the Espionage Act when he engaged in journalism. John Sloboda, the co-founder of Iraq Body Count, collaborated with WikiLeaks and analyzed the 400,000-plus US military incident reports disclosed to them by US Army whistle blower Chelsea Manning. In September and during Assange is extradition trial, Sloboda testified that a decade later, “The War Logs remain the only source of information regarding many thousands of violent civilian deaths in Iraq between 2004 and 2009.”Iraq Body Count estimated the reports described 23,000 violent incidents in which Iraqi civilians were killed or bodies were found that were previously unknown. “The majority of these new deaths came from small incidents of one to three deaths”—the very kinds of incidents that attract that least amount of media coverage.“If there are other sources of information or analyses being held within the US government regarding the deaths of civilians in Iraq that were revealed in the Iraq War Logs, they are certainly still being withheld from the public.”Sloboda acknowledged the US government is likely still keeping data on Iraqi civilian deaths secret.“By making this information public,” Sloboda suggested, “Manning and Assange were carrying out a duty on behalf of the victims and the public that the US government was failing to carry out.”Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers in the United Kingdom broke the revelations into three categories:—unlawful killings of civilians—indiscriminate attacks or the unjustified use of lethal force against civilians—horrendous abuse and torture of Iraqis by the Iraqi National Guard or the Iraqi Police Service, torture of Iraqis whilst in UK custody (presumably, whilst in the custody of US and other coalition forces custody as well)[Note: Shiner is firm represented Iraqis, who were alleged victims of war crimes.]An order calledFrago 242, which the US and the UK apparently adopted, excused officers from taking responsibility for torture by Iraqi military or security forces. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ)found““over 300 classified reports in the Iraq War Logs alleging abuse by coalition forces on Iraqi prisoners after the Abu Ghraib scandal.”In the time span covered by the logs, “some 180,000 Iraqis were imprisoned.” Approximately one out of 50 Iraqi males were imprisoned.“More than 1,300 individual cases of torture and abuse carried out by Iraqis on Iraqi prisoners at police stations and army bases” were tallied, implicating coalition forces that likely witnessed or reported on the incidents. Onewar logo n alleged detainee abuse from September 27, 2006, indicates no further investigation was necessary because coalition forces were not involved. It details abuse by Iraqi Police. Another war log from August 10, 2006, contains allegations of detainee abuse by Iraqi Police in the form of a “victim summary“:A war log on October 31, 2006,containsallegations shared by a soldier against a platoon is handling of detainees. It indicates the driver of a vehicle carrying detainees would “call back to warn the soldiers he was about to stop abruptly. The soldiers would hold on and watch as the detainees [were] propelled forward.”Soldiers in the back would the n “take turns punching the detainees,” the war log further states. Interrogatorsthreatenedto hand detainees over to the “Wolf Brigade” or “Wolf Battalion.”According toThe Guardian, the Wolf Brigade was “created and supported by the US in an attempt to re-employ elements of Saddam Hussein is Republican Guard, this time to terrorize insurgents.”“Members typically wore red berets, sunglasses and balaclavas, and drove out on raids in convoys of Toyota Landcruisers. They were accused by Iraqis of beating prisoners, torturing them with electric drills, and sometimes executing suspects.”The Iraq War Logs were a shining example of what media organizations may accomplish when collaborating. The Guardian, Der Spiegel (Germany), Sveriges Television (Sweden), Le Monde (France), Al Jazeera, Channel 4, and BBC Radio all reported on the material. Patrick Cockburn, Middle East correspondent for The Independent, submitted testimony in Assange is extradition case that addressed the impact of the Iraq War Logs, including how it aided his efforts to document the carnage.“Rereading these documents now, I am struck again by the constipated military-bureaucratic prose, with its sinister dehumanizing acronyms,” Cockburn declared. “Killing people is referred to as an EOF (“Escalation of Force”), something that happened frequently at US military checkpoints when nervous US soldiers directed Iraqi drivers to stop or go with complex hand signals that nobody understood.”Cockburn highlighted an example that occurred on the outskirts of Fallujah when a woman in a car was killed and her three daughters and husband were wounded.“The US marine on duty opened fire because he was ‘unable to determine the occupants of the vehicle due to the reflection of the sun coming off the windshield,'” according to the log.“Another report marks the moment when US soldiers shot dead a man who was ‘creeping up behind their sniper position,’ only to learn later that he was their own unit is interpreter,” Cockburn noted.“These reports are the small change of war, but collectively they convey its reality far better than even the most well-informed journalistic accounts,” Cockburn concluded. “Those two shootings were a thousand times repeated, though the reports were rare in admitting that the victims were civilians. More usually, the dead were automatically identified as ‘terrorists’ caught in the act, regardless of evidence to the contrary.”While presenting evidence that the US government is targeting Assange for his political opinions, Paul Rodgers, professor emeritus at Bradford University in England, highlighted a speech Assange delivered at a Stop the War Coalition Rally in Trafalgar Square on August 8, 2011. Assange referred to the “information [WikiLeaks] revealed showing the everyday squalor and barbarity of war, information such as the individual deaths of over 130,000 people in Iraq, individual deaths that were kept secret by the US military, who denied that they have counted the deaths of civilians.”“I want to tell you what I think is the way that wars come to be and that wars can come undone,” Assange proclaimed. “If wars can be started bylies, peace can be started by truth.”*Marjorie Cohn, professor of law at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law and former president of the National Lawyers Guild, joined me for a conversation on the Iraq War Logs anniversary.“I want to tell you what I think is the way that wars come to be and that wars can come undone,” Assange proclaimed. “If wars can be started bylies, peace can be started by truth.”*Marjorie Cohn, professor of law at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law and former president of the National Lawyers Guild, joined me for a conversation on the Iraq War Logs anniversary.",2,1,Shadowproof

By a vote of 82-62 on Sunday evening, the Texas House of Representatives approved a compromise version of HB 1927, which would allow most Texans to carry handguns without a permit. The compromise bill marks the beginning of the end of a fraught legislative process that began in April, when theHouse passed the initial version of the bill. The bill initially faced stiff challenges in the state Senate, where a series of proposed amendments prompted the House to reject earlier iterations of the legislation. Sunday is vote, however, marks a breakthrough in that stalemate, with the Senate is widely expected approval the last remaining obstacle between the bill and Republican Governor Greg Abbott is signature. Abbott has previously stated he will, indeed, sign the legislation into law.""By working together, the House and Senate will send Governor Abbott the strongest Second Amendment legislation in Texas history, and protect the right of law-abiding Texans to carry a handgun as they exercise their God-given right to self-defense and the defense of their families,"" Republican state Representative Matt Schaefer, who authored the legislation,said in a statement announcing the compromise bill. According to Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick, the Texas Senate will vote — and almost certainly pass — the bill early this week.""HB 1927 is a historic bill and a national model,"" Patrick said in a statement. ""It includes the thinking of national gun rights advocates and many in Texas law enforcement and affirms our commitment to protect the rights of gun owners and the safety of those in law enforcement.""According to the, the compromises agreed upon in the legislation include provisions allowing police to question people based on their carrying a handgun, tougher penalties for felons who are caught carrying a handgun, and an optional free online gun safety course to be offered by the Texas Department of Public Safety. Texas alreadyhasaconspicuously lax suite of gun laws to begin with, so much so that its gun culture has taken on a life of its own as a unique feature of the Lone Star State. Accordingly, the state has seen multiple mass shootings in the past several years — a fact not lost on Democratic lawmakers, who spoke out against the permit-less cary legislation on Sunday.""This is our first session since those tragedies [inOdessaandEl Paso], and this is our response, a bill to allow permit-less carry,"" state Representative Chris Turnersaid during debate on the legislation. ""A bill to say you do not have to have any training to carry a handgun in the state of Texas. And I ca not imagine a worse slap in the face to all those people who have advocated, to the victims and to the family of those victims.""Abbott, however, has come out strongly for the bill,saying late last month that ""I support it, and I believe it should reach my desk, and we should have 'constitutional carry' in Texas.""",1,1,Mic

Art Pavelski, an upstate New York Pastor of Pierce Hill Christian Fellowship explained, “Christ is neither conservative or liberal and that Christ is both.”But there is fear that the politics of our era would affect the message of Christianity. As of now, the big tech censorship of people like Donald Trump or of Parler has not hit the church. But many are concerned that might be the next step. Pavelski said, “It could affect the church. If it gets to the point where you are saying that when you talk about Christian viewpoints and it is considered to be too offensive. That could be the case.”There would be a big reason the big tech firms out there would censor Christianity in America.“These Twitter accounts, Facebook, whatever the social media is not owned by Christians,” Pavelski said. “It is not a Christian company. So, you cannot expect them to act in any kind of a Christian manner. That, that is just the way it is.”There is also another reason the church is on the lookout for possible big tech censorship.“Maybe people who would say that that some of the things that the Christians talk about would be inappropriate,” said Pavelski. “It would be what some would consider hate speech.”As of now, Pavelski said the attack on Christianity has not grown too out of control in America.“I have not seen anything compared to any kind of attack on Christians like it has been in the first century, where Christians are fed to the lions. There are not any Christians being fed to lions in the USs that I know of.”Pavelski also notes that Christians are persecuted in other parts of the world, including those with a one-party system.",1,0,Daily Torch
542,Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kayleigh McEnany Were Trump is Enthusiastic Cleanup Crew,-19.67,24.0,https://jezebel.com/sarah-huckabee-sanders-and-kayleigh-mcenany-were-trumps-1846070383,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-20,15,"There are many low lights from the Trump regime, but the re is one in particular that will haunt me: Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the first mother to serve as White House Press Secretary, standing at her podium and announcing: “I am not aware of the Attorney General is comments or what he would be referencing; I can say that it is very Biblical to enforce the law.” She was responding to a question about Jeff Sessions’ defense of the Trump administration is family separation law. Along with Kayleigh McEnany, Sanders was one of two high-profile women who served as the Press Secretary under Trump, charged with advancing his narrative day in, day out. As opposed to the bumbling Sean Spicer, they did their jobs very successfully. (Stephanie Grisham gave briefings so rarely she never achieved the same name recognition as her fellows.) Sanders and McEnany were two sides of the same coin—one somewhat sullen, the other almost chipper as she painted the press corps as enemies of the people—women who both distinguished the mselves as not just willing, but enthusiastic champions of Trump. Goodbye for now to the cheerleaders from hell. As a 2018 profile in the explained, Sanders was brought aboard the Trump campaign as a way to strengthen his appeal to women and evangelicals. Already experienced as a conservative campaign operative, she became a TV surrogate for him, delivering his pitch to white suburban women just like herself, and her aggressive posture on Trump is behalf got her a gig in the White House communications department under Sean Spicer, replacing him when he left. It was not just simply that she was willing to fight; as a 2018 Politicoprofilepointed out, her technique was as much about extinguishing fires by sucking the air out of White House briefing room: “The moment Sanders unleashes her trademark monotone, the energy drains.”McEnany—also a familiar face on Fox News—followed the playbook left by Sanders, a very evangelical brand of combative, self-righteous femininity deployed to defend her boss is every move and advance his agenda through the coronavirus and the generation election and will finish out Trump is term. While their personal presentation was vastly different, Sanders and McEnany are both the absolute embodiment of the white women who do their utmost to uphold white supremacy and patriarchy, who cheerfully do it in a brightly colored sheath dress, while flashing pictures of their kids and talking about how their most important job title is “mom.” When called out, they positioned the mselves as innocent victims, virtuous women under attack by the mob; think of Sanders getting politely asked to leave a restaurant and both complaining on Twitter and devoting time to the incident from her podium. They were Trump is cleanup crew, the ones who followed behind his Twitter tempests to bolster whatever claims their boss had made. “It is very Biblical to enforce the law,” said Sanders when asked about family separation. And, too, Sanders and McEnany—as much as any other individuals in the administration—were his public-facing storytellers. Day in, day out, with discipline and the power of the White House briefing room podium, they advanced Trump is narrative about how lying leftist media was the enemy of people. Even if Joe Biden could roll back every single policy ever adopted by the Trump administration on his first day in office, that legacy will live on, in a nation whose citizens no longer seem to agree on basic facts of reality. Of course, they will not suffer much for their role in all this—will anybody? They still have innumerable fans, and the re is always a job waiting at Fox News and the weird universe of the conservative conference scene. But the most fitting punishment for their work would be a lifetime of waking up from nightmares about being separated from their own children—to know, even for a moment, the absolute shrieking desperation of being unable to find them and to plead with a series of looming, stone-faced officials who just do not care.",0,0,Jezebel
543,Gun Shops Flouted State Closure Orders in April as Industry Notched Another Big Month,-7.0,48.67,https://www.thetrace.org/2020/05/coronavirus-gun-sales-state-closures-background-checks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-trace-bias-and-reliability/,2020-05-14,16,"Gun stores in several states have defied orders to close their doors as the coronavirus pandemic drives historic demand for firearms, according to background check data maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and interviews with shop owners. Governors of five states — Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, and Washington — ordered gun dealers to close in April under statewide stay-at-home directives. But FBI data from April shows that dealers in those states initiated tens of thousands of gun background checks. In Washington State, where gun shops were shuttered by a March 25 stay-at-homeorder, 42,000 checks were initiated in April. Some businesses sell guns in addition to food and other household items that have been deemed essential — Walmart and hardware stores may have firearms departments, for example. At least two of the five states — Michigan and New York — permit these stores to continue selling guns under their orders, which may explain a portion of the checks in the FBI is data. However, big-box stores typically account for only a fraction of all gun sales. And phone calls to more than 50 dedicated gun dealers confirmed that many remained open in defiance of state orders to close. During April, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) processed 2.9 million checks, making it the fourth highest month on record, dating back to 1998. The Trace compared the number of background checks for handguns, long guns, and transactions involving both types of gun with the same figures for 2019. Our analysis found that in some of the states where stores were ordered closed, dealers conducted more checks in April 2020 than during the same month in 2019. In Washington State, for instance, checks increased 45 percent over April 2019, and in New Mexico, they increased 15 percent. In Michigan, checks increased by 112 percent, but at least part of the surge may be attributed to a March 3rulingby the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to a spokesperson for the Michigan State Police. That ruling said that firearms dealers cannot accept a Michigan-issued concealed carry permit in lieu of conducting a background check, meaning that gun transfers to permit holders, which were previously not counted in the FBI data, are now included. Anthony Coulson, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent who is an expert on the background check system, said the increased gun sales rendered states’ stay-at-home orders “meaningless.”“What is the motivation for implementing a nonessential order if it is not going to be enforced and has no impact?” Coulson asked. The two states that did not register any year-over-year increase in firearm background checks were New York and Massachusetts. In New York, the number of checks hovered just below normal levels. In Massachusetts, background checks saw a significant year-over-year decrease, falling 66 percent. Store owners offered a litany of reasons they are violating the orders. Some considered them a breach of their Second Amendment rights. Some felt emboldened by a March 28 revision to Department of Homeland Security guidance that deemed the gun industry an essential business during the pandemic. The DHS guidance, which is nonbinding, was heavily pushed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the industry trade group. Other store owners said they felt that, if they took reasonable precautions, they could operate safely. Still others said they considered their businesses exempt from statewide restrictions.“I would say that I am supposed to be closed,” said Dennis Brown, who owns Shoreline Tactical, a gun shop in Shoreline, Washington. But with so many stores closed, “people ca not get their guns. So I have elected to stay open on an appointment-only basis.”Defiant stores more often than not went unpunished, The Trace found, despite proclamations from several governors that states would mete out harsh penalties to noncompliant businesses of all types. The April background check numbers continue a trend first spotted by The Trace in early March, when gun store owners along the West Coast saw a surge in Asian-American customers fearful of xenophobic backlash to the virus. By the end of the month, fears of social unrest spread to the general public, driving a historic sales bump. The FBIprocesseda record number of checks in March, outstripping the prior high by 12 percent. As USA TODAY hasreported, the increase has overwhelmed the federal background check system, prompting the FBI to warn gun retailers that screenings could take up to a month to complete. An FBI spokesperson said NICS “remains fully operational and will continue to process requests.”In each of the five states where gun stores were deemed nonessential, The Trace contacted retailers to inquire whether they were open. In Michigan, 15 of 20 stores said that they were open to walk-in customers. The remaining five did not answer their phones. In Washington State, all 10 dealers contacted were also selling guns, but some emphasized that they required customers to schedule appointments to ensure social distancing. In New Mexico, 9 out of 10 dealers contacted were open throughout April; in New York, 4 out of 10 stores contacted said the same. The remaining stores in both states did not answer calls. Only in Massachusetts did most gun stores appear to be closed. Of 20 firearm retailers contacted in the state, only one — in Montague — reported being open. Three others declined to answer questions; the rest did not answer calls. Shawn Brancheau, who runs Guns Galore in Fenton, Michigan, said that he considers his store an essential business even though Governor Gretchen Whitmer has said the opposite.“Home defense needs to be a consideration of the governor at a time like this,” he said, adding that he felt justified staying open because of the Department of Homeland Security is March guidance. He questioned the constitutionality of any order that would require gun stores to close and said local police had already been in his store to shop, and took no action.“Either there is no Second Amendment or you have the right to bear arms,” Brancheau said. Steve Hayes, an owner of Bob is Gun and Tackle Shop Inc. in Hastings, Michigan, said he understood that state orders superseded the federal guidance, but said Michigan is order was too ambiguous. A call to the state Attorney General is Office, he says, provided little clarity.“Local authorities are giving different answers,” he said. “It is been very confusing for a lot of store owners, and probably for customers, too, when they see one store shut and one store open.”Hayes said he received a written exemption from his local police department allowing him to stay open, but declined to provide a copy of the document. Calls to the Barry County Sheriff is Department, which has jurisdiction over Hayes’ store, were not returned. Other store owners said their livelihoods depend upon keeping their doors open. Chris Burnett, who operates Kokopelli Pawn and Gun in Aztec, New Mexico, opened his shop just before the coronavirus reached the US He says the New Mexico State Police have visited three times in the last month, instructing him to close his store. On the third visit, troopers fined him $100 and warned him that continued noncompliance could result in a six-month jail sentence. Still, he stayed open. “I just threw everything into my business,” he said. “I have two little girls at home to feed.”Some retailers said that even in states where the closure orders were unambiguous, they had found wiggle room to continue operating. Ryan Blake, who runs High Plains Gun Shop six hours east of Burnett is store, in Clovis, New Mexico, said his store had been approved to stay open by local authorities.“We are essentially a department of an essential business since we are located in a hardware store,” he said. “So we have fallen under a gray area.”Likewise, Paul Smith, who runs S&S Gun Sales in Auburn, New York, said he found a loophole in Governor Andrew Cuomo is order.“We were not originally on the list of essential businesses, but being a single proprietor gun store owner, I realized I could be open when I choose to,” he said. New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham is office, which has the authority to issue exemptions to New Mexico is stay-at-home order, did not respond to requests for comment. In New York, a spokesperson for the Empire State Development Corporation, which determines which businesses are considered essential under Cuomo is order, said that gun stores, like all nonessential retail, were permitted to have one person in the shop to fulfill online orders. As USA TODAY hasreported, many states have struck a hard tack on businesses violating stay-at-home orders, threatening fines and criminal charges for those who ignore initial warnings. But noncompliant firearm retailers appear to have largely avoided such penalties outside of New Mexico. A spokesperson for the New Mexico State Police said that six gun dealers there were issued cease-and-desist letters in April. In Michigan, for example, a spokesperson for the state is Attorney General is OfficetoldThe Detroit Free Pressthat nonessential businesses could face forced closures and up to 90 days in jail for refusing to comply with the governor is order. The Michigan State Police recently cited an Owosso barber shop for noncompliance, asking it to close or face harsher penalties. But several of the Michigan gun retailers interviewed for this story said that local authorities were aware of their operations and had taken no action. When provided background check data suggesting noncompliance among gun stores in the state, a spokesperson for the Michigan Attorney General is Office said that enforcement was being handled at the local level. He added: “There has been nothing in Governor Whitmer is executive orders that has specifically referenced firearm retailers.”In Washington, Governor Jay Insleeoutlineda three-tier penalty system for offending businesses: one violation earned a warning; another led to citations and possible business license revocation; one more could result in criminal charges. But news media reports suggest that few if any Washington State businesses have been hit with severe penalties. The Seattle TimesandKOMO TV Newshave reported on lax enforcement efforts for noncompliant businesses like gyms and construction sites. According to records obtained from the Washington Military Department, which receives complaints about compliance in the state, several gun stores also have continued to operate after allegations of noncompliance. One, Lynnwood Guns and Ammunition, was the subject of more than 20 complaints in the state is database, all of which alleged large crowds and a lack of enforcement of social distancing requirements. One complainant alleged that they had confronted the store is proprietor and shown her that gun stores are not essential per the governor is order. “She asked me to leave,” the complaint reads. A representative from Lynnwood Guns and Ammunition declined to comment. Overall, the Military Department received more than 200 complaints about noncompliant gun stores since the state is stay-at-home order took effect on March 25th – and more than 100 requests from retailers for exemptions from the order. It is unclear from the records whether any of those exemptions were granted. In Massachusetts, both the State Police and the Attorney is General Office directed questions about compliance to the Governor is Office, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment about the state is enforcement efforts. The Massachusetts Department of Health said enforcement was handled by municipalities; spokes people for police departments in Worcester and Framingham reported that gun stores in those cities were all compliant with the order. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the nation is gun enforcement agency, said that violations of state and local laws could put dealers’ federal licenses at risk. Applicants must affirm that they are in compliance with local and state laws before licenses are conferred and every three years when licenses are renewed. License status for dealers charged with local offenses, the ATF said, likely would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The National Rifle Association referred questions to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. There, General Counsel Larry Keane said it was “not surprising” that gun sales did not suffer in states where firearms dealers were restricted or prohibited from operating during the health emergency. Keane said that local enforcement of the state executive orders has not been consistent across the states.“In some areas, local sheriffs are not going to force gun shops to close because that is where law enforcement buys equipment to do the job,” he said. “We are aware that local law enforcement have been advising dealers in some cases not to close because that is where they are buying ammunition and firearms.”Keane said the foundation has made no effort to advise dealers on actual operations. Rather, he said the group has provided the industry with a running list of orders approved by the state, including the essential business operations recognized in those jurisdictions.“We are not telling people to open; we are not telling people to close,” Keane said. “We are just providing access to good information.”Christian Heyne, the vice president of policy for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence called gun stores’ disobedience deeply concerning. The USs relies on gun stores, as federally licensed businesses, to follow state and federal guidelines to ensure the safety of communities across the country, he said. “So it is incredibly alarming to think that there are a number of gun dealers that are essentially going rogue.”Meanwhile, the NRA hasvigorouslycondemnedstates that ordered gun retailers to shutter and filed lawsuits against governors inNew MexicoandNew York. MassachusettsandMichiganalso face lawsuits over their orders. As states phase in their reopening plans, the situation for gun sales is rapidly changing. On May 1, New Mexico is governor said gun stores could reopen on an appointment-only basis. On May 7, a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that the state is shutdown of gun stores was unconstitutional. Stores there officially reopened for business on May 9.",2,2,The Trace

Deborah Carmichael, the mother of now-deceased 45-year-old Tricia Jones, is speaking out and urging those hesitant about the vaccine to get the jab after losing her daughter in June. She spoke to Kansas City is news channelFox4 WDAF-TV about her daughter is death and vaccine hesitancy in an interview broadcast this week.""She was afraid of the side effects, I think. You hear a lot of horror stories. I, myself, when I had the shot, it was rough, so it scared her and freaked her out. So she did not want to do it. I could not convince her,"" Carmichael told the Missouri news channel. Jones, who resided in Grain Valley, was a mother of two, including her 18-year-old daughter Adriana, who just graduated from high school. The teen told Fox 4 that her mother was her ""best friend.""""There were so many days where I would just stand there next to my mom and say, 'Wake up, mama, wake up.' She would never wake up, and I just wish that she would. I do not think anyone should have to go through what we went through. Especially with the variant,"" the daughter said. Carmichael urged everyone to take the pandemic seriously and get vaccinated. ""Please take this seriously. You do not want to see a family member you love go through this,"" she said. Jones was reportedly hospitalized on May 9. She was the n placed on a ventilator and died on June 9.""After she got it, she said, 'Mom you were right, about the shot, about masks, being diligent and all that.' I was like, 'I do not want to be right. I want you to be well. That is all that matters,'"" Carmichael said. Missouri continues to have one of the lowest vaccination rates in the US, ranking above just 11 other states, according to aNew York Timestracker. Just under 56 percent of the state is adult residents have received at least one shot of the vaccine while just under 49 percent are fully vaccinated. Comparatively, Maine, Connecticut, Massachusetts and Vermont have more than 70 percent of their adult populations fully vaccinated. Experts have posited that about 70 percent of a population needs to be vaccinated against COVID-19 to achieve herd immunity. A survey conducted by Gallup from May 18 to 23 found that about a quarter (24 percent) of US adults do not plan to get vaccinated. Of those in the vaccine hesitant group, 78 percent said they are ""unlikely"" to change their mind about the vaccine while 51 percent said they are ""not likely at all"" to adjust their plans regarding vaccination against COVID-19. Public health officials,religious leader sand lawmakers have repeatedly assured the public that the vaccines are safe and highly effective at preventing severe COVID-19. Former President Donald Trumpand PresidentJoe Bidenhave both received the vaccine and have urged all US adults to follow their example.reached out to the Missouri Department of Health and Senior Services for comment.

545,"Young Voters, Motivated by Climate Change and Environmental Justice, Helped Propel Biden is Campaign",-11.67,44.0,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/07112020/young-voters-climate-change-environmental-justice-joe-biden/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-07,21,"If Joe Biden wins the presidency, young voters between 18 and 29 will have played a critical role in his election, turning out in force and favoring the former vice president over President Trump by 61 percent to 36 percent, according to an analysis by the Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning at Tufts University. The Center concluded that those young voters, and particularly young people of color and women, may have helped put Biden over the edge in crucial battleground states, based on an analysis of votes counted by midday Friday. The Tufts’ center estimated the youth share of the vote in the 2020 election at 17 percent, compared to 16 percent in the 2016 presidential election and13 percent in the 2018 midterms, based on the 2020 VoteCast from the Associated Press, the National Election Pool exit poll from Edison Research and its own analyses of census population data. That figure could change as more data becomes available and the election comes to a close. The center, a non-partisan, independent research organization focused on youth civic engagement, also projected that once all votes are counted, youth turnout may rise to 53 to 56 percent, compared to46 percent in the 2016 election and36 percent in the 2018 midterms. That would represent the highest youth voter turnout since at least 1984. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Young Black, Asian and Latino voters supported Biden over Trump by margins of 77, 72 and 49 points respectively. By comparison, young white voters supported Biden over Trump by a margin of only 6 points. Support for the two candidates also divided along gender-based lines within racial and ethnic groups, with young white women preferring Biden over Trump by a 13-point margin, while young white men preferred Trump over Biden by a 6-point margin. The center is analysis also found substantial pro-Biden youth voter turnout in key battleground states, including in closely-watched Georgia, where youth comprised 21 percent of the vote and gave Biden a 19-point edge over Trump. Specifically, young Black voters, who favored Biden over Trump by an 82-point margin, “put Georgia in play,” the center said in its analysis. With a recountunderway, Biden currently leads in Georgia by just over 4,000 votes. The center estimated that youth voter turnout across the 11 crucial battleground states of Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Montana, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas and South Carolina could rise to 51 to 53 percent by the election is end.“In many ways, the energy young people have brought throughout this election cycle—that will have catapulted Joe Biden into the presidency if we get that result” and given him a “climate mandate” in office, Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate organization, said at a press conference on Thursday. Prakash added that Sunrise and allied climate and progressive organizations played a critical role in making a youth-powered Biden victory possible by pushing for the Green New Deal and advocating for climate more broadly. For young voters across the political spectrum, she said, climate is “essentially a litmus test for the 2020 election.”Garrett Blad, a spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement, said Biden is use of climate change as a “closing argument” in advertisements in swing states down the election is final stretch testified to the group is success in shaping climate as a dominant issue in the Democratic Party and national political dialogue.“This is going to sound so simple but when a campaign is actually talking with young people publicly, I think that matters a lot,” said Abby Kiesa, the Tufts’ center is deputy director, who attributed Biden is favorability among young voters in part to his effort to appeal directly to youth from early on in his campaign after the primary. Kiesa added that young voters could distinguish authentic appeals from political rhetoric. “Young people are not dumb; they know when someone is just out to get their vote,” she said. Blad offered a similar analysis. “To Biden is credit, like a lot of politicians do not do, he listened to young people,” said Blad. He said he thought Biden is heavy communications about climate change was a driving force behind the vast up tic kin his favorability among young voters between May and October. Zanagee Artis, co-founder of Zero Hour, a youth climate justice organization, said the Unity Task Force on Climate Change Biden formed with Senator Bernie Sanders, which included Green New Deal champions Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sunrise is Prakash, signalled the former vice president is willingness to listen to and work with young people. Though Biden is refusal to commit to a ban on f racking and fully embrace the Green New Deal frustrated many young progressive climate activists, Artis said he felt encouraged by how successful the youth climate movement had been in pushing Biden to adopt a much bolder climate policy plan than he would have otherwise. Artis was among several climate activists who said youth helped propel Joe Biden into office on the promise that his presidency would deliver not only bold action, but specifically climate justice. Rather than talk strictly about science or decarbonization, Biden spoke about climate in terms of green job creation and investment in marginalized communities—language that helped energize young people who had coalesced around Sanders in the early Democratic primaries.“Climate is a mobilizing issue because climate is an intersectional issue,” said Saad Amer, an environmental activist and director of Plus1Vote, a youth voter mobilization organization. He said climate was inseparable from racial justice and health equity. Alex Leichenger, strategic communications manager at NextGen America, an organization of young voters created to elect pro-climate Democrats, said Biden is focus on environmental justice as part of his climate policy may help explain his higher support among young people of color and young women. Research has found that people of color and specifically,young people of color, are more likely to be concerned about climate change. The center is analysis of APVoteCast data shows young Biden voters were more likely than young Trump voters to say coronavirus, racism and climate change were top issues facing the country by 21-point, 14-point and 9-point margins, respectively, with young Trump supporters being significantly more likely to prioritize the economy and jobs. That disparity reflects the gap between Biden, who linked climate to health and environmental racism, and Trump, who has continuously denied the science around the climate and Covid-19 crises while painting climate action as a threat to people is jobs in the fossil fuel industry. Leichenger said he looked forward to seeing more data on the breakdown of youth voter turnout to better understand how racial and gender disparities affected young people is support for Biden over Trump, along with any disparities between Gen Z and millennial voting trends. Beyond having the right messaging, Biden is campaign may have benefited substantially from concerted organizing efforts by young climate activists to get out their peers’ votes. Danielle Deiseroth, a climate data analyst for the progressive think tank Data for Progress, said hundreds of thousands ofpostcardsSunrise sent out to young voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Florida were emblematic of the large-scale, youth-led organizing that may have played a critical role in swaying the election. Blad said Sunrise made a total of 1.8 million phone calls, sent 2.5 million texts and mailed 778,000 postcards to eligible voters, reaching 3.5 million unique voters just since the end of the presidential primary. Digital technologies may also have played an important role in mobilizing young voters, both Leichenger and Amer said. With in-person campaign events next to impossible because of the pandemic, they said, youth took advantage of their social media and internet savvy to get out the vote using platforms like TikTok and Instagram. And for many climate organizers, this year is powerful youth turnout is only the beginning. Youth have “shown that they are relevant, that they are here and they are going to have a say,” said Natalie Mebane, associate director of US policy at 350 Action. Leichenger said he thinks Gen Z voters between 18 and 23 are “only at the beginning of exercising what can be very substantial power.”Ilana Cohen is a proud New Yorker and a rising junior at Harvard University studying philosophy and social studies.

What she found was part of a larger story on Election Day: Even with concerns about coronavirus, Native voters on the Hopi and Navajo nations showed up in large numbers at in-person polling locations.“Turnout has been great,” Shupla said.“We have even had people come in trying to register to vote,” she said, but Arizona does not allow same-day voter registration. Her first stop was a polling site inside the Kykotsmovi Village Community Center, near the Hopi tribal office. Shupla said the location offered curbside voting, along with a ballot drop-off box for the first time. In Sipaulovi Village, Shupla stood outside the Sipaulovi Youth & Elderly Building and worked with local Native Vote volunteers as they handed out teal-colored shirts to Hopi voters leaving the polls. Native Vote is a nonpartisan initiative developed by the National Congress of American Indians that focuses on voter registration, election protection, education and data collection. Because of the pandemic, all the Hopi Villages are closed to nontribal citizens and many of them have security posts set up in front monitoring traffic. One is set up in front of the Sipaulovi Village, and the staff was directing voters toward the polling site only. No one was allowed into the village unless they were a resident.“They are busy,” Shupla said. There had been a steady stream of voters since the site opened and she was impressed with how smoothly the location was running. The final Navajo County polling station was at the Hopi LDS Church in Polacca. Shupla said she did not encounter any voting issues at any of the three sites, but she saw a lot of first-time voters.“I have never seen lines and we are seeing lines,” she said. “I think people are seeing the importance of this election.”In Arizona, nearly 6% of the voting-age population is Native American, making it one of the highest percentages among Indigenous communities in the US, according to the National Congress of American Indians. The Navajo and Hopi nations stretch across parts of Coconino, Navajo and Apache counties. Of Navajo County is 108,000 residents, 43% are Native American. Of Apache County is population of about 71,000, Native Americans make up 73%. ASU law student MacArthur Stant, a volunteer with the Arizona Native Vote Elections Protection Project, was also out visiting polling places on the Hopi Nation. He stopped in Polacca and SipauloviThe project is part of the ASU Indian Law Clinic and provides resources to tribes and tribal citizens in Arizona, “to ensure access to the polls and to prevent voter disenfranchisement,” the project is web site says. At the polling stations, Stant said he saw a steady flow of voters throughout the day.“It is been very exciting. A lot of first-time voters and it feels as if those first-time voters are going to stay voters,” Stant said. He noticed a lot of the first-time voters are in their 30s, 40s, and 50s.“These are people who have not voted in their life and they are starting to see the value and importance of it,” he added. “I think as a whole this starting to be very important.”For state elections, there were 14 Native candidates on ballots across Arizona and 11 of them won their election. Apache County voter Andrew Simpson said he felt both the Democratic and Republican parties have not spent enough time on the Navajo Nation to really understand the way of life for Navajo people. But he has noticed they are paying more attention to Indigenous communities.“Nobody ever paid attention to who we are,” he said.“They need to come here to understand us rather than try to change us into their way of life,” Simpson said. “Not only the Navajo Nation but all Native tribes. They need to understand our way of life.”Simpson voted early by mail, but still showed up to the polls on Tuesday at the Steamboat Chapter House. As a former council delegate on the Navajo Nation, Simpson said he wanted to see the turnout. In Chinle, voters were able to use one of the few early in-person voting sites in Apache County. The polling station was inside a blue warehouse and had two entrances, one for voters in the Chinle precinct and the other for the Canyon De Chelly precinct. Election official Karsteen Draper, 43, from nearby Del Muerto, greeted voters who walked toward the building, directing them to the correct precinct or to a poll worker who could help ensure they were in the right line. He said he is volunteered for elections before and has always enjoyed working with people. He likes answering their questions and helping them vote.""The line has been flowing smoothly. No long waits,"" Draper said. He planned on being the final voter of the night. As an election official, he had to make sure no one tried to get in line when the polls closed at 7 p.m. Volunteers with the Arizona Native Vote Elections Protection Project were set up in front of the polling station, providing voters with hand sanitizer and answers to voting or ballot questions. ASU law students Aspen Miller and Seth Jensen had been set up in front of the polling site since about 6 a.m. Miler said the site was not even open when they arrived. They talked to hundreds of voters throughout the day and the biggest confusion they encountered was that the Navajo Nation was having a tribal election, too. The Apache County polling site was set up only for the state and national elections. The tribal election took place at the Chinle Chapter House about two miles away. Jensen said turnout was steady and Miller agreed, saying there was always somebody inside voting.""Nobody is been turned away,"" she added. Married couple Ashley and Marlyn Willie from Chinle both knew they wanted to vote in person rather than by mail.“My vote will count the n and the re,” Ashley Willie, 27, said. ""Our voices can be heard through voting.""Marlyn Willie echoed his wife is thoughts. He said he is been voting since he turned 18, and now at 29, voting is still important to him because his future, his kids' future and eventually his grandkids' future all depend on who leads.""Not just this election but all the elections,"" he said. ""People have to get up and vote so they can be the change. We choose who gets to be in there.""In the 2016 election, Maryln Willie said he did vote for Donald Trump and he has tried to vote Republican much of the time, but that changed this election. He voted for Joe Biden. He does not believe the current division in the USs will change this election. ""Not with the two candidates we have,"" he said, and he does not believe either candidate can deliver on their campaign promises.""Not much is being said about our future,"" he added, and he said he changed his candidate this election year because of his kids. He believes that Trump has not handled the COVID-19 pandemic properly, and he said has to think about his children is health and safety. The coronavirus had hit Indigenous communities the hardest and no one knows how long it is going to last.""My children deserve to be safe,"" He said. ""I am just hoping for a little bit of change.""As the polls closed on Tuesday night, Chinle Chapter House voter Joanie Hunter stood in line along with about 100 other tribal voters waiting to cast their vote in the Navajo Nation Chapter general election. Hunter already voted in the state and national election, casting a ballot early because she thought the polling line would be too long on Election Day.“I thought the chapter (election) should be fine,” she said but was proven wrong by the time she made it to the polls just before 7 p.m. Hunter said she was mentally kicking herself for not voting early.“I did not think there would be this many people,” she said. By the time Hunter got in line, it looped around the Chinle Chapter House complex with about 100 voters still waiting. At one point during the day, the line stretched past the parking lot toward the main highway.“I do not mind waiting,” Hunter said, even as a few of her fellow voters walked away from the line. She said she cares about her chapter election because she feels it is an election where her voice is really heard.“You get a say in whose running things,"" she added. ""I believe it does make a difference.""Thousands of Navajo voters cast a ballot for chapter leaders on Tuesday. Native voters often turn out in higher rates for tribal elections than nontribal elections, according to the National Congress of American Indians. In chapter elections, Navajo voters elect leaders for their local community governments at 110 chapters across the Navajo Nation. The Navajo Nation is about the size of West Virginia and spans three states, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. It is split into five agencies: Western, Chinle, Fort Defiance, Shiprock and Eastern. Within those agencies are chapter houses and they serve as local governments for surrounding communities. It is operated along the same lines as a city council. On Tuesday, Navajo voters elected chapter presidents, vice presidents, secretary-treasurers, commissioners, election supervisors, farming board members and grazing committee members. Local chapter elections are usually full of candidates campaigning until the polls close and free food is always nearby. Many of the candidates tend to share their platforms with Navajo voters while serving coffee, stew and frybread. But because of the coronavirus, the scene was different this year. There were no food stands set up in the chapter house parking lots or candidates hosting rallies for voters. The Navajo Election Administration and the Navajo Board of Election Supervisors implemented public health safety guidelines for voting at polling places and discouraged candidates from setting up food stands. Tribal voters were also encouraged to vote early or by absentee ballot to avoid large crowds and wait times on Election Day. At the Steamboat Chapter House as voters left their vehicles and walked toward the door, they were often greeted by an election official asking if they were voting in the chapter election or for Apache County. The Steamboat Chapter House served as a polling station for the state and national election on Tuesday. Chapter voters were directed toward the entrance of the chapter house on the right side of the building, while Apache County voters were directed toward an entrance on the left side of the building. Navajo voters waiting in line maintained social distancing, wore masks and often used the hand washing stations set up near chapter house entrance. Election officials also checked temperatures before voters entered the building. Andrew Simpson and his wife, Bessie Yellowhair Simpson, from Steamboat, showed up at the polls to observe while they waited for relatives to arrive from Phoenix to vote. They both voted early, but as community leaders, they enjoyed sticking around on Election Day. But rather than their usual hugs and handshakes, they both wore masks, waving to people from inside their truck or bumping elbows with the few who walked up to the truck window. Yellowhair Simpson occasionally walked the grounds to greet people or talk. She is currently the commission secretary-treasurer for the Steamboat Chapter and was up for reelection this election. She did not retain her seat,according to unofficial results. The husband and wife also believed that Election Day is a great way to build relationships among the Navajo people, but because of the pandemic, they have lost that. It has prevented them from leaving their house, Simpson said, and at 74 he is been told he is at high risk for contracting the coronavirus. The only time they leave home is to restock on essential items, so being at the polls on Tuesday gave them a chance to see and interact with people at a safe distance.“We just wanted to see people and our relatives,” Simpson said, and he is recognized most of them through their masks. “There is still life out here.”The unofficial results for the Navajo Nation Chapter General Election can be found on the Navajo Election Administrations web site atnavajoelections.navajo-nsn.gov.",2,1,AZ Central

From conception to creation, Solomon is acutely aware of her clothing, and wants to attract people who may discover her brand because they care about the environment but become customers because of its excellent design.

Aiming to create a relationship with the wearer of each item, the collection is inclusive of size and lifestyle while maintaining a strikingly modern approach.",1,1,Teen Vogue
548,Anxious Democrats float Plan B: Raise debt ceiling on party-line vote,-5.0,44.67,https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/22/politics/democrats-reaction-debt-ceiling/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-22,24,"A number of key Democrats say that their party should take matters into its own hands and raise the national debt limit by itself once Republicans block their plans as expected in the Senate, underscoring the lack of options facing the White House and Democratic leaders in the face of stiff GOP resistance. But going it alone would force Democrats to employ a time-consuming budget maneuver that would bog down both chambers – especially the Senate – and subject their members to a parade of politically charged vote swith the national debt approaching $29 trillion. And on Wednesday, the chairman of the House Budget Committee insisted that the procedural obstacles and time constraints would prevent the party from using the budget process to raise the debt ceiling in time to avoid a default, a bid aimed at pressuring top Republicans to agree to suspend the nation is borrowing limit in a bipartisan vote. Yet rank-and-file Democrats are growing increasingly worried about the mid-October deadline, nervous about the impact on consumers of a first-ever default on the national debt as well as the political backlash that members of both parties would almost certainly endure. And they say that party leaders should indeed take steps to raise the debt ceiling through the budget process, regardless of the obstacles they encounter along the way.“Oh, yeah,” said Representative Jim Cooper, a moderate Democrat from Tennessee, when asked if he’d support using the budget process to raise the debt ceiling if Republicans do not give them the votes in the Senate.“It is a top national priority to avoid default – it is no excuse,” Cooper told CNN on Wednesday. “So you got to do whatever it takes to avoid default. You cannot let America default. Period.”The powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal, told CNN he’d support taking steps to raise the debt ceiling with just Democratic votes through the budget process.“If we had to do it I would do that,” said Neal, who is a Massachusetts Democrat. “I mean that the idea that America would default on debt is so far removed from everything I have ever entertained or thought of since I have been here. I mean, I am stunned that we even have these moments.”The clock is ticking for Congress to get things done. Here is what to knowAsked again if he’d favor Democrats raising the debt ceiling the mselves if the GOP posture does not change, Neal reiterated: “I’d favor paying our debts, yes.”And Democratic Representative Haley Stevens, whose Michigan district has been targeted by Republicans for 2022, said when asked about raising the debt limit with just Democratic votes: “We have got to do what it takes to avoid a default.”The comments — echoed by a number of other House and Senate Democrats – could undercut the stiff position among Democratic leaders,who have so far refused to publicly consider using the budget process to raise the debt ceiling on a straight party-line vote. Instead, they have tied a suspension of the debt limit to a must-pass bill to fund the government by the September 30 deadline, daring Republicans to block it and risk a potentially catastrophic default and shutdown of federal agencies. Yet Republicans are not blinking, and only a handful have left open the possibility that they may support the stopgap measure – namely because the package includes billions in aid for communities hit hard by natural disasters,like in Louisiana.“Not 10, no,” said Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota when asked Wednesday if there would be enough Republicansto break a filibuster on the package. Pointing to roughly trillions more in taxes and spending that Democrats want to pass along straight party lines through the budget process, Thune said: “If they are going to do all that with 51 votes, they will be raising the debt ceiling with 51 votes.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California – and many other Democrats – have been furious at the GOP position, saying their party helped Republicans suspend the debt ceiling three times underthen-President Donald Trump, including after the 2017 approval of the GOP tax law through the same partisan budget process. And Democrats are quick to note that raising the debt ceiling allows the US to pay bills that have already been racked up. Democrats face GOP blockage on raising debt ceiling as time is running out“Are we hostage to Republicans who are threatening to blow up a part of the economic system because they want to do that for politics?” asked Senator Elizabeth Warren, a progressive Massachusetts Democrat who is a member of Schumer is leadership team. “That is just not where we should be as a nation.”Failure to raise the debt ceiling in time could halt payments that millions of Americans rely on, including paychecks to federal workers, Medicare benefits, military salaries, tax refunds, Social Security checks and payments to federal contractors. A memo circulated by the White House last week for state and local officials listed several programs that would be halted if Congress fails, including for disaster relief, Medicaid, the Children is Health Insurance Program, infrastructure, education, public health and child nutrition. Six former treasury secretaries urged congressional leadership to raise the debt limit on Wednesday, saying that an “unprecedented default” could “cause serious economic and national security harm” and “threaten economic growth.”On Tuesday, Schumer did not answer a question directly when asked if Democrats would raise the debt ceiling by the mselves if they had to, saying instead that it was imperative to do it along bipartisan lines, asTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen has sought. Representative John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat who is the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said Wednesday that he and his staff have studied the possibility that they could go through the reconciliation process to raise the debt limit – and he insisted that it is not possible to pull it off.“You ca not do it,” Yarmuth said Wednesday. “The problems are almost insurmountable. And you certainly could not do it in time to stave off a default.”Yarmuth also made clear the resistance from Pelosi.“I have rarely heard the speaker and leadership more adamant about anything that they are not going to do this through reconciliation,” Yarmuth said, referring to the budget process. Democratic leaders, moderates and progressives headed to the White House at critical moment for the Biden agendaDemocrats have largely resisted talking about what would come next if Republicans blocked their bill to increase the debt limit and fund the government through mid-December, arguing that Republicans have no other choice but to change their minds.“I have every confidence that the Republican Party – at least some of the m– will come to their senses and not allow us to default,” Senate Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, told reporters. Without GOP support, Democrats have two main options. One would allow them to revise their current budget resolution, a process that is rife with procedural hurdles. The other option would be to deploy a little-used part of the Budget Act, which allows them to increase the debt ceiling after approving a separate budget resolution in both chambers. It would take time to pursue and require Democrats to engage in two more rounds of so-called vote-a-ramas in the Senate, a marathon series of amendment votes on the floor that occurs only during the budget process. That route, however, would require Democrats to take some tough votes. Part of the resistance to increasing the debt ceiling has been that, unlike suspending the debt ceiling or pausing it, raising it would require Democrats to include an exact dollar figure of how much they want to increase the country is debt by. For Democrats running for reelection, that is a ready-made campaign ad that leadership is fully aware could be politically damaging. Still, some are arguing that raising the debt ceiling may not be as controversial as it used to be. Top Biden economic aides join Senate Democrat call in push before debt ceiling fightSenator Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat on the Budget Committee, told reporters that he does not have a strong feeling about how the debt ceiling gets raised, he just wants to make sure it happens. Other Democrats were hoping their leadership would repeatedly force Republicans to vote on legislation to increase the ceiling, and that included keeping the increase tied to the government funding bill.“It looks like we are going to have to give Republicans multiple chances to not terrorize the American economy,” said Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut. But if Republicans block the bill in the Senate, as expected, what exactly Democrats do remains to be seen – and many on Capitol Hill have little idea what is next.“We will sh*t little bricks,” said Representative John Garamendi, a California Democrat, when asked what Democrats would do if the GOP blocks the debt ceiling hike. He let out a laugh, the n walked onto the House floor.",2,1,CNN
549,Aspen-area party businesses warned not to violate health order,-1.0,46.33,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/aspen-area-party-businesses-warned-not-to-violate-health-order/,https://adfontesmedia.com/aspen-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-23,15,"Now that indoor private parties and gatherings have been prohibited through the holiday season, area businesses that service said soirees should take note. Pitkin County public health officials signaled a willingness this week to punish party rental outfits, caterers, parking valets and others who make their living off the Aspen area is traditionally numerous private holiday parties and events.“It is something we will be looking at,” Pitkin County Manager Jon Peacock told county board members Tuesday. “(But) private gatherings, frankly, are hard to catch.”Markey Butler, chair of the Pitkin County is health board, said Monday that catering companies that serve private parties this holiday season in violation of public health orders need to be told “we will yank their (business) licenses.”“That is a tough message,” said the former Snowmass Village mayor. “I am not real excited about having a lot of indoor events.”Aspen City Councilwoman Ann Mullins, an alternate health board member, said at Monday is board meeting she is seen party rental trucks in her neighborhood recently.“One truck asked for directions and I refused to give the m,” she said. Pitkin County Commissioner Patti Clapper said Tuesday that parking companies need to be notified of the health order rules and possible consequences for violating them.“Without enforcement, we really are not protecting the public health,” she said. Health board members decided Monday that Pitkin County is status on the state is COVID-19, color-coded restriction levels would remain at the Orange level. However, the board voted to voluntarily implement most Red level restrictions in the county — with two significant exceptions — starting Tuesday and lasting until at least January 4. Board members agonized over the decision for two-and-a-half hours before deciding that remaining in Orange would allow more local control over restrictions. Moving to Red, they determined, would not provide the wiggle room they wanted when they allowed restaurants to continue at 25% capacity and already-permitted indoor events through January 4 to move forward. In addition, once in Red, the county might find it difficult to get out of it. Board members called the new restrictions “Orange-plus-plus.” They do not allow indoor gatherings at all and require visitors and residents alike to socialize only with members of the same household whether in restaurants, hotels or private residences. Still, COVID-19 infection in Aspen and Pitkin County remained rampant Tuesday, and the state could move the county involuntarily into the Red zone if one of two other metrics — hospitalizations and the positivity rate — rise to Red levels. Pitkin County is incidence rate— which jumped again Tuesday to 1,509 — is the main concern and the metric that prompted the hand-wringing at Monday is meeting. The highest rate allowed under Red level restrictions is 350. More than a quarter of the county is 873 positive COVID-19 cases since March 1 have come in the past two weeks. The positivity rate was at 9% Tuesday, which was increasing but still in the Yellow level. One person with COVID symptoms was admitted to Aspen Valley Hospital on Monday, according to local epidemiology data. That remained in the comfortable level, though if three local residents are hospitalized in a day the state would move the county to Red. The concern over what to do about the county is growing infection rate — termed both “astronomical” and “exponential” Monday by the interim public health director — triggered a health board discussion about enforcement that spilled over into Tuesday is Board of County Commissioners meeting. On Monday, Pitkin County Commissioner Greg Poschman, also a board of health member, said he wanted totalk about a letter written by fellow health board member Dr. Tom Kurt on the subject of deputizing local public health order compliance officers. The suggestion prompted a strong reaction from Mullins.“I really do not support the idea of deputizing (compliance officers),” she said, citing the large amount of training police officers and sheriff is deputies receive. “I have strong reservations about deputizing anybody who wants to come out.”Poschman shot back that he “was not suggesting we just pull people off the street,” and Tuesday at the commissioner meeting groused that his idea had been shut down so quickly.“(Leadership on compliance) will have to come from this board,” he said. Just one business in town has faced serious consequences for defying public health orders during the entire pandemic, and that owner received only “a slap on the wrist,” Poschman said.“I heard he had a party on his rooftop the other night,” he said of the defiant business owner. “We need to make an example of someone before people take this seriously.”Peacock said public health officials have heard similar rumors about a party, though in a subsequent interview said he had no concrete information other than it may have occurred last weekend. Clapper proposed that compliance officers be able to shut down a non-compliant business or restaurant on the spot. Commissioner George Newman, however, said that could put a civilian in a “precarious and possibly harmful situation,” and said police must be called in the case of an immediate shut down. Commissioner Kelly McNicholas Kury asked if rangers working with the county is Open Space and Trails program could be moved into public health order compliance duties while their ranger jobs are curtailed during winter. Peacock said he’d look into it, though he also pointed out that the county plans to spend $146,000 doubling the number of consumer protection compliance officers in the coming weeks. With the vaccine beginning to be administered, it is unclear how long those new temporary workers will be needed, Peacock said Tuesday.“But even if we hired 25 new people … we ca not police everyone all the time, and we should not have to,” he said. Poschman on Monday also proposed a Pitkin County-wide curfew that would apply to everyone, not just businesses. He said he knew such action would be complicated, unfair and unenforceable, but felt it was nonetheless necessary.“I think we have to do this,” he said. Michael Goldberg, owner of Belly Up and Matsuhisa, said the idea had the support of some in the business community. Rather than “dumping people on the streets at 10” with nowhere to go, a full curfew leaves them no alternative but to go home, Goldberg said. Aspen Mayor Torre and Snowmass Village Mayor Bill Madsen wondered how a blanket curfew would be enforced. Madsen said the idea would need “buy-in” from the community because no municipality is going to send police officers chasing people around for curfew violations. Peacock said Tuesday that the county attorney is office also says a blanket curfew might not be enforceable. Further, in order for one to be implemented, officials must establish direct evidence showing it will bring down the infection risk, he said. One area of voluntary compliance that appears to be catching on is Pitkin County istraveler affidavit program. The effort requires overnight visitors to Aspen and the county to fill out an online form attesting that they have had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of traveling here. Residents who have been gone more than 10 days also must fill out the affidavit. Since the program began December 7, more than 9,400 people have submitted the forms as of Tuesday morning, Peacock said.“I am pleasantly surprised,” he said. “When we were rolling it out, we felt we would achieve a voluntary level of compliance, and I think we are getting that.”Poschman said he is heard from one traveler who canceled plans here when a member of the traveling group who was asymptomatic tested positive for the virus. He said he expected the person to be angry, and was relieved to find they were grateful.

The league warned teams that game forfeitures will only occur if the games cannot be rescheduled and will only affect the team that had the COVID-19 breakout.“Whether to reschedule a postponed game will be dependent on health and safety reasons at the recommendation of medical experts as well as considerations of stadium availability, schedule integrity, fan convenience, and other appropriate matters,” the league said in a memo Thursday, according to ESPN After the announcement, players around the league began to chime in, with the Arizona Cardinals’ star wide receiver DeAndre Hopkins saying the news was making him “question my future in the NFL.”The Los Angeles Rams’ cornerback Jalen Ramsay said he would not judge a teammate that decided to not get vaccinated.“Just because my teammate(s) personally decide not to get the vaccine, I will not think they are a bad teammate,” Los Angeles Rams corner backJalen Ramsaysaid after the announcement. While several games were rescheduled in 2020 due to COVID-19 breakouts, none were canceled and at times, teams played their scheduled games without multiple players who tested positive. The NFL said that 75% of the league is players had been vaccinated, with each individual team having vaccination rates above 80%, as of Thursday.

Fifty-five percent (55%) of Hispanic respondents, 50% of white respondents and 46% of Black respondents said they were concerned about the COVID vaccine, and 39% of Hispanics, 29% of Black respondents and 26% of white respondents voiced their concern over vaccines in general. Nearly 80% of Texans said they know somebody who has tested positive for COVID and nearly half (47%) said they know somebody who has died from the virus. Joshua Blank, a research director for Texas Lyceum, highlighted that while 40% of respondents said they have “a lot” of confidence in healthcare providers’ ability to operate safely during the pandemic, that certainly was not the case for other businesses. No other businesses, including grocery stores, churches, public schools, local merchants and airports, received “a lot” of confidence from more than a quarter of Texans. Get the latest breaking news from North Texas and beyond. “This really is the challenge for not only government and public health officials, but for businesses too,” Blank said during a zoom presser. “... If after 10 months, knowing what we know now, people still do not have a lot of confidence in the ability to patronize a business safely, well the only solution is a vaccine. And what we are seeing is that half of Texas is not sure if they are getting a vaccine and they are concerned about the safety of it.”Blank added that this is something that every level of government, businesses and “really anyone who is willing” needs to begin getting this message out if Texans want the state to have a strong recovery from the pandemic. Texas Lyceum is a nonprofit and nonpartisan Texas organization that conducts an annual poll in order to better understand public opinion. The survey polled 1,200 adults in the state from January 8-17, 1,000 of which were contacted by live interviews over the phone. They also conducted an additional 200 online interviews of unregistered adults. Out of the 1,200 respondents, 835 self reported as registered voters. Immigration and border security were the state is top concerns in 2020, but fell out of the top five in 2021 as the pandemic, political disruption, health care, the economy and unemployment rounded out the top five problems facing Texas, according to the survey. When it comes to both the national and state economy, the survey found that this is something Texans’ outlook is undoubtedly bleak on. Only 24% of respondents said they believe the state economy is better off than the national economy compared to 40% of Texans who said the national economy is in a better place than Texas’. Daron Shaw, the founder of the poll, pointed out that these numbers are a dramatic change from the poll is findings in the midst of the Great Recession.“If you go back to 2009 at the height of the last great recession, 64% of respondents said that they felt the Texas economy was better off than the national economy,” Shaw said. “So for me, the standout result from this poll is that Josh and I refer to the bullishness that Texans have with respect to how Texas is handling things.”That bullishness is not quite as evident now in response to the pandemic and the economic consequences of the pandemic as it was back in 2009, Shaw said. Additionally, only 15% said their family is economic standing has improved over the previous year and just 34% of Texans believe their children will be better off economically in the future than they are currently. When broken down by race, the poll showed that Hispanics (60%) were more likely to know somebody who has died from COVID than white (41%) and Black (40%) respondents. When it comes to confidence regarding job status, 57% of white Texans said they are very confident that they will be employed at the end of the year, though that number dropped to 42% for Hispanic Texans and 36% for Black Texans. Additional challenges for Texans with children under the age of 18 were also revealed in the survey. Aside from the increase in care giving responsibilities, Texas care givers also face the conundrum of whether or not to send children to school during the pandemic. Only 32% of adults with children at home said they feel safe sending their kids to school, 21% lower than parents who said they do not feel safe doing so. White care givers (44%) felt the safest in sending children to school, compared to 27% of Black care givers and 23% of Hispanic caregivers. The overall margin of error on the survey is +/- 2.83 %",1,2,Dallas Morning News

Congress will certify Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 election. There were some 140 Republican House members who said they would object. Sens.

There would be an objection to the allocation of a specific state is electoral votes, both chambers would break off to hold separate sessions with up to two hours of debate, and a final vote would be held on the matter. This was expected to happen at least three times. It was going to be an hours-long affair. Not the case. Both sessions had to recess because Trump supporters stormed the Capitol Building yesterday. They quickly overwhelmed the Capitol Police. They vandalized the offices. They duked it out with police in the rotunda; tear gas was deployed. They entered the Senate chamber. They tried to bust onto the House floor, but police barricaded the door with guns drawn. It led to a nonstop media meltdown. All the narratives were hurled against the wall about how these protesters were domestic terrorists, traitors, insurrectionists, and how this is what happens when a president peddled conspiracy the ories and not fact. Oh yeah, you bet they tried to blame Trump for this event. And what happens later, the media, who had just slammed the peddling of conspiracy the ories, serve up a whopper about the Capitol Police. You see,these protesters storm the Capitol Building. There is no evidence to back this up. This is the crack pipe nonsense from liberal media outlets and their allies.

In a statement on Saturday, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said Washington had “deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of theCOVID-19investigation were communicated and questions about the process used to reach them.”“It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government,” he said, referring to the WHO mission investigating the origins of the pandemic in the central city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected late in 2019.“To better understand this pandemic and prepare for the next one, China must make available its data from the earliest days of the outbreak.” Sullivan is statement said. China responded Sunday with a statement from its Washington Embassy that said the US had already “gravely damaged international co-operation on COVID-19” and was now “pointing fingers at other countries who have been faithfully supporting the WHO and at the WHO itself.”While it welcomed PresidentJoe Biden‘s decision to reverse the Trump administration is move to leave the WHO, China hopes the US will “hold itself to the highest standards, take a serious, earnest, transparent and responsible attitude, shoulder its rightful responsibility, support the WHO is work with real actions and make due contribution to the international co-operation on COVID-19,” the statement said. Following allegations of Chinese withholding of data in The New York Times and other media outlets, investigation team member Peter Daszak tweeted, “This was NOT my experience on @WHO mission.”This was NOT my experience on@WHOmission. As lead of animal/environment working group I found trust & openness w/ my China counterparts. We DID get access to critical new data throughout. We DID increase our understanding of likely spillover pathways.— Peter Daszak (@PeterDaszak)February 13, 2021“As lead of animal/environment working group I found trust & openness w/ my China counterparts. We DID get access to critical new data throughout. We DID increase our understanding of likely spillover pathways,” Daszak tweeted. Another team member, Thea Koelsen Fischer of Denmark, also said that had not been her experience and implied some comments had been misrepresented in the media.“We DID build up a good relationship in the Chinese/Int Epi-team! Allowing for heated arguments reflects a deep level of engagement in the room. Our quotes are intendedly twisted casting shadows over important scientific work,” Fischer tweeted. While in Wuhan, Koelsen Fischer said she did not get to see the raw data and had to rely on an analysis of the data that was presented to her. But she said that would be true in most countries. The British-born Daszak, a zoologist who now works in New York, affirmed Fischer is remarks, tweeting: “It is disappointing to spend time w/ journalists explaining key findings of our exhausting month-long work in China, to see our colleagues selectively misquoted to fit a narrative that was prescribed before the work began. Shame on you ?nytimes.”Daszak had previously worked with the deputy director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Shi Zhengli, to track down the origins of severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, which originated in China and led to the 2003 outbreak of the disease. He earlier told The Associated Press that the WHO team enjoyed a greater level of openness than they had anticipated, and that they were granted full access to all sites and personnel they requested. The 10-nation WHO team last week departed Wuhan after nearly a month. It visited markets, hospitals and research centres, including the highly secure Wuhan Institute of Virology that has been the subject of speculation because of its large collection of bat virus specimens. In their comments while in China, team members said they had some new insights into the origins of the pandemic that has killed more than 2.3 million people, but that major questions are still unanswered. The mission was intended to be an initial step in the process of understanding the origins of the virus, which scientists have posited may have passed to humans through a wild animal, such as a pangolin or bamboo rat. They said transmission directly from bats to humans or through the trade in frozen food products are also possibilities, but an alternate theory that the virus leaked from a Chinese lab was unlikely. The WHO team is visit was politically sensitive for Beijing, which is concerned about being blamed for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak. An AP investigation has found that the Chinese government put limits on research into the outbreak and ordered scientists not to speak to reporters.",2,2,Global News

558,Exclusive — Pence: Biden is ‘Bad Policy’ Could Derail Pandemic Recovery,18.67,25.0,https://www.breitbart.com/economy/2021/07/18/exclusive-mike-pence-bidens-bad-policy-threatens-short-circuit-american-recovery/,https://adfontesmedia.com/breitbart-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"DES MOINES, Iowa — Former Vice President Mike Pence told Breitbart News exclusively that Democrat President Joe Biden is “bad policy,” including his $1.9 trillion coronavirus aid package and massive new spending proposals under consideration in Congress, could derail economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. Pence is comments came in a wide-ranging interview Friday evening about the Biden agenda and the upcoming midterm elections at the Family Leadership Summit after he gave remarks to a crowd of about a thousand Christian conservatives in downtown Des Moines, Iowa. While Pence has made a number of speeches since leaving office on January 20 this year, this interview with Breitbart News is his first since he left office.“The extension of, the plus-up on unemployment benefits by the Biden administration has worked a real hardship on small businesses and our recovery,” Pence said. “Look, this economy started to recover in the summer of 2020 demonstrating the resilience of the American people and the rightness of our agenda. With tax cuts, and rolling back regulations, and unleashing American energy, and America First trade deals, we had laid a foundation within the first three years that created 7 million jobs. I believe it also was the foundation on which America has made this historic recovery and in so many ways what the Biden administration has done and continues to do — and adding to that they are pushing for the largest tax increase in 50 years to pass the largest spending bill in American history — I think what the Biden administration is doing threatens to short-circuit the American recovery we all long to see and that is underway. It is. But I think the fact that inflation is now rising at the most rapid pace in 13 years is evidence of the fact that markets are starting to respond to the big government solutions — higher taxes, more regulation — being planned and coming out of this administration. That is why we got to fight back and fight back hard.”Pence said he is “incredibly proud” of House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy for holding House Republicans together “in opposing the radical left agenda of [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi.” He pointed specifically to that $1.9 trillion coronavirus spending plan, passed in March along purely partisan lines in both the US House and Senate, that extended the newly-created federal unemployment benefits program that, at the beginning of the pandemic, supplemented similar state benefits. Combined, the federal and state benefits collected together could often pay people more to not work than to actually work — something that has led to small businesses like restaurants and stores across America having trouble hiring employees. The federal government never before offered supplemental unemployment insurance benefits. But, at the beginning of the pandemic, the Trump administration — with support on a bipartisan basis in Congress — passed such benefits. The program, meant to be temporary as the government was literally telling people to stay home and not work, was extended as part of the partisan plan Biden pushed at the beginning of his presidency. Pence ripped Biden for turning this into a partisan matter.“Even in the early vote on COVID [Chinese coronavirus] relief, they were able to stand united in opposition to a massive spending bill which really was a betrayal of the whole posture our administration had taken during the pandemic with regard to Congress,” Pence said. “Every bill we passed for COVID in Congress passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities. We said we are going to check politics at the door. Everything we did, everything we did was bipartisan. For President Biden and [Senate Majority Leader Chuck] Schumer and Pelosi right out of the gate to abandon the bipartisan precedent we had established in combatting the coronavirus pandemic I thought was a betrayal of everything we’d done to bring the Congress together around a united effort to end the pandemic.”It is not just the economic recovery that Biden is bungling, though, Pence said. When it comes to the vaccine, Pence said Biden should give former President Donald Trump and the previous administration credit for developing the vaccine — and getting the rollout up to speed — as there were a million shots a day being administered by the time Trump and Pence left office. Pence said that he does believe Americans generally see through Biden is politicization of the pandemic.“I could not be more proud of what the American people accomplished over the last year and a half,” Pence said. “Only in America, in the face of a global pandemic, could we reinvent testing from a standing start and do a billion tests within a matter of months. Only in America could you stand up a supply chain and enlist companies to manufacture medical company [sic] and fly medical equipment from all around the world so that no American was ever denied the healthcare that they need facing this pandemic. And only in America could you have the kind of research companies and the kind of innovation at the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] that would permit the development of the rapeutics and vaccines within nine months. We when we first sat down, when I first became head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we called all of the heads of all of the major pharmaceutical and research companies in — we were in the Cabinet Room. I remember the President asking them how long it would take to get a vaccine? Vaccines take five to seven years, if you can get one. We all said ‘not good enough — what do you need? What needs to happen?’ And that is where the idea of clearing the way for FDA review and approval without shortcut ting safety measures and initiating the idea for Operation Warp Speed because early on we were hearing that several of these vaccines showed very promising returns in the early Phase One trials. We just made the decision we will pay you to go ahead and manufacture millions of doses so that, if it is approved, we will not wait another year for you to manufacture. The combination of all of those things is an American accomplishment”“The fact that the Biden-Harris administration, that spent much of the campaign talking down a vaccine developed under the Trump-Pence administration, now has seen its way clear to ignore our administration is efforts is disappointing but not surprising,” Pence lamented. “The thing is, I think the American people see through it. Everywhere I go—today I had a man come alongside me at a picnic I was at in Western Iowa. It was tough. He told me he lost his wife to COVID But he wanted to express his appreciation to me. I was very moved. I told him ‘I will be praying for you and I am very sorry for your loss.’ He said ‘I just still wanted to thank you for what you have done and what the vaccine has meant for other people.’ I just honestly believe the Biden-Harris administration would do well to give credit where credit is due, first to the American people and second to efforts of a prior administration to demonstrate everything we have accomplished putting the health of the American people first in this pandemic is a tribute to the American people and American innovation and only in America could we be at a place where we are today where America is coming back and we are seeing life returning to normal. I flew out to my daughter is wedding not long ago and could not barely get through the airport and I just found myself walking through the airport thinking ‘Only in America.’”With the upcoming midterm elections, Pence said that Republicans can turn the tide and slam the door shut on the Biden agenda. To retake the US House majority, Republicans only need to flip a net five seats from Democrat hands into GOP hands and, to retake the Senate majority, the GOP only needs to flip a net one seat.“We have seen this movie before. I was in Congress in 2010 with a Democrat president, a Democrat Senate, and a Democrat House,” Pence said. “What we did was we brought Republicans together around a unified conservative agenda and we stood strong against the Pelosi majority and we won 63 seats in the House of Representatives in 2010. We won the Senate a few years later and the White House two years after that. I think we are going to do it all again in the next three and a half years.”Pence said he is noticing “buyer is remorse across America” with regard to Democrat control in Washington and the Biden agenda.“I heard about it today when I was in western Iowa,” Pence said. “One of the families I met with spoke of a friend who voted for the Biden-Harris ticket and now admitted she was wrong. People see that what Biden is attempting to do is not advance kind of traditional Democrat policies but is literally trying to transform the country into a European-style welfare state.”Pence the n called one Biden administration proposal — the implementation of an international minimum corporate tax rate, whereby other countries and the USs would agree to tax entities at the same levels at least and the US would essentially be handing control over tax rates over to some international community entity — “downright un-American.”“You look at the international minimum corporate tax rate that is being orchestrated and discussed with powers around the country that I think is unconstitutional — the power to tax falls squarely with the government and the power to initiate taxes falls squarely with the USs House of Representatives,” Pence said. “The idea that the Treasury Secretary or the Biden administration could negotiate with President Macron to establish a minimum corporate tax rate that would be imposed on our companies is downright un-American. But I think your point is well taken that what the administration is advancing is agenda that is destined to short-circuit the economy but more than that it is an attempt to transform America into a fundamentally different place than it is ever been before.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced this past week that he intends to try to force a vote on the so-called “Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework” — for which there still is no bill text — this coming week in the US Senate. Combined with that, the Democrats in Congress and the Biden administration are backing a separate but parallel plan that would spend another $3.5 trillion through reconciliation — which allows them to use a budget gimmick to pass bills out of the Senate with a simple majority. Pence warned his Republican friends in the US Senate against going along with this plan.“With regard to the infrastructure bill, I will just tell you during my years in Congress I always thought it was good to let your yes be yes and let your no be no,” Pence said. “And I’d rather Republicans in the Senate simply made it clear that unless all the Green New Deal stuff is out, they are not voting for an infrastructure bill. I think there is great risk in a two-bill strategy that could result in us seeing them advance the radical left is climate change agenda. I would encourage Republicans to think really hard before going along with a first infrastructure bill as it might pave the way for policies that have very little to do with infrastructure but will stifle American prosperity for generations.”Pence also, as he did in his speech here, told Breitbart News about how during the Trump administration the USs became energy independent — and a net exporter of energy — for the first time in 70 years. But, he said, Biden has already undermined that.“America is the Saudi Arabia of natural gas,” Pence said. “This administration, with its climate change agenda, has set itself against the American people permitting to use the resources of our land in an environmentally responsible way. But what is incomprehensible to me is that President Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline but approved the Russian pipeline to western Europe. Think about that? One of your first acts in office is to kill a natural gas pipeline in the USs of America — one that had been tied up for years, one that we cleared the way on, and one that would add to our energy infrastructure — and the n to allow Nordstream 2 to go forward? We have tens of thousands of troops in western Europe ostensibly under the mission of NATO protecting Europe from Russian aggression. The idea that they would now pave the way for European countries to become dependent on Russia for natural gas — it is incomprehensible to me. What we ought to be doing is seeing our European trading partners building ports to be able to import natural gas from the USs of America. Again, what you are seeing is I think an administration that is lapsing back into the bad policy decisions of the past and they were policy decisions that the American people were glad to see our administration overturn to the benefit of an incredible boom economy before the coronavirus pandemic struck.”Pence also ripped the Biden administration — and specifically his successor as vice president, Kamala Harris — for mishandling the border crisis.“The Biden-Harris administration took the most secure border in American history and has turned it into the worst immigration crisis in my lifetime,” Pence said. “Suspending construction on the wall, ending the policies that we put into effect that had ended asylum abuse, I thought it was one of the signature accomplishments of our administration. President Trump tapped me and Secretary of State [Mike] Pompeo to sit down in the Roosevelt Room and negotiate out an agreement that anyone applying for asylum in the USs would be required to remain in Mexico. It had been talked about for years and years and in the early years of our administration the Mexicans were only allowing it on a fraction of their border, so President Trump said ‘we are going to tariff everything coming across the border from Mexico unless you agree to the remain in Mexico policy.’ The secretary of state and I sat down with the Mexican foreign minister and the ambassador and, over the course of several days, we negotiated and secured a remain in Mexico agreement for the entire southern border. That, which essentially ended catch and release on the southern border, sent a message to the northern triangle countries of Central America that the opportunity to game the system was over.”",0,1,Breitbart
559,Fighting in Gaza Marks the Start of a More Violent Era,-4.33,42.33,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/middle-east/2021-05-19/fighting-gaza-marks-start-more-violent-era,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-19,17,"At some point soon, the current military conflict between Israel and Hamas will end. But the ramifications of this latest round of Israeli-Palestinian confrontation—Israeli military strikes in Gaza, Hamas rocket attacks on Israeli cities, and rising intercommunal violence between Arabs and Jews—will be long-lasting and profound. Above all, it will reinforce the sense among Israelis, Palestinians, and most of the international community that the search for a peaceful resolution to the conflict has come to an end for the foreseeable future. The conflict that began in early May was not planned. It was the culmination of various small but important steps that, while linked, did not make violence inevitable. Yet a combination of domestic Israeli and Palestinian political dynamics, international failures, and worsening relations between the two sides created the right conditions for bloodshed. Yet whatever its accidental quality, the latest round of violence will have enduring consequences. Hamas will emerge from the conflict stronger and the Palestinian Authority (PA) and its president weaker. Violence between Israeli Arabs and Jews will eventually abate, but Arab perceptions of systemic discrimination will grow—as will a belief that a search for equality within Israel is inherently futile. Jerusalem is symbolic role will also expand, deepening the conflict is religious dimensions. Among many Israelis and Palestinians, these developments mark the return to an older phase of the conflict. The last two weeks have reinforced a belief that their relationship is again existential and zero-sum, that diplomacy to resolve the conflict is futile and violence inevitable. The current confrontation is unfolding across four the aters. The Gaza-Israeli military bombardment has destroyed civilian infrastructure and killed more than 200 Palestinians, 30 percent of them children, and ten Israelis. Ethnonational tensions within Israel have sparked unprecedented intercommunal riots and violence between Arabs and Jews. Palestinians and Israeli police, extreme Jewish nationalist-religious groups, and settlers are in a standoff in East Jerusalem over access to Muslim holy places and the planned evictions of Arab families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. And in the West Bank, tensions are high after Israeli forces killed fourPalestinian demonstrators and injured dozens more on May 18, a day of protest that engulfed major Palestinian cities. Nonetheless, tensions there remain contained by joint PA and Israeli efforts. These dynamics have been building since Israel invaded Gaza in 2014. That war marked the end of any real hope of striking a deal to end the conflict, as the n US Secretary of State John Kerry had been working to do. After 2014, relations between both sides worsened and the prospect of a two-state solution gradually diminished. With the realization that a peaceful outcome was impossible in the short to medium term, the Israeli right began to assert itself—especially after the election of Donald Trump as US president in 2016. Trump is policies emboldened many Israeli conservatives and cleared the way for extreme anti-Palestinian policies. Israeli settlers began expanding into new areas of the West Bank, and Israel began routinely confiscating Palestinian land and demolishing homes along the way. By 2019–20, many Israelis had begun to demand the annexation of wide swaths of new territory without granting equal rights to Palestinian citizens. Adding insult to injury, several Arab states also began to normalize relations with Israel, eventually concluding the so-called Abraham Accords in 2020. As Arab states’ solidarity with the Palestinian cause receded, Palestinians the mselves felt increasingly abandoned. These pressures were particularly apparent in Jerusalem. After Washington is 2017 recognition of the city as Israel is capital, Israel increased the pace of illegal annexation and stepped up its efforts to change the status quo in the Old City is holy places. Israeli police restricted Palestinian access to the al Aqsa compound, attempted to silence the call for prayer, and began granting access to larger numbers of Jewish Israelis. Authorities also moved to evict Arab East Jerusalemites from their homes and began to assert a more dominant Jewish nationalist-religious agenda throughout the city. Inside Israel itself, the emboldened right wing also took steps to marginalize Israeli Arab citizens. Many among this latter group saw the 2018 so-called nation-state bill—which declares Israel the historic homeland of the Jewish people, establishes Hebrew as the only official language, and asserts that Jewish settlements are a “national value”—as yet another means of discriminating against Israeli Arabs to the benefit of Israeli Jews. Two years later, an amendment that would have added equality for minorities to the law, reducing the chance that it might be used to legitimize legal discrimination against Israeli Arabs, was voted down in the Knesset—Israel is parliament. Right-wing politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also routinely incite hatred and fear against Israeli Arabs and their representatives in the Knesset. A dramatic rise in crime rates in Arab communities, moreover, compounds already existing socioeconomic problems. Palestinian politics has been plagued by its own series of setbacks. Over the past several years, the PA has severely undermined the public is faith in its ability to govern. Having held no general elections since 2006, the Palestinian Authority has damaged the rule of law, weakened the judiciary, curtailed media freedoms, and shrunk the space for civil society as organizations lost much of their independence from the government. The result is increasing public discontent and overwhelming demands for PA President Mahmoud Abbas to resign. Hamas is behavior in the Gaza Strip has been no better. Unbothered by constitutional principles, norms, and rule of law, it has grown increasingly ruthless. Two weeks ago, these conflicting Israeli-Palestinian and intra-Palestinian dynamics finally collided. The earliest and most obvious trigger was Israel is policies toward Muslim holy places in Jerusalem is Old City and its demographic battle against Palestinians in the rest of occupied East Jerusalem. This set the stage for small confrontations during Ramadan between Palestinians, Israeli police, and right-wing extremists in the Old City over the changes at Haram al-Sharif (the Temple Mount) and access to the Damascus Gate. Another flash point was the Shaikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem. In a pattern repeated throughout the occupied city, many Palestinian residents faced imminent eviction from their own homes by Jewish settlers. East Jerusalemites, other Palestinians, and many Israeli Arabs mobilized in response—launching a series of limited and essentially nonviolent protests. A separate trigger was the Israeli decision to prevent Palestinian elections, planned for May 22, from taking place in East Jerusalem—despite its obligation to facilitate them under the terms of the Oslo accords struck in 1993. The Israeli decision was apparently unrelated to the elections the mselves (Israel declared it had no intention of interfering in the process as a whole). Instead, the move was seen as an attempt to deny Palestinian claims to occupied East Jerusalem, even though Israel had already acknowledged such claims in three previous elections. It was this Israeli move that proved most relevant to the timing of the current confrontation. Ostensibly in response to Israel is decision, Abbas decided to cancel the May PA elections entirely‚ promising to hold them only once Israel agreed to walk back its original plan. This only multiplied internal Palestinian tensions, however. Almost all other Palestinian electoral lists and candidates rejected the decision, including Hamas. Most parties suspected that the real motive was Abbas is realization that he would lose the race and be forced to share control of parliament with three prominent Fatah defectors: Muhammad Dahlan, Marwan Barghouti, and Nasser al-Qudwa. Abbas is opponents argued that Palestinians should not grant Israel veto power over their elections. They instead favored forcing Israel to accept a vote in East Jerusalem through nonviolent electoral campaigns and voting drives in al Aqsa and other mosques, churches, and UN and diplomatic missions. The final trigger for the current round of violence was Hamas is inability to forge a joint alliance against Abbas is election cancellation, despite widespread opposition to it. Although the group reached out to other electoral lists seeking their support, none wanted to be seen as Hamas is allies. This dealt a heavy blow to Hamas is long-term strategy. By reintegrating itself into the PA political process through elections, the group had sought to restore its legitimacy and free itself from the burden of governing the Gaza Strip. With that strategy in tatters, a more militant Hamas leadership took the lead. The Israeli police escalation at al Aqsa and imminent evictions in Shaikh Jarrah provided the opportunity to achieve two goals: The first was to punish Abbas and make him politically irrelevant. The second was to punish Israel for its anti-Palestinian policies in East Jerusalem and its decision to halt elections in the city. In achieving those two goals, Hamas sought to demonstrate to Palestinians and others that while Abbas ran away from a battle over Jerusalem, Hamas would stand with its residents. Indeed, the group was willing to risk war in Gaza to defend the city and the al Aqsa mosque. Eventually, on May 10, Hamas issued an ultimatum: if Israel did not withdraw its police and military personnel from the mosque and Shaikh Jarrah, the group would attack. Minutes after the deadline passed, Hamas began targeting Israeli towns with rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, triggering retaliatory Israeli airstrikes. Hamas did not unleash the current confrontation. It merely capitalized on rising tensions to make the case for replacing Abbas. Israel is decision to cancel the election in East Jerusalem and Abbas is subsequent move to cancel the entire process set off a chain reaction that neither side anticipated. If elections had gone ahead as planned, confrontations in East Jerusalem would have intensified but likely remained nonviolent. Hamas, Fatah, and other electoral lists would have been too busy mobilizing their electoral constituencies against the Israeli police and extremist settlers; Hamas would not have risked a war in Gaza that might have halted electoral preparations, the reby destroying its opportunity to reintegrate itself into the formal political process. Without elections, however, the stage was set for violence. How will the current confrontation affect the prospects for a long-term peace? On the Israeli-Palestinian front, the two-state solution might have received a mortal blow. Given Israeli efforts to marginalize Abbas and the PA, it will not be easy to keep the West Bank out of the next conflict or even the current one. Security coordination between Israel and the PA will not be enough to contain the rising flames. And given the rhetoric around annexation, no right-wing Israeli government will be willing or able to renew a political process that would require negotiations with the PA leadership, even for small incremental steps. Domestically, Abbas will manage to stay in office only as long as he can prevent elections from taking place. Yet with rising popular discontent, the PA security services’ ability to maintain control and quell discontent is diminishing. The PA might find itself the target of an angry public. Abbas, the PA, and the Palestinian national movement will lose what little public trust they still hold. Elections and political reforms are the only means of making the system legitimate and accountable again. Those who reject elections because Abbas will lose or because the process might legitimize Hamas should consider the consequences. Ignoring the problem and keeping Hamas cornered in the Gaza Strip is no solution. There should be no illusion about the role of the international community here. At best, Arab states and others, including Washington, can help manage the conflict only by making the status quo sustainable. They do not, however, have the capacity or political will to force Israel to respect international law or Abbas and the PA to respect the norms of good governance. As hard as it may be, Israelis and Palestinians must do that the mselves.",1,2,Foreign Affairs

562,Arizonans set record for expanded jobless benefit claims as program is expiration looms,-3.0,48.0,https://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/jobs/2020/07/22/arizonans-set-record-expanded-jobless-benefit-claims-program-nears-deadline/5476629002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/az-central-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,24,"Arizonans filed a record-high number of claims for expanded federal unemployment benefits leading up to what could be the final week of the program in its current form. Arizonans filed 249,000 initial claims over the week ending July 18 under the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which pays a $600 weekly supplement in addition to what jobless individuals receive from the state. Those figures, provided by the state Department of Economic Security, were up from more than 230,000 PUA claims in Arizona during the week ending July 11 and represent the highest total so far. The federal program began earlier this year to ease financial pressures for workers suffering layoffs or reduced hours from COVID-19 and economy-shutting measures to contain the pandemic. It expires July 25. In addition, Arizonans filed 24,973 initial claims in the latest week for state benefits that max out at $240 a week. Claims for these lower benefits have been fairly steady for the past couple of months. Arizona benefits are not affected by the federal expiration date. The question remains if Congress will act to expand the federal jobless supplement, along with deciding whether to authorize another round of stimulus checks or additional assistance to businesses, state and local governments, or other entities. Some form of extended federal jobless aid is considered likely, but an agreement has not been reached yet on how much will be paid in benefits, and to whom.""Even in a highly polarized environment, it is likely that a bill will be passed as neither political party will want to be blamed for sinking a bill containing much-needed relief,"" wrote David Kelly, chief global strategist for JPMorgan Funds in a commentary. The House of Representatives, controlled by Democrats, passed the HEROES Act earlier this year. That legislation would maintain the current $600 weekly payments. Republican leaders in Congress have proposed reducing the amount so as not to disincentivize certain people from returning to work. Negotiations continue in Washington. David Wells, research director at the Grand Canyon Institute in Phoenix, said he expects the ultimate package might amount to a compromise benefit somewhere around $400 a week. Another unknown revolves around when the legislation might be passed and implemented. That might not happen until well into August, which could put financial pressure on millions of jobless people even if benefits are paid retroactively.""People still have bills to pay,"" Wells said. The Grand Canyon Institute released a report Wednesday urging Arizona to update its own unemployment insurance program. At a maximum of $240, weekly benefits here are the second-lowest in the nation, exceeding only the $235 weekly payments available by Mississippi. Thereportby the a self-described centrist think tank claims that Arizona is meager jobless payments have cost the state between $1 billion and $1.9 billion in lost economic activity since April. In most states, unemployment insurance programs are designed to replace about one-half of lost wages for typical workers, Wells said. But in Arizona, the benefits replace only about one-quarter of lost wages. Also, Arizona provides little flexibility for people when their job income is reduced, the report continued. In other words, Arizona does not offer much in the way of an ""earnings allowance"" — the amount of money people can make before jobless benefits are reduced. This is relevant for those who return to work part time, the institute noted. This combination of a low benefit cap and a low earnings allowance leads to a complete benefit disqualification for between 50,000 and 110,000 Arizonans each week, which would not be the case if they lived in most other states, the report said. Roughly 90% of this assistance, if provided, would have been paid by the federal government. The institute called on Governor Dougr Ducey and state legislators to update Arizona is unemployment insurance system, calling it ""one of the worst in the nation.""The Department of Economic Security said initial claims under both the federal and state programs amounted to nearly 274,000 for the week ending July 18, a record-high total. Continuing (as opposed to initial) claims under both programs in Arizona came to 3.03 million, another record, for the week ending July 18, with the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program accounting for 2.79 million of those. The department cautions that there might be duplication in the counts between the state and federal programs, possibly because of people filing claims multiple times out of confusion, frustration or for other reasons. That new claims for Arizona jobless benefits have mostly leveled out in recent weeks might indicate Arizona is tourism sector has not been hit as hard as those of many other states, said David Shideler, chief research officer at Heartland Forward, which tracks economic activity in middle America. In part, he said, this might be because many tourists come to Arizona mainly to see the Grand Canyon and other outdoor attractions, for which social distancing is not as much of a concern compared with, for example, museums, the me parks and other more urban attractions.",2,1,AZ Central

While several mainstream media accounts portrayed the group as friendly helpers, the stories could not explain why they were loading up so many cans of gas and why the Riot Kitchen crew fled from police. Sam, an Indian immigrant who owns a family-run car dealership downtown, lost “every dime” he had, and the 20 people Sam employed have all lost their jobs “for nothing.” Sam said his family had been “in tears” for days after rioters burned his lot two nights in a row, destroying all the cars, and looting his office before burning that as well. Sam is an Indian immigrant who owns a family-run car dealership that was destroyed by BLM arsonists. “What did we do to deserve all this?” said Sam.pic.twitter.com/hgDjbIq9pA— The Federalist (@FDRLST)August 29, 2020“I am a taxpayer,” said Sam, distraught that law enforcement did nothing to protect his business, which was left to the mercy of the mob. “This is not the America I came into. … What did we do to deserve all this?” he asked. “I am a minority too. I am a brown person. I have nothing to do with this.”Contrary to what Wallace implied, neither did white supremacists or militia groups. Black Lives Matter rioters were in fact proud to take credit. Sam told The Federalist that more than a week after the Blake shooting, Black Lives Matter rioters came back to his shop in broad daylight to make “music videos” in the wreckage of his business “like they were so proud of it,” taunting him with, “this is what you get.”Desperate pleas for mercy from the rioters confirmed who was instigating the violence. If business owners were trying to avoid losing everything to white supremacists, they would not have displayed placards signaling support for BLM and signs reading “minority-owned” in their storefronts — yet that is exactly what they did. Like many other media figures and Democrats, Wallace seemed to be cherry-picking one instance of violence from a demonstrator linked to the political right, at the expense of accurately covering the rampant lawlessness instigated by leftist extremists. Kyle Rittenhousebecame the face of so-called right-wing violence in Kenosha. Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old Hispanic boy who worked as a lifeguard in Kenosha, saw the destruction and violence and picked up his AR-15 to patrol the streets. In a video shot around 10 p.m., Rittenhouse explained his purpose, saying, “People are getting injured, and our job is to protect this business, and part of my job is also to help people. If the re is somebody hurt, I am running into harm is way. That is why I have my rifle, because I need to protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit.”Later that night, things escalated when three shootings left two people dead and another injured. Police apprehended Rittenhouse, the alleged shooter. Videos capturing the shootings suggest Rittenhouse might have been justified in self-defense. Whether Rittenhouse, an Illinois native, belonged in Kenosha in the first place is debatable, but nothing suggests the boy was motivated by white supremacy or was part of a larger militia group. In fact, the Anti-Defamation League found no evidence he was or is connected to any extremist movements. Yet Democrats and their friends in the corporate media, such as Wallace, have tried to paint Rittenhouse as a “white supremacist” in order to de flect all blame from the real agitators, left-wing groups such as BLM and Antifa. Rittenhouse is guilt has not been confirmed in a court of law, yet Wallace defamed him with gross charges of racism on national television with 29 million people watching. Biden did the same on social media in a wholly inappropriate smear. On Monday, Bidentweeteda video featuring Rittenhouse, with the caption, “There is no other way to put it: the President of the USs refused to disavow white supremacists on the debate stage last night.”Wednesday it was announced Rittenhouse is pursuing a libel case against Biden and his campaign for the advertisement suggesting he is a white supremacist. Rittenhouse is attorney, Lin Wood, said he plans to “rip Joe into shreds.”Not only was Wallace is debate tactic dirty, but it is factually wrong to say the violence and destruction that consumed Kenosha was spawned by “white supremacists,” given that the overwhelming majority of arrests were of left-wing rioters. Trump pointed out that the majority of violence in places like Kenosha is coming from “the left-wing, not from the right-wing.” Democrats’ “right-wing extremists” narrative has become increasingly difficult to defend, with accounts from on-the-ground reporters shattering their talking points. A recent study found that95 percent of riots in the USs this year have been tied to Black Lives Matter. Taking his cues from Wallace, Biden shouted at Trump to denounce Proud Boys, a right-wing group. The only instance of Proud Boys in Kenosha, however, was not during the nights of violence, but during the day. Two demonstrators sporting Proud Boys paraphernalia engaged in a verbal confrontation with three dozen BLM demonstrators, who were present to protest Trump is visit. Reporters said the two demonstrators did not appear to be armed and were being followed by the large group of BLM protesters. When the clash appeared volatile, law enforcement encircled the two Proud Boys demonstrators, who “appeared to be frightened,” walked them to nearby squad cars, and removed them from the area. It is safe to say the duo did not “add to the violence,” to use Wallace is words. Despite the endless accounts this summer of violence instigated by left-wing groups — which have left police officers dead, businesses and homes reduced to ashes, and communities in anarchic disarray — Democrats and the media keep pushing their “white supremacist” talking point. Many voters and residents of these to rn cities are not buying it. “You are telling me you are going to burn down my neighborhood?” Valerie, a 25-year-old black woman and former Democrat from the inner city of Milwaukee,toldthe Federalist in Kenosha of Black Lives Matter. “No, I do not want to be a Democrat anymore.”So MSNBC can keep standing in front of burning cities and calling them “mostly peaceful” protests, and Chris Wallace can keep pretending the right is to blame for the violence. But we were in Kenosha. We talked to people on the ground. Voters know who the peaceful protesters are and who the rioters are.",0,0,The Federalist

567,Condo Buildings Are at Risk. So Is All Real Estate.,0.0,40.0,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/surfside-tower-was-just-another-condo-building/619348/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-02,25,"The disaster in Surfside, Florida, focuses attention on condominiums’ flaws, but all forms of property ownership carry the potential for ugly surprises. After most of a condominium tower in Surfside, Florida, collapsed last week, the second-guessing began almost immediately. Some residents accused the building is condominium association of acting too slowly to address known structural flaws identified in a 2018 engineering report. Recent news stories have emphasized dissension among the owners. As someone who studies condos—their history, architecture, politics, and social dynamics, in Florida and all over the USs—I, too, have been wondering whether the building is divided ownership contributed to the June 24 catastrophe, which killed at least 18 people and left more than 140 missing. Could a single landlord have responded better to engineers’ and occupants’ concerns than an association of 136 homeowners?Condos have long been big business and a way of life in southeast Florida, which by the 1970s had become America is center of condo living. Today roughly one in five homeowners in US cities and suburbs lives in a multifamily complex rather than a single-family house, according to US census figures; in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, that share rises to one in three. Surfside residents described Champlain Towers South as a genuine community: “There was a beautiful mixture of cultures and people in that building,”one local told. “People from South America, Cuban Jews, American Jews, American nationals.”In most ways, the tower in Surfside was no different from Florida is thousands of other high-rise condo buildings. Those, meanwhile, face many of the same risks—most notably their proximity to the ocean during a time of sea-level rise—as single-owner apartment buildings and other concrete-and-steel properties along the Florida coast. A number of reports suggest that the Champlain Towers South Condominium Association functioned properly and had moved methodically,albeit amid considerable resistance, to figure out how to fix the problems that an engineer had identified. Investigators still have much to learn about the causes of the disaster. Thevagaries of the condo format, including the need to raise $15 million for repairs through a “special assessment” on the owners, might conceivably have slowed the building is response to structural problems. Absentee ownership, common in many condo buildings, especially in resorts and cosmopolitan business centers, might have hindered repairs further. Derek Thompson: Why Manhattan is skyscrapers are emptyAnd yet the collapse might also have been caused by other, yet-to-be-identified factors that did not turn up in the 2018 engineer is report. “From what I see, [that report] did not look like something that I would say, ‘Get the people out,’” Norma Jean Mattei, a University of New Orleans engineering professor,told. “The deterioration played a part, but it was not what caused this failure. Something else had to push this building over the to p.” In other words, Champlain Towers South might have suffered not from bad ownership or bad governance but from bad circumstances and bad luck. Because of the disa sterin Surfside, long-standing questions about condo-mania in Florida and elsewhere are resurfacing. The condo, like other forms of co-owned housing such as the co-op, occupies an ambiguous place in American life. Most American home buyers have historically preferred single-family houses and understood other kinds of dwellings to be second-best. Geographers, sociologists, anthropologists, and political scientists have argued for decades that the condo system is fundamentally unworkable, little more than a scheme cooked up by developers to seduce property buyers with good locations, luxury amenities, and hollow promises of community. Others saw condominium arrangements as an inevitable fiasco, worrying that an amateur group of owners could not possibly run a building competently. Still, the individually owned apartment emerged in the 19th century in cities such as New York and Washington, DC, for those who could afford a house but did not need or want one—with careful efforts in design and marketing to distinguish them from working-class tenements. The originator of the for-sale apartment in the US in the 1880s opted for a simple system: the corporate-title “cooperative,” in which the association holds title to the entire complex and individual ownership is conveyed by perpetual, in many cases $1-a-year, “proprietary” leases. In some respects, this is a superior model. The single title enables associations to more easily take out commercial loans for repairs, while the leases allow them to evict owners who become a liability. Yet the power of the association, especially to screen resales, made mortgage lenders wary. And in a nation deeply committed to unfettered property ownership, it also limited the appeal of owning an apartment. Starting in the late 1950s, the mortgage industry, anticipating untapped demand, began to promote condominium arrangements in Florida, the n nationally. As early as 1921, Congress questioned the entire premise of for-sale apartments, grilling homeowners about its viability. By 1974, an aggrieved owner, also testifying before Congress, asked, “Can a condominium actually work?” More recently, dysfunctional condo politics have been the stuff of TV comedy on shows such as. Since 2009, disputes between owners and homeowner associations have aired on Sunday mornings in South Florida on an AM radio show called “Condo Craze & HOAs,” hosted by the attorney Eric M Glazer—a Judge Judy for the Condominium Coast. Behind much of the skepticism of the condo system were tensions between private rights in property and community obligations. Between the 1880s and World War I, co-owned buildings in the USs were mostly sponsored directly by future tenants (foreshadowing the recent wave of in Berlin). By the 1920s, though, speculative developers came to dominate. To sell apartments, they learned to emphasize lifestyle, including ease of physical maintenance (“no lawn to mow,” read many an ad), while downplaying responsibilities. But owning an apartment, like any other property, comes with its own burdens—just ones less tangible than a lawn. No matter the system, ownership turns tenants, ready or not, into landlords: Members of a condominium automatically become co-owners of a corporate entity responsible for common elements. As nearly everyone who has ever owned an apartment in a large building knows, however, rare is the condo owner who is attuned to this duty, and rarer still is the one who attends association meetings, let alone serves on the board of directors. Read: The hot new Millennial housing trend is a repeat of the Middle AgesAnd yet developers and sales agents recognized this gap early on. While honing their marketing strategies, they began to encourage buildings to hire “professional” management, leaving associations with few direct responsibilities. Governance could still be challenging. In co-ops in New York and DC, where associations typically screen new buyers (ostensibly for reasons of financial security), battles erupted over whether to allow resales to Jewish people and, later, single women, Black people, and gay men. In more recent decades, residents of condo buildings have feuded over everything from cosmetic upgrades (redecorating lobbies) to the installation of EV charging stations. These disputes hint at why some early critics believed that condos would inevitably result in huge problems, including premature physical decay. These predictions occasionally proved true—but almost never in the US In America, our faith in a stable and transparent real-estate system supersedes our deep-seated aversion to public oversight of private transactions. As a result, regulation of condominium-like arrangements in this country, even in freewheeling Florida, has been among the most robust in the world, making American condo owners the envy of their counterparts in places as diverse as Australia, China, and Israel. People around the world following the news from Surfside are now aware of Miami-Dade County is requirement that buildings undergo recertification by engineers or architects after 40 years. But since the 1970s, Florida has also introduced an array of other regulations to ensure safe, equitable, and relatively efficient governance of co-owned apartments, and other states have followed its lead in many ways. When developers experimented with locking associations into management contracts at uncompetitive rates (as detailed in John D MacDonald is 1977 disaster novel,), kept down sales prices by retaining ownership of common areas and renting them back to associations (also at inflated rates), or made monthly charges unsustainably low by retaining control over associations until an overwhelming majority of units were sold, the state outlawed these practices. To allow for a more timely and cost-effective resolution of disputes among owners, and between owners and associations, it set up provisions for resolving disputes outside the courts. None of this guarantees that, when major repairs become necessary, owners will be able to make decisions or raise money quickly. And even if states push associations harder to take the unique pitfalls of condo arrangements into account, owners are still exposed to other risks, including, in some cases, the uncertainties inherent to waterfront living amid climate change. Ultimately, the condo format could turn out to be a factor in the Surfside disaster, but any presumption of guilt now may provide false reassurance to people who have a stake in other forms of real estate—and face the ugly, rare, and sometimes catastrophic surprises that are a possibility in property ownership of every kind.​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

Announced by Biden on Friday, the decision to reimpose a ban on the detention of pregnant women and girls was initially outlined in a memo signed last week by acting ICE Director Tae Johnson. Boasting of the new policy, Johnson said the border agency is“committed to safeguarding the integrity of our immigration system and preserving the health and safety of pregnant, postpartum and nursing individuals.”He added that“given the unique needs of this population,”ICE will not lock up anyone currently or recently pregnant“unless release is prohibited by law or exceptional circumstances exist,”but did not elaborate on what might warrant such exceptions. The measure does not rule out arresting pregnant, postpartum or nursing women, the ICE memo stresses, but does require that if the yare to be housed in US detention facilities, they must receive mental health services and other appropriate care. The agency is also still permitted to send expecting women to immigration courts. ICE went out of its way to avoid specifying the gender of any hypothetical prisoner in its memo, a deliberate move intended to include transgender males among the group of pregnancy-capable individuals to whom the policy applies,according to a senior administration official who spoke to USA Today on Friday. The decision is not so much new as it is a reversal of a 2017 policy enacted by former president Donald Trump, who placed the fight against illegal immigration at the center of his successful 2016 election campaign. Under Trump is predecessor and Biden is former boss, Barack Obama, ICE had a stated policy of only detaining pregnant immigrants“under extraordinary circumstances.”During Trump is first two years in the White House, pregnant immigrants were detained 80% more frequently than during the last year of Obama is presidency, according to a Government Accountability Report released last year. Biden is version of the policy does expand the period in which illegal migrants can claim exemption from ICE detention, however. While Obama is policy restricted itself to pregnant women only, Biden is shield includes those who gave birth up to one year ago, as well as nursing women.",1,1,RT

If you wanted to call for routine inspections, and the enforcement of sufficient safety criteria across the board, there are very few who would be opposed to that. But a call for a large-scale, outside investigation into Dr. Shi is laboratory lacks the necessary evidence to motivate it. If any of the18 scientists who signed the recent Science letter calling for such an investigation actually wanted to investigate the lab leak hypothesis in a scientific manner, they would simply write a research grant to do so. That is how virology is routinely performed, an dhow scientific and professional misconduct in virology has been uncovered in the past. The fact that they have brought their case to the general public instead reveals how flimsy their arguments are, while a broader concern is that the next time a pandemic flu emerges within the USs, we will have set a grossly unacceptable international precedent. American scientists will be vilified and harassed; foreign agents will demand access to our federally funded labs; lab records will be demanded by foreign governments; etc. This is a Pandora is Box, brought forth by political inquisitors, that must not be opened unless adequate scientific proof of these specious allegations comes to light. We frequently say that what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence, and this conspiracy theory of a lab leak-origin for SARS-CoV-2 should be treated as such. Dr. Fauci, EcoHealth Alliance, and Dr. Shi, among others, simply have the misfortune of being in the crosshairs of political agents who the mselves have been largely responsible for the mismanaged global response to this inevitable pandemic. Just like the notions that 9/11 was an inside job, the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax, or that “ClimateGate” proves the unethical behavior of practically all climate scientists, there is plenty of strong evidence opposing the conspiracy, instead supporting the consensus conclusion. If we are to take an alternative seriously, it cannot just consist of circumstantial evidence with enormous gaps separating the steps; you would need concrete evidence. Unless that evidence arrives, the “lab leak hypothesis” will remain a conspiracy theory, while the zoonotic origin hypothesis remains overwhelmingly supported by the evidence at hand.",2,1,Forbes

The group, called the Coalition for TJ, contends that a new “holistic review” admissions program will significantly reduce the proportion of Asian-American students at the high school in Alexandria, Va.“Plaintiff is data analysts project that Asian-American student enrollment at TJ will drop from 73 percent under the merit-based race-blind admissions system to 31 percent under the new racial-balancing admissions system for the Class of 2025,”says the lawsuit filed in US District Court in Alexandria. “No other racial group is projected to lose seats. The greatest beneficiary of the new admissions system in terms of increased population will be white students.”The Fairfax County school district did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. According to the 187,000-student district, in suburban Washington, DC, Thomas Jefferson had a 2019-20 student enrollment that was 71.5 percent Asian, 19.48 percent non-Hispanic White, 2.6 percent Hispanic or Latino, 1.72 percent Black, and 4.70 percent other. The school system, whose overall student enrollment is 38 percent White, 27 percent Hispanic, 20 percent Asian, and 10 percent Black, has made efforts to boost diversity at Thomas Jefferson in recent years, to little avail. The 2020 racial reckoning over the death of George Floyd in police custody and related events prompted renewed efforts to increase diversity at the selective school, which was founded in 1985.“Over the past 10 years, the [Thomas Jefferson] admissions process has undergone a series of changes that were intended to impact issues of diversity and inclusion,” the school system said in a white paper last year. “Nonetheless, … these changes have not made a significant impact on the diversity of the applicants or admitted students.”Fairfax Superintendent Scott Brabrand last year proposed eliminating Thomas Jefferson is admissions test in favor of five “regional pathways” based on middle schools, with each being allocated a set number of seats in the incoming first-year class to be determined by lottery. Under that plan, Black student enrollment would have increased to 7 percent, while Asian student enrollment would drop to 54 percent, and White student enrollment would increase to 25 percent. The Fairfax County School Board voted to eliminate the entrance exam in October. In December, the board adopted an alternative new plan. Under that plan, the top 1.5 percent of each of the district is middle schools who meet certain minimum academic standards will be eligible for admission to Thomas Jefferson. The district will the n conduct a holistic review that examines factors including each student is grade-point average, a problem-solving essay, and “experience factors” that include whether they are economically disadvantaged, English-language learners, or from underrepresented middle schools.“Experience factors will allow consideration of contexts that require a student to demonstrate grit and persevere through challenges to meet the [Thomas Jefferson] applicant requirements,” the school system is white paper said. The district did not offer specific projections for changes in racial and ethnic balance under the holistic review plan. The new system is taking effect this spring for the class of 2025 that enters the high school this fall. The lawsuit by Coalition for TJ argues that the new admissions system violates the 14th Amendment is equal protection clause because “although facially race-neutral, it was enacted with discriminatory intent.”The lawsuit cites a 2020 email from Thomas Jefferson Principal Ann Bonitatibus to the school community saying that the racial composition of the high school does not reflect that of the school system overall.“If our demographics actually represented [Fairfax County Public Schools], we would enroll 180 Black and 460 Hispanic students, filling nearly 22 classrooms,” the principal is email said.“This email put the focus squarely on race and the racial balance at TJ, foreshadowing changes to come,” says the suit, which cites other comments by officials in the district about the need to make Thomas Jefferson more representative.“Defendants have been forthright that the changes to the TJ admissions policy are intended to reduce the proportion of Asian-American students enrolled at TJ because they are ‘overrepresented’ compared to the rest of [Fairfax County Public Schools],” the suit says.“They want to match the racial makeup of the county as a whole,” Glenn E Roper, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing Coalition for TJ, said in an interview. “That was the motivating purpose. School districts can change an admissions program, but they ca not do it with a racially discriminatory purpose.”The lawsuit comes as the US Supreme Court has upheld the holistic consideration of race in college admissions but has a challenge to Harvard is race-conscious admissions program awaiting a decision from the justices on whether they will review that case. In 2007, when the US Supreme Court struck down two school districts’ voluntary race-conscious plans for assigning students to schools, inParents Involved in Community Schools vs Seattle School District, Justice Anthony M Kennedy wrote a concurrence that suggested there were permissible ways for districts to boost racial diversity through race-conscious means. One of those was “drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods,” Kennedy wrote in his concurrence, which some legal experts consider the controlling opinion inParents Involvedbecause much of the main opinion in that case was a mere plurality. The Fairfax County plan for Thomas Jefferson High aims to be a race-neutral plan for increasing racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity, the very kind of plan that many advocates have urged schools and colleges to adopt instead of race-conscious policies. It will be up to a federal district court, for starters, to decide whether the plan was adopted with the impermissible racial motivation alleged in the lawsuit.",2,1,Education Week

As the holiday season approaches, I am confident that others have this issue on their minds as well, so I asked experts how to figure out when it is time to cut a toxic family member of your life.

However, Stanizai explains, discomfort is different from abuse, and discerning the difference is critical for your own emotional wellbeing. But it may be hard to tell the difference when tempers are high or feelings are hurt. Know that when you argue with a family member, about politics especially, there is a spectrum of how ""healthy"" the discourse is. You can be respectfully heated, but when it borderlines on toxic comments and behavior, it is problem worth addressing. “The hallmark for defining abuse is there is a noticeable, pervasive pattern,” Satnizai says. “This does not mean it happens all the time, but it begins to be predictable.” For example, she says, the re is a pattern if you can expect the same type of criticism about multiple areas of your life from someone or if they are continually hyper focusing on one subject and constantly finding many things wrong with it. I, for instance, have a family member who is always talking about “the gays.” One minute it may be, “the gays want to make us all gay,” and five minutes later she might make a comment like, “gay people spread disease.” It is like she is always trying to finding away totalk about how terrible gay people are, even though I am one of them. This is not a debate. It is abusive behavior. Another hallmark of abusive relationships is a lack of accountability. If you tell someone that something they said or did hurt you, and they do not care, that is a problem that could be another sign of abuse, says Stanizai. And it might be time to assert your needs more directly. She recommends, however, giving someone a chance to apologize and make amends before you assume that they will not. It is tempting to just ignore the behavior, but that will likely just dig you into a deeper, more painful hole in the long run. When you are feeling hurt, it can be really hard to speak up for yourself. You may need to set some boundaries between yourself and the person who is hurt you before you can do that. That is okay. But eventually, if you want to try to heal the relationship, you are going to have to have a difficult conversation, says Stanizai. If the other person avoids the conversation or taking responsibility for their own words or actions, the n it may be time to set new limits. If you are not making leeway with this person who has a pattern of hurting you, you can choose a level of ""cutting them off."" Discarding them completely is not the only option. There are degrees of separation you can create that may allow you to feel safer. “This can mean limiting time to them only in groups, or only for certain occasions, or for 1-2 hours at a time,” she says. If it feels safe, try to give someone more than one chance to apologize. Being confronted often makes people feel defensive, and continually offering olive branches is a disarming maneuver that can benefit everyone. “When someone feels that you are giving them an honest chance, they are more likely to listen to your side too,” Stanizai adds. Now, if there is no circumstance in which you may feel emotionally safe with someone, explore that, discuss it with a trusted person in your life, and the n own it. It might not last forever, but this is your current reality. You do not have to spend time with abusive people. If you find yourself truly activated by someone — meaning that contact with them induces a panic attack or a mental health episode, Stanizai explains — the n it may be time to really cut ties. ""It is perfectly fine to skip the family BBQ or keep your distance from someone altogether,” she says. Ultimately, managing a conflicted relationship with a family member is not a black and white problem and there are no black or white solutions. If you decide to stop talking to someone, you can change your mind later if it feels safe for you. The most important thing is that you continue to bolster your own sense of agency. Having a sense of control in your relationships is not about controlling other people, it is about feeling like you get to have control over yourself. Speaking up for yourself when someone hurts you may feel hard, Stanizai says, but it can help you take control of the narrative.",1,1,Mic
574,Amazon is plans to buy MGM recall the studio is origins,1.0,40.33,https://forward.com/culture/470292/amazon-mgm-louis-b-mayer-rocky-james-bond-purchase-hollywood-lion/,https://adfontesmedia.com/forward-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-26,25,"Leo the Lion in 1928Photo by Wikimedia CommonsAmazon has nabbed a lion in winter. The retail and entertainment giant announced Wednesday that it would acquire MGM, the storied movie studio for $8.5 billion, giving them the keys to franchises likeJames Bondand Rocky, and landing the flagging studio around $3 billion more than its valuation. If all this consolidation seems like a product of the 21st century is rapacious online monopolies, it is actually true to the spirit of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is multi hyphenate origins. It all started with a few Jews. Samuel Goldwyn (né Goldfish), a Polish immigrant, who founded Goldwyn Pictures in 1916, produced a raft of silent films, standing out from the crowd of upstart studios with a striking production card featuring a real-life lion encircled in a crest. In 1924, Marcus Loew, who owned a chain of the aters, bought Goldwyn is outfit. This was part of the old “vertical integration” system, wherein production companies also controlled distribution and owned the cinemas showing the films. It was a bit of an antitrust issue,but one recently vanquished right as Netflix began snapping up the aters. Loew acquired Goldwyn to diversify his slate of pictures after buying Metro Pictures Corporation a few years before. So, so far we have the Metro and the Goldwyn part of MGM Where does the last M come in? Louis B Mayer, who helped start Metro, but struck out on his own with Louis B Mayer Pictures, came to Loew asking to be bought — in exchange,Mayerbuilt on his success as producer alongside the wunderkind Irving J Thalberg. These men came to embody the Hollywood Golden Age with classics like “Gone with the Wind” and “The Wizard of Oz.” Their way of doing business — what Mayer termed, was recently brought to life in David Fincher is“Mank.”We also have these two to thank for the Oscars, whichMayer began in order to spurn Hollywood unions. But fortunes rise and fall. Over the years the house that Mayer (and Goldwyn and Loew and Thalberg) built changed quite a bit to stay in the game. It paired with United Artists. It changed hands between businessman Kirk Kerkorian, Ted Turner, an Italian conglomerate. It even filed for bankruptcy in 2010. While the studio is responsible for some of the most iconic images in film, for many decades its story was one of fighting to survive and stay relevant. Leo the lion had some lean years, and now Amazon has the lion is share. Let is just hope that Jeff Bezos is not the new James Bond. PJ Grisar is a Forward culture reporter.

575,"Despite waiting for years, some Indian immigrants are now giving up their green card dreams",-8.33,44.0,https://qz.com/india/1871644/indians-on-h-1b-visas-are-giving-up-on-their-green-card-dreams/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,25,"Thirty-eight-year-old Amey first went to America to study at Carnegie Mellon University in 2006. Both he and his wife, who works at one of the world is top biotech companies, are on the H-1B, a non-immigrant visa allowing foreigners to live and work in the US One of Amey is previous employers applied for his green card in 2011. Almost a decade later, a green card still eludes him.“We have been waiting patiently for our green card since nine years now and it will likely take another 10-plus years till we get it,” says Amey, who like the other Indians in America whom we spoke to for this story asked that we publish only their first names to avoid drawing attention from US immigration services. Over the last decade, Amey has worked at several technology startups. “I helped them launch award-winning products, hire teams, and raise millions of dollars in venture funding,” he says. A few years ago, he and his wife opened a mom-and-pop store in suburban Philadelphia where they hired around 15 local workers. Today, they live in Los Angeles with their two-year-old son and a five-year-old Goldendoodle. For millions of Indians who went to the US on the H-1B visa in the early 2000s, a green card was a tangible next step to security and freedom. The chances of getting one now, however, look grim. Indians ranging from those working on the front lines in America is fight against Covid-19at hospitals to those employed at tech behemoths likeNetflixandGoogleare among those on the interminable line for green cards. Immigration Voice, a US nonprofit, has been sharing their stories on social media to help drum up support for a group it refers to as “legal high-skilled future Americans.”Of the total 1 million green cards given out every year, just 140,000 are for employment-based applicants. The majority of the rest goes to family-based applicants. And because of the annual 7% country cap on green card allocations in the employment route, Indians face unprecedented backlogs.“The bottom line is that the H-1B system is old and has many flaws, but has become the main vehicle for great foreign-born talent to enter the US either directly or after being employed as students” on OPT visas, says Ran Harnevo, the CEO of Homeis, an online network for ex pats and foreign-born nationals around the world. “There are super-talented employees that totally rely on this visa for several years with (a) very slim opportunity to evolve to a better visa or a permanent residency.”By the start of 2030, the green card backlog will exceed 2.4 million petitions, virtually ending all legal employment immigration from India and China, the countries with the most employment-based green card petitions, the Cato Institute is immigration policy analyst David Bierwrote in a March 2020 brief. Getting the H-1B visa—a pre-requisite before an employer can sponsor an employee—is a herculean task in itself. Dhaval, 34, immigrated to the US from India in 2008 to pursue a PhD in computer science. He thought life would be much easier once he completed his doctorate but his name was not drawn in the H-1B lottery for four years. His optional practical training (OPT) period ran out and he had to enroll in a masters program that offered CPT (curricular practical training) to continue working.“In these five years of constant struggle with getting the immigration work visa, even after having the highest possible level of education, I lost valuable time in starting the green card process,” he said. In an upsetting twist of fate, he finally got the visa—but the n his company decided to stop sponsoring green cards due to constant immigration rule changes carried out by the Trump administration. H-1B visa-holders typically hesitate to change or quit jobs, since losing H-1B status could get them kicked out of the country. Even if Dhaval switches jobs and gets a new sponsor within the year, the wait for a green card could be longer than 80 years. US president Donald Trump is hard line anti-immigrant stance has made a historically onerous process all the more challenging. Under his administration, application denials and requests for evidence both have gone up. During a recent vacation, Amey is visa drew extra scrutiny for reasons not known to him. He spent close to 40 days working remotely from another country until his visa was approved. Dallas resident Anuja, a post-doctoral research fellow in biochemistry, has faced similar issues. “Being on a visa has many problems, especially in my field, which comes under the technology alert list,” she says. “When I travelled to renew my student visa towards the end of [my] PhD in 2013, I had to spend five weeks in India to receive clearance to travel back to the USA.”Dhaval, Amey, and Anuja all give the same reason for wanting a green card: freedom. The freedom to change jobs and fields, to travel, to start companies, to buy properties and put down roots, and more. In spite of waiting it out for years, several green card aspirants have gotten fed up.“President Trump is visa restrictions are a ‘kiss of death’ for American innovation, and signal to the most vulnerable communities that their immense social contributions simply do not matter anymore,” said Homeis’ Harnevo. “He has shattered their American dream, and now they have nowhere to turn.”Canada, for one, makes immigration much easier than the US, and Indian-born workers in the US are taking note. Dhaval opted for Canada ismerit-based immigration system in 2019 and got permanent residency status within a year. He plans to make the move in the coming months. According to the Cato Institute, the number of Indians applying for permanent residency in Canada has doubled since 2016. Amey, too, started looking into migrating to Canadian around a year ago, citing “uncertainty, the political rhetoric, and the constant anxiety related to the American legal immigration process.” The family is in the final stages of getting permanent residency in Canada. But not everyone has an easy way out. Anuja, who hails from Mumbai, is still holding out hope for permanent residency in the US because “the kind of research I am involved in does not happen in India,” she says. She is trying to get her green card via the EB1 route, nicknamed theEinstein visa since it is reserved for people who are highly acclaimed in their fields. But the fear of things not working out is palpable.“If we were to lose our jobs to day,” she says, “it would mean a flight back to India despite having spent our young years being as productive as possible in researching and mentoring, paying taxes, and being law-abiding citizens…not to mention visa issues in India due to havingUS-citizen kids if you decide to go back.”Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",2,2,Quartz
576,Democrats Push Further Into GOP Territory With Fundraising Surge,-8.67,45.0,https://about.bgov.com/news/democrats-push-further-into-gop-territory-with-fundraising-surge/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bloomberg-government-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-16,17,"Democrats across the competitive House landscape turned in yet another strong fundraising quarter, bolstering the party is bid to expand its hold on the chamber. In 44 of the 58 districts the Cook Political Report rates as competitive, Democratic nominees raised more than their Republican opponents from July through September, according to a Bloomberg Government analysis of Federal Election Commission reports filed by Thursday is deadline. That includes historically GOP-leaning districts in souths ide Virginia, southern Minnesota, Long Island, NY, and Alaska, along with the suburbs of Phoenix, Indianapolis, Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta. Rather than hunker down to protect the most vulnerable seats picked up in the 2018 wave, Democrats are seeking to parlay their fundraising advantage and Joe Biden is lead in the presidential election into a larger and more durable majority.“Right after the November elections in 2018, the word was that Chairwoman Bustos had the toughest job in town,” said Michael Fraioli, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, referring toCheri Bustos(Ill.), head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “That is all turned around now. Not only are we not going to lose seats as Democrats, but we are going to pick up some and the question is how many and where.”Of the 58 districts rated competitively, 30 are held by Republicans, 27 by Democrats, and one by a Libertarian. Republicans need a net gain of 17 seats for a majority. The Cook Political Report says a Democratic gain of up to 10 seats is the most likely outcome. Most Republican incumbents in competitive, suburban districts were outraised by their Democratic challengers. Democrats made major gains in suburban districts in 2018, thanks to a combination of voters’ frustration with President Donald Trump and, relatedly, college-educated voters moving away from the Republican Party. It paved the way to a 40-seat net gain.“Were fighting very hard,” said Sarah Chamberlain, president of Republican Main Street Partnership, which supports several suburban Republicans. “We are hoping to not see a wave in the suburbs, but the more people I talk to — it is close.”Unlikely opportunities for Democrats to make gains include Virginia is 5th District, a conservative-leaning area that runs from the North Carolina border to exurbs of Washington, DC Cameron Webb (D), a doctor and first-time candidate, raised more than $2.7 million in the quarter compared with $723,000 for Bob Good (R), who ousted Representative Denver Riggleman(R) at a district convention in June. In Arizona is 6th District, a well-educated and Republican-friendly area enveloping parts of Phoenix and Scottsdale, physician Hiral Tipirneni (D) raised more than three times what Representative David Schweikert(R) brought in and ended September with nearly triple what the incumbent had in cash on hand. Schweikert has been hobbled by ethics violations, and the House voted in July to reprimand him. Republicans and Democrats attributed Democrats’ strong fundraising to the party is online tool, ActBlue, which directs small, online donations to candidates that need it the most. The GOP is online fundraising system, WinRed, has not been around nearly as long and is not as established among donors.“One of the fundraising advantages Democrats have — and it is one of the few we have — is we have really lapped the Republicans on candidate online fundraising,” said John Rowley, a Democratic consultant. “It is an area where Republicans have not caught up.”“It all goes back to ActBlue,” Chamberlain said. Rob Simms, a former executive director at the National Republican Congressional Committee, cautioned that while the numbers are impressive, it is not necessarily a show of electoral strength.“One thing that often gets lost looking at these numbers is the overwhelming majority of Democrats’ money is coming from outside the district and outside of the state,” Simms said. “You have this energy on the Democratic side fueling the fundraising, but a lot of it is coming from New York, LA, and San Francisco.”There were some bright spots in third-quarter fundraising for Republicans, who are targeting the more than two dozen Democratic-held districts Trump carried in 2016. Iowa state Representative Ashley Hinson (R) reported more in third-quarter receipts and cash on hand than freshman Representative Abby Finkenauer(D) in a district Trump narrowly won. Iowa is 1st District, which includes Cedar Rapids and Dubuque, is one of only 11 Democratic districts rated as a Toss-up. South Carolina state Representative Nancy Mace (R) to pped freshman Representative Joe Cunningham(D) in both categories in a coastal district Trump won decisively, though the Cook Political Report still gives Cunningham the advantage. The jaw-dropping amounts from Democrats in swing districts has allowed the DCCC — the party is House campaign arm, which itself announced to pping $70 million in third-quarter receipts — to invest in offensive opportunities, including nine districts where Trump won by 10 or more points. That includes suburban areas where Democrats made large gains in 2018 and hope to continue to expand in 2020. The DCCC is independent expenditure arm, which controls where it spends tens of millions of dollars on advertising, booked $648,000 in New York is 1st District in recent weeks to aid college professor Nancy Goroff is (D) challenge to Representative Lee Zeldin(R) on Long Island. It also booked $330,000 in ads in Arkansas’ 2nd District, based in Little Rock, where state Senator Joyce Elliott (D) is taking on Representative French Hill(R). The Cook Political report currently gives Republicans the edge in both. Democrats also reserved airtime in several other Republican districts, such as Alaska, where Representative Don Young— the House dean — has held the state-wide seat since 1973. Rowley said these buys illustrate not only the party is fundraising advantage and the political environment, but also how well-positioned many of most vulnerable Democratic freshmen are.“It is freed them up to play real offense,” Rowley said. “If they were not within striking distance, they would not be in those races. It is not the culture of the Democrats to casually play in Alaska and Arkansas.”To contact the reporters on this story:Emily Wilkinsin Washington atewilkins@bgov.com;Greg Girouxin Washington atggiroux@bgov.comTo contact the editors responsible for this story:Kyle Trygstadatktrygstad@bgov.com;Bennett Rothatbroth@bgov.com",2,2,Bloomberg Government

578,How well does the media cover the climate movement?,-10.33,40.33,https://www.cjr.org/covering_climate_now/climate-activists-fridays-for-future.php,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-17,18,"thousands of young activists around the world will march and strike for climate action as part of Fridays for Future, a movement launched by Greta Thunberg and other organizers. Events are planned on five continents. The the me: #NoMoreEmptyPromises. “Those in power continue to only deliver vague and empty promises for far off dates that are much too late,” reads a statement by Fridays For Future. “What we need are not meaningless goals for 2050 or net-zero targets full of loopholes, but concrete and immediate action in-line with science.”For some journalists, covering activism presents an uncomfortable dilemma. Too much coverage might come across as cheerleading or make journalists look like they are activists the mselves, contradicting institutional notions of neutrality. A reporter is job is to cover the news, the argument goes, not boost one side or the other. Fair enough. Butactivists are newsmakers—just like the politicians, scientists, and corporate officials we cover all the time. Youth-dominated groups have upended global climate politics over the last two years and injected a much-needed emphasis on environmental justice into the public conversation. Whether by scolding jet-setting elites at Davos for their obliviousness, as Thunberg did, or occupying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is Capitol office, as Sunrise Movement activists did to demand that Democrats walk their talk on climate change, youth activists have forced the climate issue onto government and, yes, media agendas around the world. During the 2020 US election campaign, youth activists’ grassroots pressure pushed the n-candidate Joe Biden to dramatically strengthen his climate proposals even as it helped raise climate change to a to p-tier campaign issue. For the general election in November, Sunrise and other youth-led groups mobilized large numbers of new voters, including in Georgia and other swing states, that helped elect Biden president and gain Democrats a razor-thin majority in the US Senate. Now, with Biden in the White House, activists are continuing to push him to make good on his promise to treat climate change as the “existential crisis” he rightly says it is. In short, climate activists are a potent political force. Covering them is no act of favoritism, but simply a matter of accurately telling the climate story. Indeed, one could argue that activists, as a whole, have been ahead of journalists on this story. Media coverage of the climate crisis has long lagged behind warnings from scientists and other experts—especially in the US, where coverage was sporadic at best, and often descended into a scientifically indefensible both sides ism that portrayed corporate flaks and real scientists as equally credible. Improved news coverage overlaps with the emergence of the youth climate movement: According to a 2020 analysis by the watchdog outfit Media Matters for America, the outpouring of climate activism in 2019—especially a global youth strike in September of that year, led by Thunberg and involving some 6 million people—was largely what finally shocked the media out of their collective climate silence. In other words, despite a wealth of evidence establishing climate change as a story of massive, global importance, many news organizations still needed to bel e dout of the darkness. With a climate realist now in the White House, a new era of possibility in the climate story has arrived. It is more important than ever for journalists to cover activist groups and their activities accurately and fairly, showing them no more fear or favor than we show any other type of newsmaker. That task begins with doing a better job of portraying who the climate movement actually is. Even after news organizations finally recognized that young climate activists were making news, too many stories fixated on the celebrity of Thunberg and a small handful of others while giving short shrift to the substance of their message. “Instead of focusing on the climate and listening to the scientific message, people are instead listening to and talking about me,” Thunberg remarked in September 2020. Such coverage gives the impression that Thunberg was the only young activist worth hearing, a grievous misrepresentation. “Dear media, I see you are writing about the international climate crisis lawsuit @GretaThunberg and I launched today with 15 other child plaintiffs,” Alexandria Villaseñor, a prominent activist from New York,wrote on Twitter in 2019. “The other plaintiffs have names, experiences and stories. Make sure you write about the m, too.”Some outlets have done well on that front, featuring a range of activists in their stories and even profiling them or publishing their op-eds. For example, both CNN and PBS NewsHour recently ran extensive stories about the Indigenous activists in Minnesota fighting the Line 3 tar sands pipeline overseen by Enbridge, a Canadian multinational company. PBS correspondent Ivette FelicianointerviewedWinona LaDuke of the Indigenous climate justice organization Honor the Earth, who said the greenhouse gas emissions of the Line 3 pipeline are “the equivalent to 50 new coal-fired power plants. So, you know, if you are trying to save the planet, this is not the way to do it.”Other times, outlets have struggled to show the diversity and breadth of the climate movement. In an emblematic incident from January 2020, the Associated Press cut Vanessa Nakate, a 23-year-old climate activist in Uganda,out of a photo depicting four other influential young activists, including Thunberg, all of whom are white. (Reuters, at the same time, misidentified Nakate as Zambian activist Natasha Mwansa.) At first, the AP said the crop was a deadline decision made to improve the photo is composition; the agency later apologized for the error. Nakate responded that the AP is action was evidence of how Africans and others from poor countries are often excluded from the climate conversation. “It showed how we are valued,” Nakate said. The modern climate and environmental movements are diverse and enormous. Rather than select, elevate, and revisit a handful of celebrities, journalists should seek out a range of voices, especially activists at the local level representing Indigenous groups or people of color whose communities are often disproportionately affected by climate change. That said, thoughtful reporting on climate activism should not preclude journalists from asking probing questions about the activists’ platforms, tactics, and operations. For example, many young activists engage the climate crisis as an intersectional issue, in which individual and overlapping identities—including those of race, class, and gender—shape their platforms and their work, including dealings with older activist organizations and policymakers. Some of the best-funded climate-advocacy groups have long been far from diverse in their staffing and leadership, despite repeated promises to improve. News coverage should engage the full substance of activist groups’ agendas in an ongoing way, with attention to their complexities and efficacy—and not only when they are marching in the streets. As many activists would say, ultimately the climate story is not about the m; it is about whether humanity can defuse the climate emergency in time to preserve a livable planet. By tellingthatstory, journalists can get the mselves, and their audiences, up to speed on the defining challenge of our time.",1,1,Columbia Journalism Review

An 82-year-old inmate who had tested positive for the coronavirus died at the Draper prison Wednesday morning, prison officials said. He is the first incarcerated person in Utah to die after testing positive for the virus. Prison officials noted that the man had other “complicating comorbidities” that likely contributed to his death, and said a medical examiner will determine his cause of death. The inmate tested positive Friday, as part of mass testing after an inmate in the Oquirrh 5 unit complained of symptom sand subsequently was determined to have the virus. Prison officials said the man was found dead in the Oquirrh 5 unit early Wednesday. They said he reported no symptoms prior to his death.[Tell The Tribune:Do you know someone at the Utah State Prison affected by the coronavirus outbreak?]The Oquirrh area, prison officials have said, is where the “most medically vulnerable” inmates live, and where they have taken the greatest precautions to keep the virus out. Officials said Wednesday that medical officials will continue to “heavily monitor” this area as they react to the virus spreading within the facility. Prison officials did not release the name of the man who died, but said family members had been notified. The American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, which sued prison officials in April over their coronavirus response, expressed frustration Wednesday, saying the prison and parole board still have not been doing enough to keep inmates safe, or release those that are medically vulnerable.“This was preventable,” said Sara Wolovick, an ACLU Equal Justice Works fellow. “This is precisely why we sued back in April. This is what we were trying to prevent.”The ACLU is lawsuit did not go far, however. The Utah Supreme Court dismissed the litigation, saying the group did not have proper legal standing to bring it to court. Wolovick did not rule out the possibility that the ACLU will sue again, saying the prison still has not taken the proper steps to respond appropriately to an outbreak that has spread throughout both its facilities. Wolovick said she did not know if the man who died had sought an early release, but said there are still elderly inmates and medically vulnerably people incarcerated who should be considered for release. She said the ACLU tried to ask prison officials to release some inmates on medical furlough so they would not be housed in communal living facilities, but the Department of Corrections did not respond to that request. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases have exploded at the Utah State Prison over the past few weeks. There have now been 572 confirmed cases at the Draper facility, according to the prison, and 22 at the Gunnison facility. The initial outbreak at the prison began in October, and was believed to be tied to a medic who treated several inmates who later tested positive. While that outbreak was contained to one area, the virus has spread to almost every other housing unit — including Oquirrh 5, Promontory, Lone Peak and in at least three blocks of the Wasatch facility. Positive cases have also been reported in at least two housing units at the Gunnison facility. Family members of those incarcerated told The Salt Lake Tribune that their loved ones have been calling them in tears, saying they feel sick and have not been able to get any medication to ease their pain. Haylee Powell is husband, who is in the Promontory section, tested positive Tuesday. She said he told her that he is quickly become weak and has had pain in his chest and racking coughs. His bunkmate, he told her, had been curled up in a ball crying in their shared space.“He is been in there a really long time, 13 years,” she said. “He is a pretty tough dude. For him to cry to me, it is pretty serious. I have never heard him cry. If they are all just breaking down, it really says something to me.”",2,2,Salt Lake Tribune

The Army isSexual Harassment/Assault Response and Preventionprogram, or SHARP, has been under scrutiny in recent months following the death of Spc. Vanessa Guillen, a Fort Hood soldier who prosecutors say was murdered in an armory on post by a fellow 3rd Cavalry Regiment trooper. Guillen is family said she had been sexually harassed by a fellow soldier prior to her death, but she did not report the incident for fear of retribution. Following those allegations, Army Forces Command sent a small team in June to specifically look at theSHARP program on Fort Hood. FORSCOM is review found that the post is SHARP program overall meets Army standards. But the team also found that 18 out of the 52 women surveyed on post, about one-third, reported being sexually harassed. That number concerned lawmakers and prompted questions about whether the standards of success for SHARP programs need to be changed. TheGovernment Accountability Officeannounced in late August that it would review the Army is SHARP program, as well, following complaints from members of Congress who sought more answers. Natalie Khawam, an attorney representing the Guillen family, said McCarthy is comments “corroborated what I have been emphasizing.”Khawam drafted a piece of legislation called the Vanessa Guillen Act, which would create an independent system to investigate both sexual harassment and sexual assault incidents. It would also provide independent charging decisions for courts-martial.“Victims like Vanessa Guillen, who suffered from sexual harassment and assault while serving our country, were failed by the system,” Khawam told Army Times. “In September Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi has promised to schedule our bill for a vote. We have patiently been waiting for her to tell us the date.”In his comments on video Wednesday, McCarthy said that it is “abundantly clear” that Army leaders must do more with regards to sexual harassment and assault investigations.“I am deeply saddened and concerned by the recent news reports of how sexual assault and sexual harassment have plagued our force and brought harm to our soldiers,” McCarthy said in the video statement Wednesday. “Leaders, regardless of rank, are accountable for what happens in their units and must have the courage to speak up and intervene when they recognize actions that bring harm to our soldiers and to the integrity of our institution.”McCarthy did not elaborate on which media reports he was referring to specifically, but Guillen is case has sparked hundreds of survivors to come forward to shares to ries of sexual trauma in the military. Some of those stories were chronicled this week by CBS Evening News, which interviewed nearly two dozen victims and several whistle-blowers who worked for the SHARP programs as part of a series aired Tuesday. The problems at Fort Hood, however, go beyond issues related to sexual assault and harassment. The post has been plagued this year with a number of violent deaths that set it apart from other installations. Severalof the deaths that involve foul play involve violence against soldiers stationed there by civilians in the local community.“The numbers are high here,” McCarthy said during a visit to Fort Hood in early August. “They are the highest, in most cases, for sexual assault and harassment and murders for our entire formation — the US Army.”Kyle Rempfer was an editor and reporter who has covered combat operations, criminal cases, foreign military assistance and training accidents.

The controversy began with the emergence of images showing agents on horseback blocking Haitian migrants from entering the US in a Del Rio riverine, and in one case grabbing onto a migrant is shirt. However, some media outlets and Democratic lawmakers misidentified the agents’ split reins, which they use to control the horse, as “whips” and accused the agents of whipping the migrants.

Other Border Patrol sources told Fox News that agents “will spin or twirl their reins in order to move the horse forward as a signal to the horse.”Another Border Patrol source told Townhall that agents on horseback move their reins for a lot of different reasons.“Primarily it is used to steer the horse, but agents will also spin them sometimes to deter people from getting too close to the horse,” he explained. “If they get too close, the horse can step on the m, breaking bones or causing other injuries. Agents also need to maintain control of their reins so they do not lose control of the horse, which can cause injuries to immigrants, the agents, and the horses.”The source said, “we are not aware of anyone being struck with the reins.”Fox News reporter Bill Melugin explained how the reins flop around while agents are riding.

Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas initially supported the agents, but changed his stance amid the harsh condemnation from the White House and left-wing Democrats. It appears the administration recognized an opportunity to pander to a core constituency, so pander it did. Mayorkas told a House Committee that the agents had been taken off the front lines amid an investigation that he expected to take days, rather than weeks.“I was horrified by what I saw,” Mayorkas told CNN. “I am going to let the investigation run its course. But the pictures that I observed troubled me profoundly. That defies all of the values that we seek to instill in our people.”White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Wednesday harshly criticized the Border Patrol agents. alleging that they used “brutal tactics” against illegal Haitians. Kamala Harris jumped on the bandwagon on Tuesday, claiming to be “deeply troubled” by the images.“What I saw depicted about those individuals on horseback treating human beings the way they were, was horrible,” Harris told reporters. “And I fully support what is happening right now, which is a thorough investigation into exactly what is going on there. But human beings should never be treated that way. And I am deeply troubled about it. And I will also be talking to Secretary [Alejandro] Mayorkas about it today.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer decried “images of inhumane treatment of Haitian migrants by Border Patrol—including the use of whips.”During Thursday is press briefing, Psaki said that it was important to “convey” that the images are “horrible and horrific” and that an investigation is ongoing.“I can also convey to you that [DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas] also conveyed to civil rights leaders earlier this morning that we would no longer be using horses in Del Rio,” she said.👀 Based on a debunked, false narrative about mounted Border Patrol agents supposedly using whips on illegal aliens, Psaki says agents are now banned from using horses in#DelRio.

The Tennessee Department of Education will launch a new dashboard on Tuesday that will include the total number of active cases among students and staff broken down by school across the state. The department will update the dashboard every Monday with the previous week is number of new cases and will include classroom or school closures and whether students are learning in-person, remotely or a hybrid of both for each district.“Parents and community members are working to make informed decisions, and we have determined the best path that balances informed decision making with our obligation to student privacy,” Education Commissioner Penny Schwinn said in a statement. “We believe this resource will not only help parents but will inform how COVID-19 is affecting student attendance, chronic absenteeism and overall student attainment.""Tennessee refuses to release information about COVID-19 cases in schoolsLee, Schwinn and state Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Pierceyhave all been criticized for not publicly reporting information on COVID-19 cases in schools. All have previously cited federal privacy law restrictions, like HIPAA and FERPA, for preventing the release of the information.""The real challenge is to provide as much information as possible to provide for transparency and to give information that is important to the public but continue to provide and adhere to privacy restrictions that FERPA and HIPAA require,"" Lee said previously. ""And that is a balance.""Lee acknowledged Thursday there is wide desire among parents for data that will help them make informed decisions about whether to send their children to school or not. Developing a dashboard to meet these needs appropriately was a process, Lee said during a news briefing.""We believe (the dashboard) will help parents make choices, but it will not compromise our commitment to parents and to students and to teachers,"" Lee said. ""It is uncharted territory. Most states are still grappling with this, but we think we have developed a tool that will be helpful in determining not only how many cases are in a school but also how it affects attendance, chronic absenteeism and even academic outcomes among our students.""Nearly200 COVID-19 cases linked to schools have been reported across the state since the first school districts in Tennessee reopened in late July, many prompting quarantines of students and staff and even temporary school closures. Dozens of school districts scrambled to launch their own online dashboards or other methods to report the number of positive cases among staff and students, how many individuals were in isolation or quarantine and school closures. Several states are already reporting or have committed to reporting the number of COVID-19 outbreaks in schools, including Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Ohio and Texas. These Tennessee school districts are already reporting COVID-19 cases after reopeningHow should districts notify parents about confirmed COVID-19 cases in their child is school?Schwinn said that the majority of state reporting efforts are being led by state health departments — the Tennessee Department of Education is the first to report cases in schools itself. The commissioner has been under fire in recent weeks from a group of lawmakers and some school district leaders over the education department is handling of the pandemic. From what information to report about confirmed cases to what safety guidance to follow in classrooms, some school leaders say the department has not given clear, consistent guidance. Lee released the state is school reopening guidance on July 28 — days after some Tennessee school districts had already reopened. Initially, he and Piercey said that neither the education or health departments would be tracking or reporting COVID-19 cases in schools. Helater announced that the state would work on a plan for reporting such data. Just a week later, Lee reversed course again and said the state would not release the data. After that, Lee said the state was contacting federal officials about what it could release. Deborah Fisher, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government, has consistently argued the public has the right to know what is happening in schools. She acknowledged that districts might be worried that if they release school data, people will use it to try to identify infected people.""It all comes down to, 'Are we somehow identifying that Joe Smith in third grade has COVID-19?"" Fisher said. But privacy concerns are also dueling with the public is right to know, Fisher said.“That has to be weighed with the need for the public to know what is happening in the schools,"" she said.

The state will not report specific case numbers for schools with less than 50 students enrolled — there are less than 40 of those statewide — and will not report the specific number of cases if the active case number is less than five. The education department routinely redacts student demographic or test data when it only applies to small numbers of students as a way to protect privacy.

583,White House orders eviction ban through end of year,0.0,53.5,https://www.rollcall.com/2020/09/01/eviction-ban-white-house-coronavirus/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-01,23,"The White House announced on Tuesday a blanket eviction ban through the end of the year covering nearly all residential renters, asserting the authority to do so through public health authorities provided to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent further spread of the coronavirus. Renters who ca not pay their lease due to COVID-19 will be able to go onto the CDC web site to fill out a form seeking eviction protection. According to senior administration officials on a background press briefing, that CDC-granted order would bar residential landlords from pursuing eviction against tenants for failing to pay the rent because of the pandemic.“Today is announcement from [the Trump] administration means that people struggling to pay rent due to the coronavirus will not have to worry about being evicted and risk further spread of, or exposure to, the disease due to economic hardship,” Deputy White House Press Secretary Brian Morgenstern told reporters. “The administration has also made federal funds available to alleviate any economic impacts to tenants, landlords and property owners.”No additional funds were made available on Tuesday, and the senior White House officials later clarified that this referred to funds given to states and localities in March as part of the $2 trillion economic relief package and earlier appropriations. Landlords, who have joined renter-advocate groups in calling for an additional $100 billion in direct aid, may face an up tick in unpaid rents, which could disrupt the mortgage bond market. On Twitter, Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, called the eviction moratorium “long overdue and badly needed,” saying it would “provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families.” But she added that the eviction suspension, without additional financial support, was only delaying the inevitable, calling it “a half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed.”The CDC eviction ban would go farther than the expired suspension enacted by Congress in March, which covered the 30 percent of renters who live in apartments with federally backed mortgages. That statutory moratorium ended in July. The Aspen Institute estimated in August that between 30 million and 40 million Americans, out of 110 million renters, could face eviction in the next several months absent additional government assistance. To qualify for the eviction protection order, a tenant must have been qualified to receive a stimulus check this year. That tenant would need to certify that they were unable to pay the rent due to coronavirus-related economic hardships, had made best efforts to seek rental assistance, and that an eviction would leave them homeless or forced into crowded housing. As with earlier eviction moratoria, the CDC protection would cover just evictions for failure to pay the rent. Landlords would still be allowed to evict tenants for other lease violations. Trump announced an executive order on August 8 directing the Treasury and Housing and Urban Development departments to come up with a response within existing legal authorities and appropriated funds. That move came after Democratic leaders appeared to deadlock with White House negotiators on talks for another economic rescue bill. Last week, the Federal Housing Administration and Federal Housing Finance Agency extended their foreclosure moratoria on federally backed home mortgages, which had been set to expire at the end of August, until December 31. Those orders protect fewer renters from eviction because they only cover properties that the FHA, or government-sponsored mortgage giants Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, currently own due to a pre-moratorium foreclosure. Federal extended unemployment insurance benefits expired at the end of July. Even without that extra $600 a week, 27 million Americans continued to file for unemployment insurance into the second week of August. Another Trump executive order allowed states to tap into Federal Emergency Management Agency relief funds to pay out an additional $300 per week in unemployment insurance. So far, 41 states have been approved to offer the funds, but just a handful have begun to do so. The FEMA funds are a stopgap. The extra benefits will run out as the $44 billion available runs dry. A Morning Consultsurveyreleased Tuesday showed how the unemployed were struggling with the reduced benefits: 50 percent of those surveyed in late August said they could not cover basic expenses with unemployment insurance, compared to 27 percent in late July. On the press call, the senior White House officials said that the eviction ban is legal authority stemmed from the broad powers given to the CDC by Congress to fight pandemics by issuing public health orders. The earlier moratorium authorized by Congress was limited to properties with federally backed mortgages, giving the federal government additional authority to regulate them. The White House is unilateral eviction order would cover millions of purely private contracts, inviting a potential legal challenge from affected landlords. The CDC order contends that housing stability helps prevent the spread of COVID-19.“Eviction moratoria facilitate self-isolation by people who become ill or who are at risk for severe illness from COVID-19 due to an underlying medical condition,” it reads. “They also allow State and local authorities to more easily implement stay-at-home and social distancing directives to mitigate the community spread of COVID-19.”",2,2,Roll Call

Journalists Olivia Beavers and Juliegrace Brufke, in an article for The Hill, discuss the possibility of a major blue wave in November and the fears that Republican activists are expressing behind closed doors. Some Republicans are privately expressing what Beavers and Brufke describe as a “growing sense of doom.” A GOP source, presumably interviewed on condition of anonymity, told The Hill, “If the election were to day, we would lose the House, the Senate and the White House.”Republicans already lost the US House of Representatives in 2018, when Democrats achieved a House majority. That source probably meant to say that Democrats would keep their House majority if the election were held to day, and Beavers and Brufke note that in order to retake the House in November, Republicans would need a “net 17 seats.”A House Republican, quoted anonymously, told The Hill, “This is the problem: (Trump) continues to allow it to be a referendum on himself. You ca not do that in a competitive race.”Another Republican in the House told The Hill that the GOP is 2016 playbook is not going to work in 2020, when the US is facing the coronavirus pandemic. According to that lawmaker, “People are looking for reassurance.... Chaos worked great in 2016, (but) they do not want it in 2020. They want to know that we are trusting science and doctors on the questions here, and they want to know we are going to get through it. There needs to be more FDR fireside chats and less Jerry Springer knockdowns.”Some polling released byQuinnipiac Universitythis week shows why some of the Republicans that spoke to The Hill are so pessimistic. According to Quinnipiac, Democrats are highly competitive in some high-profile Senate races. In deep red South Carolina, Quinnipiac found that incumbent Republican Senator Lindsey Graham — who has been a fixture in the Senate since the early 2000s — is tied with Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison at 44%. And in Maine, Quinnipiac found that Senator Susan Collins, a Republican, is trailing Democratic challenger Sara Gideon by 4%. Collins, in the past, was reelected by double digits; now, according to Quinnipiac, she is in danger of being voted out of office. Quinnipiac found that in Kentucky, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is leading Democrat Amy McGrath by 5%. That poll was much better news for McGrath than aMorning Consult poll released earlier this week; Morning Consult found McConnell ahead of McGrath by 17%. But in South Carolina, Morning Consult found Graham leading Harrison byon ly 1%. Of course, poll numbers can change. In 1988 is presidential election, there were summer polls that showed Democrat Mike Dukakis defeating the n-Vice President George HW Bush — whose poll numbers improved considerably in the fall. And Bush 41 enjoyed a decisive victory over Dukakis that year. But the US was not facing a deadly pandemic in 1988. Interviewed by The Hill, Representative Liz Cheney expressed confidence that Trump will defeat Biden in November. But what Republicans say publicly and what they say behind closed doors can vary considerably. And another Republican source, quoted anonymously, told The Hill that Trump is not going to win over conservative women by expressing “meanness” or attacking a member of his coronavirus task force like Dr. Deborah Birx.“Conservative women want to see empathy and compassion and do not like meanness,” that GOP source argued. “We are doing really poorly with married, white women. I do not at all understand the Deborah Birx attack at all — not politically and not morally.”",1,0,AlterNet
585,Biden Pledged to Close For-Profit ICE Detention Centers. Will He Follow Through?,-16.67,38.67,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/01/biden-pledged-to-close-for-profit-ice-detention-centers-will-he-follow-through/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-27,25,"A GEO Group guard at a Tacoma, Washington, immigration detention center in 2019. Ted S Warren/APIn 2019, Wilfred requested protection from political persecution at a California border crossing because he saw the USs as a beacon of hope. Instead, Wilfred, an African asylum seeker who asked to be identified by a pseudonym to protect associates in his home country from retaliation, wound up at a Mississippi immigration detention center with practices that he compared to the slave trade. Prison officials told detainees to walk with their hands behind their back, avoid eye contact with their jailers, and speak only when spoken to. After Mississippi, Immigration and Customs Enforcement sent Wilfred to Louisiana, where he used his training as a lawyer to help fellow detainees fight their cases. In what he says was retaliation for his lawyering, ICE moved him to the Allen Parish jail, another Louisiana detention center that he called “hell itself.” Upon arriving, he recalled an assistant warden, who was white, telling him, “I hear you are the trouble maker. If you try to create trouble for me here, I will shoot you.”Wilfred is experience—the indefinite detention, the trauma it caused, and the money prison companies made in the process—encapsulates the detention system President Joe Biden has taken over. The Trump administration took the already large detention network operated by ICE and pushed it to record size by opening more than 40new detention centers. But during the pandemic, detention levels fell to the lowest in decades, largely due to a Trump administration policy of summarily expelling people at the border. It means thatBiden has taken office with roughly 15,000 people in detention, down from an all-time high of more than 55,000 in the summer of 2019 and about41,000in November 2016. On Tuesday, Biden issued an executive order that directed the Justice Department to phase out its use of private prisons, but the order does not apply to ICE The Biden administration is considering issuing a similar order to cover immigration detention, but has no immediate plans to do so and some immigrant advocates doubt it ever will,reported. Silky Shah, the executive director of Detention Watch Network, said in a statement that her organization was encouraged by Tuesday is executive order. But, Shah added, the “Biden administration must now address the private prison industry is toxic relationship with the Department of Homeland Security,” which oversees ICE To understand the potential significance of Biden is campaign pledge, it helps to understand the categories that comprise the civil detention network for immigrants: ICE-owned detention centers operated by for-profit companies, local jails run by prison companies, detention centers owned and operated by prison companies, and locally run jails that have government contracts. Unlike the Justice Department is Bureau of Prisons, ICE has no detention centers that it owns and operates. Margo Schlanger, a law professor at the University of Michigan who led the Department of Homeland Security is civil rights and civil liberties division during the Obama administration, hopes that Biden will count all detention centers operated by prison companies as for-profit, regardless of whether they are owned by ICE or local jurisdictions. That would commit his administration to eliminating most of ICE is detention capacity. As of January 2020, Eunice Cho, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU is National Prison Project, says ICE was holding 81 percent of all detainees at facilities owned or operated by for-profit companies. (The White House did not respond to a request for comment about what it considers to be for-profit detention centers.)Should this policy be enacted, the result would be that essentially the only ICE detention centers that would remain would be local jails—whichtend to be as bad as or worse than the for-profit detention centers. (The Allen Parish jail that Wilfred called “hell itself” is one of them.) Like private prisons, they are cash cows. But instead of funneling money to shareholders, they prop up cash-strapped towns and sheriffs’ offices that ICE often pays around $60 per day per detainee. Schlanger knows the problems with local jails but says the main priority right now is to reduce the number of immigrants in detention. Pressuring Biden to stop using for-profit detention centers makes sense as a strategy because he is already committed to it. Should for-profit detention be eliminated, the question could quickly become where to hold the people who remain detained. Other than abolishing detention altogether, which the Biden administration has shown no intention of doing, the options would be to keep using local jails or come up with a new form of detention that is not for-profit. That could mean repurposing community colleges or halfway houses to hold immigrants, according to a former ICE official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. People at those facilities would not be free, but they would not be in jails built to hold a criminal population. Many immigrant advocates, who often favor eliminating ICE detention entirely, would oppose this kind of shift. As Schlanger put it, “I do not think the advocacy community is very interested right now in taking one huge system of detention and substituting another system of detention.”Sarah Gardiner, the policy director at Freedom for Immigrants, framed Biden is campaign promise to end for-profit detention as a “critical first step” toward her group is ultimate goal of detention abolition. Adding to the challenges for the Biden administration is that the number of immigrants in detention mostly plummeted in 2020 because the Trump administration largely sealed off the border during the pandemic. The order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ostensibly to combat the coronavirus, causes border crossers to be summarily removed from the country before they even have a chance to enter ICE custody or to request asylum. The Biden administration has signaled that initially it will keep the CDC order in place to avoid a sudden increase in the number of people arriving at the border, but will presumably end the draconian policy at some point. Once it does, people will start entering ICE custody instead of being immediately expelled, and the numbers of people in detention could quickly balloon unless the agency releases more people on bond or parole than they did under Trump. John Sandweg, who led ICE under Obama, disagrees with advocates who favor getting rid of immigration detention. But he supports ICE taking a more risk-based and individualized approach under which only people deemed a threat to public safety or a flight risk remain detained. “I think we would find that ICE is detention needs are probably in the 12,000 range,” he says, “and nowhere near the 30 to 35,000 range.”The Biden administration does not have to wait to take this approach. Cho points out that ICE can quickly review the status of everyone in custody with the presumption that people should be released, the reby flipping the current approach under which the burden is on people in detention to show that they should be released. Beyond that, Cho says ICE could eliminate use of the cash bonds that can be prohibitively expensive. Adopting those changes would help many of the people who remain detained today in facilities where social distancing is impossible and COVID-19 outbreaks have been rampant. (As of Sunday, more than9,000people in ICE custody had tested positive for COVID-19 and 593 were being monitored for active infections.)There are already some signs the Biden administration is moving towards letting out more people. It started a100-day pause on some deportations, and David Pekoske, the acting Homeland Security Secretary, has directed ICE to provide a process for an individualized review for people who have deportation orders that are more than 90-days old. As part of that process, ICE will look at whether detainees can be released, or have their cases stayed, or reopened. But the status of that process was upended on Tuesday when a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the deportation pause. In May, Wilfred sued for his release, and in a rare move, a judge assigned him a federal public defender. In October, the judge granted his legal team is request to depose a senior ICE official and the warden of the Allen Parish jail. Two weeks later, ICE released him after 14 months in detention. The case became moot, and the ICE official avoided having to testify under oath. Karim Golding, who came to the USs from Jamaica at 9 years old, has not had the same good fortune as Wilfred. After being arrested as a 21-year-old for selling cocaine and two handguns, he served 10 years in prison. When he was released in 2016, ICE took him into custody. He is now at the Etowah County jail, anotoriousAlabama jail that ICE uses for the long-term detention of people like Golding who are willing to fight their deportation for years. On March 20, as news of the pandemic spread, Golding and another detainee protested to demand that people transferred to the jail be quarantined first. He put a noose fashioned out of bed sheets around his neck and tied the other end to the second-floor railing of his unit, theInterceptreported. The threat of suicide forced officials at the jail totalk with the detainees about doing more to protect them from COVID-19, but it ultimately was not enough to prevent a coronavirus outbreak. In July, Golding started feeling ill and tested positive for COVID-19. In what appeared to be retaliation for demanding better conditions before testing positive, GoldingtoldtheIntercepthe spent nearly two month in solitary confinement. It was summer in Alabama, and the cell he spent 23 hours a day in lacked air conditioning. After we spoke in December, another outbreak was reported at Etowah, this one affecting six detainees as of Sunday. Like nearly everyone I have interviewed who has experienced both federal prison and ICE detention, Golding told me that the conditions in prison had been far better. Despite everything he’d been though, Golding said he favored keeping some immigration detention for people the government could show are dangerous. He thought that approach would leave ICE with something like two or three detention centers. To Wilfred, it seemed reasonable that people who come to the country seeking asylum would be detained for a few months while they establish that they have a significant chance of being persecuted in their home countries and the US government verifies their identity. The difference, however, is that during that time, he believes people should be held in more humane conditions. He asked why people in civil detention, which is supposed to be non-punitive, are marched around in orange jumpsuits or taken to medical appointments in shackles. “That was my worst experience: the chains,” he says, recalling being shackled, “I felt like the slavery life was reliving itself in us.”Golding hoped that people on the outside would not stop fighting for detained immigrants once Trump was out of office. He compared Trump to 9/11, explaining that the former president had united normally disparate factions. “But we have a tendency of getting complacent after these tragedies, and he was that tragedy,” he said. “You do not want to be like, ‘Biden is the solution.’ We want to hold him accountable.”",1,1,Mother Jones
586,Migrant Who Believed It Was “Okay” to Rape Irish Girl Jailed for 12 Years,22.25,12.75,https://newspunch.com/migrant-okay-rape-irish-girl-jailed-12-years/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newspunch-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-17,22,"The Central Criminal Court heard the 42-year-old man, a migrant who admitted to raping the child, initially thought the crime was “.”Irishtimes.comreports: He was later convicted by a jury, after a trial, of charges of raping his step-daughter. His lawyer told the court he does not accept those verdicts. In her victim impact statement, the girl said the family were experiencing financial and other implications from the man no longer being in the home. She said she sometimes felt these were her fault. She said she now suffers self esteem, worry and stress issues. She was unable to sleep and her school work suffered. She said she had broken down when she heard the verdict. “I sometimes feel as if I am at the bottom of the ocean,” she said, “with no light at all.” She does not want to see the man again, the court heard. Last January, the man pleaded guilty at the Central Criminal Court to three counts of defilement of a child under the age of 17 years old on dates between March and June 2017. He had pleaded not guilty one count of oral rape, 12 counts of rape and three counts of defilement of the same girl on dates between 2011 and 2017. He also denied a further count of sexual exploitation of the girl in July 2017. The jury convicted him of all these charges in January. The victim was aged between 11 and almost 16 years old at the time of the offences. Mr Justice Michael White said the offences had been a “serious violation of a child” which involved a very serious breach of trust as the man had been in a position of authority. He also noted the length of time the offences continued and the severity of the abuse. He took into account that the man was an Irish citizen of foreign extraction with very little English and prison would be more difficult as a result. He also noted the man had no previous convictions and had been a good provider. The judge said he was particularly disturbed by the fact that the “intolerable” abuse was happening “as a matter of rote.”“When you think of the nature of the offences, it does not bear thinking about,” said Mr Justice White. The judge imposed concurrent sentences totalling 12 years. A local gar da told Vincent Heneghan SC, prosecuting, that the abuse began with oral rape when the victim was 11 years old and the man later began having sex with her “on a highly regular basis” in the family home while the child is mother was away working. The sexual abuse continued until June 2017 when she was 15 years old. After making a disclosure to members of her family she made a complaint to gardaí in July 2017. The count of sexual exploitation refers to a phone call between the victim and the man, which was heard on loudspeaker by family members in July 2017. The accused invited the child to have sex with him for €200. The court heard the man effectively controlled the victim during the time of the offences in a domestic situation where he was a position of authority. Damien Colgan SC, defending, said his client accepted what he did was wrong and stands over his guilty pleas in relation to three charges of defilement. He said the man does not accept the jury verdicts on the other counts. He said the man had no previous convictions, a good work history and had abided by all his bail conditions. He asked the court to take into account that the man would be serving his sentence as a foreign national in an Irish prison.",0,0,NewsPunch

With the coronavirus pandemic upending previous plans, Democrats will meet for two hours nightly, from 8 to 10 p.m. Central time, when they stage their mostly virtual national convention at the Wisconsin Center in Milwaukee. The schedule — adopted by a key committee Thursday — provides the broad outline of what is shaping up to be a carefully crafted and staged proceeding. It will also be one of the shortest conventions in history by total time. The event runs August 17-20, with Joe Biden expected to accept the party is presidential nomination in Milwaukee on the final night. Biden is vice presidential nominee, still to be announced, will be nominated on August 19 and address the gathering. The speech is expected to take place in Milwaukee, although details are not confirmed. A keynote address is scheduled for August 18, the same night of the presidential roll call, which will be conducted virtually. The convention will open August 17, with committee reports on credentials, rules and the platform, and select speakers. Convention planners also confirmed that former President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama will participate, although where they will be speaking from has not been announced. There will also be a tribute to the late US Representative John Lewis. That spot is being produced by Dawn Porter, who was the producer-director of ""John Lewis: Good Trouble.""Delegates have been asked not to attend the event in person because of concerns over the coronavirus pandemic. They are casting ballots remotely, beginning next week. Members of Congress have also been told not to travel to Milwaukee. Democrats are calling this a ""Convention Across America,"" featuring speeches and events from other sites, with Milwaukee anchoring the proceedings. This convention is anything but typical. Normally at a party gathering, meetings are well-attended during the day with the delegates gathering for several hours nightly to listen to speeches. The 1872 Democratic Convention in Baltimore is reputedly the shortest on record,clocking in at six hours over two days. This year is event is in essence an abbreviated event at an unprecedented time. Top Democrats were named to the convention leadership, led by honorary chairs House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and US Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. US Representative Bennie Thompson of Mississippi was named permanent convention chair. US Representative Gwen Moore of Milwaukee, who helped bring the event to the city, will be the sergeant-of-arms. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett is among the permanent co-chairs of the convention, with Governor Phil Murphy of New Jersey, US Sens. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois and Tom Carper of Delaware, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms and US Representative Tony Cárdenas of California. Jason Rae, who lives in the Milwaukee area, is the party is secretary. Democrats also released a schedule of daily virtual meetings and caucuses that will take place around the convention.""We are looking forward to a historic convention anchored in Milwaukee, and through the leadership of the permanent officers who will help oversee this convention Democrats will come together to continue the work to elect Joe Biden as the next President of the USs,” DNC Chair Tom Perez said in a statement.“We have an exciting lineup of programming over the course of four nights as we seek a better future for all Americans, and unite around our shared values and Joe Biden is vision for a better, safer future for the country.”",2,2,Milwaukee Journal Sentinel
588,‘Constitutional carry’ comes to Texas. The trend in five charts.,-4.33,44.67,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Justice/2021/0602/Constitutional-carry-comes-to-Texas.-The-trend-in-five-charts,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-02,25,"Soon, most adult Texans will be able to openly carry a handgun in public. No background check or training necessary. It will be a major expansion in gun rights, one that Texas is uncharacteristically late in arriving at. About 20 other states already have “permitless carry” (also known as “constitutional carry”) laws, including Vermont. Vermont is an outlier, having never regulated gun possession in its history. It is legal to carry a concealed handgun in all 50 states, though most require a license, training, and a completed background check. In Texas, for open or concealed carry, residents generally need to pass a written exam and a shooting proficiency test, complete four to six hours of training, and submit their fingerprints. When Texas changes its gun laws, the USs takes notice. But “permitless carry” already has been adopted in 19 other states. What are the effects so far?The new permit less carry law awaiting Texas Governor Greg Abbott is signature would nix that requirement, essentially making permits – and the training and paper trails that come with them – optional. Only those already barred from carrying a gun would be excluded. It is one trend in a rapidly changing gun rights landscape. Nineteen of the states with permit less carry adopted the laws in the past decade, due in great part to National Rifle Association lobbying efforts. (Tennessee Governor Bill Lee thanked the group in at weet after signing the bill into law.)“Part of it is simply exploiting the fact you have some very conservative state legislatures that are very receptive to this kind of thing,” says Robert Spitzer, a political science professor at the State University of New York, Cortland, who studies gun politics. But other states have been moving in the opposite direction. Liberal states like New York and California have passed new gun control laws – often following high-profile mass shootings – that include banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and requiring background checks on all gun sales. President Joe Biden is also supporting various gun control measures. In that sense, the growth of permit less carry is also “an ideological push in the opposite direction,” says Dr. Spitzer. Handgunlaw.usSupporters of permit less carry argue that it helps protect citizens’ Second Amendment rights and makes the public safer.“Every law-abiding Montanan should be able to defend the mselves and their loved ones,” said Governor Greg Gianforte when he signed Montana is permit less carry bill into l awin February. But the laws have also conjured up visions of Wild West-era lawlessness, and provoked fears of increased crime and violence. When Oklahoma adopted its constitutional carry law in 2019, local news reported that not much happened afterward, “at least on its first weekend.”Law enforcement officials have publicly opposed permit less carry in many states. The Missouri Fraternal Order of Police did, as didal l the county sheriffs in West Virginia. The public, including Republicans and gun owners, also often opposes scrapping permits. In Kansas and Missouri, local law enforcement, government officials, and certified gun trainers told researcher swith the Urban Institutein 2018 they mainly disapproved of permit less carry because training would no longer be required.“Law enforcement was concerned with accidental shootings, or increased firearm the fts if guns are not secured properly,” says Paige Thompson, a researcher at the Urban Institute.“It is [also] very difficult for them to determine whether someone is ineligible to carry a firearm without a permit because the re is no [state] background check,” she adds, or “background checks for private sales.“DMN/UT Tyler March 2020 poll, Everytown for Gun Safety February 2016 poll, Everytown for Gun Safety March 2019 poll, University of Iowa March-April 2021 pollSo who is right? Does permit less carry increase safety, or violence? Since the laws are only a few years old, researchers say more time is needed to see if they have a notable effect on public safety.“There has not been much research on permit less carry,” says Andrew Morral, leader of the Gun Policy in America study initiative at the Rand Corp.“Most of the research has been done looking at ‘shall issue’ concealed carry laws versus ‘may issue’ concealed carry laws,” he adds. In “shall issue” states, applicants generally get permits if they meet the requirements. In “may issue” states, meanwhile, law enforcement has some discretion to deny permits to certain individuals. It is here, where research has been building for decades, that experts are beginning to draw some conclusions. John Donohue, a professor at Stanford Law School who has been studying gun policy for decades, says it took about 20 years “before I was able to draw a strong conclusion about the impacts of the laws.”His conclusions, outlined in a2019 paper, include the findings that more permissive gun carry laws are associated with rates of violent crime that are 13% to 15% higher 10 years after adoption. Other research has tied more permissive gun carry laws to increased firearms homicides. For permit less carry laws specifically, crime statistics show little significant change – at least that can be attributed to the laws the mselves. Alaska Department of Public Safety, Arizona Department of Public Safety, US Census Bureau“It has been difficult to study [permitless carry law] effects given the short timeline,” says Dr. Spitzer. And to the counterargument, he adds, “there is no evidence that civilian gun carrying has any beneficial effect on suppressing, stopping, or reducing crime.”An analysis of several thousand gun policy studies by the Rand Corp.last yea rfound that evidence that concealed carry laws increase homicides and other kinds of violent crime is limited at best, but mostly inconclusive.“The research is improving in this area,” says Dr. Morral. Unfortunately, he adds, “I do not think the data is improving. In some ways the data is moving backwards.”The FBI, for example,changed the program it uses to collect local crime data this year. The new program will allow for more detailed reporting, but reporting is voluntary. Dr. Morral and others have concerns that participation will drop off and there will be less data to study. For now, it is hard to deliver a conclusive verdict on what effect permit less carry laws have on public safety, if they have an effect at all. Rand surveyed a range of experts – including academics, advocacy groups, and legislative staff – on how adopting permit less carry nationwide could affect public safety, for example. Responses diverged significantly. RAND Gun Policy Outcome ExplorerIn its next term, the US Supreme Court will hear a case concerning a restrictive New York concealed carry law, its first big Second Amendment case in more than a decade. The court has to date ruled only that the Second Amendment protects having a handgun in the home for self-defense. This case could see that protection expanded to handgun possession outside the home. The gun rights landscape could thus be poised for even greater change. Whichever direction the statistics and research take, politics will continue to play a powerful role.“Over a considerable period of time, [the evidence] was murky enough that the theoretical arguments against [permissive carry] laws were not powerful enough to stop the m,” says Dr. Donohue.“Now the political dynamics are so powerful that even with the evidence becoming more clear, the political dynamics are dominating the best empirical evidence.”",2,2,Christian Science Monitor
589,College Enrollment Dip Hits Students of Color the Hardest,-2.0,47.33,https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/college-enrollment-dip-hits-students-of-color-the-hardest/2021/06,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,25,"Corrected: An earlier version of this story incorrectly noted the drop in two-year college enrollment for new graduating seniors in 2020; it was 12 percent, not 12 percentage points. During the 2020-21 school year, 120,000 fewer new high school graduates entered the nation is colleges and universities than the year before, according to anew analysis by the College Board. The pandemic has particularly set back students of color, and seems to have set up significantly different education trends in two- and four-year colleges. For students heading to four-year, public universities, the pandemic was more of a road bump than a road block—and for some, it was even an opportunity. Public four-year colleges saw an enrollment decline of less than 3 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. At some more selective four-year colleges, enrollment actually increased, because the institutions started to accept more students with lower GPAs after seeing more of the highest-performing high school graduates opting to sit out this year. Likewise, the incoming students at four-year colleges became more likely to stay through their freshman year. But community colleges and other two-year institutions—which several states have promoted through tuition “promise” programs and similar scholarships—experienced a different story. Overall enrollment in those schools dropped 12 percent among new graduating seniors in 2020 compared to the prior class. Moreover, the drop in enrollment for most students of color at two-year colleges was several times worse than the decline for such students at four-year colleges. At two-year colleges, for example, Black, Hispanic, and Native Hawaiian students’ enrollment rates dropped by about 15 percent each, while at four-year colleges, the drop in enrollment was only 1.9 percent for Hispanic students and 2.6 percent for Native Hawaiian students. There was no statistically significant change in Black student enrollment at four-year colleges in 2020, compared to the prior year.“We usually see college enrollment increase during recessions, particularly at community colleges, but not this time,” said Jessica Howell, vice president of research for the College Board and a co-author of the report. “When we start to look under the hood of that to p-line result we start to start to see a new picture of disparate impact emerging.”That is because community colleges disproportionately serve some of the same students whose communities have also been hit hardest by the pandemic, Howell said. She noted that the two-year college sector typically attracts “many of the subgroups of students who are historically under-resourced or vulnerable or underrepresented in higher ed., or disadvantaged more broadly in terms of educational opportunity—underrepresented minority students, first-generation students, students who live in some of the most educationally disadvantaged neighborhoods and attend some of the highest poverty high schools—and the impact of the pandemic on college enrollment rates is quite clearly most severe among those students.”Moreover, the College Board found about 5 percent fewer students entering two-year colleges in 2020 returned after their first year, an opposite trend from what was seen in four-year colleges. Researchers did find that college enrollment was lower in counties with high COVID-19 infection rates—generally those above 15.8 daily cases per 10,000 residents—but again, the effect was strongest for two-year colleges. College Board researchers analyzed data from more than 3 million graduating high school seniors from each of the 2018, 2019, and 2020 classes. They also accounted in the data for trends in enrollment at different kinds of colleges that had already begun before the pandemic. Other recent studies have suggested students who graduated in communities hit hardest by the pandemic is economic downturn also had more competition for financial aid. That could mean the disparities in college enrollment could worsen next year, as separate studies have found the Class of 2021 already falling behind even the prior year in applying for colleges and arranging financial aid.“It is important to note that the students we are talking about [in the class of 2020] really did not have too much disruption to their learning,” Howell said. “They did not have any disruption to their testing. They did not face widespread changes to admissions practices—all of which are things, of course, that affected the class of 2021 much more.”",2,1,Education Week
590,Pregnant health care workers could get Pfizer vaccine after FDA emergency authorization,-0.67,44.67,https://19thnews.org/2020/12/pregnant-health-care-workers-could-get-pfizer-vaccine-after-fda-panel-votes-for-emergency-authorization/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-10,25,"A top government panel voted in favor of granting an emergency use authorization for Pfizer is coronavirus vaccine candidate for people 16 and older, including those who are pregnant — a major step toward administering the first round of COVID-19 immunizations in the USs, and a notable departure from how British regulators addressed the pregnancy question. The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee is recommendation will now head to the Food and Drug Administration, which is expected to accept that advice. If the FDA grants emergency authorization, some Americans could start receiving vaccines within a matter of days, and the majority will likely be women. Emergency use authorizations (EUAs) are an interim way to make drugs available in crises, but they require less safety and efficacy data than does full government approval. At Thursday is meeting, government scientists emphasized the need to track the health of people who receive the initial Pfizer vaccines, monitoring both their level of immunity and what kind of adverse reactions they have. Pfizer is planning to seek full government approval next spring, after submitting more vaccine data. The 19th thanks our sponsors. Become one. Still, the authorization has major implications. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised that the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines be given to health care workers — particularly those in direct contact with people who have contracted the coronavirus — and residents of nursing homes. State governments will be charged with distributing vaccines to eligible residents. But there will not immediately be enough vaccines to cover everyone, even in those groups. Women will likely constitute the majority of immediate beneficiaries. About 20 million Americans work in health care, and 75 percent of those workers are women. More than two-thirds of the nation is 1.3 million long-term nursing home residents are women. Notably, the FDA advisory committee did not explicitly prohibit giving the vaccine to pregnant people otherwise eligible for the vaccine. That leaves open the door for health care workers who are pregnant and breastfeeding during the initial vaccine distribution — an estimated 330,000 people — to get the two-shot regimen when their states and hospitals receive the vaccine. Pfizer is large-scale vaccine trial excluded those who were pregnant or breastfeeding.“We have really no data to speak to risks specific to pregnant women or fetuses, but also no data that would warrant a contra-indication to use in pregnancy at this time,” Doran Fink, an FDA deputy director who specializes in vaccines, said at the meeting. “In the interest of allowing women of child-bearing potential who would consider vaccination, who are in the population approved for use under an EUA – they would be free to make their own decision, in conjunction with their health care providers.”During the meeting, government officials acknowledged the particular challenge posed by vaccinating pregnant people, especially those who are more likely to be exposed to the virus through work.“The early indication is there may be a higher risk of preterm delivery for pregnant women infected with COVID-19 compared to women without COVID-19, but the re is ongoing efforts to assess those and other pregnancy-related risks,” Aron Hall, a CDC scientist, told the panel. On Thursday, Pfizer said it expected to have data by mid-December about whether animal trials of the vaccine would have negative repercussions on the reproductive system — something known as “reproductive toxicity” — which is an important question for pregnant people taking the vaccine. And though Pfizer excluded pregnant people from enrolling in the study, 23 participants became pregnant during the trial, according to company data. Twelve received the vaccine, and 11 were in the placebo group. That information is not enough to draw larger-scale conclusions. The FDA has required that Pfizer track and submit regular data about how people respond if they get the vaccine while pregnant, including whether they develop any adverse events. The company also intends to launch studies on pregnancy and the vaccine next year. Immediately, it is likely that states and local health care systems will have to decide how to distribute a limited supply of vaccines. They could determine on their own whether to treat pregnant health care workers as part of the immediate priority immunization group. Medical groups, including the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the American College for Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have argued that pregnant health care workers should be given the option of taking the vaccine. The technology behind Pfizer is vaccine, messenger RNA, is not known to cause special problems for either pregnant people or their fetuses. (Messenger RNA is also the basis for the Zika vaccine.)In anop-ed published this week at Stat News, three medical ethicists argued that pregnant health care workers should be given the option to take any early vaccine, factoring in their risk of on-the-job COVID exposure.“A restrictive policy would not only deny pregnant and lactating individuals the opportunity to work with the same protection afforded their co-workers, but would further strain available human health resources over the next few months, when pandemic cases — and the need for health care — are peaking,” the authors wrote.",2,2,19th News

That is his re-election platform — nonsense. Among other points, Trump claimed that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden should drop out of the presidential race because of the unfounded corruption allegations against the Bidens that Trump is cronies have been pushing. A report released by Senate Republicans just this week failed to confirm that the Biden family financial relationships in question had any impact whatsoever on US foreign policy, as Trump previously alleged. Summary of the first segment of Trump is Fox News Radio interview:– Baseless claims about Biden– Baseless claims about mail ballots– Boasts about how Mike and Chris Wallace like him, in part because he gave/gives them good ratings— Daniel Dale (@ddale8)September 24, 2020Trump said:‘I look at Hunter Biden, where he stole millions of dollars. Stole millions! His father should leave the campaign, because his father was in on it, his father knew everything — far more than we thought in Ukraine, far more than we thought in China, and now other countries are added. Look at what is going on! The newspapers do not even want to write about it, except the New York Post has it on the front page, which is great — good old New York Post is great. They should get the Pulitzer.’Trump is lying. Hunter Biden did not “steal millions of dollars,” and his father — Joe Biden — did not “know everything.” Hunter Biden had globe-spanning financial/ business entanglements, and these entanglements had no documented impact on the foreign policy of the US while Joe Biden was vice president. These are the facts. Trump is lying about mail-in ballots on Fox Radio. He keeps lying about them. There is no evidence to support his lies. Mail-in ballots are safe.— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1)September 24, 2020Listen to Trump is comments below:Meanwhile, Trump also claimed that ballots that had “Trump written on the m” were found in a garbage can, and he tried to present this dubiously characterized anecdote as evidence that mail-in ballots are a “horror show.” He could not even name the state where this apparent incident took place — he said it happened in a “certain state” — and he struggled on other basic facts too. Voters do not generally write the names of the candidates they are voting for on their ballots; they fill in bubbles or maybe boxes, although yes, discarded ballots were recently discovered that had been filled out to support Trump. Still, the fact that a ballot happened to be thrown in with trash (or something along those lines) does not, in any respect, mean that there was some kind of fraud. Maybe the voters messed up their choices and wanted to request new ballots. If that happened — the n voila, no fraud.

The US Environmental Protection Agency is decision,announced Wednesday, applies to PacificCorp is Hunter and Huntington power plants in Emery County. The revised emission-reduction plan credits the utility is prior retirement of the nearby Carbon Power Plantand prior emission-reduction investments, concluding it does not need to make any new upgrades at the operating plants in order to comply with the Clean Air Act.“It is frustrating to have the answer right in front of us and the n have politics overshadow the science,” said Kirstin Peterson, owner of Rim Tours in Moab. “The only thing that Utah is new haze plan does is ensure that we are going to continue having polluted skies that mar Utah is tremendous landscapes and harm the health of visitors, wildlife, resources and our outdoor recreation economy.”In authorizing the new plan, the EPA withdrew the previous plan approved by the Obama administration in 2016, which had called for expensive selective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment installed at the plants. Such upgrades would have cut nitrogen oxide emissions, a leading cause of haze, by 75% according to the National Parks Conservation Association, or NPCA In 2017, however, a federal appeals court granted a request by the Trump administration to halt the plan.“We appreciate the efforts of EPA to act on Utah is plan and the many stakeholders who participated in the development of the plan.” Bryce Bird, director of the Utah Division of Air Quality, said in a statement released Wednesday by the EPA. “Utah is regional haze plan has protected visibility in our national parks, supported rural economies and reduced emissions of harmful air pollutants for the residents and visitors to the state.”According to the EPA, Utah is new plan will reduce missions by 1,879 to ns per year relative to the 2016 plan. Conservationists, however, argued the replacement plan does nothing to clean the air.“Smart communities all across the West began moving away from fossil fuels and building new, thriving economies by diversifying and investing in clean energy, outdoor recreation, and long-term, sustainable job prospects even before COVID hit,” said Scott Williams, executive director ofHEAL Utah. “We cannot afford a rear-view mirror approach that puts a dying coal industry ahead of a vibrant outdoor recreation economy that Utah has built.”According to an analysis by NPCA, the Hunter and Huntington plants, which began operating in 1978 and 1974, respectively, are among the nation is worst in terms of their haze pollution, which affects Utah is “Mighty 5” national parks. The three-unit Hunter plant ranks Number 2 on the list of all pollution sources in the nation, not just coal plants, while the Huntington plant ranks Number 18.“We need leaders with a bold vision, who can see past the politics and industry pressure to come up with a real plan that steers us toward clean energy resources,” said Cory MacNulty, NPCA is southwest associate director. “We will continue to fight until Utahns and our national parks have the clean air they need and deserve.”",2,2,Salt Lake Tribune

The McCloskeys, a pair of personal injury lawyers who famously pointed guns at demonstrators in front of their palatial residence this summer, instantly went down as one of the most unusual appearances in the history of presidential conventions. They are a pair no other president would have invited — but Trump. Mark and Patty McCloskey warned that in an America under a future President Joe Biden, other Americans would likewise be forced to defend the mselves from protestors on their own front lawns.“No matter where you live, your family will not be safe in the radical Democrats’ America,” said Patty McCloskey. The couple beamed into the convention from their Renaissance palazzo-style mansion in St. Louis, seated on a couch in a room richly-paneled with dark wood, and spoke straight to the camera. They warned other Americans that the y, too, may soon have to wave their own weapons at unruly gangs of demonstrators if Donald Trump loses the 2020 election.“What you saw happen to us could just as easily happen to any of you who are watching from quiet neighborhoods across this country,” Patty McCloskey said. “And that is what we want to speak to you about tonight.”The pair also complained bitterly about getting slapped with criminal charges for felony unlawful use of a deadly weapon over the incident.“Not a single person in the out-of-control mob you saw at our house was charged with a crime,” Mark McCloskey said. “But you know who was? We were.”The couple went on to allege that Democrats want to “abolish the suburbs altogether,” by ending single-family home zoning.“The radicals are not content just marching in the streets. They want to walk the halls of Congress,” Mark McCloskey said. “They want to take over. They want power. This is Joe Biden is party. These are the people who will be in charge of your future, and the future of your children.”",1,1,Vice

Most particularly, he should stop sitting for interviews at all. In yet another Fox News interview on Wednesday, Trump continued to beat the drum on his mental acuity and proved once again that he has none. Ca not stop watching Trump on the cognitive test:""The last questions are much more difficult. Like a memory question. It is like you will go 'person, woman, man, camera, TV.' So they say could you repeat that? I said, yeah. 'Person, woman, man, camera, TV.' Okay, that is very good.""pic.twitter.com/Ggv42oGliu— Kyle Griffin (@kylegriffin1)July 23, 2020Trump told interviewer Marc Siegel in an interview on Fox News that he took a cognitive test at Walter Reed Medical Center in November to prove to voters and the “fake news media” that he is “sharp” and fit to be president. For some reason, however, he would not admit at the time that a cognitive test was included in the visit, saying only that it was a routine annual physical (which does not include a cognitive test), discounting his reasoning because nothing is “proven” to the public when you do not tell anyone. After a disastrous interview with Chris Wallace of Fox News, which aired on Sunday, Trump took much criticism for his rambling answers, his insistence that a basic cognitive test to rule out dementia was “hard,” his utter resistance to fact-checks, and his dismissive attitude toward the coronavirus response that has left more than 140,000 Americans dead. Trump keeps boasting about passing a cognitive test — but it does not mean what he thinks it does— The Washington Post (@washingtonpost)July 23, 2020Trump is approval numbers are at their lowest and, for context, is on track to be the same as George HW Bush is and Jimmy Carter is when they ran for their second terms. As a reminder, both lost. No matter how bad these interviews are, Trump insists they are “great.” However, they are really not doing him any favors. So much else in the Fox News Sunday interview, but this dangerous statement should not be ignored:""I think mail-in voting is going to rig the election.""Will you accept the results of the election: ""I have to see.""— Bill Kristol (@BillKristol)July 19, 2020Featured image screen shot viaYouTubeNo related posts.",0,0,Bipartisan Report
597,America is Holy War Comes to the RNC,-16.67,36.67,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/religion-republican-convention/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,25,"On Wednesday night, former football Coach Lou Holtz spoke at the Republican National Convention and questioned Joe Biden is faith. “The Biden-Harris ticket is the most radically pro-abortion campaign in history,” Holtz said. “They and other politicians are Catholics in name only and abandon innocent lives. President Trump protects those lives.” Joe Biden responded by saying, “I am a practicing Catholic. I do not proselytize about it.” He added, “I never miss Mass. It is who I am.” In truth, although no proselytizer, Biden is more open about his religious faith than any Democratic presidential candidate since Jimmy Carter, who famously defined himself as a born-again Christian. Biden, if elected, would be only the second Catholic ever to be president. His Catholicism was repeatedly emphasized at the Democratic convention, especially by a leading surrogate, Delaware Senator Chris Coons. “People, Joe believes, were made in the image of God. Joe learned that from his parents and the nuns and priests right here in Delaware, who taught him and inspired in him a passion for justice,” said Coons. “Joe is faith is really about our future, about a world with less suffering and more justice, where we are better stewards of creation, where we have a more just immigration policy and where we call out and confront the original sins of this nation, the sins of slavery and racism. Joe knows these are central issues in this election. And for him, they are rooted in faith.” Religion is a central fault line in American politics. Biden and Coons are articulating a version of liberal Christianity where faith is defined by private worship and actions to ameliorate the world. This stands in contrast to the conservative Christianity of Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. The Trump/Pence version of Christianity is a fusion of religion with reactionary nationalism, where faith is defined by protecting a traditional way of life against foes both domestic and foreign. This way of life can be defined in simple shorthand as a nostalgic idealization of 1950s America, with the need to maintain rigid racial and gender hierarchies. This explains the importance Trump-supporting Christians give to issues like abortion, immigration (threatening because it changes the racial demography of America), and LGBT rights. In his speech at the RNC on Wednesday night, Mike Pence said, “Let is run the race marked out for us. Let is fix our eyes on Old Glory and all she represents. Let is fix our eyes on this land of heroes and let their courage inspire. And let is fix our eyes on the author and perfecter of our faith and freedom and never forget that where the spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom—and that means freedom always wins.” As The Washington Post reports, Pence is words were a reworking of two Bible verses (2 Corinthians 3:17 and Hebrews 12:1-2) but with “Old Glory” replacing “Jesus.” Pence is in effect defining American nationalism as holy, the literal equivalent of God. Some Christians find this equation of nation with divinity to be an affront to their faith. Greg Jao, senior assistant to the president of InterVarsity, a leading campus religious organization, tweeted, “Glad Pence seems to know Scripture; grieved & appalled he’d believe substituting ‘Old Glory’ for ‘Jesus’ was not blasphemous and equating the freedom Paul was referring to with civil liberties.” Because the faith Trump and Pence are selling is religious nationalism, Christian Republicans can easily reconcile the mselves to supporting Donald Trump despite the fact that he is clearly a biblical illiterate and profane libertine. For Christian nationalists, religion is not a matter of going to church, having a decent personal life, or even working to make the world a better place. Faith, in this version of Christianity, is about keeping the nation powerful by buttressing traditional hierarchies. Trump fulfills the need for a nationalist strongman. Integral to nationalism is an ideal of rugged masculinity that Kristin Kobes Du Mez, a historian who teaches at Calvin University, connects to classic Hollywood movies in her book Jesus and John Wayne. Speaking on NPR, Du Mez noted of the Wayne character that whether he is “on the frontiers of the Wild West or in the Second World War or on the battlefields of Vietnam, he can bring order through violence. And he can defend Christian America, really, and that is what really appeals to many evangelicals, how he becomes this icon—and not just to evangelicals but to secular conservatives as well.” There are tens of millions of Americans who are not Christian at all. But Christianity remains the majority religion, so the two parties are offering starkly different versions of the faith. Biden is the avatar of a Christianity of good works, Trump of a Christianity of violence unleashed against all perceived enemies. Many of Trump is supporters see his victory in 2020 as providential. But if Trump loses this year, it is unlikely that they will think God did not want Trump is reelection. Rather, they are likely to redouble their holy war against liberalism. ",1,1,The Nation

599,Just How Big a Mess the California Recall Is,-4.67,42.67,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/08/california-recall-election-newsom-ballot-mess.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-19,25,"It is hard to know where precisely to start. The sun is shining, the fires are raging, and California is stumbling in a daze through a gubernatorial recall election that might change mor ethan anyone wants to admit. You might already know the general outlines of the story: A small but passionate minority of voters, most of them Republican, are pumped to give Governor Gavin Newsom the boot. They know better than anyone that the success of the scheme depends on keeping the Democratic majority complacent and unalarmed about what yet another “recall election” means. (After all, every governor since 1960 has faced one or more such attempts—what is the big deal?)And, as you may have heard, the plan so far seems to be working. Surveys of Democrats reveal them to be pretty unconcerned and potentially unmotivated to do much about whatever is going on: Alate July Berkeley/Times poll found that Democrats by a whopping 70 percent to 8 percent margin expect Gavin Newsom to defeat the recall. There is dissonance everywhere you look. Newsom, a Democrat, has a 57 percent approval rating! But FiveThirtyEight ispolling average this week finds that among those likely to vote in the recall, keeping Newsom is barely leading, with 48.8 percent wanting to vote to keep and 47.6 percent wanting him removed. The good news is that for only the second time in the state is history, every voter is getting a ballot mailed to their home. The first time that happened was last November. But everything else about this process is confusing, up to and including that ballot. Let me walk you through it. The ballot has two sides and asks voters to answer two questions. On one side voters are asked “Shall GAVIN NEWSOM be recalled (removed) from the office of Governor?” This question—the essential one!—is printed so immediately under the instructions that I found it easy to overlook. On the other side, which is much more recognizable as a conventional ballot, voters can choose one of 46 candidates to replace Newsom, or write in a candidate of their own. Forty-six. Because these are two separate questions that do not pit the current governor directly against his potential replacements, the winner gets decided using a bizarre rule. If Gavin Newsom does not receive a majority of the votes in response to the first question, he loses the governorship. Period. That part is decided. If he loses, the candidate who gets the most votes of those running to replace him will become governor. It is a mathematically maddening system because of the startlingly undemocratic outcomes it can produce. In an op-ed for the New York Times, Erwin Chemerinsky and Aaron S Edlin argue that the recall system is unconstitutional, sketching out a perfectly plausible scenario in which, even if nearly 5 million people vote to keep Newsom, he might be replaced by a candidate who receives a mere 1.8 million votes. The 110-year-old law governing recalls requires an unusually low number of signatures in order for a recall to make it to the ballot: Only 12 percent of the number of voters in the previous election. (Michigan, Minnesota, and Colorado require 25 percent.) The California law was designed to make it unusually for voters to recall elected leaders; it was one of 22 constitutional amendments Governor Hiram Johnson managed to get passed in October 1911. He wanted to empower voters to recall leaders compromised or corrupted by larger forces (like the Southern Pacific Railroad). It was not, suffice to say, designed for a hyper partisan moment. The law has not aroused enough outrage to get it changed because in the only other recall to make it to the ballot—also driven by Republicans against a Democratic governor in 2003—voters delivered Arnold Schwarzenegger more votes than Gray Davis had received in the actual 2002 gubernatorial election. It seemed like Davis had effectively been outvoted by his replacement; the outcome felt small-d democratic even if the process was not. Unless the candidates running against Newsom get more popular very soon, that is unlikely to happen again. Newsom is camp, meanwhile, has not hedged its bets. He successfully kept serious Democratic candidates off the ballot to forestall the possibility of his replacement. His strategy, and that of Democratic party leaders, has been to advise voters who oppose the recall not to answer the second question on the ballot—that is, not to vote for a replacement at all. It is a game of chicken: By making the vote more straightforward for Newsom supporters, they are (selfishly, some argue) significantly increasing the chance of a Republican governor should the recall prevail. Newsom might also not be in this position at all were it not for a. Last November, Newsom—in violation of his own administration is guidelines limiting gatherings to “no more than three households”—celebrated a friend is birthday at the French Laundry in Napa County at which at least 12 people (and more than three households) were present. It angered a lot of people (including Democrats!) and likely galvanized a flailing recall effort. Fans of irony will appreciate that on the very same day, a Schwarzenegger-appointed judge granted the recall effort an extra four months to gather signatures,citing the pandemic. So here we are. No tour of the California recall circus would be complete without at least surveying the oddball crowd of contenders. Though Caitlyn Jenner was the splashiest entrant, she is polling poorly. The front-runner is Larry Elder, a conservative radio host who has defended a minimum wage of zero, claimed the police are more likely to shoot white people than Black ones, defended employers who discriminate against pregnant women, and claimed in writing that “women know less than men about political issues, economics, and current events.” In one of his books, he attacked Republican governor of Massachusetts Jane Swift for continuing to lead her state after giving birth to twins. He was nearly left off the ballot because, per a letter sent by the secretary of state, “incomplete redacted and/or unredacted income tax returns were filed.” He sued, claiming that a 2019 law requiring candidates to release five years of tax returns should not apply to him because the law did not apply to recall elections. He won. Kevin Paffrath is polling as the next most popular candidate: a centrist running as a Democrat, he is a 29-year-old real estate developer and YouTube star. He tried to get listed on the ballot as Kevin “Meet Kevin” Paffrath. He says he is running as a Democratic option since the party did not provide one. “It was mind-blowing to us that they did not put at least somebody in, so that way, worst case, they had a hail mary,”he is said. Lagging behind but still ahead of the others is John Cox, a businessman and millionaire who ran against Newsom in 2018. At Tuesday is gubernatorial debate (which Elder refused to attend)Cox was served on stage while delivering his opening remarks—forfailing to repay consultants he hired during his 2018 campaign. Former congressman Doug Ose dropped out of the race after having a heart attack, and former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, a moderate Republican who wanted his ballot designation to be “retired San Diego Mayor” rather than “Businessman/Educator,” does not seem to be gaining traction in the polls. Neither is Angelyne, the Los Angeles icon famous for her billboards and pink Corvette (party preference: none). The hefty voter guide is filled with memorable candidate statements like “Can you dig it?” from Green Party candidate Dan Kapelovitz, “Search Youtube” from Jeremiah “Jeremy” Marciniak, or “Vote For Me The People is Governor” from Chauncey “Slim” Killens. This feels like clownery and it is. But California is one of many places where clownery masks a crisis, and a lot of Californians still do not realize this recall election is one. Within the state, there are water shortages and fires to deal with. The delta variant is extending the pandemic and those opposed to masking measures are only doubling down. The recall could have massive national implications to o: Should Senator Dianne Feinstein, who is 88 years old, be unable to finish her term, the governor of California would appoint her replacement to what is now a 50–50 Senate.*The partisan motivation gap is real: 78 percent of registered Republicans said they were “very interested” in voting in the recall, while only 47 percent of registered Democrats said the same. And while Newsom could theoretically take comfort in that 57 percent approval rating in the CBS News poll, that figure will not help him unless people vote who do not seem particularly inclined to. Per the Berkeley/Times poll,among those likeliest to vote: 51 percent disapprove of his performance as governor. This recall is costing taxpayers a quarter of a billion dollars. A little over three weeks out in the Golden State before the election is decided, the stakes are high, the situation dire, and what remedies exist to so peculiar a crisis are confusing enough that a lot of voters are tuning the mout.

600,"Glennon Doyle and Biden Campaign Manager Jen O’Malley Dillon on Politics, Motherhood, and Doing Hard Things",-15.33,30.67,https://www.glamour.com/story/glennon-doyle-and-jen-omalley-dillon-interview,https://adfontesmedia.com/glamour-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-15,18,"Within an hour of the networks’ at last declaringJoe Bidenthe winner of the 2020 presidential election, his campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon took to Twitter to celebrate. In contrast with what we have come to expect from those who serve in the current administration, she was not gloating or triumphalist. She was honest, elated, and grateful. “We can do hard things,” shewrote, “and you just did!”The phrase “We can do hard things” will sound familiar to the 1 million women who have kept the boo kon the New York Timesbest-seller list for the past 39 weeks. Glennon Doyle—the activist and public speaker who made a name for herself on her parenting blog and has since founded Together Rising, a nonprofit that is raised over $25 million for people in need—wrote it to chronicle her divorce from her husband and her eventual marriage to the soccer star Abby Wambach. Thebookis about those seismic life events, but it is also about an ethos: The world is rife with heartache and obstacles. There is no hiding from that. We have to do hard things. We can do hard things. This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. No wonder the mantra resonated with O’Malley Dillon—whose college softball coach introduced her to it. She is the first woman to manage a successful Democratic presidential campaign, the first woman to run a campaign that ousted an incumbent president, and of course the first person to spearhead a winning ticket in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic. Her task since she joined the Biden team on March 12, 2020—less than 24 hours after Tom Hanks announced he had tested positive for Covid-19, the NBA suspended its season, and the World Health Organization designated the brand-new disease a global pandemic—has been to do the hardest possible things: Win a virtual election. Fight a cascade of misinformation. Keep hundreds of staffers and the candidate himself safe. Do not flinch. After Biden is sworn in, O’Malley Dillon will serve as his deputy chief of staff—her first White House role ever after two decades in presidential politics. But in the meantime, with the tiniest bit of breathing room now that Donald Trump and the GOP have lost almost 60 court cases in their futile, craven efforts to overturn the will of the voters in the 2020 race, O’Malley Dillon made some time to meet Doyle over Zoom and talk about—what else?—the hard things. —Well, it was a team effort, but we are getting there. Look, I think the re is never an easy path to that, right? I have been doing presidential campaigns for the last 20 years. Before I worked for the president-elect and before he was in the race, I ended up going on the campaign trail for Beto O’Rourke. I had a great life! I had a consulting firm, and I loved the work I did. I had three little kids. People thought I was crazy that I was even thinking about taking that job. But I just had this sense—for both my husband and me, because you obviously ca not do any of this shit if you do not have a partner that believes in it as much as you do and is willing to help. I just felt like, How do you answer to your kids when you look back on your life? How do you go on with your life without doing something to help? So I left all that stability. We moved to Texas. I moved three kids to El Paso, and my husband agreed to do it, and we made our lives work. When it came to Vice President Biden, we had just around that time found out that my dad had cancer. We did not know how serious it was. And I asked myself, “Am I even up for this?” This is scary shit, and everything is at stake. In the end, I just really felt called. I had to do something. And I believed in the vice president. It was kind of as simple as that. I think for our generation—the women before us were such trailblazers and were held to such a different standard. But when I was growing up, my dad said that I could be anything, and I really believed him. I did not even get what women had done and sacrificed and still did not have until I got much older. I feel like it is so important totalk about the fact that I am a mom. I think a lot of people just feel like that is still so incongruent with being a professional woman. I had my girls—twin daughters—a week after the election in 2012. When I was deciding to do that campaign, I had women who I admired telling me, “You ca not do it. If you want to be on a campaign, you cannot have a kid.” Or, “If you are thinking about having a kid, do not tell anyone.”That was the norm. And now we are seeing more and more women who are able to have kids in a campaign environment that is more supportive, so I just feel like talking about it is so important; talking about it is how other people believe it is possible to do it. You know what? No, I do not. I am not sitting here telling you I am an awesome parent right now. It just feels like it is important for me to say to a young woman, “You can figure this out if you want to. You do not have to want to, but do not believe you ca not. And also, do not be afraid totalk about it.”I feel like I am at my TED Talk here, but that is the other thing that is totally a pet peeve for me. When you have a meeting somebody wants to schedule, so many women are like, “Well, I do not want to tell them I ca not make it because I have a school thing or my kid is sick, because that is not professional.”Fuck that. Why should not I say, “Actually, you ca not talk to me from 6:30 until 8:00 unless it is an emergency, even on a presidential campaign during a pandemic, because that is the only time I have with my kids. And that is more important.” Of course there are going to be times when you make exceptions. But I feel like if we do not talk about that stuff, it means it is not okay for that to be the reason. And as a professional woman, that has to be okay. Exactly. Exactly. I mean, the answer is so long and obvious, but also it is still such a problem that we have totalk about it. First I want to caveat that I have been super fortunate. The first time I met with the president-elect, he talked about family coming first. That is the Biden way. As I was trying to navigate this job, I was not sure how long my dad might have to live. We did not really know. I had the kids. How could I do this to them again? I had just moved them to Texas. And he allowed me to work through that. He gave me the space to do that, and also was like, “Look, if something happens and your dad gets sick, that will always be okay and family will come first.” That is not how it usually goes. I think it is important to mention that. But when it comes to this campaign or campaigns in general or other jobs, I would say a couple of things. First, I think that there is an opportunity with women for working together more effectively. Women are not afraid to share information. We are communicators—sometimes overcommunicators. You hear the stories, too, about women trying to reinforce another woman is voice. I still do that. Of course not everyone is perfect here. We are all human. But I do think seeing other women in roles of leadership, seeing them in partnership, the re is a sense that they are thinking about the integration of how one role fits with another. There is a feeling of shared responsibilities. And the n the other thing I is, at least how I have experienced it—the shit, the drama, and the turf wars, who gets credit—first off, it is not important to me, but also it does not get me bothered as much as I think as it might bother others, because I have kids. Every moment that I am not spending with the m, I am not spending with them. You have to be efficient about how you use your time, because you know what you are giving up. I think that that really in turn reinforces the efficiency of the entire workplace and helps clarify what is really important. Well, we could spend a whole lot of time talking about who were the people within the party on the outside of the campaign who were sharing all their thoughts publicly, but that would probably be a different conversation. I will say honestly, it would have been impossible to do it if the vice president did not set the tone. He said that we had to make sure people were safe, and we could not deviate from that. And also, he knew he had to be a role model. It was not good enough to just talk about the science. You had to live it, and I think that is the model for his life too. It was hard, though. We had a lot of people who were well-meaning, who were just scared that this was the wrong call: It was going to hurt us; we were never going to be able to build the campaign we needed. But this was not my first rodeo. I have spent 20 years on presidential campaigns. So I just was confident that I had the support of the candidate and that this was the right thing to do. Now, even though I thought it was the right thing, I thought there was a political price to be paid. It is possible that that was the case. But it felt to me like, this was authentic to who Joe Biden is. And if we lost that, or we lost sight of him being a good man and a great leader and someone who is resilient and has gone through these hard things, the n how could we be true to the campaign? That was grounding as well. But again, it was not easy. I had so many people calling me. My mom was like, “Jen, I saw on CNN that these luminaries in the party are saying you are doing the wrong thing. Are you going to get fired?” I had to be like, “Stop watching CNN, Mom.”Yeah, exactly. And the n her other question is, “What actually do you do?” We have been doing that for 20 years.depending on you. Did you have strategies or rituals to deal with the stress of knowing that, or are you just a generally calm person?My whole professional life has been in a stressful environment. So I do not mind that. And campaigns—it is like sports, I think. You are building for the moment, the end game. I have developed an ability to push myself because I know it is going to be over. I think that is owed to a few things. One, again, I have my kids to anchor me. They could give a shit about all this. Around the time of the decision around the running mate, we were having a serious meeting. It was Dr. Biden, and it was the vice president. And my daughters came in, and Katie was like, “Oh, hey, Joe Biden, what are you doing?” Like,concern. He was happy totalk to the m, but it just kind of puts things in perspective. And the second thing is, you as one person actually ca not take in the totality of what you are responsible for. I had this amazing team. There were so many other people. Ultimately, it was the president-elect who really carried the burden. But for me, I could not focus on the bigness of it. I just had to know that we were headed in the right direction. And I had to ask myself, What did I have in front of me that I had to accomplish? You ca not let yourself get distracted in the abstract. I have never thought of it quite like that, but it is passion and belief in values. Those are the things that drive the work. My dad and my mom are teachers, and they taught us that it was important to be part of your community and to find ways to give back—whether it was through a job or just in your own life. I think that is what I found when I started doing organizing work, which meant figuring out what other people cared about and what mattered to them. It was not just a one-sided thing. That showed me that you could not be successful in politics if you did not understand what another person needed, if you did not understand what a community needed. And you had to be open to listening. Like Joe Biden says all the time, “Great leadership starts with listening.” It is challenging for us to do that right now, because of how polarized we are. But politics breaks down to one-on-one conversations and not being afraid totalk. I get that you are not supposed totalk politics at the holiday dinner. Well, fuck that. It is because we do not do that that we are in this situation now. I also think, as in love, compromise is a good thing. The atmosphere in the world now is like, “Oh, if you compromise, you do not believe in something.” No, it is: I believe in it so much that I am going to work to find a path we can both go down together. That feels to me like the heart of relationships and love and success across the board. Yes, exactly. And frankly, that is what we need. The president-elect was able to connect with people over this sense of unity. In the primary, people would mock him, like, “You think you can work with Republicans?” I am not saying they are not a bunch of fuckers. Mitch McConnell is terrible. But this sense that you could notfor that, you could not wish for this bipartisan ideal? He rejected that. From start to finish, he set out with this idea that unity was possible, that together we are stronger, that we, as a country, need healing, and our politics needs that too. Which is not to say it is easy. It is like a relationship. You ca not do politics alone. If the other person is not willing to do the work, the n that becomes really hard. But I think, more than not, people want to see impact. They want to see us moving in a path forward. They want to do their work, get paid a fair share, have time for the mselves and their family, and see each other as neighbors. And this overhang of this negative, polarized electorate that politics has created is the thing that I think we can break down. I played softball in college, yes. Not anywhere near your wife is level as an athlete. But my sister and her wife are coaches. They are basketball players, and they are phenomenal. Everything. I am not here, doing this work, without sports. As a kid, I did not feel like I fit with everyone else. I did not always feel like I connected. Sports was a place that I felt like I belonged. It was a place where I felt like I could work hard and see improvement, which I think applies so much to campaigns and politics. Sports also taught me about leadership, and when I was a girl and the n in college, it helped me find a voice. I was good at softball. I was not great. But being part of it allowed me to see that I had things to contribute. I saw what was required of a leader, and I saw what might be required of me to lead too. That college coach is the person who introduced me to the idea of “We can do hard things.” I did not even know you had said it before. I was just starting on the campaign. And people were finding out about it, and my college softball coach reached out. We were chatting and she said that one of the moms of her players was talking about how hard everything was with the pandemic, and she was trying to figure out, like, what is a simple thing the team can rally around to get through the day and to just hang in together? And my coach said the mom had said, “We can do hard things.”And I was like, “Oh, that is the exact thing that I am looking for.” I had just started this job. Everyone was remote. I had 200 people that I was working with who had never even met me. We started these weekly virtual meetings, and in the first one I said, “This is hard, but we can do hard things. We are going to get through it.” It became the rallying cry we used every week. And it was hard. It was the hardest thing I have ever done. That little saying really helped us get through it, honestly. Because sometimes, like in sports, you do not have it in yourself, but someone in the group has it, and someone can be there to say, “We are going to get through it. We are going to be okay,” and that is what you need. Right. Exactly. It has to be a we. Exactly. That is amazing. And we have already done hard things. That is the other part of it for me. It is grounded in the fact that we have already done hard things. And that is what holds me together.",1,1,Glamour
601,How to Find a Covid-19 Vaccine Appointment in Your Area,-3.0,47.67,https://www.wired.com/story/how-to-find-a-covid-19-vaccine/,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-06,25,"Omicron is rise has been abrupt and startling. Like Delta, the WHO is director-generalsaid earlier this month, Omicron causes infections severe enough to lead to hospitalization and death, particularly among unvaccinated people. You should take every opportunity to protect yourself and your loved ones from it, and the latest shield available to you is a booster shot. Booster shots, like initial doses of the vaccination, may not completely prevent you from contracting Covid-19., and if you do catch a breakthrough case of Covid-19, you are far less likely to end up in the hospital with a severe infection. More than doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been given worldwide since the pandemic began. The three vaccines used in the US—Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson—have been taken by hundreds of millions of people around the world by now, and they have been found to be safe and effective. In short, they cannot get you sick with Covid-19. Vaccinations have led humanity out of many of history is most devastating diseases, such as polio, smallbox, and measles, and the Covid-19 vaccines—along with social distancing, masks, and smart policy decisions regarding reopening businesses—will be our path forward to living with Covid long-term. States, territories, and our one state-like district (DC) all have wide latitude to set their own Covid-19 policies and procedures. Advice and paths to a Covid-19 vaccine are going to differ based on which part of the US you live in, but we have put together a guide that should give you an accurate overview of how to get the jab. All American adults, regardless of occupation or preexisting health conditions, are able to sign up for a booster appointment. At least five months must have elapsed since your primary Pfizer-BioNTech or your Moderna series, and at least two months after your Johnson & Johnson. Children age 12 and up are eligible are also eligible to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech booster. If, and only if, a child aged 5 and up is moderately or severely immunocompromised, they can also receive a Pfizer-BioNTech booster shot. There is no federal or nationally centralized list onto which you sign up for a booster shot. Each state, territory, and freely associated state has sign-up information available on its own health department website. Odds are that a vaccine appointment is already available near you. About 90 percent of the population in the US has a vaccine site within 5 miles of where they live.. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonSome health department sites are more helpful than others, offering telephone hotlines, statewide sign-up lists, and eligibility checkers that will say whether you can get a vaccine yet if you answer a few questions about your age, gender, profession, and health conditions. Other states merely direct you to a list of vaccination providers to call yourself. Check outVaccines.gov(formerly VaccineFinder), built by Boston Children is Hospital and the CDC, to locate available vaccines near you, and follow its Twitter account for updates. Other places to check include:Vaccination sites let you make an appointment so that you can be sure you are not in for a long wait when you arrive. Now that vaccines are widely available, it is fine to walk in without an appointment. It is not guaranteed they will have space, though, so if you want to make sure you will not have a long wait, make an appointment beforehand. A government-provided vaccination site, such as a community health center or public health department, might be the safest option if you are worried about surprise medical bills or do not want to reveal your citizenship or immigration status. They tend to be free, too. In our research and experience, we found that many say they do not ask for health insurance information or immigration status on their websites. Check with your local facilities to make sure. Most states also run mobile vaccination units, a broad catchall term for pop-up tents, buses, and trailers that are regularly driven to different locations. They typically show up in areas where residents have limited ability to go to a vaccination site, such as low-income neighborhoods, nursing homes, and rural areas. While a state or city is web site for government facilities might only drop new appointment openings on certain days or at certain times, private companies operating in those states are not held to the same schedule. Each company seems to have a different time at which they drop new appointments, so openings are scattered across the day. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonLike the initial vaccines, booster shots are typically covered by your health insurance, but it pays to check with your provider and the office before you commit to an appointment. Surprise bills are a problem in this country. Private practices and retail locations, such as pharmacies, usually require you to bring ana nd health insurance car dand may ask for the name of your primary care physician. Vaccination sites run by government services, such as at community health centers and public health departments, do not typically ask for health insurance info, but you may need proof of state residency. Depending on your state, it may be possible to use school records, samples of mail addressed to you, or a statement from another person as a substitute for a government-issued ID But be sure to check with the specific vaccination site you have decided upon. In the USs, the three booster vaccines available to the public right now via emergency authorization by the FDAare from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson is Janssen. TheCDC recommends the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech booster shots over the Johnson & Johnson. ABritish study published in the Lancet compared the immune responses of six vaccines, including the three vaccines available in the US, and found that the mRNA vaccines—Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech—provided the strongest protection, although all six booster vaccines did increase immune system protection. It is also safe to mix and match your primary and booster vaccine. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and the Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots continue under Emergency Use Authorization. Moderna has requested full approval, and Johnson & Johnson says they plan to request full approval within the year. Vaccination sites typically tell you which brand of booster shot is available and let you choose when scheduling. It takes two weeks after your booster shot for your body to build up its maximum defenses, so remember that until the n your body is still building up its immune system protection. The CDC also offers advice on what to expect at your vaccination appointment. You may get asked if you have been exposed to Covid-19 or shown any symptoms lately, and the facility should ask you to sit and wait for a period of15 minutes after getting your vaccine to ensure you do not have a severe reaction, or 30 minutes if you have had a reaction to a vaccine or injection before. You should also be given a card that tells you the vaccine you got and the date (keep it). After your vaccination, you cans ign up for V-safe, the CDC is Health Checkerwebsite. It will send you phone notifications to fill out an easy survey in the days and weeks after getting your vaccine, asking about any symptoms you have experienced and notifying you when you should get your second dose. A few warnings:Do not get any other vaccination sin the 14 days before or after your Covid-19 vaccination. Do not preemptively take new medications before vaccination, even over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, or stop taking your normal medications before your appointment; talk to a doctor before the appointment and tell them what you are on, though. They may have some advice for you. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonEven if you have already had Covid-19, your antibodies will not last forever. Youshould still get vaccinated when you can. Plus, the protection you receive from a vaccination isth an the protection you get from having had Covid-19. If you had Covid-19a vaccination, the n that is even stronger. I was a healthy guy who hit the gym regularly and had no existing health conditions, but Covid knocked me flat on my ass for five weeks in 2020 before there were any vaccines available. I was only 31. Protection is not immediate after a shot. It takes about two weeks after Moderna is or Pfizer-BioNTech is second shot, and two weeks after the single Johnson & Johnson shot for your body is immune system to reach its maximum strength against the virus. Johnson & Johnson is currently testing a two-dose version of its vaccine, but the findings are not ready yet, and so it is only being given as a one-dose shot at this time. In its clinical trial, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had a lower overall efficacy than the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, but all three are great at preventing severe cases of Covid-19that would lead to hospitalization or death. On April 25, 2021 the USresumed administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after pausing it on April 13, 2021to investigate a possible link between it and a rare type of blood clot that can appear within two weeks of being given the shot. There have been half a dozen or so reported cases of complications out of the 17.8 million doses administered in the US The CDC recommends that you bring your original vaccination card when you show up for your booster, as many vaccination sites will ask for either the card or a photograph of the card. Your vaccine provider will double-check to make sure that five months has elapsed since your primary series, and add all your information—vaccination site, date, time, brand of booster vaccine, and details on the production batch of booster you received—to your previous doses' information in one place.. Many venues, restaurants, bars, and methods of travel require proof of vaccination now. You need to keep your card safe so that you can use it as a pass. Carrying your physical card with you everywhere might be risky. Many cities and states have their own Covid pass ap ps for iPhones and Androids so that you can have your Covid pass information always handy without risking your physical card. There is also the nationwideCommonPassapp. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonDo not laminate your vaccination card. Stick it in a Ziploc if you are worried about keeping it safe, and put it somewhere you know you will be able to find it in three or four weeks when you are due for your second dose. If you lose your card, you can go back to the site and get another one printed off. Take a picture of it so that you have the information as a backup, just in case.some side effects to the vaccines, but allergic reactions are rare. If you have had allergic reactions to vaccines before, tell the person giving the vaccination as soon as you arrive. They will probably ask you to hang around for a little while after the shot, just to make sure. Here is alist of vaccine myths and facts that slaps down the persistent lies floating around social media and conspiracy websites. For example, the vaccines will not alter your DNA or make it unsafe for you to have a baby. They also will not make you magnetic. Even after you are fully vaccinated, keep wearing a mask in public (or get one). The CDC has updated its recommendation for vaccinated people to wear masks indoors and in certain other situations, as the risk level has changed since mask rules were relaxed earlier this year. Masking up keeps everybody—even you—safer. Finally, if there are folks in your life who might need help getting vaccinated, share the knowledge and give them a hand. Every vaccination makes us all a little bit safer.",2,2,WIRED

That slow rate of decline in the short term indicates that immunity may remain for years.""That amount of memory would likely prevent the vast majority of people from getting hospitalized disease, severe disease, for many years,"" Shane Crotty, a virologist at the La Jolla Institute of Immunology who co-led the new study,told The New York Times.

However, it is said to be the most comprehensive and longitudinal study of COVID-19 immunity thus far. While there are multiple vaccines against the coronavirus being studied, with two showing efficacy of preventing the virus of at least 90%, scientists have questioned how long the public would remain immune and if repeat vaccines would be necessary in order to keep the pandemic in check. The research studied 185 COVID-19 cases, including 41 cases in people who had been infected six or more months prior. A small number of recovered participants did not have long-lasting immunity. The findings are consistent wit ha similar study that showed immunity in people for at least three months and another that showed immunity in people even when antibodies were not detectable.

604,Homeless encampment grows on Apple property in Silicon Valley,0.0,44.67,https://www.mercurynews.com/2021/08/10/homeless-encampment-grows-on-apple-property-in-silicon-valley/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mercury-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-10,17,"Apple promised to help quell the Bay Area is homelessness crisis with a series of big-ticket investments, but the tech giant soon may have to get more directly involved — addressing a problem that has spread to the company is front door. A large homeless encampment is growing on the site Apple earmarked for its North San Jose campus, two years after Apple made waves with a$2.5 billion pledge to combat the Bay Area is affordable housing and homelessness crisis. What started as a few RVs parked on the side of Component Drive has grown over the past year into a sprawling camp of dozens of people, a maze of broken-down vehicles and a massive amount of trash scattered across the vacant, Apple-owned property. People with nowhere else to go live there in tents, RVs and wooden structures they built the mselves. At least two children call the camp home. Apple is trying to figure out what to do, but it is a tough situation. Clearing the camp likely will be difficult both logistically — it is more challenging to remove structures and vehicles that do not run than tents — and ethically — there are few places for the displaced residents to go.“There are approximately 30-35 unhoused people living in the area with an estimated 200 to ns of hazardous trash and debris on the private property, making this a complicated and challenging situation,” Daniel Lazo, spokesman for the city of San Jose is department of Parks, Recreation and Neighborhood Services, wrote in an email. “There are also an estimated 65-75 operable and inoperable vehicles at the site.”Residents of the camp say there may be as many as 75 people living there. Apple is “in talks with the city on a solution,” company spokeswoman Chloe Sanchez Sweet wrote in an email, without providing additional details. The number of people living without homes in the region has grown dramatically in recent years — it is estimated there are about 30,000 homeless people in the five-county Bay Area. The crisis has become even more noticeable during the COVID-19 pandemic, as cities cut back on clearing encampments, allowing unhoused people to shelter in place and camps to grow and become more entrenched. As the problem intensifies, local tech companies — some of the region is main generators of jobs and wealth — have felt mounting pressure to intervene. GoogleandFacebookeach pledged $1 billion to fight the housing shortage and homelessness in 2019, andApplefollowed by committing $2.5 billion. The vacant land off Component Drive figured into Apple is $2.5 billion commitment. Apple originally bought the land in apus h to acquire real estate in North San Josefor a new tech campus, but so far, the company has not done much to develop it. In 2019, the tech company promised to make $300 million of land it owns in San Jose available for new affordable housing — including a portion of the Component Drive property. But it is unclear when anything might be built. For Tigs Smith, who has been living on Apple is land for the past year, the tech company is promises mean little when they do nothing to help her or her neighbors. Smith, a 40-year-old construction worker, lives in a tiny, one-room house she built herself on the Component Drive property — where she landed after her ex-boyfriend kicked her out of the home they shared. She recently moved her 16-year-old daughter and nine-year-old son into the tiny home with her. Now, Smith hopes Apple will do something to help.“All I need is a place to put me and my kids at night,” she said. “All I need is that one little push in the right direction.”Apple already has committed $50 million over five years to help San Jose-based Destination: Home reduce and prevent homelessness. So far the organization has used some of that money — plus $50 million from Cisco — to finance nearly 2,000 new units of housing for people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. That money also has funded a new online portal, set to launch next spring, that will help unhoused people track the status of their requests for housing help. And it helped the county expand its homelessness prevention system to serve 1,500 households per year, according to Destination: Home. But those efforts will not necessarily help Smith and her neighbors.

Meanwhile, San Jose is gearing up to clear a much larger camp at West Hedding and Spring streets, near the San Jose airport. That clean-up, which comes at the behest of the Federal Aviation Administration, could displace more than 200 people — some of whom might move to the Apple camp or other nearby camps. In an attempt to shelter some of those people, city officials have proposed creating a new modular interim housing site near the San Jose Police Department headquarters on West Mission Street. The City Council is set to consider the proposal next month. Relocating people living in the Apple camp “will understandably create stress for many residents,” Lazo wrote. “It is important to City staff that the process be handled with compassion and respect for the people displaced.”",2,2,Mercury News
605,Sarah Palin is Facebook grift,-14.33,41.33,https://popular.info/p/sarah-palins-facebook-grift,https://adfontesmedia.com/popular-information-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,18,"Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican nominee for Vice President, is not the cultural icon she was a decade ago. In March, she appeared on ""The Masked Singer,"" where she sang ""Baby Got Back""dressed in a pink bear costume. So how is Palin making ends meet?One source of income, it appears, is her Facebook page, which has 4.5 million followers. An investigation by Popular Information reveals that, since May 4, Palin is Facebook page has linked to an obscure right-wing aggregation site called Analyzing America 280 times. The page is owned by Joshua Riddle and David Rufful. The pair claim to have founded Analyzing America ten years ago, but only purchased the domain in 2018. The site has been criticized for ""extreme right-wing bias, promotion of conspiracies and propaganda."" Last year, the site implied that Hillary Clinton might have murdered Jeffrey Epstein. Each time Palin is Facebook page shared a link to Analyzing America, it appends something called a UTM code. A UTM code is a way for publishers to know precisely how much traffic comes from a particular source. It looks like this:Analyzing America and other web sites keep track of their visitors through special software — most commonly Google Analytics. Normally, if Palin is Facebook page shared a link from Analyzing America, it would show up on Analyzing America is Google Analytics dashboard as referral traffic from Facebook. It would be difficult to segregate out the traffic referred from Palin is Facebook page from any other Facebook page. By appending the UTM code, Palin is Facebook page solves this problem. Now Analyzing America can know exactly how much traffic Palin sent to their site. But Palin has no access to the data. So absent a relationship between Palin and Analyzing America, it would be pointless for Palin to append the UTM code. But the UTM code allows Analyzing America to pay Palin for sending traffic to its website. If this sounds familiar, that is because it is the same methodThe Daily Wire, the web site founded by right-wing pundit Ben Shapiro, used to boost its traffic. The Daily Wire was paying Facebook pages controlled by Mad World News, a noxious site that has built a huge audience on racist and violent content, to link to The Daily Wire. That scheme ended earlier this month after it was exposed by Popular Informationbecause it violated Facebook is rules. Under Facebook is policy, Facebook pages cannot ""accept anything of value to post content that you did not create."" This rule, however, appears to be routinely violated by right-wing web sites to artificially inflate the popularity of unreliable, low-quality content.""After an initial investigation, we found the re is enough evidence to merit a deeper review. In the meantime, we are taking temporary enforcement action and demoting the Page posting this content,"" a Facebook spokesperson told Popular Information. The Washington Times has significantly boosted its presence on Facebook through an undisclosed relationship with a large Facebook page called ForAmerica, which has over 7.85 million followers. Since October 8, 2019, ForAmerica has posted 1,360 links to The Washington Times. Over a recent one month period, June 9 to July 9, links to The Washington Times constituted 67% of all links posted by the ForAmerica page. This data comes from research conducted by the global civil organization Avaaz and provided exclusively to Popular Information. The Washington Times has only 692,000 followers on its Facebook page. But, since October, its relationship with ForAmerica has allowed it to dramatically increase its distribution on Facebook. Engagement with Washington Times content on the ForAmerica Facebook page frequently exceeds the engagement with Washington Times content everywhere else on Facebook combined. The evidence strongly suggests that The Washington Times is paying ForAmerica to post its content. Each link shared by the Washington Times includes a UTM code. ForAmerica is owned by a non-profit organization calledAmerica Inc. It is a sister organization to the Media Research Center, a right-wing organization dedicated to exposing the ""liberal bias"" in the news media. (ForAmerica and Media Research Center share the same address.)It is unclear what ForAmerica does other than operate a large Facebook page that links to The Washington Times. On its website, which is primarily a feed of its Facebook page, the organization says its ""mission is to advance freedom, prosperity and virtue, one click at a time.""Facebook told Popular Information that it has not yet established there is a paid relationship between ForAmerica and The Washington Times. Paying for traffic is not the only thing that Analyzing America has in common with The Daily Wire. Analyzing America also operates a clandestine network of Facebook pages to promote its content. While these pages list a variety of owners, they all post the same content from Analyzing America at the same time. The pages in the network include Trump & The Great America (2.1 million followers), Chicks on the Right (1.3 million followers), Young Cons (998,000 followers), The Comical Conservative (2.2 million followers), Rush Limbaugh and the EIB Network (728,000 followers), and Red Symposium (162,000 followers). The pages list a variety of owners, including Young Conservatives LLC and Gregory Lawrence Burright. Three of the pages list no owner at all. This appears to be a deliberate attempt to conceal the centralized control of all six pages. Facebooksaysthat ""[w]hen we find domestic, non-government campaigns that include groups of accounts and Pages seeking to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing while relying on fake accounts, we remove both inauthentic and authentic accounts, Pages and Groups directly involved in this activity."" That appears to be the case here. But Facebook has previously taken a very narrow interpretation of this policy. Last October, Popular Information exposed more than a dozen large Facebook pages that were exclusive posting content from The Daily Wire in a coordinated fashion. Facebook said it did not constitute coordinated inauthentic behavior because there were ""real people"" operating each page. Several months later, the pages disclosed they were all owned and operated by The Daily Wire. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the network of Facebook pages promoting Analyzing America. Monday isPopular Informationsaid that Congressman Glenn Grothman was from Minnesota.

606,San Diego home price gains stall,0.0,44.67,https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/real-estate/story/2020-11-18/san-diego-home-price-gains-stall,https://adfontesmedia.com/san-diego-union-tribune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,20,"San Diego County home prices in October did not increase from the previous month for the first time since May The median home price for all homes — single-family, condos, townhouses — was $650,000, unchanged from last month, said CoreLogic data provided by DQNews on Wednesday. The price is still up a substantial 13 percent in a year, but marked a rare slowdown in price appreciation that has defied expectations throughout the pandemic. Many of the circumstances that experts say have driven up prices across the nation are still present: Record low mortgage rates, lack of home inventory and desire to own a home as many people are stuck working outside offices. Mark Goldman, a real estate analyst with C2 Financial Corp., said one month is worth of data is probably nothing to write home about yet. He said the fundamentals of the housing market have not changed and are unlikely to stop the upward pressure on prices.“Most indicators of housing demand continue to remain strong,” he said, “so this one data point, which is something to be aware of and something to watch, is not necessarily a harbinger of the market turning.”Goldman said there are things that could push the home price up in the coming months, such as optimism about the future because of a COVID-19 vaccine or (depending on your political persuasion) a new president. However, he said fear from potential buyers that the economy may take a turn for the worse, or concern the housing market is at its high point, could lower prices. One factor that did not change in October was the lack of homes for sale in San Diego County — which experts point to as the primary reason for rising prices. There were 5,058 homes listed for sale in San Diego County from Sept. 28 to October 25, said theRedfin data center. That is down from 7,651 around the same time last year and 9,312 in 2018. Real estate agent Gary Kent said news of a vaccine, and its potential widespread distribution could mean sellers who are on the fence could put homes on the market and increase inventory. He said he has spoken with potential clients over the past few months who were waiting because of the virus. Kent said increased supply could mean there is less upward pressure on prices, but he — similar to many housing experts — was hesitant to say that prices could actually decrease. But, it might make the process of buying a little easier.“I do not at all see some massive price drop,” he said, “but people might say, ‘I do not have to make an offer the first day over list price and maybe I could negotiate a bit.’”Despite the overall median price stalling, the main part of the San Diego market hit a new high. The resale single-family home median hit $730,000 in October, its highest ever and up from $715,000 in September and August. The resale condo price fell $10,000 from its peak in September to $475,000. The newly built home median was $726,000, down from the record $812,500 in October 2018 when there was an increase in luxury, single-family homes for sale. There were 4,292 home sales in October, roughly the same level it has been for four months. It is a stark contrast to April when there 2,327 sales, its lowest in years, and was the result of homes being pulled off the market as the pandemic began. Interest rates have never been lower, but it does not necessarily mean homes are cheaper. In October, the interest rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 2.83 percent, saidFreddie Mac, down from 3.69 percent the year before. That means the monthly cost of a median-priced home now would be around $2,430 a month, assuming 20 percent down on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan and including property taxes and home insurance. That is up slightly from roughly $2,390 a month for a median home at last year is prices and interest rates. However, that scenario would require a roughly $130,000 down payment, compared to $114,600 a year earlier. Across the six-county Southern California region, the median home price was down 0.8 percent. Orange County had the biggest monthly increase, 1.3 percent, to a median of $795,000. It was followed by San Bernardino County up 1 percent for a median of $400,000, and Los Angeles County up 0.7 percent to a median of $715,000. Ventura County was down 1.5 percent for a median of $655,000, and Riverside County was down 0.6 percent for a median of $445,500.",2,2,San Diego Union-Tribune
607,New search launched for meth sobering center site – The San Francisco Examiner,-1.33,47.67,https://www.sfexaminer.com/news-columnists/new-search-launched-for-meth-sobering-center-site/,https://adfontesmedia.com/sf-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-24,19,"NualaIn February 2020, San Francisco was gearing up to open the nation isfirst sobering center specifically for people who use methamphetamine. The center — which would take people who are high on the drug off the streets, providing them safety, medical care, and resources — was the primary recommendation of theMethamphetamine TaskForce, created in 2019. With the blessing of the mayor, plans were developed speedily to erect a tent in a parking lot of 180 Jones St. in the Tenderloin, with the goal of opening in spring of 2020. Then, the pandemic hit. Health organizations scrambled, redirecting resources to battling the virus. The opening of the meth sobering center, which was designed to include a large congregate room, was postponed, and 180 Jones St. became a pop-up safe sleeping site. Now, nearly a year after plans for the sobering center were put on hold, the project has been relaunched. But instead of a tent in a parking lot, The City is looking for a brick and mortar location. And the facility will not just house the meth sobering center, but also a future safe consumption site — if and when California legalizes a pilot program to open one. Sobering centers are not a new idea. Since 2003, San Francisco has run an alcohol sobering center, located on Mission Street in SoMa. It takes in more than 5,000 people each year, many of whom are brought in via paramedics. In addition to providing medical support and care, the center makes direct referrals to Joe Healy, an alcohol de to x program. The alcohol sobering center is design is very intentional. The room can be seen in its entirety through windows in the staff office. Its 12 beds are low to the ground, with mats next to the m, so that if someone falls out of one, they will not sustain serious injuries. Showers and bathrooms are ADA accessible. Nurses are on hand to monitor visitors’ vital signs. All told, most people who are admitted stay six to 12 hours, before being transferred to a de to x center or discharged back to the streets.“When those folks were developing their model [for the methamphetamine sobering center] they asked our in-house experts about what they need to know,” said Alice Moughamian, the alcohol sobering center is director, noting that many people involved stopped through for tours. “Thinking about what substance people are intoxicated on really impacts how you want to physically lay out your sobering center to make sure people are safe and succeed.”On February 11, HealthRIGHT 360 CEO Vitka Eisen spoke at a community meeting in the Tenderloin with San Francisco Director of Public Health Dr. Grant Colfax, left, and Dr. Anton Nigusse Bland, director of Mental Health Reform at San Francisco Department of Public Health, center. (Courtesy HealthRIGHT 360)People who are intoxicated by alcohol have very different needs from people who are high on methamphetamine. In 2019, Dr. Anton Nigusse Bland, San Francisco is director of Mental Health Reform, toured drug sobering centers in Houston, Texas, Portland, Ore. and Los Angeles for inspiration on design.“Methamphetamine is what we call a stimulant,” Nigusse Bland explains. “It is very similar to cocaine, and it tends to cause people to have really erratic behavior. They often feel overheated. And they can be really, really confused and disoriented. On the street, you may see a person that is pacing, engaging in repetitive motions, talking to someone that is not really the re, maybe yelling at someone because they are having a surge of emotions. And they are having delusions that something is happening to them or that they might be in danger.”With that in mind, the methamphetamine sobering center being designed in San Francisco will have room for people to pace, and be active. But once they come down, they may feel exhausted, requiring a bed to sleep in for up to a day. Kathleen Silk is the managing director of behavioral health at HealthRIGHT 360, which will operate the sobering center once it opens. She helped design the first model for the tent at 180 Jones St.“The plan was a really simple one in terms of having a space for people to be quiet and sleeping, as well as active and having some tactile stimulation and an outdoor area,” she said. Storage would be built for people is belongings, and bathrooms with showers would be installed. But plans were abandoned when the pandemic hit.“Because of the affordable housing development slated for 180 Jones St., that location for the drug sobering center was always going to be temporary,” explained Jenna Lane, a spokesperson for the Department of Public Health. “When the pandemic forced us to postpone opening a new congregate setting and to redesign it with COVID-19 distancing in mind, that shortened the amount of time we could use the space at 180 Jones St. enough that it became wiser to look for alternatives. That search continues, and SFDPH looks forward to opening a site that can serve the community for the long term.”Now, Silk is working with The City to identify a brick and mortar space, and a new design, somewhere in SoMa or the Tenderloin.“We do still want the model of a larger indoor space where we can have eyes on everybody, and a combination of different levels of activity,” Silk said. At the same time, there are new concerns about air flow and safety during the pandemic. “With COVID, the re is a to n of other implications, like what type of AC or HVAC system we have got going, or the capacity of people,” Silk said. “We had been playing with around 12 to 15 people for beds, or upwards of 20. We are not trying to overextend ourselves. We run some programs that are like 60 or 70 people. That is not what this is going to be.”The pandemic provided the time to pursue a more permanent location, but it also gave HealthRIGHT 360 the opportunity to launch its Street Crisis Response Team, which will be a key component in bringing people to the sobering center. The team, which began operating in November, consists of a paramedic, a peer support counselor and mental health therapists. Currently, it only takes calls in the Tenderloin, but the pilot program will eventually be expanded citywide. According to Silk, “They cannot wait for this to open.”Intake to the sobering center is being carefully strategized. In addition to the Street Crisis Response Team, HealthRIGHT 360 plans to launch a dedicated outreach team specifically to find people having a hard time with their methamphetamine experience, and a van to transport them to the center. Referrals will also be accepted from EMS-6, The City is paramedic team dedicated to working with people experiencing homelessness.“Coerced involvement in this project is not what we are going for whatsoever,” Silk said. “This has to be totally voluntary. When people are forced or given an ultimatum by law enforcement, their presence in the milieu is really disruptive and not what we are going for here. We did not want a situation where it is like ‘this or jail.’”The City received a $400,000 prize from the federal government as one of the initial winners of a multi-phase competitionThe biennial census is federally mandated and goes a long way in funding support services in The CityDoty was acquitted last month of assaulting a former San Francisco fire commissionerAnd, once word gets out, Silk expects people to walk in on their own.“At its best, this is a program where if I use drugs, I can go there myself,” she said. “I know I can knock on the door, I am going to be invited in, and I am going to get the resources I need, and I am not going to be told I have to stay there forever. And if I do want to sleep it off and stay there a little bit, it is a welcoming community.”Kathleen Silk of HealthRIGHT 360 appeared before the San Francisco Health Commission on March 3, 2020, days before plans for the methamphetamine sobering center were paused due to COVID. (Courtesy HealthRIGHT 360)^The creation of a space for people to safely ride out their methamphetamine high is one thing, but creating a route to care is an entirely different beast. People who use op io ids — like heroin or fentanyl — have a variety of medications they can choose from to help withdrawal symptoms and reduce cravings. But despite its rapid rise in San Francisco, there are no government-approved medications to treat methamphetamine use, making treating people who are addicted to the drug tricky. What is available are treatment centers. In San Francisco, many of them are run by HealthRIGHT 360. By operating the Street Crisis Intervention Team, the methamphetamine sobering center, and both inpatient and outpatient addiction services, HealthRIGHT 360 will soon be able to move people through its systems of care fairly seamlessly.“I think one of our huge strengths for this is that not only do we have those robust programs in the area, but we also know 24-hour treatment,” Silk said. “It is our bread and butter, and we do it well.”This means that people who come into the methamphetamine sobering center will not just receive a respite from the streets, but opportunities to receive care — from doctors who specialize in addiction medicine, to residential treatment centers, or even just an appointment with a dentist. For Silk, it is also important that staff are trained at every level, from janitors to medical professionals. It is her goal to make sure that every interaction with people who come in off the streets is as positive as possible. “Wherever people are willing to engage with us, we will do it,” she said. That commitment to meeting people where they are at, and addressing their needs in the moment, is a vital key to recovery. Moughamian, from the alcohol sobering center, says they have people who come in 150 to 200 times a year. “The top 1% of our utilizers are actually 30% of our visits,” she said. Those high-utilizing visitors receive a high level of case management, and are also able to walk in without referrals. In other words, recovering from addiction requires patience. “It is important that we acknowledge that recovery is not a linear kind of path,” Nigusse Bland said. “It takes some time. We expect people to want to return here when they are under the influence, because the other consequences are far worse. We want them to feel this is a safe place to be.”Opening the first methamphetamine-specific sobering center in the nation is ground breaking in itself, but San Francisco is already looking ahead. In December, state Senator Scott Wiener reintroduced legislation to establish a safe consumption site. While it still has to clear the California legislature and Governor Gavin Newsom is desk, plans are already developing to combine a future site with the methamphetamine sobering center. In 2020, 699 people died of drug overdoses citywide. Silk said a safe consumption site is desperately needed, particularly in the wake of 699 overdose deaths that occurred across the city in 2020. “When people use in secret, they die, and when they use alone, they die,” she said. But for her, the safe consumption site and the methamphetamine sobering center are just two more resources for people who use drugs to receive the support they need. “I think one of the biggest barriers for people getting into substance use treatment is shame, and stigma,” she said. “If we are showing compassionate, non-judgmental service, we will see a higher rate of people saying, ‘you know, if HealthRIGHT can do this with me, or if Glide can allow me to do this, I can trust them a little bit further and potentially see what recovery could be like.’”There is no clear time line on when either facility will open, but the hunt is active. And as for a name? The verdict is out. When the sobering center was slated to open at 180 Jones, HealthRIGHT 360 was toying with the name “Project 180.” Now, the organization plans to open up name ideas for the site to the community it will serve. That might come sooner than anticipated.“I have a feeling that a week from now, if we are able to find the right space, it will all be happening very quickly,” Silk said.",2,2,SF Examiner

609,Daily coronavirus updates: Connecticut formally expands next phase of COVID-19 vaccinations; state reports lowest single-day positivity rate in months,0.0,48.33,https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-news-coronavirus-daily-updates-0114-20210114-5ko2nbzkbrezvbipmpq2vqbwmi-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/hartford-courant-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-14,20,"Connecticut is next phase of vaccinations has officially expanded to include all residents who are 65 years and older, as well as residents with at least one high-risk health condition, but a vaccine shortage means it could be months before this large group is inoculated. Governor Ned Lamont on Thursday formally approved the Phase 1B expansion, which had been recommended by a state subcommittee earlier in the week.“It will probably take a few weeks before all the people in Phase 1A get their second dose,” Lamont said, “but that does not mean we are not beginning to do people in 1B, really focused right now on folks 75 and above.”With the expansion, the state has added about 715,000 people to the phase, for a total of more than 1.3 million, according to state estimates. (Previous state estimates placed the number at more than 1.5 million.)The newly expanded phase, which began this week with residents 75 and older eligible to sign up for vaccination, now includes:All residents aged 65 and older. Residents aged 16 to 64 who have at least one high-risk co-morbid condition (including cancer and Down syndrome). Frontline essential workers (including teachers and grocery store workers). Residents of congregate settings (including group homes and prisons). Because of the size of the phase, the state is rolling out eligibility in waves — meaning not everyone in Phase 1B will be vaccinated at once.“This allocation strategy is limited by the number of doses we have available,” said Dr. Deidre Gifford, acting commissioner of public health. “We are hoping for more vaccine as new [vaccines] get approved and as the existing manufacturers are able to ramp up production, but we can only give out as many vaccines as we have doses.”The state is 277,000 residents who are aged 75 and older are first in line, and the state has already opened up vaccination appointments to that group. However, Connecticut officials have not said which group might become eligible next, or given any time line for the full rollout of Phase 1B.“Our message to the public today is please be patient,” Gifford said. “It will take time for us to get to the other members of Phase 1B.”Lamont noted that “demand is far outstripping supply.” The state has received 46,000 vaccine doses a week from the federal government, though Lamont said Thursday they were expecting an extra 50,000 next week as a one-time reward for successful vaccine administration. Phase 1B marks the beginning of the widespread vaccination in Connecticut. Previously, only a narrow subset of the population — health care workers, medical first responders and nursing home residents — were eligible for inoculation. Gifford said the full vaccination process will take months but that state hopes to have most residents vaccinated by the fall. Also on Thursday, the state opened its centralized vaccination registration web site to residents who are 75 and older. Eligible residents can now make a vaccination appointment through the website, which can be found atportal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/COVID-19–Vaccination-75-and-older. They can also call (877) 918-2224 to set an appointment. Appointments are currently available only to residents who are 75 and older. Appointments are required at vaccination sites across the state.“Do not just show up. That does not work,” Lamont said. “You need to get registered, and you need to make an appointment.”Connecticut has so far administered more than 170,000 vaccine doses, with about 5% of the state is population having received at least one shot and about 16,000 residents having received both of their required doses. The state ranks fifth nationally in the share of its population to receive at least one dose. State reports lower-than-usual positivity rateLamont on Thursday reported 968 new COVID-19 cases out of 22,171 tests, for a positivity rate of 4.4% — lowest in a single day since late November. That lower-than-usual figure came just days after Connecticut reported its highest single-day positivity rate since May The state is seven-day average currently stands at 7%, down slightly from recent days but still near its peak level.“The numbers are bouncing around a little bit,” Lamont said. “What we know is that outside is safer than inside and the re is nothing more important than wearing a mask.”Connecticut currently has 1,118 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, down 30 from Wednesday. Hospitalizations have remained mostly flat for about a month now, since peaking in mid-December. Additionally, Lamont reported 17 new coronavirus-linked deaths Thursday, following 87 on Wednesday. The state has now recorded 6,553 COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic, including 264 over the past week. The USs has now seen more than 23 million COVID-19 cases and 386,996 deaths, according to the Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University. High-capacity vaccine sites coming to Rentschler Field, other sitesIn addition to an existing vaccine site at the Connecticut Convention Center, state officials announced Thursday that the state will organize two additional high-capacity sites: one at Rentschler Field and one in Shelton. Josh Geballe, the state is chief operating officer, said the sites are taking only a small number of patients currently but that they help ensure the state is preparedness for future phases of vaccine rollout.“We are limited for the foreseeable doses by the number of doses that we get in,” Geballe said. “What we are doing is setting up these mass sites in anticipation [of more doses becoming available].”Emily Brindley can be reached atebrindley@courant.com.",2,2,Hartford Courant
610,‘Last responders’ brace for COVID deaths,-3.67,45.33,https://montanafreepress.org/2020/12/24/last-responders-brace-for-covid-deaths/,https://adfontesmedia.com/montana-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-12,15,"They watched as New York hospitals and funeral homes marshaled refrigerated trucks to store bodies. More than 600 bodies of people who died in the spring COVID surge remain in freezer trucks on the Brooklyn waterfront because officials ca not find next of kin, or relatives are also sick or unable to pay for burial. People like Dr. Robert Kurtzman, Montana is chief medical examiner, took heed. Last spring, he worked with funeral directors and others to study the state is morgue capacity. After looking at COVID projections, the state arranged with the Montana National Guard to have 13 refrigerated semi trucks ready to dispatch anywhere in the state.“We are already in a precarious position, and the projections present a scary proposition,” he said. “We need to be ready for worst-case scenarios.”Chad Towner, CEO of St. Joseph Health System, which has two hospitals in northern Indiana, ordered two refrigerated semitrailers in April. For a time, things were relatively quiet. But the pandemic has hit.“I told a friend who was a COVID doubter that if my wife needed a bed to day, I could not arrange one. That is the dire situation we face here,” Towner said. “All our competitors in the area are in the same boat, and we are working together instead of competing.”“Normally a funeral is a two- or three-day process with hundreds of people. Now there is no time to tell stories about the person, not a lot of singing and praying. I have been to three recent COVID funerals, and everything was at the burial site, with maybe 30 people sitting in their cars and not getting out.”Although the freezer trucks have not yet been needed, he worries that the sharp increase in cases, and those anticipated from Thanksgiving travel and gatherings, will make last-resort measures necessary.“We recently had four deaths in one afternoon,” said Towner. “A priest approached me to say he’d been asked to provide last rites to three patients in one hour.”Moving bodies from the hospital morgue is a slower process than usual, he said. “Morticians and funeral homes are overflowing as well. Families that are sick or quarantined at the time of the loved one is death often ca not work with us on a transfer, meaning bodies are here longer. The entire system is stressed to the tipping point,” said Towner. Private enterprise has created a solution for smaller communities. In Bozeman, Montana, a specialty truck company is retrofitting trailers that can be pulled by an SUV or a pickup. Acela Truck Co. has already sold hundreds of the pull-behind refrigerated units created in response to the COVID pandemic. They range from 9 to 53 feet and have racks that each hold four body trays. “We are very busy and have orders in all of the lower 48 states,” said CEO David Ronsen. Acela has partnered with Mopec, a Wisconsin autopsy supply company, to help sell and deliver the new product. Billings Clinic in Montana also anticipated a flood of deaths last spring by reserving a semitrailer for delivery, if needed. The clinic, which has just two morgue spaces, has dealt with 80 COVID deaths, including seven on the weekend after Thanksgiving. Chief Nursing Officer Laurie Smith said the hospital is at capacity, despite adding beds by converting office space and building an addition. The hospital, which currently has 335 beds, so far has handled the additional deaths through what she calls a “sad partnership” with funeral homes, which have been quickly picking up bodies the hospital cannot store. The hospital does its best to allow relatives to say goodbye, but that often involves family members standing at an interior window outside the patient is room, using a computer tablet to communicate their last words. That is just one way in which the rituals of grieving have changed during COVID Typical congregational hymns are pretty much gone, as are choirs.“We are using mostly recordings, sometimes a soloist,” said Spitzer. Funeral home directors who pride the mselves on spending time comforting grieving families say they are so busy that some days they have to rush out from one funeral to begin the next one.“Families are being robbed of the whole funeral rite experience and losing the support of having friends and family around the m,” said Shauna Kjos-Miotke of Fiksdal Funeral Home in Webster, South Dakota. Native communities have not only been among the hardest hit with COVID illnesses and deaths, but their grieving rituals have been among the most seriously disrupted.“Normally a funeral is a two- or three-day process with hundreds of people,” said Josiah Hugs, a Crow tribal member who is the outreach coordinator for Billings Urban Indian Health and Wellness Center. “Now there is no time to tell stories about the person, not a lot of singing and praying. I have been to three recent COVID funerals, and everything was at the burial site, with maybe 30 people sitting in their cars and not getting out.”COVID has even affected body disposal. Asurveyby the National Funeral Directors Association found that more than half of their members reported increased cremation rates due to COVID The NFDA also found that half its members have clients who have postponed services to hold a memorial later. In the largely impoverished Hidalgo County, a Texas border area, county officials began using COVID funds to help cover the burial costs for struggling families. Then they begin hearing of the emotional costs, including the anguish of video conferenced funerals, such as for a family that had lost a husband, a mother and an aunt in one month. They wondered if there would be interest in an alternative way to honor the dead.“We sent out a social media post asking if anyone wanted to post a photograph of a relative who died of COVID if we created a county memorial page,” said county spokesperson Carlos Sanchez, who himself barely survived a bout with COVID in July. “Within minutes, we got more than 20 emails. Several sent photos of multiple relatives. They want them to be remembered.”(Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit news service covering health issues.

At one point, activist and2017honoree Ashlee Marie Preston, who helped organize the protest, thanked those who showed up to lend their voices and support:“I thank all of you for being here in support of the employees at Netflix of trans and non-binary experience and their allies and accomplices. I think the message that many people expect for us to deliver today is one around ‘why it is important to cancel Dave Chappelle.’ And so I want to make it very clear, this is not an instance of cancel culture because I have invited Dave Chappelle to have transformative dialogue with us on multiple occasions and he has made it clear that it is not of interest to him. So just to be clear, this is not cancel culture but an avoidance of accountability when we have invited you to be a part of the repair that it takes to not only hear a culture, but to move all of us forward.”She later added, “We are up against the emergence of hate economy. And there is this manipulation of algorithmic science that distorts the way that we perceive ourselves and others. And I think that companies like Netflix, Facebook, and Instagram, they play into it, and they monetize on it. And so I think that this is important to show up today.”A counter-protester who was present as a “supporter of comedy” explained: “We are protesting this walkout. They have the right to do it, but we have the right to stand up for Dave Chappelle and his freedom of expression. This boils down to equality, and if people want equality they [have] to be put on the same level as anybody else. Comedians are equal opportunity destroyers. You ca not pick and choose who you are going to make fun of.”In addition to the walkout, those same employees and allies provided the streamer with a firm list of demands via a press release obtained byThe Verge, which centered around actionable steps towards “content investment, employee relations and safety, and harm reduction.”Significantly, a demand to pull the special off of the streaming giant was not included on that list.“We are employees, but we are members, too. We believe that this Company can and must do better in our quest to entertain the world, and that the way forward must include more diverse voices in order to avoid causing more harm. The Trans* ERG [Employee Resource Group] looks forward to working with the Company to make this a better, more entertaining place for us all,” the document concluded. Moreover, at the same time the protest was taking place, Chappelle himself was performing the last leg of his weeklong UK tour at London is Eventim Apollo the ater. While no cellphones, cameras or recording devices were allowed, many in attendance confirmed to Varietythat the comedian mentioned he would plan a 10-city US tour should be removed from Netflix, though as previously stated, there are no plans to do so at this time. Ahead of the protest, Netflix shared a statement in support of its employees and allies, saying: “We value our trans colleagues and allies, and understand the deep hurt that is been caused.

Brad Horrigan / Hartford CourantIn this April file photo, a man is swabbed by a Hartford HealthCare medical professional for a COVID-19 test. Earlier this month, Christopher J Duff decided to get tested for COVID-19. He was not feeling great and his two-year-old son was running a fever.“My symptoms were being extremely tired, some body aches and feeling very warm,” said Duff, who is 39 and serves on the Rocky Hill town council. “I have been working from home, social distancing and wearing a mask out in public, so I did not think I was likely to have COVID, but I wanted to rule it out and make sure, especially because we have a toddler and an infant.”The testing process, conducted at a CVS Minute Clinic in Rocky Hill, took a total of 30 minutes. Duff is wait for the results took eight days. Across the state and the nation, wait times for some COVID-19 test results are stretching to a week or longer. Timely results are key to containing the spread of the virus, public health officials say. The longer a person is unaware of a positive test, the more time they have to infect others and lengthy delays can hamper contact tracing and other efforts to control outbreaks.“Five days is an eternity in COVID time,” Governor Ned Lamont said Tuesday. “You do not know what is happened…in the five days it is taking you to get that response.”In addition to causing stress and disruption for individuals, experts fear the rising backlog of test kits could jeopardize efforts to control the virus and reopen society.“We are concerned that the national demand for testing is causing longer wait times for test results,” said Dr. Deidre Gifford, acting commissioner of the state Department of Public Health.“Anyone that has a known exposure to a COVID-positive individual or who has symptoms should be in self-quarantine until they have a negative test result,” Gifford said. “That is how were going to contain the spread of this virus…people [should] remain isolated from others if the re is a chance they may be infected. It is very important…as inconvenient as we understand that is, that individuals remain in quarantine.”The wait for test results has grown longer in recent weeks, with national labs processing a spike in samples from Arizona, Texas, California and other hot spots. CVS Health attributed the “extremely high demand for tests” to rising caseloads in much of the nation.“This has caused backlogs for our lab partners and is delaying their processing of patient samples,” said Tara Burke, a spokeswoman for CVS Health. “Currently, due to these factors, it may take 6-10 days for people to receive their results and, in some instances, our lab partners may take even longer to return results. Our lab partners are working hard to address this issue.”With schools and businesses looking to reopen, demand for testing could swell even more, putting additional pressure on an already overburdened system, officials say. Early in the pandemic, Connecticut contracted with several in-state laboratories, which agreed to process a certain number of tests and to turn around results as quickly as possible. In most cases, the in-state diagnostic centers are reporting results within 24 hours, said Josh Geballe, Governor Lamont is chief operating officer. The state is currently in discussions with some of those facilities to take on additional capacity to help compensate for the backlog at the national laboratories.“We are working as much as we can with our local labs and…there we are getting a quick turnaround, 24 hours or less,” Lamont said. “We are doing as much as we can to move all the testing analysis right here in the state of Connecticut and we are not going to have that wait.”Quest Diagnostics, one of the nation is largest labs, said it is trying to address the backlog. “At Quest Diagnostics, we are doing everything we can to bring more COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing to patients at this critical time,” the company said in a statement. Last week, the Federal Food and Drug Administration allowed Quest to pool its samples. Under this scenario, four samples can be tested at once; if the results are negative, all of those individuals are COVID-free. If it is positive, the four samples are separated and tested individually to determine which is infected. Even as steps are taken to speed up the process, some state residents continue to face long waits for results. John Silver went to a mobile testing site in New Britain on July 9 for a COVID-19 test. He and his wife had several trips planned and wanted to make sure they were not infected before they set off. His results arrived nine days later, on July 18, and his wife is arrived on July 20; both were negative. Although they had no symptoms and no reason to suspect they were sick, they isolated for the first two days following the test.“But nine days?” said Silver, who is 43 and lives in Farmington. “Just too much time.”Christopher Duff is test was also negative.“Everyone is symptoms lifted before we got results back,” he said, “although I was still concerned I could have it and be asymptomatic.”After eight days of waiting, “it was a relief,” he added.",2,2,Hartford Courant
613,Ex-Representative Ryan Zinke eyes new House seat in Montana,-2.67,45.33,https://www.rollcall.com/2021/04/29/ex-rep-ryan-zinke-eyes-new-house-seat-in-montana/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-29,23,"| Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinkeformed a committeeThursday to raise money to run for a House seat in Montana that will be created based on new census data released this week. Zinke won two terms representing the state is current at-large district before leaving to join the Trump administration in 2017. He was the first Montanan to serve in a presidential Cabinet, but here signed in the face of ethics investigations after serving less than two years. In all, the former secretary came under at least 15 different investigations before leaving in January 2019. Paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission indicates that the Helena-based campaign committee, Zinke for Congress, is geared toward fundraising for what will become Montana is 2nd District. Boundaries for that seat will be drawn later this year, after more detailed census data is released. Lorna Kuney, who was listed as the committee treasurer and records custodian on the FEC paperwork, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Republican strategist involved in House races said it is not too early to lay the groundwork for a campaign, but other candidates are likely waiting to find out more information about where and how competitive the new district will be. Despite Democratic Governor Steve Bullock spending $49 million last fall on a run for Senate, he and his party is House candidate were shut out, and Montana voters went for President Donald Trump over Joe Biden, 57 percent to 41 percent. At least one of the two newly drawn seats is expected to be solid GOP territory in 2022. But the re is a possibility the new seat could be competitive, depending on how the boundaries are drawn by an independent commission, appointed mostly by state lawmakers.[]It is also unclear whether Montanans will penalize Zinke for his record at the Interior Department. In October 2018, about two months before Zinke left his post, the department is inspector general referred an inquiry it had launched into Zinke is conduct to the Justice Department. That probe centered on a land agreement Zinke reached with an executive of oil field services giant Hallibutron in Whitefish, Mont., his hometown. Also that October, the inspector general found that Zinkebroke federal rules by allowing family members to travel with him in government vehicles. Zinke also asked if his wife, Lola, could join the department as a volunteer, the IG said in a report.“He denied that his intention in making this request was so that his wife could travel with him in an official capacity, which would have eliminated the requirement to reimburse the Government for her travel,” the report said. “Ultimately, the employees advised him that making her a volunteer could be perceived negatively, and she did not become one.”The inspector general also found that Zinke took a security detail with him on a vacation to Greece and Turkey, costing taxpayers $25,000. In April 2018, the IG cleared Zinke of misconduct in connection with travel arrangements, including on chartered and military planes. A former Navy SEAL, Zinke showed up to his first day of work as secretary on a horse. He pushed policies to relax fossil fuel extraction and supported shrinking the boundaries of two national monuments in Utah, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. Citing an inspector general report, House Democrats said the decision to shrink the size of those monuments was predetermined to benefit fossil fuel and mining interests. Zinke, whom the Senate confirmed by a 68-31 vote in March 2017, frequently used the phrase “energy dominance” to describe his efforts at the department to ease environmental regulations, and he backed a Trump administration move to allow offshore oil-and-gas drilling off every coastal state in the country, including in Florida, despite bipartisan opposition. Trump issued a moratorium in August last year to freeze oil and gas drilling in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. The Interior Department unveiled Zinke is official portrait in December. It shows him on horseback and is based on a photo taken when he visited Bears Ears in 2017.",2,2,Roll Call

Responding to CNN is Jim Acosta question of whether Tucker Carlson is hugely popular show on Fox News would have prevented the eradication of dangerous diseases in the US had it been around decades ago, Fauci appeared to agree.“Do you think we could have eradicated polio or defeated the measles if you had Fox News night after night warning people about these vaccine issues that are, you know, bunk?”Acosta asked Fauci during an interview on Saturday. Dr. Anthony Fauci to@Acosta: ""We probably would still have smallpox and we probably would still have polio in this country if we had the kind of false information that is being spread now.""pic.twitter.com/MVUxEPX5yf“If we had had the push back for the vaccines the way we are seeing on certain media, I do not think it would have been possible at all not only to eradicate polio, we probably would still have smallpox,”Fauci said, before adding that he was“certain”that polio would have been still active in the US The US had its last outbreak of smallpox back in 1949, and since 1972, the vaccine is no longer commonly administered. The last wild case globally was in 1977. Shortly after 9/11, President George W Bush ordered smallpox vaccinations for 500,000 US troops in high-risk parts of the world and front line healthcare workers who were willing to get vaccinated. However, at the time there were concerns about possible life-threatening side effects of the jab, with the New York Timesreportingthat“the decision had been difficult for President Bush, given the probability that some people would die of the vaccine is side effects.”According to a 2003 modelstudy, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, if 60 percent of the US population was vaccinated, this would be beneficial in an unlikely scenario of a national bio terrorist attack with the smallpox virus, but otherwise would have caused some 482 deaths nationally. The US has been polio-free since 1979, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) crediting“a successful vaccination program”with two vaccines introduced in the mid-1950s and early 1960s for uprooting the disease in the US Worldwide, polio cases have plummeted dramatically since the late 1980s, with the World Health Organization reporting only 22 cases in 2017. And while polio has been almost eradicated, save for Afghanistan and Pakistan, where it remains epidemic, the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign was called into question in light of a 2019 WHO report voicing concerns that more polio cases were attributed to a cheap oral vaccine than to a wild virus.",1,1,RT

616,Lockdowns Come from a Place of Privilege,13.33,29.67,https://thelibertyloft.com/lockdowns-come-from-a-place-of-privilege/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-loft-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-05,15,"Charlotte, NC — The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lock downs are making life quite difficult for a lot of people, and some of the hardest hit are the poor and marginalized. There are immigrants who have been laid off from their jobs and single mothers who ca not access childcare. There are elderly people who ca not get the support they need and people with mental illnesses who are struggling with the lack of routine. One of the biggest challenges for people on the margins is that, all too often, they are invisible to society at large. Issues likepoverty, addiction, mental illness and domestic abuse do not often make the news, so it is easy to forget that these hardships are an ever-present reality for millions of people. Champions of the lock downs tend to be especially oblivious to these hardships, and their preoccupation with case numbers and COVID deaths has caused them to blithely dismiss people is concerns. Some have even castigated protesters for raising their concerns, brushing them off with the callous retort, “it is not all about you.”Another way people have trivialized these hardships is with the phrase “just stay home.” To many, that slogan may seem innocuous. But, for those living on the margin, that word “just” cuts like a knife. The fact is that for a myriad of reasons, many of them simply ca not afford to stay home, and talking as if they can only underscores the extent of our shortsightedness. In many cases, the myopia displayed by the most vocal proponents of the lock downs likely stems from the fact that they the mselves have not been impacted nearly as much as those who are underprivileged. Politicians like to say “we are all in this together,” but in reality, there is not really much “we” about it. Instead, there are two, starkly different lock downs playing out. The first kind of lock down is the one experienced by the “lockdown elite.” More akin to a romanticized inconvenience, this kind of lock down is characterized by working remotely, chatting on Zoom calls and ordering Uber Eats. The second kind of lock down is the one experienced by the lower class. For many, it means being unemployed or underemployed, and potentially putting the mselves at a higher risk of infection. These lock downs are also leading to higher suicide rate sand damaging an entire generation of kids whose psychological well-being depends on rich social interactions. But even that is just the tip of the iceberg. Drug overdoses have also spiked due to the enforced isolation, as well as domestic violence rates. The dramatic rise in unemployment has also led to as urge in the number of Americans who ca not afford food. And on top of all that, senior citizens in particular have faced unimaginable suffering. In contrasting these two experiences, the privilege of the lock down advocates becomes apparent. The “lockdown elite” are shielded from the trials of the marginalized, so it is no surprise that they downplay the severity of the problems or deny that they even exist. The natural consequence of this circumstance is as obvious as it is uncomfortable. We need to “check our privilege.” Now to be sure, that phrase has been abused a lot, but the kernel of truth in it is that being protected from adversity can make us oblivious to the impacts of the policies we endorse. So “checking our privilege” in this case is about humbly recognizing the limits of our knowledge. We need to be particularly wary of arrogantly thinking that we can impose a sweeping, one-size-fits-all approach that will be generally beneficial. Aside from being paternalistic, the problem with this mindset is that it disregards the diverse range of individual experiences, needs, and risks that people are facing. A good example of this mindset can be seen in the mainstream discourse, which has revolved around questions such as “what should schools do” or “what should churches do.” For many of us it can be tempting to pick sides on these topics. But rather than weigh in on these debates, I think we would be better to insist that these are the wrong questions. Decisions about how to manage risk should not be to p-down and universal. They need to be made independently by each local institution. Of course, it is reassuring to imagine that the government is looking out for us and that their experts will make good decisions, but it is important that we resist the allure of central planning. Bureaucrats, scientists and journalists will all pretend to have the answers, but the truth is that they do not. What is more, we can do an awful lot of harm when we impose our “solutions” on people whose contexts we do not understand. In light of this, truly “checking our privilege” means rejecting the to p-down solutions that stem from our ignorance and hubris. Rather than assuming we know what is best for others, we need to embrace a multifaceted, localized approach that empowers individuals to make their own choices. Invariably, many will object that ending the lock downs in the name of economic expediency is rather imprudent, but this objection is missing the bigger picture. Ending the lock downs is not about ignoring the very real risks we are facing. Rather, it is about taking responsibility for our own well-being and allowing others to take responsibility for theirs. Even more, it is about recognizing that people is livelihoods are not “non-essential”, and that our privilege often blinds us to the repercussions of our actions. Because here is what you need to understand about the marginalized people bemoaning these lockdowns. They are not greedy. They are desperate. And you would be too if you were in their shoes.

618,Trump fans are hoping he will commute Pollard is sentence – The Forward,-0.67,39.67,https://forward.com/news/458462/the-timing-is-right-for-trump-to-help-jonathan-pollard-convicted-spy-move/,https://adfontesmedia.com/forward-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,25,"Supporters and friends of Jonathan Pollard, the American Jew who served Israel as a spy, are hoping that before he leaves office, President Donald Trump will enable Pollard to emigrate to the Jewish state by commuting his sentence or pardoning him. Pollard pleaded guilty in 1986 to conspiracy to commit espionage in connection with providing Israeli contacts with hundreds of classified documents he had obtained as a civilian intelligence specialist for the US Navy. After serving 30 years in prison, he began 15 years of parole, whose conditions stipulate that he not leave the country. He also has a curfew and the government monitors his computer use. However, Pollard is parole comes up for review by the US Department of Justice every five years, and his five-year anniversary is on November 21, saidDavid Schoen,a defense attorney not connected to the Pollard case who practices nationwide and has worked on cases involving government security clearance. Eliot Lauer, Pollard is lawyer, could not be reached for comment. Pollard and his wife are eager to learn the government is plans, especially because he longs to move to Israel and has already become an Israeli citizen, but they have not an inkling of what the Justice Department might do, said a friend of the family who talked with them Thursday morning but spoke on condition of anonymity. If the Justice Department makes no changes to his parole arrangements, Pollard could appeal to Trump for a commutation of his sentence, or a pardon. He could also appeal to the department itself, but going to Trump is the stronger strategy, Schoen said. Pollard is allies are already trying to involve Trump, beloved by many Jews for moves he is made related to Israel, such as moving the US embassy to Jerusalem. In 2017, Trump commuted the 27-year sentence of another high-profile Jewish prisoner, Sholom Rubashkin, the former CEO of the largest kosher meat-processing plant.“I think there is a good chance – based on his track record – that Trump may do something,” said Farley Weiss, president of the National Council of Young Israel. “There is no question that he has been the best president for Israel of any president in history.”Weiss asked deceased Senator John McCain, a Republican of Arizona, to help Pollard leave prison on parole after he had served 30 years of his life prison sentence. Now he is tapping his contacts again on Pollard is behalf. Jewish supporters of both Rubashkin and Pollard claimed that their sentences were excessive. Farley called Pollard is sentence a “miscarriage of justice.”Just before he was sentenced, Pollard tried to cast himself as a kind of Jewish patriot, the Forward reported, trying to help Israel by compensating for the American intelligence community is failings. Others, including the Forward,have argued against leniency for Pollard.“Jonathan Pollard is not a Jewish martyr,”wroteNew Republic editor Martin Peretz.“He is a convicted espionage agent who spied on his country for both Israel and Pakistan (!) — a spy, moreover, who got paid for his work.

620,Op-Ed: Do not exempt religious objectors from vaccine mandates,-5.67,35.0,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-07-23/religious-exemption-mandatory-vaccination-policies-constitution,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"Policies requiring vaccination against COVID-19 need not include, and should not include, exceptions for those who have religious objections to vaccinations. Many universities, including the University of California, are requiring vaccination for all students, staff and faculty returning to campus. Many employers, public and private, are doing so as well. These policies are essential to protect public health. The virulent Delta variant of the coronavirus has made it imperative to ensure vaccination of as many people as possible. Unfortunately, though, many of these policies have an exception for those who have a religious objection to vaccination. These are neither required by the law nor are they desirable as a matter of policy because they make it possible for anyone to circumvent the vaccine mandate. The UC is mandatory vaccination policy, for example, has an exception for those who object on religious grounds. It states that this is because the law requires such an exemption,declaring:“The University is required by law to offer reasonable accommodations to ... employees who object to vaccination based on their sincerely-held religious belief, practice, or observance.”This is simply wrong as a matter of law. No law requires such a religious exemption. In terms of free exercise of religion under the 1st Amendment, the Supreme Court ruled more than 30 years ago in Employment Division vs Smith that the Constitution does not require exceptions to general laws for religious beliefs. In an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, the court said that as long as a law is neutral, not motivated by a desire to interfere with religion and of general applicability to all individuals, it cannot be challenged based on free exercise of religion. In June, in Fulton vs City of Philadelphia, the court reaffirmed this legal test. Laws that require vaccination are the epitome of a neutral law of general applicability: a requirement that applies to everyone and that was not motivated by a desire to interfere with religion. Even if this were not so, the government can infringe on religious freedom if its action is necessary to achieve a compelling interest. Stopping the spread of a deadly communicable disease is obviously a compelling interest and vaccinations are the best way to reach that goal. No one, in practicing his or her religion, has a constitutional right to endanger others. Indeed, a number of states, before COVID-19, created mandates for children to be vaccinated against other communicable diseases without making exemptions for religious beliefs. Without exception, the lower courts have upheld these mandates as constitutional. Nor do federal employment discrimination laws require a religious exception for employees. In the 1977 case Trans World Airlines vs Hardison, the Supreme Court said that employers do not have to bear more than a “de minimus” cost in accommodating employees’ religious beliefs. Vaccine exemptions could impose a significant cost on employers in terms of illness and the refore clearly are not required. Religious exemptions, like in the University of California policy, are for those with “sincerely held religious beliefs.” But how can this possibly be determined?The Supreme Court has said that religious beliefs are personal and it does not matter whether they are in accord with the teachings and dictates of a particular faith. Under this broad principle, any person could get a vaccination exemption merely by stating that he or she has a religious objection against it. Such an easy opt-out could make the mandate illusory. That is why the only way to have a meaningful vaccination requirement is to apply it to everyone — except those for whom vaccination is not medically advisable. As people return to the workplace and to campuses the spread of COVID-19 remains a great danger, especially with the highly transmissible Delta variant circulating. The unvaccinated not only endanger the mselves and other unvaccinated people, but also those who cannot get the vaccine for medical reasons. And now, there are growing reports of breakthrough infections of fully vaccinated individuals. Universities and employers have the legal right to make sure that everyone is vaccinated. And they have the moral duty to protect health and lives. Erwin Chemerinsky is dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law and a contributing writer to Opinion.

Nine of 13 retail categories posted increases in June sales, including solid gains at electronics and appliance outlets, clothing stores and restaurants. Sales at motor vehicle and parts dealers fell 2% in June, likely in response to limited inventory as auto makers face a supply chain crunch.

Nearly half of millennia ls surveyed by Corelogic, and 64% of baby boomers, said the y, ""strongly prefer"" to live in a single, stand-alone home.""Single-family rent growth showed a strong rebound in April 2021 with all price tiers back above their pre-pandemic rent growth rate,"" said Molly Boesel, principal economist at CoreLogic. ""While rent growth slowed last April at the start of the pandemic, the rate of rent growth this April was running above pre-pandemic levels even when compared with 2019 and shows no signs of diminishing.""The rent gains are across all price categories, even low end, which exceeded pre-pandemic rent increases for the first time. By category, the gains are as follows:·(75% or less than the regional median): 3.9%, up from 3.2% in April 2020·(75% to 100% of the regional median): 4.8%, up from 2.5% in April 2020·(100% to 125% of the regional median): 5.1%, up from 2.3% inApril 2020·(125% or more than the regional median): 6.1%, up from 2.2% in April 2020Regionally, by top 20 metropolitan markets, rent gains were highest in Phoenix, where single-family rents were 12.2% higher than a year ago. Next, Tucson, Arizona, with a gain of 10.6%. That was followed by Las Vegas at 9.3%. Atlanta, which had the lowest unemployment rate of the 20 metros, came in fourth at 9.1%. On the flip side, Boston saw an annual decline of 5.9% in rent prices and has experienced the largest decrease of the 20 metropolitan market rent prices for nine straight months. Chicago was the only other decliner, at 2.6%. With home prices continuing to gain at a double-digit pace, and more potential buyers being priced out, demand for single-family rentals is unlikely to cool anytime soon.""The inflation that is currently here is slowing the most interest rate sensitive part of the economy, that being housing,"" said Peter Boockvar, chief investment officer at the Bleakley Advisory Group.",2,2,CNBC
623,Long COVID poses a subtle workplace crisis as sufferers say they are working longer hours and feel more stressed,0.0,45.0,https://www.businessinsider.com/long-covid-work-crisis-longer-hours-stress-2021-7,https://adfontesmedia.com/insider-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,17,"Long COVID may pose a workplace crisis, as new data offers a snapshot into how sufferers feel the impact on their working lives. Those self reporting symptoms of long COVID say they are working longer hours than before and in general have higher levels of anxiety. Some feel like they do not have anyone totalk to about their symptoms,according to the latest Opinions and Lifestyle Survey from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). There are two stages to the condition that is clinically diagnosed as long COVID, according to the British Lung foundation. Symptoms that last for between four and 12 weeks is known as Ongoing Symptomatic COVID-19. Symptoms that last for more than 12 weeks — and are unexplained by another diagnosis — are referred to as Post COVID Syndrome. Symptoms reported by sufferers can vary in their type and severity and include breathlessness, fatigue and aches and pains among a variety of others. For the ONS survey, 39,268 UK adults aged 16 and above were polled to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on British society between April 7 and June 13. In total 6.2% of adults said that they had experienced symptoms of long COVID — that included 2.6% who said they were unsure. A tenth said that they had tested positive, but had not suffered any chronic symptoms. The survey covered self-reported symptoms of long Covid, rather than those whose conditions had been clinically diagnosed. Of those who reported long-term symptoms, 44% said that it had affected their day-to-day work either through their ability to do their job or through other factors like having to work from home. Some 30% said that this impact had been negative. There has been an increase all around, with 36% saying they had not experienced long COVID but had felt the impact of the coronavirus on their working lives. But it is long COVID sufferers who were more likely to say that they worked longer hours as a result of the pandemic than those with no symptoms (25% versus 21%). Their mental health is also generally worse (40% compared to 30%). The majority, 65%, said that they felt more stressed and anxious as a result of their long term condition — compared to 59% for those without chronic symptoms. A quarter feel like they have no one totalk to about the condition. A further 25% say they feel like a burden on others. Other UK government studies have estimated that as many as2 million people had had COVID-19 symptoms that lasted at least 12 weeks by February 2021. Global numbers are hazier, but theWorld Health Organisation estimated in February that one in 10 people who catch COVID-19 could suffer long term symptoms. Read next",2,1,Insider
624,"The MAGA Riot in Washington Was the Natural Culmination of Donald Trump is Influence — And, Just Maybe, Its Swan Song",-19.17,34.0,https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/the-uprising-in-washington-was-the-natural-culmination-of-donald-trumps-influence-and-just-maybe-its-swan-song-1234880114/,https://adfontesmedia.com/variety-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-06,21,"As corrosive and unsettling as the images of lawlessness from the US Capitol have been to day, the re is a twist of fate at their core so brutally ironic it can make your head spin. When the MAGA protesters, turning off their incendiary right-wing TV and Internet channels and getting off their couches, set out for Washington to foment what Joe Strummer 44 years ago called a “white riot,” they probably did not expect to be competing with the headline “Democrats Retake the US Senate.” Because, of course, few observers we rethe game-changing referendum we got from the two Senate races in Georgia. The grand paradox is that you can link that seismic pair of Democratic wins directly toDonald Trump is 10 weeks of drum-beating over his increasingly destructive fantasy of election fraud. Why? Because his descent into total demagogic lo opiness revealed his nature so starkly it turned voters off? Number Because enough Republicans were actually brainwashed intohim. They did not bother to show up for a “rigged” election, the reby making Trump a victim of his own success. Since to day is insurrection was all about the issue of election fraud, the Georgia vote lent the events an irony of extraordinary bite. And what it indicated is that the whole “Biden stole the election!” issue, as perilous and scary as it has often seemed, has proved in the end to be the ultimate political orgy of hot air: a great deal of smoke without fire. The far-right uprising in Washington today was framed, in the minds of those who participated in it, as a Boston Tea Party/burning-of-the-Reichstag defining moment. But it felt more like the Last Gasp of Trumpism heard round the world. Which is not to deny that it was disturbing as hell: not just a mob scene, not just a protest laced with anarchy, but a messy, furious, middle-class-yob-posing-as-rebel attack on the rule of law. Yet even as the images of the MAGA faithful swarming the steps of the US Capitol, or climbing its walls like a scruffy medieval horde in windbreakers, seared the mselves into our national memory play with a shock value that was undeniable, in another way the protest, the riot, the violent tantrum — whatever you want to call it — had a weird “OK, let is finally do this!” inevitability about it. The right wing in this country has been nattering on about “civil war” ever since that person at a Tea Party rally held up a sign that said “Keep the government is hands off my Medicare!” Today is mini high-concept rehearsal for civil war was the natural culmination of what Trump and his enablers have been egging his supporters on to do for some time — from Trump is shout-out to the Proud Boys in the first presidential debate, when he asked them to “stand back and stand by,” to Rudy Giuliani is exhortations to “trial by combat” this morning. Yet it was not just Trump is winking appeals to lawlessness that incited to day is chaotic action. The nature of those who live in an alternate reality is that the re is something essentially about their entire belief system. No,Joe Bidendid not steal the election; the truth of his victory has been ratified by every state and dozens of courts. And no, the Democratic Party is not controlled by a cadre of elites who run a child sex-trafficking ring. But if you believe the former (which most Trump supporters do), or if you believe the latter (the central article of faith in QAnon, the online cult that is now moved to the center of the Trump cult), you are not living in the real world. And that means that politics has become, for you, a kind of media-fed shadow play, a dance of illusions dressed up as “news.” “Drain the swamp” is not a policy; it is a fairy-tale metaphor posing as policy. When your political beliefs are mired in the world of illusion, there may be a special need to transform those beliefs into something physical and tangible, to prove — to yourself! — that you are not just another Fox News simulation-game ditto-head but a badass who means what you say. An assault on the Capitol Building is a metaphor that can feel “real” because it looks just like something you saw in a Gerard Butler movie. Is the insurrection we saw today the beginning or the end of something? Those on the right will want to see it as the beginning. They reject the very foundation of the Biden presidency (that thing called voting, otherwise known as democracy), and so today was the day they stood up, climbed the walls, and declared that they stood for something else: power at any cost. But the flip side of power, or at least unseemly displays of it, is impotence. And that, sealed by the amazing Democratic triumph in Georgia, may wind up being the signature quality of the post-presidency of Donald Trump, and all those who will now follow him like lemmings off the cliff of his own ego. It is fashionable to say that Trump will continue to wield extraordinary influence. But I would argue that the last two months, fueled by his pathological obsession with election fraud, have changed the Trump brand. For a long time, Trump supporters could at least that he stood for things like standing up to China or shouting down political correctness. But now Trump stands, first and foremost, for the idea that he is “still really the president,” and that Joe Biden is occupying the office under false pretenses. That is not just politically outrageous; it is nuts. And that is what the armchair anarchists in Washington stood for to day: not simply trashing America but going through the looking glass to do it. They have left us with a lasting image of what it looks like when political action loses its mind.",1,1,Variety

Donald Trumpis considered high risk to the dangers of the coronavirus because of his age and because he is judged to be overweight. Experts have long warned the virus, which causesCovid-19, is a particular threat to those aged in the 70s or older, those with some pre-existing health conditions, and people who do not exercise.“This evening I received confirmation that both President Trump andFirst LadyMelania Trump have tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus,” White House doctor Sean Conley said in a statement.“The President and First Lady are both well at this time, and they plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.”He added: “The White House medical team and I will maintain a vigilant watch, and I appreciate the support provided by some of our country is greatest medical professionals and institutions.”Yet experts warned that given he is aged 74 and because he is considered overweight, Mr Trump will be in the high risk category for those who contract the disease. There was no immediate word from Joe Biden, who debated with Mr Trump on Tuesday night in a noisy, unappealing event during which the president repeatetedly talked over the former vice president. He even mocked him for wearing masks “I do not wear masks like him. Every time you see him, he is got a mask,” he said. “He could be speaking 200 feet away from it, he shows up with the biggest mask I have ever seen.” Mr Trump is positive test result came after news that Hope Hicks, a top adviser and trusted aide, had tested positive for the new coronavirus earlier on Thursday. The president. who is tested regularly for the virus, has held rallies with thousands of people in recent weeks in the run-up to the November 3 election, despite warnings from public health professionals against having events with large crowds. The president largely eschews wearing masks and has criticised others who do. Public health professionals say mask-wearing is key to helping to prevent the virus from spreading. Earlier this year, House speaker Nancy Pelosi calling him “morbidly obese”. Mr Pelosi said it was ”not a good idea“ for the president to be taking hydroxychloroquine, a drug that has not been proven to work against the coronavirus, because it can pose a risk for people with heart conditions and he is ”morbidly obese”. Mr Trump later said: “I do not respond to her. I think she is a waste of time.”Additional reporting by ReutersJoin thought-provoking conversations, follow other Independent readers and see their repliesGettyWant to bookmark your favourite articles and stories to read or reference later?

627,Ron DeSantis leans into mask-mandate fights as Covid cases soar in Florida,-15.67,34.33,https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/20/politics/ron-desantis-masks-florida-schools-covid-19/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-20,24,"As the number of new coronavirus cases in his state soars, Florida Governor Ron DeSantisis betting that an aggressive campaign against mandatory mask-wearingin schools will harden the Republican base ahead of his expected re-election bid next year – and make him a GOP star nationwide as the party is 2024 presidential primary comes into view. The gamble appears to be paying off – for now. DeSantis is a Fox News darling and relishes the intensifying backlash from Democrats, especially President Joe Biden, who has criticized the governor and other Republican state executives for rejecting recommendations from public health experts and officials. But national attention does not always translate into political gain at home and could potentially seed new complications for DeSantis by the time Floridians go to the polls next year to cast their verdict on his first term. For now, the Delta variant is surge in Florida is a wild card for the governor, who has refused to ramp up mitigation efforts even as the pandemic threatens the state is tourism industry and – with schools opening – the safety of young students, their families, educators and other staff inside the buildings. The fates of elected officials in both parties during midterm elections are typically tied to the popularity of the sitting president. If Biden – and, more specifically, Biden is brand of moderation that has been so popular in the suburbs – is on the up come November 2022, DeSantis could be in for a trickier campaign than most anticipate. If not, cutting a divisive figure could put the governor on a glide path to a relatively narrow, but comfortable re-election. That logic appears to be influencing DeSantis as he spreads his message across the country, whether on cable or at events like one in Utah in late July, where he ridiculed the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over their new mask guidance – “Did you not get the CDC is memo?,” he asked the mostly unmasked crowd to laughter. “I do not see you complying” – and pledged to take a hard line against other measures.“It is very important that we say, unequivocally, no to lockdowns, no to school closures, no to restrictions and no to mandates,” DeSantis told the conservative gathering. Florida Board of Education orders Broward, Alachua counties to allow mask opt-out in 48 hours or start losing fundingDeSantis is keen to play to friendly crowds and he appears mindful of where he picks his highest profile fights. His recent mask clashes have mostly centered in counties and school districts where, politically, he has the least to lose – Democratic strongholds that rejected him during his run for governor in 2018. Hillsborough and Miami-Dade, Florida is largest county, both voted overwhelmingly for Democratic nominee Andrew Gillum nearly three years ago, when DeSantis won his first term by a little more than 32,000 votes, or less than one-half of 1 percentage point. School districts in those counties have taken steps in defiance of the governor. Hillsborough County Public Schools responded to a spike in Covid-19 infections and exposures by putting in place a 30-day mask mandate, and the school board in Miami-Dade voted to require face coverings in classrooms, setting up another round of conflict with DeSantis and top state officials who have threatened to sanction dissenters. DeSantis spokeswoman Christina Pushaw argued that rather than the governor being keen to pick fights in areas where he might have already lacked political support, DeSantis is simply carrying out the law he signed in late June, which effectively banned schools from implementing mask mandates without parental opt outs – and that partisan politics might be influencing the school boards’ positions.“Due to the lack of empirical data to support forced masking of children, which is not even recommended at all in many European countries, it is hard to understand why these school boards would willingly violate the law,” Pushaw said in an email. “They argue it is for the health of children, but they ca not provide data to support that assertion. Therefore it does appear to be political on their part.”Public health experts, including at the CDC, strongly encourage mask-wearing as a useful tool against the spread of Covid-19.“Community mask wearing substantially reduces transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus in 2 ways. First, masks prevent infected persons from exposing others to SARS-CoV-2 by blocking exhalation of virus-containing droplets into the air,” according to an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association. “Second, masks protect uninfected wearers. Masks form a barrier to large respiratory droplets that could land on exposed mucous membranes of the eye, nose, and mouth.”Hillsborough and Miami-Dade squared up with DeSantis on the same day Biden, in a speech from the White House, revealed that he had directed his Education Department to use its power to potentially overrule state executives preventing local jurisdictions from making their own masking rules. Biden did not mention DeSantis by name, but he called out “some politicians” for “trying to turn public safety measures – that is, children wearing masks in school – into political disputes for their own political gain.”“We are not going to sit by as governors try to block and intimidate educators protecting our children,” Biden said, suggesting that that the administration could pursue legal action. Hours later, in a conversation with Fox News host Sean Hannity, DeSantis mocked the President and again previewed his 2022 – and, potentially, 2024 – campaign messages.“He is obsessed with having the government force kindergarten ers to wear masks all day in school,” DeSantis said. “In Florida, we believe that that is the parents’ decision. Joe Biden thinks the federal government should come and overrule the parents and force these young kids to wear these masks.”A day earlier, the Florida State Board of Education voted to recommend investigations into school officials in Alachua and Broward counties, which have acted in defiance of the governor is ban on mandates. DeSantis lost Alachua, which voted to extend its mask mandate for 8 weeks on Tuesday, by more than 2 points in 2018. And in Broward, Gillum more than doubled DeSantis’ vote total, winning the county by a 68%-31% margin. Democratic candidates and Democratic-aligned groups are ringing alarm bells over the situation in Florida and pinning the bulk of the blame for the state is dire circumstances – with more than 20,000 new Covid-19 cases being reported daily – on refusals by the governor and GOP lawmakers to allow proven mitigation measures even as cases climb among children. According to statistics from the Florida Department of Health, there were 16,764 new cases among those under 12 years old (a cohort not yet eligible to be vaccinated) from August 6-12. That represented a positivity rate of 22.1%, slightly higher than the state average. Floridians ages 12 to 19 years old accounted for nearly 15,000 new cases that week. Their positivity rate also exceeded the state number, at 24.3% to 19.3% overall. Democratic Representative Charlie Crist, a former Florida governor running to win back his old job, responded to the state board is decision, describing the standoff as a clash between courageous local officials, some of whom have been threatened with firings, and a power-hungry DeSantis.“He is overstepping the boundaries of his office to enforce his deadly political agenda on our lives, leaving our school boards and superintendents to bravely do what is right and stand up against him,” Crist said in a statement. “Governor DeSantis lacks the compassion and common sense to get us out of this pandemic. I continue to stand with teachers, parents, and school boards doing what is right for our students. We need a leader, not a dictator.”Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the only statewide elected Democrat in Florida and another potential DeSantis challenger next year, has also sharpened her attacks on the governor as she touts a federal lawsuit arguing, in part, that bans on mask mandates are in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.“These unconstitutional threats from DeSantis and (Florida Education Commissioner Richard) Corcoran are not about individual rights or freedom,” Fried said on Wednesday. “They are about pandering to the most extreme voices in order to score political points at the expense of your kids, your family.”But even as the Delta-powered Covid-19 surge shows few signs of abating as the school year swings into gear, DeSantis is, much in the vein of former President Donald Trump, only becoming more strident – and undermining of real-world data and science that proves the utility of masks.“Politicians want to force you to cover your face as a way for them to cover their own asses,” he said on Wednesday. “That is just the truth. They want to be able to say they are taking this on and they are doing this, even though it is not proven to be effective they want to continue to do it.”",1,1,CNN
628,Some Texas Democrats ready to walk as GOP digs in on voting,-5.0,45.0,https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-government-and-politics-texas-voting-c05ff78698d843674ec917085f6cc6da,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The possibility of Texas Democrats staging a second walkout to again stop one of America is most restrictive new voting measures grew louder Saturday, as hundreds of people waited hours to rail against the GOP is plan in the largest turnout this year at the state Capitol. As Republicans made clear they intended this weekend to advance a new election bill — which would prohibit 24-hour polling places, ban drop boxes and stop drive-thru voting — some Democratswho broke quorum in May are now describing it as their best, if not only, option again. Texas is among several states with GOP-controlled statehouses where Republicans have rushed to enact strict voting laws in response to former President Donald Trump is false claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him. A second walkout by Texas Democrats would mark a high-stakes escalation of their efforts to deny Republicans a major priority, and in turn, put more pressure on President Joe Bidento act on voting at the federal level. Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic former Texas congressman who is considering challenging Republican Governor Greg Abbott in 2022, said he has already offered help, saying he was ready to raise money “literally to feed and house the legislators” if they go that route.“Should we stick around? Hell no. For what?” Democratic state Representative Jarvis Johnson said. “There is nothing being done in earnest. There is nothing be done with the utmost respect for one another.”For weeks, Democratic leaders in the Texas Househave said they are not ruling out another revolt, but have also expressed hope of weakening the bill during the 30-day special session. Johnson, however, believes a large number of his colleagues are ready to deny Republicans a quorum for a second time, though most continue speaking cautiously.“You may know my next move, but you ca not stop it. You never knew when Mike Tyson was going to throw the uppercut, but you knew he was going to throw it,” he said. Another walkout may merely buy more time: Abbott could keep calling more 30-day special sessions until voting measures are passed. Paychecks for nearly 2,000 Capitol staffers could also be on the line, because Abbott vetoed funding for the legislative branch following Democrats’ late-night walkout. He has signaled he will restore that funding this summer — if lawmakers are around to put a bill on his desk. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the elected head of the governing body for the county where Houston is located, said Abbott was “extorting” lawmakers to get the legislation passed. Hidalgo said she was would support Democratic legislators breaking quorum again to block the bill is passage.“It is very important to me to recognize voting rights should be above politics,” Hidalgo said. “We can do that with all manner of issues, but not voting, not democracy.”The last time Texas Democrats left the state to deny a quorum was 2003, when they decamped to Oklahoma and New Mexico to try to block new GOP-drawn voting maps. They were gone more a month, but ultimately, Republicans passed a new redistricting plan. On Saturday, both the House and Senate were expected to advance the revived voting bills, which no longer include two of the most contentious provisions: prohibiting Sunday morning voting, when many Black churchgoers go to the polls, and language that would have made it easier for a judge to overturn elections. Hundreds of opponents packed overflow rooms at the Capitol and waited for hours to testify. It was the biggest turnout against a bill this year in Texas, where COVID-19 concerns have dampened crowds. Republican state Senator Bryan Hughes defended the election proposals as refining and improving the voting process, and said newly added provisions increase early voting hours and provide opportunities to fix rejected ballots.“Your ballot is sacrosanct,” Hughes said. “Everything else in the election process should be bathed in sunshine.”Nacal Tate said she woke up at 4 a.m. to drive from suburban Dallas to Austin to testify against the bill, even though it meant missing her grandniece is birthday party. She was joined by June Jenkins, president of an NAACP chapter in Collin County.“Hopefully the impact of what we do today will be worth the sacrifice of what we needed to sacrifice,” Jenkins said. “My compromise is to kill it.”Acacia Coronado is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

Nearly the moment that votes were tallied in Georgia, formalizing Democratic control of the Senate, West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin began to object: to $2,000 stimulus checks—which even President Biden himself pledged to pass—to filibuster reform, to the size of the stimulus package, to passing it via budget reconciliation. Manchin, who frequently voted with President Trump, wanted to make it clear that he would be a willing obstacle to the Democratic agenda, according to his own whims and fancies. Just a handful of days later, in a series of media appearances both national and local, Manchin vocalized an openness to checks, to the bigger spending package, and to passing it without Republican support. He even wavered ever so slightly on the filibuster. What changed? A series of radio spots went up in the state, paid for and produced by No Excuses PAC, a group founded by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez alums Corbin Trent and Saikat Chakrabarti and Justice Democrats co-founder Zack Exley. The ads identified Manchin as the obstruction standing between West Virginians and desperately needed relief. PerThe Intercept is Aída Chávez, Manchin was “getting pounded at home by a brutal radio ad.” And, not inconsequentially, he changed his tune. Now, No Excuses is launching its second pressure campaign, targeting intransigent Democratic senator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Sinema has gone to perhaps even greater lengths than Manchin to showcase her willingness to be an obstacle, and grab some of that spotlight from Manchin as the foremost Democratic opponent of filibuster reform in the Senate. And unlike Manchin, she is doing it from a purple state Joe Biden won in 2020. The group is up with radio ads across the state of Arizona, informing voters that their senator is one of Washington is top obstructionists. It hammers Sinema not just on her support of the filibuster, but on the broad embrace of inaction that the filibuster necessitates. “She seems to think the Senate needs to do more talking and less doing,” said Trent, co-founder of the group and the voice-over artist on the ad spot. “Countless hours of partisan bickering and back-and-forth, they do not prevent one case of COVID, they do not stop one death, they do not create one job,” the ad asserts. “It is time Kyrsten Sinema stood up for the people and stood against the filibuster.”The new ad is part of a multi-week multimedia campaign in Arizona. No Excuses has also taken out ad space in, the state is largest newspaper, to drive home the message. And this time, the messaging comes with a recruiting pitch: No Excuses is looking for candidates who could primary Sinema from the left when her term is up in 2024. The strategy is a new addition to Democratic politics, where it has not been commonplace to hit representatives back home for their work in Washington outside of an election cycle. While progressive primary challenges have pressured Democrats to move left in the House, the Senate, with its six-year terms, is more sheltered from that threat. No Excuses is hoping this strategy will make the left-wing presence a more persistent one, and help facilitate primary challenges of moderates if need be. “We have gotta create a little political gravity on that side of the m,” said Trent. Sinema is stubbornness is especially confounding, at least compared to Manchin, given the respective political contexts of their states. Manchin is one of the only Democrats left at any level in arguably the country is reddest state, one that has run away from Democrats at an astonishing pace. While Arizona can credibly be called purple, Joe Biden won the state in November, and it now sports Democrats in both of its Senate seats. Arizona is fast-growing metropolitan areas and large Latino population, combined with significant organizing networks and popular movement groups, mean it is a state where the progressive agenda has purchase now, and it will likely have even more in the future. The state recently legalized recreational marijuana and passed a substantial tax increase on high earners via ballot measure. Sinema won in 2018, a wave election for Democrats, who rebuked Trumpism and overachieved all over the country. She beat extremely unpopular Republican Martha McSally, who went on to lose to Democrat Mark Kelly two years later for the state is other Senate seat. Sinema, a former Green Party member who the n became a conservative Democratic vote in the House, portrayed herself in the campaign as an independent. But the notion that a maverick Democrat can only win in Arizona through a willingness to defy the party is priorities makes little sense in the current political climate. Most importantly, said Trent, it brings “very little benefit for the people she represents,” which is the message Arizonans are now hearing over the airwaves. Sinema has gone to perhaps even greater lengths than Manchin to showcase her willingness to be an obstacle. In some sense, the No Excuses operation buttresses the Biden administration is, and helps the president and party enact their agenda. Bidendispatched Vice President Kamala Harristo West Virginia for a media tour and pressure campaign of their own, hoping to drum up public support to sway Manchin. (Harris, who is not popular in West Virginia, did a clumsy job of it, talking about “abandoned land mines” instead of “abandoned mine land” when extending an olive branch to coal country.) If the party had better message discipline or could be counted on to vote the party line as Republicans do, none of this would be necessary. But that is not the Democratic Party that exists. So far, the inside-outside game seems to be working, at least in a limited fashion. Manchin has not had a total political epiphany. Justyesterday, he did a YouTube live stream where he refused to support ending the filibuster and championed the legacy and reputation of notorious segregationist Robert Byrd as a roundabout way of supporting the Byrd Rule and the filibuster is broad scope. And he appears to be the main obstacle to increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour within the COVID relief package. But he is fallen in line on the overall bill, which was in no way a certainty. Even Republican West Virginia governor Jim Justice recently called on him to support the bigger stimulus package. Whether it will be enough to change Sinema is tune is yet to be seen. But already, frustration is mounting in Arizona. Activist groups made up an important part of the coalition that helped Sinema across the finish line just over two years ago, and they have made their displeasure with her stance on the filibuster known. It is clear that it will be harder for Democrats to hide behind claims of Republican obstruction, when they are well within their abilities to enact meaningful legislation. Doing so immediately is a top priority, given the fragile trifecta Democrats currently sport. With redistricting looming and a fearsome 2022 midterm cycle, inaction would be tantamount to suicide for Joe Biden is agenda. If Sinema and Manchin, under threat of relentless public pressure, do come around, it will mark another lesson from the mistakes of the Obama years that Democrats seem to be learning, grudgingly.",1,1,American Prospect
630,Deficits Likely to Be Bigger Than Biden is Budget Projects,2.0,45.33,https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2021/06/02/Deficits-Likely-Be-Bigger-Biden-s-Budget-Projects,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-02,25,"President Biden is budget request for fiscal year 2020 projects a $1.8 trillion deficit next year and annual shortfalls of more than $1.3 trillion over the rest of the next decade. Actual deficits could be even larger, writes Howard Gleckman, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center — and not because of some extraordinarily rosy economic assumptions, as has often been the case in the past. “Instead, Biden masked what likely will be the true increases in deficits simply by using standard Washington budget accounting and by assuming that all of his proposed tax increases will become law, when they almost surely will not,” Gleckman writes. He explains that Biden is budget “makes two big assumptions.” One, as we noted last week, is that individual tax cuts in the 2017 Republican tax law will be allowed to expire as currently scheduled at the end of 2025. Biden has pledged not to raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year and he may not ultimately want all of those 2017 individual tax cuts to expire. Even if he does, many in Congress will not. “In reality, Congress may allow some to expire but surely will extend many others,” Gleckman says. “And there is a lot of money at stake. A back-of-the-envelope calculation based on theJoint Committee on Taxation is 2017 TCJA revenue estimates, which assume the individual provisions do expire after 2025, suggests extending them could add close to another $800 billion to the debt by 2031.”The other questionable tax assumption in Biden is budget involves corporate taxes. The budget assumes that his proposal to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% gets enacted — even as some Democrats have pushed back on that hike and said they’d prefer a 25% rate. “Rough rule of thumb: That three percentage point difference would reduce projected revenue by about $300 billion,” Gleckman says. “Similarly, Biden is budget assumes about $500 billion from changes to the taxation of US-based multinational corporations. The biggest single provision would effectively increase the global minimum tax on multinationals from 10.5 percent to 21 percent.” But the minimum rate is tied to the base corporate rate, and could ultimately drop to about 18% or lower. “Add it all up and that $2 trillion in new corporate tax revenue is likely to look more like $1.5 trillion or less,” Gleckman says. His conclusion: The 2031 deficit of 4.7% of GDP projected in the Biden budget is more likely to stay closer to 5% of GDP through the decade because revenues would be lower than forecast in the White House blueprint. Of course, Congress could still change that outlook by scaling back Biden is spending plans or enacting some unanticipated revenue measures.

Because that is how long it is until the 2022 midterm elections. And history suggests a good chance Democrats will lose their narrow control of Congress, most likely by losing the House. Then gridlock resumes. It is doubtful that Republicans will have much interest in helping Biden further become a ""transformational president"" by passing more wish-list items from the progressive agenda. Democrats surely understand the clock is ticking. But they also have to be hoping that the extraordinary power of the emerging economic boom might make the 2022 midterms an exception to the political pattern. Moody is Analytics, for example, recently revised its 2021 real GDP growth outlook to nearly 7 percent and to over 5 percent next year. ""If we are right,"" chief economist Mark Zandi told clients in a report, ""and the re is good reason to believe we will be, this will be the strongest two years of growth since 1950-1951 at the height of the post-World War II economic boom."" And Moody is is hardly alone in predicting warp-speed GDP and job growth this year and next. So we are really off the map here. Who knows, not only might the Biden Boom keep the House and Senate in Democratic hands, it might also make a second Biden term (or a first Harris term, perhaps) a pretty good bet. And when you think about it, two presidential terms might be what Democrats need to pass key legislation and the n make sure those programs survive during an era of extreme partisanship. Democrats are already trying to undo the Trump presidency wherever possible, such as attempting to partially reverse the Trump tax cuts, restore environmental rules, and rebuild America is trade relationship with Europe.

But the political impact of an unprecedented economic surge is not the only unknown here. Putting aside the possibility of a dangerous new COVID-19 variant, perhaps the greatest risk to the recovery — and thus the Biden legacy — is how Washington is helping generate that recovery. The stimulus continues to flow even as consumers boost spending and businesses fully reopen. And some Democrats still do not think the re is enough federal dough being spent, such as those who want recurring stimulus checks to be sent out and the $2.3 trillion Biden infrastructure plan to be a$10 trillion plan. As is, the tsunami of spending might yet boost inflation, resulting in surprise action from the Federal Reserve and an unexpected slowdown. Imagining pre-election recessions during the first terms of Ronald Reagan, George W Bush, and Barack Obama creates a pretty interesting game of ""what if"" alternate history with Presidents Mondale, Kerry, and Romney. An inflation surprise is hardly the only risk. While the recovery is currently generating gobs of jobs, the expansion will eventually slow. And it might slow faster than necessary thanks to generous jobless benefits that could potentially discourage work and create shortages. The $1.9 trillion COVID relief package last Marchextendedsupplemental benefits of $300 a month through early September. It is an argument sure to gain momentum after Friday is wildly disappointing April jobs report that showed 266,000 net new jobs were created last month vs a Wall Street forecast of a million or so. Now fat unemployment checks might not be the main reason for that undershoot. Home schooling, a lack of child care, virus fears, and data issues all might have played a role. But the report does suggest why some economists are worried about the labor-supply impact of impact of jobless benefits as the economy continues to gain strength in the coming months. A worker shortage would also add to the inflation threat. Again, many Democrats do not seem at all worried, at least so far. Late last month, nearly 40 Democrats on Capitol Hill sent the Biden White House a letter proposing ""more generous and long-lasting jobless benefits on a permanent basis,""according to the. Then the re is the proposed tax increases, more than $3 trillion worth — including a record increase in capital gains tax rates. A nation is tax burden matters. How an economy is taxed matters. What is taxed matters. Tax rates matter. And although the economy did not soar after the Trump tax cuts, the impact of the business tax cuts might have been offset by the Trump trade war. It is generally accepted, however, that tax rates affect how much and where a company invests. More investment makes workers more productive and will, over time, boost their wages. There is an economic risk that these proposed Biden tax increases will hurt investment. While many Wall Street banks have some pretty rosy economics forecasts, they are generally not incorporating any downside impact of the tax hikes. Those same firms are also, for the most part, assuming the economy returns to its modest pre-pandemic pace in 2023. So there could be less room for economic policy mistakes than it seems right now. And Democrats — pushing for more, more, more — should be worried a transformational presidency might just end up transition ing back to a Republican one.",1,1,The Week

633,"Semiconductor crisis has Biden administration sounding the alarm, with worries about China",0.0,45.67,https://fortune.com/2021/07/16/biden-administration-sounds-the-alarm-on-the-semiconductor-crisis/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,25,"US Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo has a lot on her mind, but one thing tops them all: semiconductors. Semiconductors, or computer chips, act as the brains that power our technological devices. These chips, now smaller than a stamp and thinner than a piece of hair, have revolutionized the modern world. Innovation in the field has led to smarter, faster, and smaller technology (think pacemakers, smartphones, solar energy, self-driving cars, laptops, airplanes, just about everything you use). They are also the second largest export in the US and are responsible for 2 million American jobs. A recent shortage of semiconductors sent companies, who usually rely on a lean inventory of the chips, around the world into crisis as the pandemic drummed up demand for laptops, cellphones, and other technological devices. The blockage of the Suez Canal in March only worsened deliveries. Industry leaders likeIntelCEO Pat Gelsinger expect things to get worse before they get better. They do not expect any real hope for recovery until 2022. Now, auto companies likeGM and Ford have announced that they are temporarily shutting down plants because of a semiconductor shortage. And that is exactly why Secretary Raimondo is worried. “We have fallen very far behind from where we need to be with respect to semiconductors,” she explained this week atCEOI Collaborative discussion. “Semiconductors are the building blocks of our entire digital economy and unfortunately, we are vulnerable now because we do not make enough leading edge semiconductors in America.”China is a net importer of semiconductors, largely from the US The country imported $350 billion in chips in 2020, an increase of 14.6% from 2019. But recent trade tension under President Trump has damaged the long standing relationship and spurred China to begin accelerating and prio rit izing its own chip-making programs. In 2020, the former president cut off Huawei Technologies, the number two smart phone maker in the world, from access to US chips in a fight over Beijing is industrial practices. The Trump administration also publicly considered imposing export restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, the largest manufacturer of semiconductors in China. The hostilities came as China promoted its Made in China 2025 initiative and Guidelines to Promote National Integrated Circuit Industry Development, which create financial incentives, intellectual property and antitrust standards to develop the Chinese semiconductor industry and end reliance on the US“What I most often get asked about is China,” said Raimondo. “The fact of the matter is we have to run faster in America, and that means investing in our innovation and tech and unleashing all the opportunity that we have here.”US semiconductors accounted for half of all global sales, or about$193 billion, in 2020, but only 12% of those chips are actually manufactured in the US So while the US still leads in design, supply-chain issues have become a problem and gives China a lot of leverage over the US In February, President Joe Biden issued an executive order to review America is industrial supply chain, partially to review why there was a shortage of production in the USs. “It is about making sure the re is a level playing field, so that we show every company can compete,” said Raimondo. But, more needs to be done to aid in research and development. “We have consistently fallen behind in terms of R&D as a percent of GDP,” she said. While Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and China invest billions annually in their semiconductor industries, the federal government has been slow to provide R&D funding and funding for domestic production. R&D now accounts for less than 1% of the US GDP but that would change under President Biden is infrastructure bill, which proposes $52 billion invested in domestic manufacturing and another $50 billion in R&D funding to focus on semiconductors and advanced computing. Still, Raimondo is weary. Even if the infrastructure bill were to pass as-is, $52 billion is not enough, she says. The money is just “a piece of the puzzle,” she told. But while it is “not nearly enough to do what we need to do,” she hopes it will be able to unlock and stimulate private sector investment to the tune of $100 billion in the production of semiconductors and job training. Stimulating that innovation and enhancing innovative competition, she said, “is the bedrock of our capitalistic system, the bedrock of what has made America great.”Subscribe to Fortune Dailyto get essential business stories straight to your in box each morning.",2,2,Fortune
634,Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy Claims Network Does not Spread Pro-Trump Lies—Despite All Evidence,-12.0,38.33,https://www.thedailybeast.com/newsmax-ceo-chris-ruddy-claims-network-doesnt-spread-pro-trump-lies-despite-ample-evidence,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-beast-bias-reliability/,2021-01-08,25,"In fact, Ruddy claimed to The Daily Beast, the right-wing outlet has so much journalistic integrity that it has pissed off President Trump in recent days. Donald Trump-friendly cable outletNewsmax—which has reaped massive ratings rewards for its refusal until recently to acknowledge Joe Biden as president-elect—has tried to exploit that stance by repeatedly airing bogus claims that Trump did not lose the election and that anti fa and Black Lives Matter, not a violent mob of Trump supporters, are to blame for Wednesday is lethal assault on the Capitol. At least one Newsmax commentator claimed after the mayhem—in which five people died, including a Capitol police officer—that George Soros was somehow involved.“Stop right here,” Newsmax majority owner and chief executive Christopher Ruddy admonished The Daily Beast on Friday when asked to explain his channel is enthusiastic platform ing of post-election falsehoods, especially in the aftermath of Wednesday is insurrection. “We have acted very properly on this. We condemned the violence almost from the minute it was happening in real time. We were saying every time somebody raised anti fa [that] we have no evidence they were involved at all.”Despite Ruddy is assertion, there are numerous examples in which Newsmax guests, paid contributors, anchors and correspondents have made specious claims with no such disclaimers. On Friday, for instance, former New York Police Commissioner and convicted felon Bernard Kerik, a promoter oft he election-related conspiracy theory that Trump is victory was stolen by a deep-state supercomputer named “Hammer,” told credulous Newsmax host John Bachman: “I was at the rally…but I can tell you that there were close to a million people on the Mall [a spectacular exaggeration] between where the president spoke and the Washington Monument, beyond the monument, and that area was completely peaceful.“Whatever happened, happened down at the Capitol, and I anticipate you are gonna see a lot of instigators and anarchists from Black Lives Matter and antifa,” Kerik continued. Instead of casting doubt, Bachman eagerly agreed.“Anybody who knows anything about these protests knows that there is a professional class of protestors,” he declared. “They have no ideology. They have no real morals. They do not really believe in anything other than tearing down the system.”Kerik, the recipient of a presidential pardon last year after serving prison time and pleading guilty to multiple counts of federal tax fraud and perjury, was only the latest Newsmax personality to go on air and spread sham conspiracy the ories—which in recent days have also included the Soros conspiracy by frequent guest CJ Pearson, a teenage Trump acolyte from Georgia.“George Soros [would] like to see in the final days of what looks like will be Joe Biden is quest to steal this presidency than to make it look like Joe—that Donald Trump is trying to wage some insurrection as the liberal media has said? It is absolutely nonsensical. It is a far departure from reality,” Pearson told highly rated Newsmax host Greg Kelly on Wednesday night,as first spotted byleft-leaning press watchdog organization, Media Matters for America. On the same show, Kelly mused: “We have heard about outside agitators all summer long with the Black Lives Matter protests that all the looting was done by, you know, foreign sources from some faraway place. Look, these do not look like Trump supporters. Trump supporters do not do these things.”On Thursday night, meanwhile, Kelly told viewers: “Sometimes the bank robber gets away with it. Joe Biden stole this election. You know it. I know it. Tens of millions of Americans agree with us… Donald Trump should not concede because he did not lose.”Also on Thursday, Newsmax anchor Grant Stinchfield hosted InfoWars personality DeAnna Lorraine, a QAnon acolyte who, among other interesting observations, has argued that Bill Gates is a space alien and Michelle Obama is a man.“I am so proud of… the people that went to the Capitol yesterday because we needed to do this,” she told Stinchfield. “We needed to show them that we care, that our Constitution matters, that our America, our country matters. This is a foreign, hostile takeover and you know it. I know it. And it is time that we step up and that we fight.”Lorraine went on: “Yesterday, we told the truth. We were there at the Capitol, we were peaceful protesting. The violence was only coming from the police towards us who were there. And yet they are spinning this disgusting narrative that we are at fault or that Trump is at fault and this was domestic terrorism. No it was not. It was us fighting for our country. And we have never, ever been more at risk of losing our country.”Ruddy argued that it is unfair to hold Newsmax accountable for giving free rein to those and other such baseless and reckless claims and Trump-reinforcing fever dreams.“We ca not control every guest that comes on Newsmax,” Ruddy said. “You are expecting that every guest that comes on CNN and MSNBC—we should hold them accountable for all the bats hit crazy things they said about Russian collusion over the years?... C amon. Is Newsmax responsible? Are we really pushing the anti fa thing? In all fairness! We have probably said three dozen times that we have no evidence that anti fa is involved.”Regarding Kerik is remarks, Ruddy added: “I do not know what Bernie Kerik said. He is the former police commissioner of the City of New York.” Kerik is criminal record “does not undermine the fact that he was the police commissioner and a law enforcement officer,” the Newsmax CEO said. “He has been completely pardoned for his crimes.”Ruddy added: “I do not see what the story is. I really do not.” He added that contrary to the general perception, Newmax has displeased Trump from time to time—including Ruddy is recent column arguing that his friend the president should concede and congratulate Biden—and has actually shown restraint in resisting such bogus claims as retracted story that facial recognition technology had identified anti fa activists among the rioters. Ruddy added that his friend Trump, with whom he has dined at Mar-a-Lago, where he is a longtime member, was upset when Newsmax started referring to Biden as “president-elect” on December 14 after the Electoral College certified his victory.“I can tell you Trump is not happy with Newsmax that we were calling Biden the president-elect,” Ruddy recounted, adding that he spoke to the soon-to-be ex-president over the holidays. “I said to him that we were accepting the constitutional process and thought that he should do that”—advice Trump rejected. Ruddy added that some Newsmax viewers have even complained about the channel is alleged journalistic conscientiousness. Newsmax is refusal to run the facial recognition story “has been fueling all the angst we are getting from our viewers hip that we are not covering this—that we are part of the coverup. And now you are calling me and saying we have been fueling it. No one else is arguing this.”On Wednesday, as the rampage at the Capitol drew to a close, Newsmax anchor Tom Basile fervently promoted the antifa/Black Lives Matter canard: “So that you have a complete picture of what is going on, the last couple of times we have seen these rallies, it has not just been the president is supporters. We have seen antifa, we have seen Black Lives Matter, we have seen other leftist groups that have tried to stir up violence.”Newsmax White House correspondent Emerald Robinson chimed in: “That is a great point, Tom, because I am hearing from some people on the ground that there is a question of, if anti fa has infiltrated the Trump rally-goers and are fomenting some kind of unrest.”MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, meanwhile, assured Newsmax viewers that Wednesday is riot was “very peaceful” and that there was “probably some undercover anti fa that dressed as Trump people and did some damage to windows and got in there.”Newsmax anchor Chris Salcedo concurred—“I have heard those reports, to o”—never mind that there were no such reports, at least not from news organizations. Ruddy, who prefers that Newsmax be described as “center-right conservative” instead of “right-wing,” vowed that his channel will cover the Biden administration from the perspective of “the loyal opposition,” not as an illegitimate president.“I actually like some of his Cabinet choices,” he said, mentioning attorney general-designate Merrick Garland and secretary of state-designate Tony Blinken.“I have heard that Blinken is a good guy,” he said.

Obtaining one required going in person to the court building to complete several pieces of paperwork, waiting around to see if a petition was granted, and the n finding out when a hearing would take place. The whole process could take all day. “It can be incredibly intimidating to file a personal protection order,” said Jeni Hooper, program coordinator of the community response team at First Step, an advocacy group in Detroit for survivors of domestic violence. The coronavirus has required court systems to adapt — and at a time when experts warn that social isolation, economic uncertainty, anda historic wave of gun-buyingare driving up domestic abuse. Calls to the Michigan Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violencewere up102 percent in March and the first half of April, compared to the same period last year. In Wayne County, officials accelerated plans to digitize the process for a personal protection order (PPO) as it is called locally. On April 17, three days before its courthouses closed to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, the Wayne County Circuit Courtlauncheda digital portal through which people can request ordersremotely. As part of the process, a petitioner can ask a judge to prohibit the respondent from purchasing or possessing a firearm. Themajority of state slack an automatic gun prohibition with an temporary pre-hearing order, even though experts warn that a failure to disarm abusers when an order is served exacerbates the risks for victims. Kathleen McCarthy, the presiding judge in the family division of Wayne County Circuit Court who spearheaded the e-filing program, said that when she was deciding whether to temporarily close the courthouse last month, her biggest concern was how domestic violence survivors would be able to get restraining orders. Growing up in a household with domestic violence had made her particularly attuned to the risks, she added. The pandemic “turned everything on its head and forced everyone to learn and to acquire the technology to do these things in a more up-to-date fashion,” McCarthy said. In 2018, Wayne County had the highest rate of reported domestic violence incidents by county in Michigan, according to a Trace analysis of the most recent available crime statistics from the Michigan State Police and population data from the US Census Bureau. When a state stay-at-home order started on March 24, officials and advocates in Michigan feared the problem would get worse. “A lot of times people need to get these personal protection orders and the person they need to get it against is still somewhere around the m,” said Shelly Drain, an assistant prosecuting attorney in Wayne County.“The pandemic puts survivors at a much more increased risk because they can be isolated with their abuser,” added Hooper. In April, the county registered a slight decline in reported incidents of domestic violence compared to the last year,according to an analysis of county data by theDetroit Free Press. But local crisis centers have reported an increase in calls about domestic violence in the same period compared to last year, a possible sign of underreporting. McCarthy says the e-filing system has been processing an average of 17 PPO applications per day, about the same volume that came through the old system in March. That is down from a pre-pandemic average of about 25 per day, she said. Researchshowsthat when an abuser has access to a gun, the risk of homicide becomes five time smore likely. Federal law bars convicted abusers and those subject to domestic violence protective orders from owning guns. But the law refers to permanent orders of protection that have been handed down by a judge, not orders that are served prior to a hearing. Twenty-one states either bar gun possession for people subject to a PPO before a hearing is held, or allow a judge to authorize a gun prohibition. Michigan falls into the latter category. Most of the time, Drain said, judges in Wayne County order a gun prohibition even if a petitioner has not asked for it. McCarthy added that all sitting judges in her jurisdiction must attend domestic violence training, where “it is clearly taught that removing guns from the household is the number one way, if you can, to prevent a fatality.”Thee-filing system makes it much easier for petitioners, whether in a pandemic or not, said Hooper, whose group is one of several domestic violence organizations available to help petitioners complete the process. They can file on behalf of a domestic violence survivor if that person is unable to access the forms themself. The courtwebsitealso makes it easier for petitioners to find court-approved process servers or send documents by certified mail. Georgea Cole, an advocate for victims with the Americorps Urban Safety Domestic Violence Program at Wayne State University, spends the vast majority of her time helping domestic violence survivors file for PPOs, including through the new system. Normally, she works out of police stations throughout Detroit, speaking with people who are referred by an officer or via a domestic violence hotline. She says working from home has hindered her ability to connect with survivors. “You ca not get that kind of refuge virtually,” she said. But for other survivors who are unable to get to a physical place of safe harbor, the online filing system offers potentially life-saving access — even without the pandemic or state of emergency. Cole said she thinks that the addition of online filing after the state reopens can allow for the greatest access possible for survivors whose circumstances restrict different resources.“We see both of the methods work,” Cole said. “But everything is not for everybody.”Wayne County is not the first place to add an e-filing system for personal protection orders. Macomb County in Michigan has had such a system in place since 2018. Prior to the coronavirus crisis, three states — Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin — allowed people to electronically file restraining order petitions directly to the court without having to visit a courthouse or meet with a legal advocate, according to an analysis of data from the National Center for State Courts. Since the pandemic began, others likeUtahhave also allowed temporary restraining order petitions to be emailed directly to the court. But online systems remain unusual. And that largely comes down to funding, said Rachel Teicher, director of intimate partner violence intervention at the National Network For Safe Communities. “It costs money to set up these systems and adopt them and make sure they are secure and that the process works,” said Teicher. But she said the investment is worth it. “It saves victims a lot of time and stress.”Wayne County officials hope that other jurisdictions might follow their lead. Said Drain, “It can really be rolled out everywhere.”",2,2,The Trace
636,"The Child Tax Credit Is a Proven Boost to American Families, So Why Are Conservative Democrats Trying to Stop It?",-24.0,28.67,https://www.counterpunch.org/2021/10/07/the-child-tax-credit-is-a-proven-boost-to-american-families-so-why-are-conservative-democrats-trying-to-stop-it/,https://adfontesmedia.com/counterpunch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-07,25,"American families have struggled for decades to make ends meet with wages simply not rising as fast as the cost of living and a government social safety net that has been so deeply decimated that the US nows pends less on children than nearly any other wealthy nation. This year there was a small glimmer of hope that such a trend might be halted and even reversed. Democrats, using their razor-thin control of the Senate and marginal control of the House,passed an expanded child tax credit(CTC) in March 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan that not only increased the tax refund received by families with young children but also began sending the ma monthly advance instead of making them wait until they filed their annual tax return. By any measure, the amounts are embarrassingly modest and only offer an increase of $1,000 to $1,600 over the entire year. Families whose incomes are low enough to qualify and have children aged 6 through 17 are now receiving $3,000 a year instead of $2,000, while those with children younger than 6 are getting checks that add up to $3,600 a year. Putting cash, however small an amount, into the hands of ordinary Americans is a win-win proposition for all but the most conservative pundits. As the 2020 CARES Act unemployment benefits—amounting to a $15 an hour wage—demonstrated, the economy as a whole is buoyed when people have more money in their pockets to spend on basic necessities. And, just as importantly, the benefits helped the most vulnerable, particularly Black and Latino workers, to stave off financial ruin. Now, the monthly CTC payments are already showing similar promise. The Center on Poverty and Social Policyat Columbia University documented “a notable drop in child poverty” after just the first month of payments. Additionally, the benefits are particularly helpful for Black and Latino children, who the center estimates have twice the poverty rate of white children. Still, because the CTC relies on tax returns filed in the previous year, white children benefited more than children of color as their families were “more likely to have filed taxes.”TheUS Census Bureaualso found that after just one month of payments, food insecurity among vulnerable families dropped significantly, and families receiving checks also had less difficulty paying for weekly expenses. So convincing are the expanded CTC is proven benefits that nearly 450 economists wrote an open letter to Congressurging them to extend the program. The CTC payments benefit roughly39 million American families who are currently receiving monthly checks of up to $300 per child per month. Meanwhile, the cost of child care in the US is exorbitant, averaging at about $1,300 per month for infants and nearly $900 per month for preschool-aged children. For families with multiple children and parents in low-wage jobs, child care is simply out of reach, and the modest CTC payments do not even come close to covering the costs. At the same time,child care workers are so underpaid that in the wake of the pandemic, more than 120,000 have simply quit their jobs nationwide. Even the US government is so concerned that theTreasury Department issued a report admitting that “the existing child care system in the USs, which relies on private financing to provide care for most children… fails to adequately serve many families.”This is not a new problem. In a2014 speech at the White House Summit on Working Families, former President Barack Obama acknowledged that, “in 31 states, decent child care costs more than in-state college tuition,” and that “there are other countries that know how to do child care well.”Child care is such an important factor for families with young children that the latestHarris Poll survey found that 76 percent of working parents felt that child care decisions were a major factor in their employment decisions. The cost of raising a child is estimated to be nearly a quarter of a million dollars—a sum that is wildly out of reach for low-income families. Combined with persistent wealth and income inequality, it is no wonder that, as per a recentCDC report, 2020 was “the sixth consecutive year that the number of births [in the US] has declined.”One 2009 study concluded that cheaper child care is the key to reversing falling birth rates. There are two simple ways to make child care cheaper: heavily subsidize the child care industry (the US government, after all, subsidizes fossil fuel and agricultural industries), or put more money into the hands of parents with children. Currently, the expanded CTC benefits are valid only for a year, and some Democrats want to make them permanent. But President Joe Biden wants them extended for only four years via a $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill called theBuild Back Better Act. And some conservative Democrats want to roll back the expanded benefit right away. Accountable. USidentifies nine House Democrats and two Senate Democrats opposing the extension of an expanded CTC Of these 11 naysayers, eight are millionaires. In spite of its clear benefits, the CTC is in very real political danger of being rolled back. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), who is one of its biggest proponents,said,“There is nothing bigger than this… if you just want to look at the impact of a child is life, this is the biggest thing that we are doing.” Indeed, it is hard to argue against helping vulnerable American children, but some Democrats like Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) are managing to do so as they stand in the way of the current iteration of the CTC Manchin in particular has adopted a posture far closer to the Republican way of thinking: that benefits aimed at wealthy interests are good for the nation, while benefits to vulnerable individuals are effectively “entitlements.” Using Republican-favoredbuzzwords, Manchin recently said that while he supports theCTC in theory, “anything that can be added should be means tested,” and that it is important that the US not turn into an “entitlement society.” Onecritic explained that “‘Means testing’ is just a nicer way to say, ‘We want people to jump through more hoops, so fewer people can get help.’”The West Virginia senator exudes such hubris in opposing his own party that in aNew York Timesinterview earlier this year, he essentially dared Democrats to try to oust him, saying, “What are they going to do, [are] they going to go into West Virginia and campaign against me? Please, that would help me more than anything.” With friends like Manchin, Republicans can sit out the discussion and have no clear policy position on the matter. With many progressive Democrats going on the defensive to protect the expansion of the CTC, some are going on the offensive in trying to get money into the hands of low-income and middle-income Americans by other means. Minnesota Democratic RepresentativeIlhan Omarin July introduced a guaranteed income bill that would ensure individuals making up to $75,000 a year receive $1,200 monthly checks. The SUPPORT Act, backed by progressive stalwarts such as Cori Bush (D-MO) and Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), includes running a pilot program initially to prove that monthly payments would have a positive impact on families. Such approaches embody the opposite of the trickle-down economic model long championed by many establishment economists in the face of progressive opposition. Now, the trickle-down model is so discredited that even Biden has explicitly rejected it. Rather than infusing the top tiers of society with money, tax breaks and subsidies, based on a fantasy that those riches will eventually reach the bottom tiers, policymakers are getting on board with direct benefits to vulnerable Americans. Whether or not the CTC survives Washington is political wrangling remains to be seen, even as tens of millions of Americans rely on it.

639,Plowshares Activists Pay Heavy Price For Resisting Nuclear Warfare,-32.67,31.67,https://shadowproof.com/2020/11/17/kings-bay-plowshares-activists-pay-heavy-price-for-resisting-nuclear-warfare/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-17,22,"Patrick O’Neill gripped the hammer tightly in his hands. The police would soon surround him. O’Neill and six other Catholic peace activists had infiltrated the Kings Bay Naval Base in St. Mary is, Georgia, with the goal of symbolically disarming the base is six Trident submarines armed with first-strike missiles capable of holding 200 nuclear warheads. Some of the activists strung up crime scene tape and hung protest banners that read “The Ultimate Logic of Trident is Omnicide.” Others poured baby bottles of their own blood around the base. Using Google Maps, O’Neill and Mark Colville discovered a macabre shrine to nuclear ism consisting of a half dozen statues of nuclear missiles that looked as if they were suspended in motion just seconds after launch. Staring up at a replica of a Trident D5 intercontinental ballistic missile, O’Neill is mind turned to the book of Exodus in the Bible: the shrine offered proof that nuclear weapons were modern-day idols more powerful than a golden calf. Unlike that empty signifier, the pacifist recognized the immutable power of nuclear weapons. For him, it was the same as worshipping death. Time was running short. O’Neill sprinted up to the statue and beat it with the hammer. The missile was solid cement and the hammerhead broke clean off.“It was a formidable idol,” recalled O’Neill. Catholic peace activists like the ones who infiltrated the naval base at Kings Bay in 2018 have attempted to topple the formidable idol of nuclear ism for 40 years, and they have paid a heavy price. Liz McAlister has already served 17 months behind bars and Father Steve Kelley continues to languish in a jail in Georgia. After spending more than 28 months under house arrest, O’Neill was slapped with a 14-month prison sentence in October. Carmen Trotta and Clare Grady will serve more than a year in prison, while Martha Hennessy expects to be incarcerated for 10 months. Mark Colville will be sentenced in December. On top of that, the activists are grappling with an establishment media blackout that they fear could be reflective of Americans’ apathy towards nuclear abolition at a moment when the threat of a nuclear holocaust is at its highest point in decades. O’Neill and the other Catholic peace activists knew they possessed neither the tools nor the numbers to physically disarm the nuclear naval base at Kings Bay. Rather, the goal of the Kings Bay action, like every Plowshares action dating back to the movement is inception, was to call attention to the omni cid al threat that nuclear weapons continue to pose for humanity. The Plowshares movement began in 1980 when Roman Catholic priests Philip and Daniel Berrigan and six others surreptitiously gained access to the Re-Entry Division at the General Electric Space Technology Center in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. Carrying only hammers and pints of their own blood to symbolize the human cost of nuclear war, the activists pounded on nose cones that covered Mark 12A nuclear warheads and poured the blood over engineering blueprints and other documents. As their objective was to convert weapons of war into instruments of peace, the activists dubbed the mselves the Plowshares Eight, a reference to a verse in the book of Isaiah in the Bible calling nations to “beat swords into plowshares.”The King of Prussia action captured the attention of the nation–thetocallit “one of the best-known antiwar incidents in this country since the Vietnam War”–and announced to the world the beginning of a bold new faction within the broader anti-war movement in the US that fused religion with non-violent direct action against nuclear weapons.“They were different. They were risky. They were costly,” said McAlister, a former Catholic nun and longtime Plowshares activist. Since 1980, dozens of Plowshares activists have repeatedly penetrated sites across the country ranging from military installations to missile silos and in the process laid waste to the idea that nuclear weapons could ever be stored safely. The 2018 infiltration of the naval base at Kings Bay is estimated to be the 100th Plowshares action. Legal trials and prison sentences that were sure to follow their acts of civil disobedience were viewed as opportunities for the activists to draw more attention to their cause and often revealed the extraordinary lengths the government took to suppress dissent among those who dared to confront the American war machine.“You could count on serious time as a consequence,” McAlister said. “And [the federal government was] consistent about seeing to it that we did that time.”McAlister and Philip Berrigan were excommunicated from the Catholic church after they married in 1973 but their social justice activism continued. McAlister said she avoided participating in Plowshares actions at the same time as her husband so that one parent could be home with their children. The couple estimated that they spent more than 10 years of their marriage separated by the carceral system. McAlister served another two and a half years, including jail time for the Kings Bay action, since Berrigan died in 2002. When Grady first heard about the King of Prussia action, her initial reaction was alarm at the personal risks that the activists undertook to broadcast their message out to the public. Her second reaction was skepticism that their actions, though brave, would lead to any concessions on the part of the American military-industrial complex. After some consideration, Grady realized, “Oh, our friends are not asking the US government to do anything. They are doing it the mselves.”Two years later, Grady joined McAlister and five others in penetrating the Griffiss Air Force Base in New York in order to gain access to a B-52 bomber, which were once outfitted to carry nuclear payloads that could be dropped onto the former Soviet Union. Base security did not appear until an hour after the activists started beating on the hanger doors, which incidentally were unlocked.“In 1983, when we hammered on the B-52 bomber and related parts, that plane was actually frozen for evidence for five months,” Grady said. “That is one of the few moments where nuclear weapons with these actions actually were disarmed. I am not sure that too many efforts could claim that at that moment.”The grassroots movement against nuclear weapons in the US reached a peak in 1982 when an estimated one million people converge din New York City for a massive demonstration. Grady remembered the thrill of being a part of the historic protest, which stands in stark contrast to the minority status that anti-nuclearism maintains today.“People were very much aware at that time of the danger of nuclear weapons,” Grady said. “Nowadays, very few people know about it and very few people are organizing around it.”The dearth of activism against nuclear weapons in the US coincides with a new nuclear arms race as measures designed to mitigate nuclear proliferation that took decades to stitch together are being dismantled piece-by-piece. The world is currently just 100 seconds away from global destruction, according to the Doomsday Clock created by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1947 as a way to remind people about the threat of nuclear annihilation. Here in the US, a new nuclear threat, one potentially more cataclysmic than the first, is currently underway. And not unlike the nuclear submarines that pass innocuously through the waters of Kings Bay in Georgia, it is happening right under the noses of the American public.“What has happened is the end of the Cold War and the disappearance of a single focused enemy with a peer competitor in the nuclear field,” Jessica T Matthews told. Matthews is the former president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.“Older people remember getting under their desks for nuclear drills when they were in elementary school and putting their coats over their heads. Growing up in the era of above-ground nuclear testing all the time. All that went away with the end of the Cold War and I think it seemed as though the threat of nuclear conflict went with it.”The USs ushered in the nuclear age in 1945 and despite deepening wealth inequality and skyrocketing unemployment resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, the country continues to spend billions of dollars to maintain its nuclear hegemony over the rest of the world. This new nuclear arms race is a reminder of how even in an era marked by entrenched partisan divisiveness, Democratic and Republican lawmakers remain united on maintaining America is nuclear supremacy regardless of the financial, environmental or human costs. In 2001, Republican President George W Bush withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, an arms control agreement dating back to the 1970s. President Obama, a Democrat, secured passage of the New START treaty limiting the number of nuclear weapons but only after he struck a deal with Congress to spend $100 billion to refit American nuclear facilities and labs. That plan has now turned into an across-the-board modernization of the country is nuclear apparatus, including the Trident II D5 nuclear missiles that are housed at the Kings Bay naval base, currently priced at $1.7 trillion, Matthews said. More than any other president, Trump seemed bent on turning the clock back to the 1950s when the country maintained more than 30,000 nuclear warheads and bombs in its stockpile, compared to roughly5,800weapons today. In May, Trump administration officials signalled their interest in breaking the 28-year moratorium on nuclear testing to get China and Russia to agree to arms limitations under the New START treaty, which expires in 2021. President-elect Joe Biden will likely extend the treaty but the result of all these infractions upon our already threadbare nuclear safety net amount to a running leap into a second nuclear arms race that is expected to continue regardless of who sits in the White House.“It is a train that is in motion and it is going to be very hard to slow it down or redirect it,” Matthews warned. So hard that barring any unforeseen conflicts that might actually bring us closer to the brink of nuclear war, Matthews is dubious that Plowshares actions and other grassroots organizing will be enough on their own to force the issue into the national discourse.“I think it is a really hard time for that to happen,” Matthews said. “If there were a confluence of events…if the [Trump] administration decided to test [nuclear weapons] and the n if Korea got hot, and if several things happened at once, I can imagine it. But I just do not think this is an issue whose time has come for public attention.”Calls to drop the charges against members of the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven elicited support from figures like Daniel Ellsberg, whistle blower and longtime anti-nuclear activist, along with religious leaders, including Reverend William J Barber of the revived Poor People is Campaign and former archbishop Desmond Tutu. Though he has not publicly commented on the legal fate of the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven, Pope Francis has embraced the Catholic peace activists’ once radical demand for the abolishment of nuclear weapons.“There is an urgent need to work for a world free of nuclear weapons,” Pope Francistoldthe UN in 2015, “in full application of the non-proliferation treaty, in letter and spirit, with the goal of a complete prohibition of these weapons.”Media coverage, meanwhile, has failed to keep pace. News about the Catholic pacifists’ bold act of nonviolent civil disobedience at Kings Bay and their subsequent trial appears predominantly in progressive or religious publications like the National Catholic Reporter. Mainstream outlets, including those in Atlanta and nearby Jacksonville, Florida, have steered clear of the Plowshares activists. The lack of coverage has prompted some Plowshares supporters to conclude the seven activists have become the victims of a media blackout. Journalist Jeremy Scahill recently gave voice to that concern following the recent sentencing of Kelley and O’Neill. Speaking in October on, Scahillslammedthe press’ refusal to cover the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven.“These Catholic peace activists, during the Trump administration, tried to confront that nuclear threat, and there was a total media blackout on the action that they did,” Scahill said. “And, you know, if we lived in a just society, the Kings Bay Plowshares activists’ trial would have been reported on as one of the most brave confrontations of the most dangerous aspect of this government, and particularly this administration.”O’Neill pointed to a 2019 hearing for the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven attended by the actor and Catholic activistMartin Sheen. Only one reporter from a local newspaper showed up to document Sheen is public show of support. Rather than a concerted effort by the media to suppress the activists, O’Neill fears that the lack of press coverage is instead a reflection of how complacent Americans have become after 75 years of living on hair-trigger alert. In the absence of sustained grassroots mobilization aimed at keeping the issue of nuclear abolition in the spotlight, O’Neill imagines news editors and journalists view the Plowshares activists as if they are political outliers or relics of a bygone era, with little incentive to cover them.“The media is not blacking us out,” said O’Neill. “They just made a conscious decision to say we are not worthy of coverage. It just says something about how relaxed people are about being under the shadow of the nuclear arms race.”The deadly coronavirus pandemic compounds what is sure to be an already arduous prison sentence, posing an additional threat for members of the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven, all of whom are more susceptible to COVID-19 since they are over the age of 60. In October, USs District Court Judge Lisa Godbey Wood sentenced O’Neill to 14 months in prison. Since he lives at a Catholic worker house in Garner, North Carolina, O’Neill told that he preferred to serve out his sentence close to home at the nearby federal prison in Butner even though it has become a hot spot for coronavirus infections. More people at Butner have died from COVID-19–26 prisoners and one staff member–than at any other federal federal correctional institution. Instead, O’Neill was ordered to report to the Elkton Federal Prison in Ohio. The facility was at the center of a COVID-19outbreakthat was so bad with one in four prisoners infected that it drew legal action from the ACLU So far, nine prisoners have died from the coronavirus. O’Neill said he is appealing the order but clearly both options pose a risk to his health. When asked about whether the Kings Bay action was worth losing his life over, O’Neill echoed the words of past Plowshares activists who saw a greater danger–in this case, the death of all living things–in not speaking out.“There are people in the world working to change the direction of the world, to move the world away from nuclear ism and the development of more nuclear weapons and we are very much in the minority right now,” O’Neill said. “But nonetheless, we are not acting in vain.”“If we had not gone to Kings Bay, people living in those communities there would never have given any thought to Kings Bay as being anything more than an employer, an economic boost. I think people now have to sort of think about things in a different light.”It is reasonable to think that at nearly 81 years old, McAlister is 17-month stretch for breaking into the naval submarine base at Kings Bay will be her last time behind bars for nonviolent civil disobedience. But McAlister knows just as well as anyone else that nuclear annihilation is not reasonable and she stopped short at saying definitively whether Kings Bay would be her last Plowshares action. McAlister acknowledged her concern that fewer people are willing to join the Plowshares movement than they were 40 years ago at the height of anti-nuclearism. But just as the threat of nuclear war has not subsided since the end of the Cold War, McCalister is hopeful that people of conscience will continue to fight for a nuclear-free world. A former nun, McAlister says she never would have dared to undertake the risks that Plowshares activists must take if it were not for her faith in God. She firmly believes that it was God performing “minor miracles” that facilitated the entry of dozens of Plowshares activists into highly secured nuclear facilities and enabled them to put their hands directly onto the doomsday machine.“These are the most deadly weapons in the world,” said McAlister. “How is it possible for somebody like me to walk right in and be right next to them and pour blood on them? Use a hammer on them? But I have done it a number of times and so have some of my friends and my husband.”“And please, God, others will continue to do it,” she said. One person who answered the call was Martha Hennessy. The 2018 infiltration of the Kings Bay naval base was her first Plowshares action, which makes her an anomaly among the other activists. Hennessy, though, is no stranger to the movement. In fact, she is the granddaughter of Dorothy Day, who was one of the principal driving forces behind the creation of the Catholic Worker movement in the 1930s. Growing up, Hennessy witnessed firsthand the evolution of the Plowshares movement under the guidance of Catholic peace activists like McAlister and the Berrigan brothers who dared to take a stand against the threat of nuclear armageddon even in the face of assured retribution from the federal government. Her decision to infiltrate the Kings Bay naval base in a defiant act of civil disobedience against the world is most powerful military came only after months of prayerful discernment, a kind of internal examination about what risks she was willing to take on behalf of her religious beliefs and moral convictions. The integrity of the Plowshares movement gave Hennessy the strength to take part in the Kings Bay action, a cohort that she believes will help her survive her 10-month prison sentence.“You know, walking onto a military base was not the first thing I wanted to do in this resistance work for nuclear abolition,” recalled Hennessy. “But the power of such an act can speak for itself and we had to bring the body of Christ there to the base.”“It is our obligation to speak out,” she proclaimed.",1,1,Shadowproof

641,Computer hackers stole thousands of Lightfoot administration emails. Here is a look at some of what they leaked online.,0.0,43.67,https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-lightfoot-administration-hacked-emails-closer-look-20210514-havyv352lfegrklmfi76a25wfi-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-tribune-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-05-14,25,"Hackers recently stole a cache of thousands of city of Chicago em ails that were electronically transferred from Mayor Lori Lightfoot is administration to the Jones Day law firm. City officials have declined to comment on individual hacked emails: “Reporting on materials compromised during a third-party vendor data transfer makes all of us less safe and encourages future bad actors to use nefarious means to gain information.”The hacked emails, now visible online, were sent or received by four former city employees over a two-year period and offer some insight into the inner-workings of the Lightfoot administration — how some decisions are made, who was involved and what they were thinking. Here is a closer look:‘Crap spot is putting it mildly, dude’Some of the em ails show Lightfoot advisers were at times stuck between the mayor and their own ideas on certain issues. One example of the administration is internal decision making involved Lightfoot is campaign promise of imposing civilian oversight on Chicago is police department. As a candidate,Lightfoot promised to pass a police oversight plan during her first 100 days in office but she has not yet introduced a proposal. Lightfoot has since backed away from a plan endorsed by the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability, that she once supported. Following last summer is civil unrest spurred by the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, political consultant Joanna Klonsky emailed top staff members just before 5 p.m. on Saturday, May 30. She said the mayor had requested a resolution condemning Floyd is death and calling for justice. Lightfoot officials began drafting the resolution over the weekend. At one point during the flurry of correspondence that followed, policy chief Dan Lurie said such a resolution should have a policy attached to it, not just words, or it might set the “wrong tone otherwise.”Lurie said the mayor is office should include a civilian oversight proposal, and asked former Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Susan Leefor her thoughts. “We cannot include GAPA,” she responded. Lurie said it is the “obvious policy response” that “everyone will ask” about, so a failure to commit on the issue in a resolution “might actually fail on votes and public opinion at the same time.”“We can say something vague about committing to the value of more civilian oversight but nothing specific about GAPA,” Lee countered. In response, Lurie said: “OK Realize you are in a crap spot Susan. Just voicing concern that this might not help things. But know she asked for it so I am cool sending it on with addition of some oversight language.”Her answer: “Crap spot is putting it mildly, dude.”On the evening of June 2, Lightfootgave a televised speech from her City Hall office and promised to implement a series of long-stalled police reforms, some of which had been languishing for years.

In March 2020, Lee asked Lightfoot is chief of staff Maurice Classen about the civilian oversight plan once supported by Lightfoot.“What should we do with GAPA? I know there is no bandwidth for this but if we do not do this in April, it is essentially dead for 2020 and probably 3 more years,” Lee wrote ahead of the April 2020 City Council meeting.“Not all deadlines are created equal.”How to respond to a federal consent decree which requires an overhaul of the Chicago Police Department, is an ongoing issue at City Hall. Officialsare often faulted for failing to meet deadlines though the city emphasizes it is improving. In one exchange between former deputy corporation counsel Caryn Jacobs and former Lightfoot deputy press secretary Pat Mullane, Jacobs took issue with the proposed plan to steer the narrative on efforts to catch up on missed consent decree deadlines. Jacobs suggested downplaying the deadline response issue.“Why would we emphasize the 55% failure rate? We want move away from these kinds of metrics. Indeed, in talking points that I wrote for the police, we say that not all deadlines are created equal,” she wrote.‘Indoor dining’Early in the pandemic, Lightfoot and Governor JB Pritzker repeatedly clashed in private on COVID-19 mitigation measures. They mostly presented a unified front in public. Behind the scenes, however, Lightfoot is City Hall team last summer considered defying Pritzker is indoor dining ban. Top staff members even scheduled a meeting to discuss how such a move would play out.“There has been some discussion that the City should permit indoor dining in restaurants, even if otherwise prohibited under state order. The purpose of this call is to discuss what it would mean for the City to do so and how this would be operationalized,” one staffer wrote in June 2020 to to p-ranking Lightfoot administration officials. The plan never came to fruition butLightfoot was publicly critical of the governor when he closed indoor dining again in the fall.“I am very, very focused on getting our restaurants reopened. If we look at the various criteria that the state has set, we are meeting most if not all of those. So that is a conversation that I will have with the governor,” Lightfoot said at a June news conference about the city is COVID-19 vaccine distribution sites. “But I want to get our restaurants and our bars reopened as quickly as possible.”‘Reforming these communities’One of former corporation counsel Mark Flessner is top deputies, Caryn Jacobs, was asked to weigh in on a statement about the mayor is position on aspects of police accountability and curbing violence in communities. In her note, she commented on “reforming these communities.”“I actually agree with the idea of reforming these communities. God knows values such as intact families, education, work ethic, religion, etc. are the building blocks of success in all societies,” she wrote. “As young people, we think this is old fashioned. As we mature, we see it is not only true, but that the alternatives lead to chaos.”gpratt@chicagotribune.comTwitter@royalpratt",1,2,Chicago Tribune
