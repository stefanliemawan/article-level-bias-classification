Burger King UKtweetedthe message around 9 a.m. local time on March 8. The company followed up with two additional tweets that unveiled a newscholarship program aimed at helping women pursue professional culinary careers. But critics argued the first tweet came across assexistandencouragedthose with chauvenisticideas about women. Someslammed Burger King for resorting to “clickbait” to grab attention.

Twitter/@BurgerKingUKBurger King UK caused an uproar by tweeting, “Women belong in the kitchen.”Twitter/@BurgerKingUKBurger King UK caused an uproar by tweeting, “Women belong in the kitchen.”Context is key and the original Burger King UK tweet triggered aswiftbacklashonline. Itstarted with the tweet, “Women belong in the kitchen.” Burger King immediately followed that with asecond tweet that read, “If they want to, of course. Yet only 20% of chefs are women. We’re on a mission to change the gender ratio in the restaurant industry by empowering female employees with the opportunity to pursue a culinary career.” The account included the hasht ag “IWD” for International Women’s Day. It took nearly another two hours before Burger King UKspecifically mentioned thescholarship in a third tweet:“We are proud to be launching a newscholarship programme which will help female Burger King employees pursue their culinary dreams!”This tweet has 22,000 retweets. Your reply tweet has 1,000 retweets. This is why usingsexist remarks as bait is a dumb, dumb idea. The majority of people are notseeing your positive reply. They are justseeing asexist comment made by a brand account.— Ryan Brown 🎮 (@Toadsanime)March 8, 2021As of this writing, the original tweet had been retweeted more than 300,000 times and generated more than 52,000 replies and nearly 600,000 “likes.” Thesecondary tweets received far less attention. Your marketing team need to have a long hard look at themselves. On a day that weshould be empowering women, you’ve manage to create more engagement postingsuch a derogatory tweet. I get the wholesentiment behind the bigger thread… but this postshouldn’tstand alone.— **Rachel** (@Rachelerella)March 8, 2021A Burger Kingspokeswoman, Adrianna Lauricella, explained to theWashington Postin an emailedstatement that the company realized in hindsight that the company may have distracted from its intended message by choosing to release the information inseparate tweets:We are committed to helping women break through a male-dominated culinary culture in the world’s fine dining restaurants — andsometimes that requires drawing attention to the problem we’re trying to help fix. Our tweet in the UK today was designed to draw attention to the fact that only asmall percentage of chefs and head chefs are women. It was our mistake to not include the full explanation in our initial tweet and have adjusted our activity moving forward because we’resure that when people read the entirety of our commitment, they willshare our belief in this important opportunity. GettyBurger King. GettyBurger King. Thescholarship program the Burger King UK Twitter account was promoting is actually taking place in the USs. It’s called the Helping Equalize Restaurantsscholarship or HE R. program. According to the Burger King Foundation website, at least two women will receivescholarships of $25,000 each that can be used for accredited culinary programs. Burger King employees who have worked at the restaurant for at leastsix months are eligible to apply and need to have plans to enroll in a culinary institute or program for the 2022-2023school year. Applicants also need to have earned a highschool diploma or GED to be eligible. Burger King also bought advertisingspace in the print edition of the New York Times to promote thescholarship. According to AdWeek,the Times advertisement included the “women belong in the kitchen” headline but added the following language: “Fine dining kitchens, food truck kitchens, award-winning kitchens, casual dining kitchens, ghost kitchens, Burger King kitchens. If there’s a professional kitchen, women belong there.”Why would we delete a tweet that’s drawing attention to a huge lack of female representation in our industry, we thought you’d be on board with this as well? We have launched ascholarship to help give more of our female employees the chance to pursue a culinary career.— Burger King (@BurgerKingUK)March 8, 2021In the Twitter thread, Burger King wrote that only 20% of chefs are women. According toData USA,which compilesstatistics based on government datasuch as census information, about 77% of chefs and head cooks in the USs were men as of 2019. It also found that women earned, on average, about $10,000 less than their male counterparts. NPR reported in 2018 that among restaurants in the USs, only about 7% of those businesses had lead chefs who were female. It’s asimilarsituation across the pond. The Guardianreported in 2016 that women accounted for about 18.5% of professional chefs in the United Kingdom. Thesestatistics may account for why Burger King decided to keep the “women belong in the kitchen” tweet on its thread despite the criticism. KFC Gaming commented on the original tweet with a mem e that read, “The best time to delete this post was immediately after posting it. Thesecond best time is now.”Burger King responded, “Why would we delete a tweet that’s drawing attention to a huge lack of female representation in our industry, we thought you’d be on board with this as well?

3,Out of the Shadows: New York Legalizes Adult-Use Marijuana,-6.67,46.33,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/03/31/out-of-the-shadows-albany-legalizes-marijuana-in-new-york/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-31,17,"Albany was all about cannabis on Tuesday, with New York lawmakers debating the issue across three committee meetings, a few more hours in thesenate, and a marathon, almostseven-hoursession in the assembly. This morning, Governor Andrew Cuomo tweeted that he hadsigned the three-way deal, theMarijuana Regulation and Taxation Act. For hours on Tuesday, State Senator Liz Krueger passionately defended theseven years of effortshe’d devoted to New York’s legalization plan leading up to its 40-23 victory in the Senate. In the Assembly, Majority Leader Crystal D Peoples-Stokes oversaw the day-long defense of the effort. Late in the day doubters in thesenate formed whatseemed like a firing line to pepper Krueger with thesame questionsshe’d heard for the better part of a decade of working on the issue.#BREAKING: I justsigned legislation legalizing adult-use cannabis. The bill creates automatic expungement of previous marijuana convictions that would now be legal. This is a historic day. I thank the Leader and Speaker and the tireless advocacy ofso many.— Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo)March 31, 2021The Governor would applaud the efforts of Albany’s cannabis champions in an eveningstatement prior tosinging. “Tonight, the New York State Legislature took the firststep in a major leap forward for the Empire State by passing legislation to legalize adult-use cannabis,” Cuomosaid. “I thank Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, and the many legislators who worked tirelessly on this issue forsecuring passage of this historic legislation.”Cuomo went on to offer a final reminder of New York’s troubled past with cannabis enforcement on the eve of putting hissignature on the bill. “For too long the prohibition of cannabis disproportionately targeted communities of color with harsh prisonsentences and after years of hard work, this landmark legislation provides justice for long-marginalized communities, embraces a new industry that will grow the economy, and establishessubstantialsafety guards for the public,” hesaid. But the road to get to those congratulations yesterday was a long one. During the debate in the Senate, State Senator Fred Akshar was Kreuger’s firstsparring partner. Hestarted by questioning the bill’sstated intention to reduce violent crime. How would it accomplish this? Krueger quickly pointed to the reality that much of the drug trade in New York is currently controlled by violent criminals.“When people go to buy their marijuana they don’t know who it is they’re buying from, there’s no licensing. They don’t know if they’re organized crime,” Kruegersaid. “They don’t know if thatsame person isselling other much more dangerous drugs.”While Kreuger did not claim the bill as a fix-all to criminal elements currently involved in the cannabissupply chain,she argued that its provisions will help. “I do think that people will choose within the two options, an illegal dangerous option, and a legal regulated option, to buy marijuana through our legal regulated options,”shesaid, pointing to the resources that would remain after legalization to targetserious threats tosociety. “We expect to actuallysave up to $500 million in our criminal justicesystemsimply because we have legalized marijuana. So we won’t be using our police to pick up kids.”Akshar went on to question Kreuger on whethershe’d been in the room for the final negotiations between the Assembly, Senate, and Governor. Shesaid most of it had been left tostaff, butshe had been readily available at all hours to provide input to everyone taking part in that negotiating process until the deal got done. The conversation turned to who else was in the room for that final language deal. Akshar wanted to know if mental health professionals,substance use disorder professionals. Parent-Teacher associations,school leaders, or police officers had aseat at the table.“The answer is yes,” Kreuger replied and went on to point out how all the years at the table with those groups informed the final language. ”And it was mesometimes, and it wasstaff. This bill has been percolating into a bigger and bigger, and changed —and I believe better bill —for overseven years.”Kreuger reminded everyone that whenshe first introduced the bill in late 2013, everyone thoughtshe was crazy. Andshesaid that maystill be the case. “But the fact is we had hearings, we took meetings, endless, endless meetings with anyone who asked us. We met at the local level. I would go out to people’s communities if they invited me there to talk about their concerns. So, in truthfulness, I’m notsure I have ever met with as diverse a group of people as I did over theseven years that my Chief of Staff and I were working on thisstuff.”Kreuger mentioned advertising restrictions and other ways to avoid appealing to children as early and easy concessions to PTA groups. Also important was leaving room for municipalities to locally opt-out of thestate’s legalization plan, with the option to jump into the mix when theysee fit. For much of the time, the debate in both houses centered around the impact on law enforcement. Across New York law enforcement there are only a few hundred drug recognition experts. Part of the argument revolved around law enforcement needing money up front to get more DREs, despite the fact that the current number has already beenserving New York’s millions of cannabis users, most of whom are now expected to transition to the legal market. Despite the lack of cash upfront, Kreuger argued there’s asignificant amount of resources committed to makesure we have more local police andstate troopers who are trained in theskills to evaluate drivers intoxicated with marijuana and getting them off the road. More understanding of the financial aspects of that process would arise as the enforcement mechanisms are developed in the next 18 months before the market opens. Kreuger also pointed to the governor’s office commitment that police have the resources they need to combat impaired driving. But again, Kreuger kept things realisticsaying the DRE topic was important asshe addressed these question: “I don’t want anyone listening to us to imagine that we’restarting today from a place where there is zero marijuana being used by people who drive cars, because it is being used, and they are driving throughout thestate of New York.”Eventually, Senator Anthony Palumbo queried Kreuger on a variety of topics that included what happens to parents who use weed compared to alcohol use in child custodysituations; the five-pound limit around homegrown pot; and police not being allowed tosearch a vehiclesolely based on thesmell of burnt marijuana. Kreuger explained that there was indeedsome confusion on the five-pound limit when talking about the gross weight of the plants compared to the usable marijuana. “The five-pound example wasn’t actually a great example,” Kreugersaid. “But you might haveseveral ounces of usable marijuana in your home. That isn’t evidence that you’re using it every day. That’s not evidence that you’re using it at all, actually. So just like, I guess insome people’s houses they have cases and cases of wine or beer or otherspirits. That’s not evidence of anything other than they have a lot of bottles of liquor in their home.”Another part of the bill Kreuger was questioned on came in regards to law enforcement being forbidden to cooperate with federal authorities on nowstate-legal cannabis crimes. The opposition, like that in 15states before it, argued this lack of compliance with the federal law was asetup for failure. Kreuger compared it to law enforcement not cooperating with ICE deportation efforts in recent years.“I think it’s a fairly parallelsituation, and every once in a while, you hear astory coming out, andsomething gets resolved or not, but I don’t think it’s been a huge issue,” Kreugersaid, “And I don’t think it’s been a real issue in any of the other 15states that have legal marijuana, even though they’re under thesame federal laws we are.”Senator George Borrello began with concerns that the cannabis industryseemingly wouldn’t be asstrict as the hospitality business in NY Borrello explained he was deeply versed in the licensingstructure meant to prevent theshady figures of New York’s past from operating liquor establishments, pointing out that a felony was almost a guaranteed rejection. He asked if the bill would really let people with drug dealing felonies operate in the legal market.“Yes, and of course a major portion of this bill is to expunge the records of people who got caught up in the criminal justicesystem involved with cannabis,” Kreugersaid, basically asserting if those convictions don’t exist anymore they can’t have an impact on licensing. “So our goal is to expunge the records of people who had cannabis convictions and open them up to be able to be full citizens where they can apply to actually work legally in this business. Where they have no risk of problems with getting an education because they had a cannabis record, or being able to apply for certain kinds of jobs, or being able to live in certain places. So yes, part of the goal of this law is to ensure that people who may have been participating in an activity that was illegal will now be able to become taxpayers, owners, work instores, etc.”Borrello pressured Kreuger on whether peopleselling other drugs or with gun charges would qualify, offenses that wouldn’t get caught up in a mass expungementsweep. Kreugersaid the agency handing out licenses determines whether they believe they can be a trustworthy, reliable business person in this field and ifso then they will be allowed. And it will be through a regulatory process and evaluation. Borrello went on to ask how restaurants would be protected from edibles, adding that he has numerous concerns. “That’s because as an operator, I am responsible for you beingsober. I’m responsible for your intoxication level yetsomeone can walk in with a handful of very potent gum mi es and consume them on-premise.” He proposed asituation in which people would head to bars to consume edibles, and he asked what would happen if they were to “leave that establishment, get into an accident and killsomeone. In thatscenario, especially with the restaurant restrictions that we now have where, you know, these people are going to be… it’s gonna be difficult tostop these people because of all the freedom that they’re going to have to consume and drive.”“Well, the irony is that exists right now,” Kreuger replied, “We don’t know whensomebody comes in your bar, whether they have used marijuana before they got there, or popping other illegal drugs or not. They are wandering around the world they’re using what they use. Andso we faced this risk and reality today.”Although legislators argued until 10 PM, Kreuger finally triumphed when the bill wassent to the Governors desk. Twelve hours later cannabis possession became legal in NY with the Governor’s tweet. Various advocates weighed in on this historic day. Empire State NORML Deputy Director Troy Smitsaid, “Westand on theshoulders of giants. It’s taken a great amount of work and perseverance by activists, patients, and consumers to go from being the cannabis arrest capital of the world to lead the world with a legalized market dedicated to equity, diversity, and inclusion.”Smit admitted things weren’t all positive, but there is plenty to work with. “This might not be the perfect piece of legislation, but today, cannabis consumers can hold their heads high andsmell the flowers,” Smitsaid. “Senator Krueger and Assemblywoman Peoples-Stokes have laid the groundwork for marijuana justice and a consumer-centric industry. Now, it’s time for the Office of Cannabis Management to take up their torch and implement regulations that protect patient and consumer rights. In the words of our late Director, Doug Greene — Cannabis Excelsior!”NORML’s national leadership also weighed in on the big victory. “These votes are historic because theysignal the beginning of the end of the racially discriminatory policies that have long made the Empire State the marijuana arrest capital of the USs, if not the world,”said Erik Altieri, NORML Executive director. “Once enacted, this measure will end the practice of annually arresting tens-of-thousands of New Yorkers for low-level marijuana offenses, the majority of whom are overwhelmingly young, poor, and people of color.”The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) represents workers in New York’s medical cannabis industry. RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum and John Durso, President of Local 338 RWDSU weighed in on the new opportunities for working-class New Yorkers. “Today, in passing the Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act, the New York State legislature took enormousstrides toward ending the decades-long war on drugs and its discriminatory impact on people of color,” Appelbaumsaid. “The legislature listened to calls by workers and advocates to create an industry centered on equity. From the creation of asocial equity fund to requiring labor peace for cannabis license holders, this places New York on the forefront ofsocial equity nationally. We thank the legislature for prio rit izing the needs of workers and the community and look forward toswiftsignature into law.”Dursospoke to how important he believes organized labor will be in helping New Yorkers get the most out of the forthcoming pot industry. “Local 338, New York’s cannabis union, has organized almost 500 workers in the medical cannabis industry in New York,settingstandards across the industry that benefit workers and their families,” Dursostated. “Our contracts in the medical cannabis industry have established full-time careers with family-sustaining wages, affordable and quality health care, workplace health andsafetystandards, funding for retirement, and more.” He added,“It is our priority that the 30,000-60,000 jobs created in our State’s adult-use industry meet thesamestandard as those in the medical cannabis industry. The MRTA will help to do just that, by ensuring access to opportunity at every level of this brand-new industry, including for the thousands of New Yorkers who will be entering it as workers.” ❖More:cannabisNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

Thestates have already certified their results. The electors are not committing a crime when they collectivelystate that two plus two equals four or morespecifically 306 equals President Biden.

That is not how anything works. This is not a hostile takeover of a corporation or even fantasy football. The popular vote winner of eachstate is presidential election receives the allotted electoral votes. That is the existing law. Enough with the attempted coups. The anti-anti-Trump brigade — those who do not especially like Trump but hate liberals more — argue that Trump is refusal to accept the results of a free and fair election is no different from 2016 is hasht ag #Resistance movement. Yes, theso-called“Hamilton Electors"" wanted to deny Trump the White House through the Electoral College, but Hillary Clinton, who conceded the morning after Election Day,had nothing to do with this. More importantly,she was not an incumbent president desperately clinging to power. The Hamilton Electors also did not try to install a defeated Clinton as president but a moderate Republican “compromise"" candidate, which is a classic Democrat move. States tightened up laws against faithless electors after 2016so instead of chargingsomeone a measly $1,000 after the fact for a failed coup, thestates can remove the faithless elector and replace them withsomeone who will respect the will of the people, no matter how dumb. TheSupreme Court upheld these laws in a unanimous ruling. Trump is unhinged tweets and Miller is elector cosplay can not change the law or the results of the presidential race. However, they do promote the dangerous fiction that the election is notsettled. Trump tweeted after his (second) Supreme Court loss that “We have just begun to fight."" Hissupporters, who exist in an alternate reality of Trump is own design, are heeding his call, and his incendiary rhetoric, which Republicans ignore and enable, has put a target on the electors' backs. Thereports:In Michigan, Democratic electors have been promised police escorts from their cars into the State Capitol, where on Monday they will formally vote for Joseph R Biden Jr. In Arizona,state officials are holding the vote at an undisclosed location forsafety reasons, far from what is expected to be a heated hearing on election integrity issues that Republicans will conduct in the Statehouse. Even in Delaware, the tiny, deeply Democratic homestate of the president-elect, officials relocated their ceremony to a college gymnasium, asite considered to have bettersecurity and public health controls.

Martin Luther King Jr. famously laid out a vision for harmony between white and Black people 57 years ago, hisson issued asobering reminder about the persistence of police brutality and racist violence targeting Black Americans.“We must never forget the American nightmare of racist violence exemplified when Emmett Till was murdered on this day in 1955, and the criminal justicesystem failed to convict his killers,”said Martin Luther King III,speaking to thousands that gathered Friday to commemorate the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.“Sixty-five years later (after Till’s murder), westillstruggle for justice — demilitarizing the police, dismantling mass incarceration, and declaring as determinately as we can that Black lives matter,” Kingsaid. Even in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, many felt compelled to join civil rights advocates in Washington to highlight ascourge of police and vigilante violence that gave way to what many feel is an overdue reckoning on racial injustice. Somestood insweltering temperatures in lines thatstretched forseveral blocks, as organizers took temperatures as part of coronavirus protocols. Organizers reminded attendees to practicesocial distancing and wear masks throughout the program, although distancing was hardly maintained as the gathering grew insize. They gathered following anothershooting by a white police officer of a Black man — this time, 29-year-old Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last Sunday —sparking demonstrations and violence that left two dead. As peaceful protests turned to arson and theft, naysayers of the Black Lives Matter movement issued calls for “law and order.”The Rev. Al Sharpton, whose civil rights organization, the National Action Network,plannedFriday’s commemoration, had a message for naysayers.“Somesay to me, ‘Rev. Al, y’all ought to denounce those that get violent, those that are looting,’” Sharptonsaid. “All of the families (of victims of police and vigilante violence) have denounced looting. What we haven’t heard is you denounceshooting.”Sharpton asked, “We willspeak against the looting, but when will youspeak against wrong policeshooting?”Sharpton and Kingstood with relatives of an ever-expanding roll call of victims: Blake, George Floyd, Breonna Taylor, Rayshard Brooks, Ahmaud Arbery, Trayvon Martin, and Eric Garner, among others. Arbery and Martin both were killed by white men who pursued them with guns and whose arrests were delayed until residents protested.“There are twosystems of justice in the USs,”said Jacob Blake Sr., the father of the man whoseshooting by police in Kenosha left him paralyzed from the waist down. “There’s a whitesystem and a blacksystem -- the blacksystem ain’t doingso well.”Subscribe to our free DayStarter newsletterWant more of our free, weekly newsletters in your inbox?“No justice, no peace!” he proclaimed. Philonise Floyd, the brother of George Floyd,stared out at the massive march audience andsaid he wished his brother was there tosee it. Friday’s marchshaped up to be the largest political gathering in Washingtonsince the pandemic began. Many attendees wore T-shirts of the late Rep. John Lewis who, until his death last month, was the last livingspeaker at the original March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. It went on to become one of the most famous political rallies in US history, and one of the largest gatherings with over 200,000 people in attendance. Organizerssaid they intended toshow the urgency for federal policing reforms, to decry racial violence, and to demand voting rights protections ahead of the November general election. A handful ofsatellite marches were held in South Carolina, Florida, Nevada, Utah and Colorado. Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris, in a video,said the original conveners would be disappointed that Black Americans arestill marching for justice and equality under the law.“I have to believe that if they were with us today, they wouldshare in our anger and frustration as we continue tosee Black men and womenslain in ourstreets, and left behind in our economy and justicesystem that has too often denied Black folks our dignity and rights,”shesaid. Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted hissupport for the march. Although President Donald Trump did not comment on the march Friday, the Republican National Committee marked the event’s anniversary by highlighting the president’s record as a “champion for the Black community.”“While there is more work to be done, Donald Trump is the leader to make it happen,” Paris Dennard, an RNCsenior communications advisor,said in astatement. Activist Frank Nitty, whosaid he walked 750 miles for 24 days from Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to Washington for Friday’s march,spoke to the audience about persistence in the fight for justice.“Are y’all tired? Because I’m tired,” Nittysaid. “They think this is a negotiation, but I came here to demand change. My grandson ain’t gonna march for thesame things that my granddaddy marched for.”Navy veteran Alonzo Jones-Goss, 28, who traveled from Boston to participate in the march,said the nation hasseen far too many tragic events that claimed the lives of Black Americans and other people of color, and “that needs to come to an end.”Following the rally, participants marched to the Martin Luther King, Jr. memorial in West Potomac Park, next to the National Mall, and then dispersed. Some participants headed toward Black Lives Matter Plaza, right outside of the White House, which was renamed from Pennsylvania Avenue during protests in June. Chants of “Black lives matter” and “No justice, no peace” echoed through downtown Salt Lake City Friday morning, as about 200 people marched from thestate Capitol to Washington Square Park for Utah’s March on Washington.“If peoplestill can’tsee why we’re out here and why we’re marching and why people are loud and angry then they’re blind,”said Joshua Chamberlain, a realtor from Holladay, Utah. “There’s racism happening every day and -- especially by police brutality -- people are dying from it.”In Colorado,several dozen people rallied at a prominentstatue of Martin Luther King Jr. in Denver’s City Park. Democratic US Sen. Michael Bennet cited the names of George Floyd, Elijah McClain and victims of police brutality.“You know and I know what happened to them would never happen to me,”said Bennet, who is white. Sharpton instructed those in otherstates to march on their USsenators’ offices and demand theirsupport for federal policing reforms and reinvigorated voter protections, in Lewis’ memory. In June, the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives passed the George Floyd Justice In Policing Act, which would ban police use ofstranglehold maneuvers and end qualified immunity for officers, among other reforms. A Republican-authored police reform bill, introduced in June by South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, who is Black, failed a procedural vote in the Senate because Democrats felt the measure didn’t go far enough to address officer accountability. In July, following Lewis’ death, Democraticsenators reintroduced legislation that would restore a provision of the historic Voting Rights Act of 1965 gutted by the US Supreme Court in 2013. The law previously requiredstates with a history of votersuppression toseek federal clearance before changing voting regulations. Both measures are awaiting action in the Republican-controlled Senate. Associated Press article by Aaron Morrison, Kat Stafford and Ashraf Khalil",2,2,Tampa Bay Times

The peer-reviewedstudyshows the US is the largest producer of plastic waste. Thestudy notes that American citizens may rank as high as third globally when it comes to coastal plastic pollution. Datasuggests that more than half of the plastic collected for recycling in the US has been exported to developing countries that are alreadystruggling to manage plastic waste adequately, effectively masking the US is brutal contribution to plastic waste. The analysis found that US plastic waste input into its coastal environment was between 0.51 and 1.45 million metric tons. Despite comprising only 4% of the global population, the USs is responsible for 17% of its plastic waste.

7,Census misses create worries of Hispanic undercount,-6.33,45.33,https://www.rollcall.com/2021/04/29/census-misses-create-worries-of-hispanic-undercount/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-29,23,"Joseph Garciaspent months working to ensure that Hispanic residents of Arizona got counted in last year’s decennial census. After this week’s release of the firstset of results, he worries the governmentstill missed thousands of them. Arizona, along with Texas and Florida — otherstates with large Hispanic populations — fellshort of expectations in Monday’s reveal of census data, resulting insmaller gains in congressionalseats than projected, or none at all. Historically, the census has missed portions of Hispanic communities,shortchanging them on representation and in millions of dollars in federal programs,said Garcia, executive director of the advocacy group Chicanos por la Causa Action Fund.“I just don’t want everyone to focus on ‘Oh, we didn’t get another congressionalseat’; the harm is much deeper than that,” Garciasaid. “It’s compounding because it’s going to be year after year after year over the next decade of less funding for all theseservices, which are really needed by many people.”In addition to apportionment, census results are used to draw legislative maps and help guide more than $1.5 trillion in federalspending every year. However, it’s uncertain at this point how many people the census process may have missed. During Monday’s reveal of the results, Census Bureau officials cautioned the apportionment totals did not include any demographic information. Additionally, they pointed out the population forstatessuch as Texas and Florida came within 1 percent of the projections it previously made. Multiple expertssaid it could be months before the public gets a better picture of the accuracy of the 2020 census. Detailed redistricting information that will include race and ethnicity data isslated for release over thesummer. Even the Census Bureau itself doesn’t know at the moment — much of the accuracy assessment for the count is based on a post-countsurvey the agency will complete by next year. In 2010, the Census Bureau’s post-enumerationsurvey indicated the agency may have under counted the Hispanic population by as much as 1.5 percent nationwide. Tom Wolf,senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law,said assessing potential under counts is “really astory that is going to be compiled over the next year.”However, he pointed out there are “allsorts of factors that would trend toward decreasing the quality and equity of the count” that couldshow up in later data releases. White Housespokeswoman Jen Psaki referred questions about a potential under count of the Hispanic population to the Census Bureau during a news briefing Tuesday. She noted, though, the Biden administration reversed the Trump administration’s effort to exclude undocumented immigrants from apportionment data and gave the agency extra time to finish the census results. Redistricting expert Kim Bracesaid Monday’s population results revealed the potential for asignificant under count of the Hispanic population nationwide. It will take more data to know forsure, hesaid, but if there are undercounts, it will make it harder to draw fair congressional and legislativeseats in the coming months.“My gut tells me” that Hispanics who “got turned off by the Trump administration’s actions and the citizenship issue probably did not participate in the census. That doesn’t bode well for redistricting,” Bracesaid. Arturo Vargas, CEO of the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Education Fund, found it “surprising” thatstates with large Hispanic communities fellshort of projections.“Once more details are released, we will be able to better determine to what extent the Latino population was fairly and accurately counted,” Vargassaid in astatement. Still, half of the 10states with the highest Hispanic populations — California, Illinois, New Mexico, New Jersey and New York — beat the Census Bureau’s earlier estimates of their population growth. All five hadsignificantstatewide efforts to boost census participation, including a campaign of more than $180 million funded by California, whichstill lost a congressionalseat. Vargas’statement noted those efforts may have made a difference in beating estimates, however. The other fivestates with large Hispanic communities — Texas, Nevada, Florida, Arizona and Colorado — all came in under Census Bureau projections. Arizona had the largest miss in the country, with its population count coming in more than 3 percent below the Census Bureau estimate. Vargas had previously criticized the Trump administration for its failed attempt to include a citizenship question on the census and for attempting to exclude undocumented immigrants from the apportionment process. Before the actual head countstarted, his organization released multiplesurveys that found more noncitizen and undocumented immigrant respondentssaying they would not respond to the census than the general public. As many as three-quarters of respondents in thosesurveys expressed concerned about what the Trump administration would do with census responses. Those concerns alsosurfaced in multiple lawsuits over the Trump administration’s actions and amid congressional oversight efforts. Federal law prevents the disclosure of census responses, and Census Bureau advertisements and outreach materials included that fact. However, the pandemic complicated in-person outreach and efforts to convince people to respond on their own by mail or online, Garciasaid. He and other advocates had to pivot plans to convince people to respond in person to census door-knockers trying to find residents who failed to respond on their own. That added to the difficulty of convincing people frightened by the Trump administration’s attempt to add a citizenship question to the process, Garciasaid.“It was a perfectstorm, and I think itshould be pointed out that Donald Trump artificiallyseeded the clouds on that perfectstorm,” Garciasaid.",2,2,Roll Call

US officials whospoke toForeign Policyindicated that the consulate closure is a response to asurge in Chinese espionage in the USs. The Trump administration ordered the closure of the Chinese consulate in Houston by Friday, asignificant diplomatic escalation between the two rival powers. US officials whospoke toForeign Policyindicated that the consulate closure is a response to asurge in Chinese espionage in the USs. Washington directed the closure of the consulate “to protect American intellectual property and Americans’ private information,” State Departmentspokesperson Morgan Ortagussaid on Wednesday. Ortagus did not cite aspecific incident that prompted the move, butshe raised accusations that China violated USsovereignty. The closure was announced after asweeping indictment was unsealed in federal court in Washingtonstate outlining years of Chinesestate-directed hacking and theft of intellectual property affecting victims across the USs and in other countries.“The USs will not tolerate the PRC’s violations of oursovereignty and intimidation of our people, just as we have not tolerated the PRC’s unfair trade practices, theft of American jobs, and other egregious behavior. President Trump insists on fairness and reciprocity in US-China relations,” Ortagussaid, referring to the People’s Republic of China. Chinese officials have vowed retaliation, raising the likelihood that a US consulate in China will be forced closed in response. “The US has far more diplomatic missions andstaff working in China. So if the US is bent on going down this wrong path, we will resolutely respond,” Wang Wenbin, a foreign ministryspokesman,said to reporters on Wednesday. Reutersreportssuggest that the US consulate in Wuhancould be closed in retaliation. How China chooses to retaliate could determine whether thesituationspirals,said Larry Pfeiffer, whoserved as CIA chief ofstaff under former CIA Director Michael Hayden. “If they want to keep it from escalating then picking a place like Wuhan wouldn’t be a bad one,”said Pfeiffer, noting that US diplomats were already evacuated from the consulate earlier this year during the coronavirus outbreak. “If they closed our Hong Kong or Shanghai consulate, that would beseen as an escalation,” hesaid. US officials have maintained that China, like other rival powers and the USs itself, uses its embassies and consulates forspying under the guise of routine diplomatic work.“There’s always a certain amount ofspy versusspy that gets tolerated, but this wouldsuggest to me that the Chinese havestepped outside those norms of normal espionage,” Pfeiffersaid. The USs ordering the closure of foreign diplomatic missions is a rarely used diplomaticstep. The Trump administration in 2017 ordered Russia toshutter its consulate in San Francisco—alsoaccusedof being a base for espionage—as relations worsened between the two countries. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, acting chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee,tweeted: “#China’s Houston consulate is a massivespy center, forcing it to close is long overdue.”“We are undersiege from Chinese espionage, and they traditionally use their consulates for propaganda and espionage,”said Daniel Hoffman, a formersenior executive Clandestine Services officer with the CIA whoserved three times asstation chief overseas. “Houston is a big city, large manufacturing center, aeronautics, oil field equipment, high-tech, all things that would be of interest to China,” he added. China also apparently used the consulate in Houston as a base to pressure andintimidateUS energy firms that were carrying out projects in the disputed areas of the South China Sea.“In the biggerscheme of things, this is looking awfully like a 21st-century cold war,” Hoffmansaid. FBI Director Christopher Wray warned earlier this month that Chinese espionage was the “greatest long-term threat” to the USs economic and nationalsecurity during aspeech at the Hudson Institute in Washington, DC He cautioned that China was using a multifaceted approach “to become the world’s onlysuperpower by any means necessary,” and hesaid that the FBI is now opening a new China-related counterintelligence case roughly every 10 hours.“The People’s Republic of China has engaged for years in massive illegalspying and influence operations throughout the USs against US government officials and American citizens,” a State Departmentspokesperson told. “These activities have increased markedly inscale andscope over the past few years.”China’s topspy agency, the Ministry of State Security, maintains an intelligence unit in California, likely run out of its consulate in San Francisco, according to a 2018 investigation from. Chinese hackers indicted this month in Washington worked with the Ministry of State Security. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in aspeech in February before the National Governors Association, accused China of meddling in USstate affairs. “Chinese consulates in New York, in Illinois, in Texas, and two in California, bound by the diplomatic responsibilities and rights of the Vienna Convention, are very politically active at thestate level, as is the embassy right here in Washington, DC,” Pompeosaid. Pompeosaid that in August 2019, former Mississippi Governor Phil Bryant “received a letter from a diplomat in the consul’s office in Houston, threatening to cancel a Chinese investment if the governor chose to travel to Taiwan.”“Phil went anyway,” Pompeosaid. As the State Department announced the closure on Wednesday, local authorities in Houston responded to reports of fires at the Chinese consulate, with witnesses reporting people in the consulate compound were burning files in trash cans, according to theHouston Chronicle.

You wouldn’tsay, “Oh, Katie Hill,she’s the one who’s openly bisexual and was the first woman and the youngest person to hold her congressionalseat, right?”You wouldn’tsay, “I remember Katie Hill! She flipped a deep-red Republican district in California in her first ever race.” Or even, “Katie Hill—she’s probably the only person to hold political office who can quote both Susan B Anthony and.”You wouldsay, “Yes, Katie Hill—the one who resigned after her pictures were leaked.”If you know of Hill, you know a handful of the most traumatic and personal facts about her life. You don’t know thatshe identifies with aTamora Pierceprotagonist (Sir Alanna of Trebond, of course) or thatshe has endometriosis or that in afresh man class which included Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ayanna Pressley, it wasshe who was elected to represent the group to leadership. You don’t know thatshe reports feeling terrified to leave her husband, whomshe’ssaid was abusive (through lawyers, her ex-husband has denied any abuse), thatshe wassuicidal after herscandal, and that a few months aftershe resigned, her brother, who hadstruggled with op io id addiction, died. Hill had a meteoric rise and an even faster fall: She was a former community collegestudent who became the leader of a major nonprofit, then launched and won aseemingly impossible run for Congress in a deep-red district by the timeshe was 31. In Congresssheshone for exactly one year. Then a right-wingsite published the photos, which promptlyspread as only nude photos of a 29-year-old congresswoman can. Hillsays the photos,some of which were taken without her knowledge, could have only come from her then husband, whoshesays threatened to “ruin” her ifshe left him. Hereportedlysaid that he was hacked. The picturesshowed that Hill and her then husband were involved in a relationship with a younger woman, an employee of Hill’s campaign. She resigned, with a resounding laststand of aspeech on the floor of the House of Representatives. The fact that Hill’s private photos were published is a tremendous act of violation. But the injustice was complicated by the fact that Hill did have a relationship thatshe knows was outside the bounds of appropriate behavior. It didn’t break congressional rules, but the relationship tainted Hill’s image as a champion of the #MeToo movement. She apologized, but there was no taking it back. She was the boss. The relationship had been with astaffer. Thereshould have been boundaries. There weren’t. That whole whirlwind—the allegedly abusive partner, the violating pictures, the uneven power dynamic, the perceivedsordidness of a non-monogamous relationship—was compressed into one world for the public:scandal. Hill wasshamed, blamed, and presumed to be out of politics forever. Notso fast, Hillsays. The 31-year-old has a political PAC, called HER Time, that’s dedicated to electing women. She has a new book,, that reads like the best possible combination ofSeventeen Magazineand feminist manifesto. She has a new podcast, cheekily namedNaked Politics. Andshe has a plan toset women free—a legislative project to aid women and girls in demanding a kind of freedomshe has never enjoyed. Glamourasked Hill about life after publicshame. It was this crucial time in my life, coming out of the trauma that happened with my ex-husband, and with the photos, and with resigning. And then right after, within two months of when I resigned, my brother passed away. So being able to justsit down and tell mystory—it was really therapeutic. I feel like it’ssomething that I needed to do for myself anyway, even if I hadn’t been able to publish a book. I’m glad that writing the book kind of forced me to do that, because I don’t know if I would have been able to do that otherwise.[endometriosis, Hill hasspoken openly about hersexuality, her gun ownership, dealing with emergency medical expenses, the fact thatshe once considered abortion but then had a miscarriage, and hersexual assault and abuse experiences.]Yes! It’s almost toostrange, there are these experiences that happen toso many people, but they’re all rolled into one with me. I don’t know why during your life you go through things—and I think there’s got to be a reason behind it, and that’s the only way I’ve been able to cope with it all. But I think part of my job is to tell thesestories and hope thatsome of them have an impact on people. Therestill aren’t very many people in high-profile positions who talk about these things,so I kind of feel obliged to. I mean, I’ve got thescars from mysurgery—it’s one of those weird things where it’s like, “How do I have to prove it to you that this happened?”To me, it feels like you have to be able to own it even more. It’s about taking ownership of your own body and your own choices, and that’s hard! It’s a process for me to figure out—what areself-destructive behaviors that come in the wake of all this trauma, versus what are healthy coping ones? I don’t necessarily have a goodsense of what a normalsex life for meshould look like. I’m just trying to take my time with it, but I’m 100% in onsex positivity. I do get nervous about any BDSMstuff, because of my own experiences with it as it tied into an abusive relationship—but other people doing that in a healthy andsafe way? That’s great for them. ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyI tried to put into words our mission as feminists, as warriors, as women, which is to ensure that women are really guaranteed a few basic things—consideration, autonomy,safety, equality, and power. We do need to achieve equal power for any of these things to happen, which means electing women and installing women into positions of power at every level—whether it’s in government, in media, in nonprofits, in the corporate world. And there is a real legislative agenda that can move us in the right direction for all of this. What came out of the book was 10 real legislative goals that have either been composed or passed at the House, or passed at certainstate and local levels, but have been blocked at the national level by Republicans. I don’t even think thisshould be a partisan issue! But it is. With HER Time, the PAC that Istarted, the overarching goal is to be able to elect women and then push forward this agenda. And I’m hoping we can get that to become a movement. The biggest thing I learned from it is that when Istarted to campaign, it truly felt like a movement and these people were my friends. Thatshouldn’t have been the case, because I was paying them. I truly do believe that the #MeToo movement and everything related to the abuse of power is really driven by patriarchy and power over women,so I don’t think the case is thesame. But I do think we all have to be takingstock of that, and it’s notsomething that I did. I didn’t think of myself that way, and that was a mistake. You have toset your clear boundaries from the beginning. More than anything it probably just boils down to: Don’tshit where you eat. Starting three and a half years ago, when I entered thespace of becoming a candidate, I really wasskyrocketing. I just kept going and going and going up, and then I just fell, like, off a cliff. Now the rebuilding part isslower. It’s like you’re climbing out of a canyon and you’re trying to find the most efficient way out, and also knowing that there’s danger in coming out too fast, but also you’ve got this reallystrong desire to get out as fast as you can. With the outside parties that were in play, and my ex, I think that I very much came from the mindset of, “I’m not just going tosit here and kind ofstew in this and be quiet for any lengthy period of time, I have to get back on my feet.” I’ve been a horseback rider for basically my whole life, and when you fall, the number one thing you’re taught, that’s just drilled into you, is that you have to get right back on. The reasoning behind that is that you get a fear, really quick, it gets instilled in you, and it kind of becomes unbreakable if you don’t immediately get back on. You have to know that you do it. I think that’s kind of where I am right now—I got back on the horse. I might not ever be at the level where I was before, but I got back on. Samantha and Felicity. Oh, it’s Serena.

Shaw, an alumnus of theschool, currently works as an administrative assistant in the Department of Student Affairs at the elite women’s college.“I’m white, which reallyshouldn’t be relevant, but my employer has made it clear that, not only is it relevant, but it’s possibly one of most important or if not the most important feature of me as a human,” Shawsaid in a video posted to herYouTube channel. As of now, Shaw has made a total of four videos detailing her experience at work. The first is titled: “Dear Smith College: I Have a Few Requests.”“I ask that Smith Collegestop reducing my personhood to a racial category,”shesays. Shaw also claims that “a lot” of otherstaff members feel thesame way. Thosestaffers have not come forward. Shaw goes on to offer a blistering indictment of critical race theory, attacking the idea that white people have built an unconquerablesystem of racism against which people of color are powerless.“I believe my value lies in the quality of my work, the goodness of my deeds, the essence of my character, and the fullness of my heart, not myskin color,”shesays. According to Shaw, there is an “ever-present terror” at Smith “that any unverifiedstudent allegation of racism, or any other ‘-ism,’ has the power to crush our reputations, ruin our livelihood, and even endanger the physicalsafety of ourselves or our family members.”Shaw later went on thepodcastto describe whatshe was referencing. On July 31, 2018, astaffersawstudent Oumou Kanoute lounging in a dining hall. Believingshe was out of place, thestaffer called unarmed campus police to investigate. When the officer arrived on thesite, he recognized Kanoute,saw nothing was wrong, and left. Given a platform by the ACLU, Kanoute would claim thatshe was “racially profiled,”creating a firestorm on campus. An independent investigation, however,foundthat the employee who called the police did not violate any campus policies. After Shaw posted the first video to her channel, an HR representative came to a meeting with hersupervisor,she told“We know about your video,”she told Shaw. Shaw was then assigned a “campussafety partner” — which is another name for a campus police officer — to whomshe could turn ifshe felt “unsafe.”“It feltstrange and I do not know if Smith is actually concerned about me or just concerned about fulfilling obligations necessary to maintain their liability policy,” Shawsaid, thoughshe alsosaidshe assumes it is the latter. Publicly, the college threw Shaw under the bus.“This past week, an employee of the college posted a personal video to express their concerns about the college’s programming to promote racial justice,” wrote Smith College President Kathleen McCartney in astatement.“This employee does notspeak for the college or any part of the college. Further, we believe the video mis characterizes the college’s important, ongoing efforts to build a more equitable and inclusive living, learning and working environment,”she wrote.“The National Labor Relations Act protects employees who engage in concerted activities, includingspeech, with respect to workplace conditions,” McCartney writes. Shaw is particularlyskeptical of thissentence.“I feel like this paragraph is code for: ‘We would fire her, but we can’t, because there’s this law thatsays we can’t…otherwiseshe would totally be fired,’” Shawsaid in asecond video de constructing thestatement. One reason for her disbelief is the existence of a college policy protecting the “free exchange of ideas,” as Shaw calls it. According to Shaw, it issuspicious that McCartney cites the National Labor Relations Act rather than any freedom-of-expression policies at Smith. In a third video, Shaw describes an experienceshe had while organizing a library orientation forstudents. As a candidate for a full-time library position,she was told to “dosomething crazy.” She decided to perform a rap to getstudents acquainted with the librarysystem. Whileshe was preparing for the orientation, the incident with Kanoute occurred. According to Shaw, the campus “went into overdrive” and created a very “racially tense environment.”Asupervisor wrote in an email to Shaw, “The use of rap as a medium by a whitestaff member andstudent could easily be perceived as insensitive or cultural appropriation by incoming Smithstudents and could create a perception withstudents that the library is not raciallysensitive.”In an in-person conversation with thesupervisor, Shaw asked ifshe would be able to do the rap ifshe were a person of color. Without hesitation, thesupervisor replied, “Yes.”“I honestly believed that, if I filed a complaint…nobody would ever hire me at Smith College or anywhere,” Shawsaid. Because of that event, as well assuspicion that the department would not want to hire a white person,she withdrew her application for the position and took on her current role. After Shaw posted this video,, Smith’sstudent newspaper, wrote a November 2storyon Shaw. While Shaw agreed to an interview withThe Sophian,she is only directly quoted once. Shaw toldthat, whileshe did not read thestory, colleagues told her that “it did not do a fair job of portraying the issues which is unfortunate as it denies members of the Smith College community access to information in an objective, fair manner.”The fourth and most recent video as of November 11 describes Shaw’s experience at a faculty retreat, the first day of which wouldsee her and her colleagues discuss their “identities.”Shaw was told tosit in a group and talk about her race “in the context of your childhood, your adolescence, and your college years.”Uncomfortable talking aboutsuchsubjects in a work environment, Shaw abstained from the discussion. Hours later, a facilitator told the group, “Any white person who expresses discomfort about or distress or any kind of resistance toward talking about their race when asked to is not actually experiencing discomfort,so don’t feel like youshould comfort them because it’s not discomfort. It’s called ‘white fragility,’ and it’s a power play.”Shawsaw this as “a public humiliation.”“This was framed as a manipulative maneuver on my part,”said Shaw. “It was an act of aggression, mesaying I’m uncomfortable.”Shaw told that more videos are forthcoming. They will feature her take on “specific incidents that took place on Smith College campus between [the Kanoute incident] to the present that I believe are all a product of and a contributor to the hostile environment at Smith and excellent examples of the ideologicalstranglehold Smithseeks to maintain over its community.”contacted the Smith College public relations department, but it did not respond to repeated requests for comment. Shaw’s videos have garnered national attention from TV hostssuch asTucker Carlson, who had Shaw on as a guest.“I consider myself a liberal,” Shaw told, “and while I wish more liberals wouldspeak out against this, I recognize it is an issue that concerns all of us and is an area that both conservatives and liberals can (andshould) join forces on. This is not the time for division.”“I continue to work in a hostile work environment that feels more hostilesince releasing the video.”IMAGE: Jodi Shaw Smith College Big Dig/YouTubeLikeon Facebook/Follow us on Twitter",1,1,The College Fix
12,4 key takeaways from Oregon’s election,-1.0,46.33,https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/11/4-key-takeaways-from-oregons-election.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-04,25,"A record2.3 million-plusOregon voters had theirsay in this fall’s general election, deciding races from local ballot measures and city councils to the US Senate. Here aresome of the takeaways from Oregon voters' decisions. Unlike nationally, few Oregon races are undecided after election night. Oregon’s well-oiled vote-by-mailsystem delivered decisive results in the vast majority of contests Tuesday night. Oregon’ssix contestedseats in Congress, its three races forstatewidestate office, nearly all legislative races and key money measures: all were decidedshortly after the balloting deadline, thanks toswift action by voters and election officials. The few key racesstill pending -- two key Oregon Senate races that will help decide the balance of power in the Legislature, a tight race for Gresham mayor, a relatively minor ballot measure about Portland Water Bureau billing rights -- are worth watching, but don’t remotely approach the national breath-holding over the presidential race. Oregon Democrats' grip onstate office isstrong. Oregon has tilted blue forsome time. But this year’s election results reinforced thestate’s Democratic voters' dominance. Thestatewide votes for former Vice President Joe Biden to become president and incumbent Sen. Jeff Merkley toserve another term were overwhelming, as were the votes to install the three Democratic candidates forstatewide office -- incumbents Attorney General Ellen Rosenblum and Treasurer Tobias Read and newcomer Shemia Fagan assecretary ofstate. Oregonians want people to be free to use drugs. Two ballot measures, one to one to decriminalize possession of moststreet drugs and the other to allowsupervised use of psilocybin, passed overwhelmingly Tuesday. Both are nationally notable, as they mark the first time anystate has permitted the non-prosecuted possession or use ofsubstances. To be fair, backers of the measure to decriminalize drugs, many of whom are former addicts with long records of hard-wonsobriety,said they want people caught withsmall amounts of heroin, meth and other drugs to get assessed and treated to end their addiction, not to keep using. But it would not be a crime for them to doso.

13,We Need a MAGA 2.0,21.33,29.33,https://amgreatness.com/2021/01/15/we-need-a-maga-2-0/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-greatness-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-15,25,"With allsincerity, what was the “Stop the Steal” rallysupposed to accomplish? When you think about millions of unhappy Americans traveling to Washington, DC to express their unhappiness with the results of the 2020 elections, one is left to ponder whether that energy needed to be directed elsewhere, or if thereshould have been a different message for the event? Everyone at that rally had the right to be unhappy and to protest, but just because they were within their rights does not make that action the right choice for the moment. Much like waiting until after he contracted COVID-19 tostart conveying a more aggressive message about re-opening the economy, President Trump led a rally that was many days late and many dollarsshort. As we approach the 300th day of15 days to flatten the curve, it is becoming apparent that taking a backseat to the Fauci-Birx-Redfield triumvirate and allowing the country to fall under the rule of the White House Coronavirus Task Force doomed the president’s reelection chances more thanSharpies in Arizona. Inshort, the time to “stop thesteal” wasElection Day. An “open the country” or “take off your mask” rally would have been more productive for the more than 74 million Americansseeking to reclaim their freedom. Because of the ugliness of January 6, it’s tempting to be gaslighted into thinking President Trump’s administration was an unmitigated disaster. There were foreign policy wins and tax cuts. His outsiderstatus exposed the manyRINOswho populate the Republican Party. His exposure of media bias pushed the mainstream media ever deeper in the tank for the Left, further eroding its public image. His outreach to different racial and ethnic communities produced greatersupport in those demographics. Yet, because he is a flawed human like us all, his ability to create his movement came with heavy baggage. His boorishness has been documented ad nauseam. More relevant to where we are today is the reality that while he was bestowed the magic “R” by the Republican Party, he is not a principled conservative. Rather, he is aseptuagenarian businessman who loves the country and understands marketing. That unleashed the MAGA movement and many red hats, much like President Obama’s “Hope and Change.”Unfortunately, MAGA also was revealed as an ambiguousslogan that faltered when we needed it in March 2020. Principled conservatives who are guided by freedom and liberty would not allow themselves to become the face of putting a multitrillion-dollar economy “on pause.” One who believes that citizens are responsible for their own risk tolerance in life wouldseek to inform rather than mandate. Nothing guided the messaging on COVID policy beyond declaring preemptive victory over the virus. This emboldened a determination to enact an unprecedented level of government intervention, even instates with trifecta Republican control of thestate government. We can have the federalism debate all we want, but regardless, astrong leader owns a crisis response. The president’s reactionarystyle contributed to the communication of a hodgepodge message about the government’s COVIDstrategy. Even as wesit here today, what the COVID endgame? The publicsigned on tosaving hospital capacity but has been conditioned to believe that we areseeking zero COVID cases, which effectively ends our culture as a free country. Thus, it’s now crucial that patriots thank Donald Trump for the awakening, but it’s time to move on to MAGA 2.0. MAGA 1.0 was about Donald Trump and effectively ended on January 6. MAGA 2.0 is about infusing the culture with the energy and onus behind the original movement. As the late Andrew Breitbart noted, politics is downstream from culture. The current political climate that has Communist analogies is rooted in the Right ceding the culture battle to the Left. Reclaimingsomesemblance of liberty involves infusing popular culture with thatspirit for freedom. Whether Joe Biden’s victory was legitimate or not, more than 74 million Americans cast a vote for the candidate who, to their minds,stood for challenging the uni party politicalsystem of cronyism. MAGA 2.0 needs to harness the energy created by Trump’s ascendency but refocus that energy away from how one man was wronged and into local communities and culture. More than 80 percent of the counties in the USs voted for Trump. At least a few of them can be governed as far to the Right as California is to the Left. Many of these areasshould declare themselves “constitutionalsanctuaries”that reject COVID coercion and promote freedom of expression. MAGA 2.0should also encourage dollars to flow to businesses that are pro-freedom. Libertysells. It’s tough to refute the notion that long, unkempt facial hair and camouflage clothing are nowstylish because a family of God-fearing duck hunters in Louisianahad one of the most popularshows on television a few years ago. Most politicians on the Right are not leaders, they are followers who are constantly ceding ground to thespirit of the age. They don’t drive the culture, they follow the trends. Very few are Ron DeSantis, Kristi Noem, Chip Roy, or Thomas Massie. Those like Mike DeWine, Larry Hogan, Eric Holcomb, and Liz Cheney are more common. Yet, if the 75 million Americans who voted for Trump demanded toughness from all elected publicservants, you’d eventuallysee more of the former and less of the latter. The Georgia runoffsent asignal about what people didn’t want. But that can only goso far. That’s why MAGA 2.0 really needs to be less about making America great again and more about making America free again.",1,0,American Greatness

On the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, the city of New Orleans wasstruck by thisstorm and left broken yet again. Sixteen years ago, I wasstarting mysenior year of highschool () and witnessed the destruction of New Orleans instatewide media, the national coverage, and from the accounts of those who evacuated to my highschool. We had a handful of new classmates that year who came to us from the Catholicschools of New Orleans, and they hadstories to tell. But we all watched as New Orleans became what felt like a developing world country. Thestreets were flooded for whatseemed like forever. The government proved ineffective to help them. There were peoplestranded on rooftops for days. The Superdome became a long-termshelter for those displaced. Governor Kathleen Blanco blamed the federal government. The Bush administration blamed Blanco. The city of New Orleans blamed everyone else. It was a catastrophic failure at practically every level, and no one reallyseemed to get that there were lessons to be learned. Katrina would ultimately prove to be Blanco’s downfall. Bobby Jindal came in and, to his credit, it appears he did fight to get the leveesystems of New Orleans in working order, andsome improvements were made. But the city itself had made very few changes to allow for the residents to be ready to move in the event of another disaster. Even aftersixteen years, it appears the only thing that changed was the leveesystems. Everything else failed again. But the biggest failure of allseems to be a lack of an evacuation plan. New Orleans is confusing as hell to navigate into and through on the best of days. Twenty years ago, there was asolution to this, and it was implemented by Jeb Bush.

To address these issues, Governor Jeb Bush appointed a Governor is Hurricane Evacuation Task Force— Gabe Hoffman (@GabeHoff)August 28, 2021There are numerous ways to enter and exit New Orleans, but given the geography of thestate, evacuating the city is a hassle during a crisis. By havingsomething like the contraflowsystem in place, thestate would make itsignificantly easier to get people out in times of major weather events like Hurricane Ida. Right now, the city is completely without power. Cellservice issporadic at best in and around New Orleans. Transmission towers fell into the Mississippi River. Many people arestuck where they are with no power and no phones. They are completely in the dark, and it’s not because they chose tostay. For the vast majority, manysimply couldn’t leave. What’s worse is that the city will be relying on not just thestate but the federal government for assistance to get through. But three hours to its west is Lake Charles, whichstill has gotten none of the federal assistance it was promised by the government after Hurricane Laura. It, too, remains in tatters andstruggling to recover a year later. The federal government is being run by the Biden administration, who over the last two weeks has proven it is incapable of even formulating a plan, much less following through on it. Everything about the withdrawal from Afghanistan has been a disaster and the leaks from the intelligence and military communities heavily imply every issue has beenself-inflicted rather than as a result of the Taliban’ssudden rise to power. I have no doubt that New Orleans will recover. It tooksome time after Katrina, but this time the levees appear to have held up and there is no major flooding in the city. That is an improvement, but the inability of the government at any level — local,state, or federal — to have done anything to mitigate the damage or tospeed up the recovery isstill proof that we have a long way to go in protecting our citizens from these threats in the future.",1,0,RedState

17,What Was the Debt-Ceiling Showdown Really All About?,10.67,29.67,https://www.thebulwark.com/what-was-the-debt-ceiling-showdown-really-all-about/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-bulwark-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-05,17,"The Western liberal tradition to which we belong has as it foundation two things: proportional representation of the will of the people and capitalism. Both are equally as important. One cannotsurvive without the other. Yes, the Europeans may be a bit moresocialist leaning, but democracy has neversurvived truesocialism or communism. And there are no precedents for capitalism flourishing insystems that reject proportional representation. In essence, any vote against capitalism—that is, capitalism at its core, not its regulatory edges—is anti-democratic. And vice versa. Yet, voting against capitalism is what what the entire Republican Senate minority just did. No thing, and no person, has economic value in a vacuum. All value—like all motion—is relative. Value (and thus price) is the relationship of one thing to another. The entire discipline of what we call “finance” is an exercise in making relative valuations. But tostart, finance had tosettle on a reference point—a “risk free” thing which could be used as a yardstick for everything else,so that everything else can be priced accordingly. While everyone knows there is nosuch thing as a “risk free” investment in an absolutesense, the mechanism that finance chose madesense: government bonds. In particular, U. S government bonds. And in even more particular, the 10 year Treasury yield. Every mortgage, every auto loan, every wage—everythingis priced relative to the value of the risk-free rate—the US 10 year Treasury yield. The reason why government bonds are considered risk free is because they, by definition, are. A bond is an obligation of a country to pay a holder of that obligation at a future date. That obligation is met throughsomething else owned by the country—meaning currency. It is impossible for a country to default on its own bonds, because it could just create more currency to meet the obligations. Which means that there is only one way to default onsovereign debt—willfully. But the debt!Perhaps one of the most disingenuous (but effective) arguments put forward in modern politics was the case for conservative “fiscal responsibility.”You have to manage your own debt,so whyshouldn’t the government?That line makessense to people. Building on this parochial bedrock, conservatives flirted many times with the idea of the businessman-president until finally nominating Donald Trump, a bankruptcies vitamin hawker who played the role of businessman on TV Under President Trump thesize of government grew to its largest levelssince the 1960s. Never mind the fact governments probablyshouldn’t be run like a business, or a household because it turns out that there is no constituency for fiscal conservatism. Despite what conservatives havesaid for 40 years, their revealed preference is clearly for bigger government and morespending. And you know what? As a policy matter, that’s okay. Can debt growso large it topples the financial order? Sure. But as of 2021, insum, the USs has a net worth (assets-liabilities) of $132 trillion. The Biden administration’s proposal to take on $3.5 trillion of national debt over 10 years to reducesignificantly the greatest risk to our mature civilization—which is wealth inequality—would lower America’s national net worth by around 2.25 percent. That’s it. We would bespending 2.25 percent in order to cut child poverty in half. Would you as an individual donate 2.25 percent of your personal net worth to cut child poverty in half? I bet you would. I bet you would even donate 2.25 percent of your net worth over a 10 year period to cut child poverty in half for just one family. Prices are relative and this price isn’t all that high relative to the good we’d be purchasing. Of course, there could beside effects. The plan might not cut child poverty in half. There could be inflation. There may be prudential reasons not to enact it. But to argue that thesize isso onerous is wrong-headed. Back to willful default. The Senate Republicans who now fashion themselves as champions of fiscal responsibility were willing to turn the risk free rate—on whichever y asset is priced—into a non-risk free rate by refusing to raise the debt ceiling. They were voting for America to default. This isn’t just hypocritical. It is also another attack on democracy. Because if the risk free rate had been made risky, then then financial calamity would have been unspeakable. Because again: Functioning democracy is intertwined with functioning capital markets. During the first andsecond Trump impeachments, a number of Republicans voted to remove Trump, andso we thought,Hey, as long as we have Mitt Romney and the others, there’s hope. But the problem is that these Republicans aren’t thinking expansively enough about democracy. About what democracy is. About what democracy requires. It’s not just rejecting Donald Trump’s cult of personality. It’s understanding andsupporting the policies which make democracy possible. Even whensuchsupport runs counter to the party’s daily marching orders. All 50 Republicans in the Senate voted not to raise the debt ceiling and therefore willfully default on America’s debt. That vote was just as antithetical to a functioning democracy as was the votes to decertify the election results on January 6. For democracy and capitalism tosurvive, they need each other. And we need a better class of Republicans. Even the “good Republicans.”",1,1,The Bulwark
18,Conservatives Issue a Clarion Call on Trump’s Mental Health,-22.0,26.5,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/03/19/conservatives-issue-a-clarion-call-on-trumps-mental-health/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"Given what we know about Donald Trump and the presidency, I have beensuggesting for a long time that his mentalstatus will not get any better and can only get worse. As that prediction materializes, the president’s behavior has triggeredseveral conservatives to issue warnings about his deteriorating mental health. The most comprehensive comes from Peter Wehner, whoserved under three Republican presidents and is now asenior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, a conservative think tank. Reacting tosome of Trump’s more inflammatory tweets over the weekend, Wehnerrefers to the president as “a damagedsoul with a disordered personality.”It doesn’t take a person with an advanced degree in psychology tosee Trump’s narcissism and lack of empathy, his vindictiveness and pathological lying, his impulsivity and callousness, his inability to be guided by norms, or hisshamelessness and dehumanization of those who do not abide his wishes. His condition is getting worse, not better—and there are now fewer people in the administration able to contain the president and act as a check on his worst impulses…Whether the worstscenarios come to pass or not is right now unknowable. But what we know is that the president is a person whoseems to draw energy and purpose from maliciousness and transgressive acts, from creating enmity among people of different races, religions, and backgrounds, and from attacking the weak, the honorable, and even the dead. Donald Trump is not well, and as long as he is president, our nation is notsafe. Leading the charge of conservatives commenting on the president’s mental health is George Conway. Right now he is best known as the husband of Kellyanne Conway, counselor to President Trump. But he also made a name for himself by representing Paula Jones in her lawsuit against Bill Clinton. Conway has been expressing his concerns about the president recently on Twitter. This was the end of astream where he reacted tosome of Trump’s lies. Whether or not impeachment is in order, aserious inquiry needs to be made about this man’s condition of mind.— George Conway (@gtconway3d)March 14, 2019Conwaytweetedthe diagnostic criteria for Narcissistic Personality Disorder and asked, “Tell us,@realDonaldTrump—which of these diagnostic criteria do you notsatisfy?” To explain, het weeted a link to an article in Rolling Stone titled, “Trump’s Mental Health: Is Pathological Narcissism the Key to Trump’s Behavior?”At one point, Conway teamed up with Bill Kristol to express his concern. Agree with this, but would add that *all* Americansshould be thinkingseriously *now* about Trump’s mental condition and psychologicalstate, including and especially the media, Congress—and the Vice President and Cabinet.— George Conway (@gtconway3d)March 18, 2019Jennifer Rubinjoinedthe bandwagon. Whether meantseriously or not, Deputy Attorney General Rod J Rosenstein’s alleged consideration of the 25th Amendmentseems, in retrospect, not to have been irrational at all. Since President Trump’s firing of James B Comey as FBI director and the appointment of aspecial counsel, Trump’s mental and emotional health hasseemed to fray. The pace of lies and nonsensical accusations, the resort to conspiracy theories and refusal to conduct himself like an adult (let alone the president) often pick up in the wake of bad news from thespecial counsel and widespread criticism of the president’s unhinged behavior. So it was this weekend following his refusal to directly condemn white nationalism in the wake of the New Zealand massacre and the defection of 12 Senate Republicans last week on the resolution repealing the emergency declaration. These are not warnings coming from partisansseeking to undermine the opposition. Instead, they are clarion calls from conservatives to Republicans currently in office and thoseserving in Trump’s cabinet to take thesituationseriously, before it’s too late.",0,1,Washington Monthly

Ron Wyden (D-OR). President Joe Bidensignedthe American Rescue Plan Act into law in March. It directs the Treasury Department to distribute billions of dollars instimulus funding to local andstate governments. Those funds can be used to improve broadband access, but the billseverely limits the eligibility criteria forsuch projects. The billsays that only unserved or underserved communities can use the federal funding to improve broadband access, asnotes. According to the Federal Communications Commission, communities with internetspeeds of under 25 Mbps down and 3 Mbps up are underserved. That definition has remained thesamesince 2015. Wydensays thosespeeds are not nearly fast enough for current needs, calling that benchmark ""woefully outdated."" He wants communities wherespeeds are less than 100 Mbps up and down to be classed as underserved and to be eligible for upgraded internet infrastructure under this plan.“The mass adoption of video calling,streaming, and other bandwidth-intensive ap ps by Americans during the COVID-19 pandemic has made it clear that miserlyspeeds and data caps are holding back telework, remote education and tele health capacity,” Wyden wrote i na letter to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. “Simply put, it is not possible for a family of four to tele work and engage in remoteschooling whilesharing 3 Mbps of upload bandwidth.”Wyden went on to argue that a failure to address concerns “will further expand the digital divide and jeopardize our ability as a nation to build back better from the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, as you finalize the Coronavirus State and Local Fiscal Recovery Funds Final Rule, I urge [Yellen] to clarify that underserved locations include anywhere affordable, reliable broadband of at least 100 Mbpssymmetric is not available."" Wyden added that ""to be accessible, broadband must also be affordable.""Other lawmakers have been pushing the FCC to upgrade the definition of high-speed broadband to 100 Mbps up and down.

23,Losing Culture Wars: How Conservatives Aid the “Trans” Agenda,27.67,19.33,https://thenewamerican.com/losing-culture-wars-how-conservatives-aid-the-trans-agenda/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,16,"If you want to know why conservatives are batting almost zero in the culture war, consider the recentstory about a MUSS (Made-up Sexual Status, or “trans”) activist whosuggested rhetorically that all childrenshould be put on puberty blockers. For while attempting to oppose the MUSS agenda,some conservative outlets reporting on the matter did, unwittingly and as usual, enable that agenda. Thestory wassparked by one Zachary Antolak, a man claiming womanhood who goes by the name “Lauren McNamara” when he’s not going by the name “Zinnia Jones” and who tweeted the following:If children can not consent to puberty blockers which pause any permanent changes even with the relevant professional evaluation, how can they consent to the permanent and irreversible changes that come with their own puberty with no professional evaluation whatsoever?I won’t address the tweet’ssubstance here, except tosay the activist is making a rhetorical argument that was refuted wonderfully by commentator Drew Belsky. For what’s more troubling than Antolak’ssophistry is conservatives’ leftism-born terminology. For example, TheBlaze’s Phil Shiverwrote, among other things, that the activist “arguedin her [sic!] tweet thread that puberty became ‘optional’” due to technology, related Belsky. That “TheBlaze would use female pronouns to describe this man is disgraceful,” Belsky then writes. “‘Zinnia Jones’ was not just ‘born male.’ Hemale and always will be,” he explains.“He cannot be anything else,” Belsky continues. “To call a man ‘she’ and ‘her’ is to be comp licit in transgender insanity. It’s twice as damaging when conservatives, who purport to hold the moral high ground, join liberalsexual deviants in pushing the linguistic envelope.”Preach it, brother (except that there’s nosuch thing as “transgender,” either). I’ve been writing for almost 20 years now about how too many conservatives are “connedservatives” who, while fighting the culture destroyers, cede half the battle before it has even begun by embracing their Newspeak. As to this, Stuart Chase pointed out in his book that theside that defines the vocabulary of a debate wins the debate. Yet decade after decade conservatives have obediently parroted the Lexicon of the Left, which is generally originated by left-wing academics and then popularized by left-wing media. Thus have I heard conservativessay not “illegal alien” but “undocumented worker” (akin to calling a rapist an undocumented husband). They also may callsemi-automatic rifles “assault weapons,” black Americans “African-Americans,” “sex” “gender” (humans are of onesex or the other;have gender) — and now a man by feminine pronouns. Controlling the language is imperative (which is why our Left manipulates it, as evil forces will do — e.g., the Nazis). Just imagine, for example, that French and German cultures were vying for primacy in a certain region. If the Germans could convince the French tospeak German, howseverely handicapped would the French be in their culture war?What conservatives do is a bit as if European Jews hadsaid during WWII, using a pejorative the Nazis applied to them, “We[sub-humans] must fight for our human rights.” Or it’s as if we’d proclaimed pep-talkstyle during thesame period, using a pejorative the Imperial Japanese applied to Americans, “We hairy white apes willshow ’em who really has the brains!”In the MUSS agenda’s case, its activists’ central claim is that you can be an opposite-sex member (or another “gender,” as they put it) just by willing it. And referring to a man using feminine pronouns is. We’re essentiallysaying, “We accept your ‘identity,’ but…” But what?You’ve lost. Thus proceeding is to buttress the MUSS agenda claim that certain people have a biologically induced brain-bodysex mismatch requiring a biological remedy, as opposed to a psychological issue requiring a psychological remedy. It’s tosay, “Your ‘cure’ is real — just don’t offer it to kids with thesame problem.”Aside from being a bit confused, the issue is also that too many conservatives arescared, afraid to truly transgress against political correctness’s tenets. We have to “respect” a person’s identity, right? (OK, then I identify as Oh Great and Superior Master). So they’re left arguing against the extremes of political correctness — within the framework of political correctness. They’ll fight over the Left’s corollaries after accepting the Left’s propositions. Now perhaps it’s obvious why GK Chesterton observed that the “business of Progressives is to go on making mistakes. The business of Conservatives is to prevent mistakes from being corrected.”When conservatives accept the Left’s words when using words to battle the Left, well, it’s a bit like using the Left’s voting machines when trying to win an election.",0,0,The New American

When officers arrived, new video footageshows, the March 23 encounter quickly turned violent, and Prude died from asphyxiation under a hood officers had put over his head. Two years prior, in 2018,Shukri Ali Saidof Georgia also wound up dead after leaving her house during a mental health crisis on April 23, 2018. Police, called in to help, found Saidstanding at an intersection holding a knife. Officersshot her five times in the neck and chest, killing her. Thatsame month, in New York, officers answered a 911 call about a black man wavingsomething that looked like a gun. In fact, it was a pipe. But whenSaheed Vassell, a 34-year-old father with mental illness who was well known in his Brooklyn community, pointed it at police, theyshot him dead. Prude, Vassell and Said are among the hundreds of people with intellectual disabilities or mental illnesses in the USskilled by police every year. According toThe Washington Post, 197 of the 999 peopleshot by police last year had a mental illness. Police are almost always the first responders in cases of mental health crises in the USs, as they are in criminal and medical emergencies. But the police – who are trained to give orders and use force when they feel endangered – are generally ill-equipped to handle people with mental health challenges. As a disability and ethicsscholar who focuses on criminal justice, I know this country has long failed to justly and humanely care for people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities. For most of American history, people with mental health disabilities were locked away in hospital-like institutions, many of themstate-run. Starting in the 1950s, the physical andsexual abuse common in these facilities, as well as other inhumane practices,spurred a decades-long effort to close them down and return residents to the community. This process, calleddeinstitutionalization, was meant to replace institutions with local mental health centers that would provide community-based mental health treatment and assistance for those recently released from institutions. However, in 1981Ronald Reagancut most funding for these centers. Andsince other existing communityservices– likeschools, housing and healthservices – were not adapted to meet the needs of these new community members, many were left jobless, homeless and unable to get a good education. Today, the 15% ofAmericanswiththesedisabilitiesstill have very littlesupport. Some people are fortunate enough to live with their families or in one of the USs’ roughly500 private residential facilities– places that can cost up toUS$60,000 a year. Others end uphomeless, in poorly run facilities or even in jails. But everyone with these disabilities is at high risk of interacting with police. Too often, these interactions go poorly. In hopes of identifying practices that prevent avoidable deaths, I’ve been interviewing people with intellectual and developmental disabilities about their experiences with the criminal justicesystem. Under the terms of the academic ethics boards overseeing my research, the names of all my interviewsubjects are protected. One reason police encounters can go wrong, I’ve learned, is that people with intellectual disabilities oftenstruggle to comprehendspoken instructions – particularly in a high-stresssituation.“People who don’t have [an intellectual disability] don’t have a hard time understanding what the police are asking them to do,” one man told me. “It’s different for me.”Being overwhelmed can cause people with psychiatric and intellectual disabilities tos hut down. If this behavior is interpreted asobstinate, it can lead to arrest, detention or police aggression. People with these disabilities are also often disbelieved by the police. A woman I interviewed – who communicatedslowly due to her disabilities –saidshe called 911 on her boyfriend for hitting her. But the police believed the boyfriend’sstory thatshe was the violent one and arrested her instead.“When they find out that you’re not capable of understanding what’s going on, it’s a free-for-all,” another interviewsubject told me. People with intellectual disabilities maystruggle in court, too. When one interviewee didn’t understand a judge’s question, he told me, he wassentenced to three months in county jail for disorderly conduct. Judges and lawyers “need to listen to people that’s on disability,”said the woman arrested after calling 911 on her abusive partner, urging patience. Recognizing that theystruggle to handle people in mental crisis, many US cities are making efforts to improve outcomes. New York Citytrainssome officers incr isis intervention and recently mandated that asocial worker must accompany officers tosuch cases. Denver is looking to adopt a mobile crisis intervention programstarted in Oregon that ensures medics and crisis workers, not police, respond to mental health calls. These andsimilar efforts nationwide are astep in the right direction. But my research indicates they may not go far enough. Police frequently encounter people with psychiatric disabilities whensomeone calls 911 about a person acting unusually in public. If police perceive that person as potentially violent, thesituation can quickly escalate. That’s howAnthony Hill, a black veteran found wandering around his Atlanta apartment complex naked, died in 2015. Hill, who had gone off his medication, ran toward Officer Robert Olsen, whoshot him. Olsen wassentenced to12 years in prison on November 1, 2019, for aggravated assault and violating his oath of office. Nor do laws targeting police violence address the factors that lead people with mental health disabilities to need emergency assistance in the first place. Despite growing recognition of thestigma around mental illness, people with mental health disabilities are oftenstillfeared, pitied and associated with violence in TV and movies. Thissocialstigma can lead tosocietal rejection and isolation. And the difficulties people with mental health challenges face finding adequate housing, health care and employment all increase their risk of involvement with the criminal justicesystem. One lesson from the history of American mental health care is that reforming just one problematic aspect of thesystemdoesn’t work. Toserve this population’s needs, other institutions – from education to housing – must also be made more flexible, responsive and accessible. Just asshuttering institutions 60 years agosolved little,simply targeting police responseswon’tsuffice now, either.",2,1,NewsOne

California issuffering from drought, and farmers in thestate is Central Valley are pumping more groundwater from their well to make up for ashortfall in water from thestate is reservoirs. The next time you pick upsome California-grown carrots or melons in the grocerystore, consider the curious, contested odyssey of the water that fed them. Chances are, farmers pumped that water from underground aquifers on ascale that is become unsustainable, especially as the planet heats up. Facing an ongoing drought that issqueezingsurface watersupplies, farmers are extracting groundwater at higher rates to continue growing food as usual. California is farmers probably will pump an additionalsix toseven million acre-feet of water from their wells this year, above what they normally use, according toJosue Medellin-Azuara, a water expert at the University of California, Merced. That quantity would cover 10,000square miles with a foot of water, and far exceeds the amount that naturally replenishes the aquifer, even during a year with normal rainfall.""It is a huge amount,""says Steve Jackson, a farmer in Visalia who helps to manage 40,000 acres of almonds and other crops. ""I'dsay 90 to 95 percent of our crop demands this year are going to be met by groundwater.""This year, however, may mark the beginning of the end of California is great groundwater grab. Thestate is preparing to phase in new limits on groundwater pumping that will force painful adjustments on thestate is farmers. California is a powerhouse of food production, growingsome 40 percent of the country is fruit, vegetables, and nuts. Yet the production depends on asupply of water that is increasingly fragile and unreliable as the climate warms.""Drought reveals the lie of a place,""says Mark Arax, the Fresno-based author of, a history of California is water conflicts. ""The lie is our ambition. We have taken on too much.""In good years, an intricatesystem of dams, aqueducts, and irrigation canals captures water from rivers and meltingsnow, much of it in the northern part of thestate, and moves that water to fields in the wide Central Valley where most crops are grown. Thesystem alsosupplies coastal cities, but agriculture remains the largest consumer of water. This year, rivers are running low. Thestate is biggest reservoirs contain less than half the average amount of water, and farmers have been forced to rely on their wells. ""This year, there is no allotment, because there is no water,""says Kathy Briano, referring to the amount of water that farmers are assigned for irrigation use. Briano grows almonds near the town of Porterville, andshe is relying on her wells instead. Until now, groundwater use in California has been unrestricted. Farmers and cities could pump as much as they wished. And there was a time when that watersourceseemed inexhaustible. The Central Valley aquifer is like a giant, multi-layered lake beneath the ground. ""A hundred years ago, when you tapped a foot into the earth, in certain parts of the valley, the water would gush out,"" Araxsays. At that time, wells typically only needed to be 50 or 80 feet deep. But year after year, towns and farmers --- but mostly farmers --- pumped more water out of the aquifer than nature put back in, and the water table fell. Today, farmers and towns are drilling wells over a thousand feet deep. Extractingso much water even changed the region is geology.""As you draw the water up and out of the earth, the earth itself then collapses andsinks,"" Araxsays. ""We are notsinking by inches. We aresinking by feet.""Jerry Jones (R) and hisson Brandon Jones (L) of Jones Construction and Excavation install a 2,500 gallon tank in front of the home of Loren Scott Denney after his well went dry on May 25, 2021 in Madera, California. Denney did not have running water for almost a month as he waited for the tank to be installed. Justin Sullivan/Getty Imageshide captionBrianosays the problems first became obvious during the drought of 2014-2015. ""Everybody was pumping,""shesays. ""You had to pump all that you needed, and you just brought that groundwater down to nothing.""On her ranch, the water table dropped by 60 feet. The well thatsupplied water to her house went dry. Thesame thing happened to hundreds of people who relied onshallow wells in the nearby town of East Porterville. ""People were without water, and they had to bring water tanks in. They had no water at all!""shesays. During that drought, there was growing pressure to enact limits on groundwater use. Susana De Anda, executive director of theCommunity Water Center, in the town of Visalia, was among those pushing for change. ""When 90 percent of our valley residents rely on groundwater, we have to besure that we aresharing that for all beneficial uses,""shesays. ""That means that weshould not over-pump.""In 2014, California passed theSustainable Groundwater Management Act(SGMA). It requires big changes, but they will be enforced only gradually, over the next two decades. Under this law, overuse of the aquifer must end by 2040. By that date, use and replenishment of thestate is groundwater must be in balance. State and local officials now are coming up with limits on groundwater use to achieve this. In practice, it could mean that farmers in the San Joaquin Valley, which occupies a large area of the Central Valley between Sacramento and Bakersfield, will have to cut their groundwater pumping by 70 or 80 percent by 2040, compared to what they are using this year. In order to enforce these limits,some authorities are requiring meters on wells. Others are monitoring water use throughsatellites that can detect which crops are being grown. The reaction among farmers has been mixed. Some, like Steve Jackson, agree that limits are necessary, even though groundwater has kept his farm alive in drought years. ""It is a lifeline, but I think that it is a lifeline that we have all taken for granted, and it is not infinite,""hesays. ""I think that is what is coming home to all of us.""The limits probably will mean thatsome land will no longer grow crops, although there is dispute about how much. Onestudy, backed by the agricultural industry,predictsthat a million acres, or 20 percent of the fields in the San Joaquin Valley, will be taken out of production. Other researchers think it will be half that much. Farmers are likely to adapt byshifting their limited watersupplies to their most valuable crops. They also will be able, for the first time, to buy andsell groundwater allotments,shifting the water to the places where it is worth the most. Other farmers, like Kathy Briano, reject the prospect of idling fertile Central Valley land. Briano agrees that it makessense to protect the aquifer. But to make up for it,she wants thestate to deliver more water from dams and reservoirs, to whichshesays the farms are entitled. ""Mysolution is, you need to bring us more water,""shesays. ""We can not keep taking from the valley, because we are taking away [food] production, and where can we grow everything? Right here!""Mark Arax, the writer,says the changing climate is likely to breed more conflicts like this, also in other parts of the country. ""How we deal with this becomes an example for the rest of America, when it comes to their doorstep,"" hesays. The California dream was born in the Gold Rush, claiming nature and re-shaping the land. Now, Araxsays, it is time to re-invent that dream.",2,2,NPR
27,Trump showerhead rule on more water flow goes down the drain,-3.67,43.0,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/7/16/22580481/trump-showerhead-rule-more-water-flow-goes-down-drain,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"WASHINGTON — So much for Donald Trump’s quest for “perfect” hair. The Biden administration is reversing a Trump-era rule approved after the former president complained he wasn’t getting wet enough because of limits on water flow fromshowerheads. Now, with a new president in office, the Energy Department is going back to astandard adopted in 2013,saying it provides plenty of water for a goodsoak and a thorough clean. The rule change will have little practical effect,since nearly all commercially madeshower heads comply with the 2013 rule — the pet peeve of the former president notwithstanding. The Energy Departmentsaid the action clarifies what’s been happening in the marketplace. Showers that provide the extrasupply of water desired by Trump are not easily found, officialssaid. Since 1992, federal law has dictated that newshower headsshould not pour more than 2.5 gallons of water per minute. As newershower fixtures came out with multiple nozzles, the Obama administration defined theshowerhead restrictions to apply to what comes out in total. So if there are four nozzles, no more than 2.5 gallons totalshould come out among all four. The Trump-era rule, finalized in December, allows each nozzle tospray as much as 2.5 gallons, not just the overallshowerhead. A proposed rule change,set to be published in the Federal Register next week, reverts to the Obama-erastandard. The public will have 60 days to comment before a final rule is developed. The change will ensure that consumers continue tosave money while reducing water use and paying lower energy bills, the Energy Departmentsaid. Officials estimated that the Obama-era rulesaved households about $38 a year, and the Energy Department expectssimilarsavings by reverting to the 2013standard.“As many parts of America experience historic droughts, this commonsense proposal means consumers can purchaseshower heads that conserve water andsave them money on their utility bills,’’ Kelly Speakes-Backman, acting assistantsecretary for the department’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy,said Friday. While publicly talking about the need to keep his hair “perfect,” Trump made increasing water flow and dialing back longstanding appliance conservationstandards — including for light bulbs, toilets and dishwashers — a personal issue.“Soshower heads — you take ashower, the water doesn’t come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn’t come out,’’ Trumpsaid at the White House last year. “So what do you do? You juststand there longer or you take ashower longer? Because my hair — I don’t know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect.”But consumer and conservation groupssaid the 2020 rule change wassilly, unnecessary and wasteful, especially as the West bakes through a historic two-decade-long megadrought. With four or five or more nozzles, “you could have 10, 15 gallons per minute powering out of theshowerhead, literally probably washing you out of the bathroom,”said Andrew deLaski, executive director of the energy conservation group Appliance Standards Awareness Project. “At a time when a good portion of the country is experiencingserious drought exacerbated by climate change, there’s no place forshower heads that use needless amounts of water.”DeLaski and officials at Consumer Reportssaid there’s been no public outcry or need for change. The Energy Department’s database of 12,499shower headsshowed 74% of them use 2 gallons or less water per minute, which is 20% less than the federalstandard. A 2016 test ofshower heads by Consumer Reports found that the best-ratedshowerheads, including a $20 model, provided a pleasing amount of water flow and met federalstandards. The Energy Department also is proposing to remove the definition of “bodyspray” adopted in the 2020 final rule. The rule allows “bodysprays” to circumvent congressional intent to promote water conservationsimply based on orientation of the water flow — asidespray rather than overhead.",1,2,Chicago Sun-Times

If you think about the internet the way it actually is, you worry about mountains and rivers and oceans, about electricity generation andsignal interference. And you might also worry about ownership, control, power, and coordination. The internet, after all, issimply a. Its job is to get information from one physical place to another physical place. Itserves thesame function as telephones, telegraphs, radios,smokesignals, andsemaphore. It happens to operate through a complicatedsystem of physical tubes. When yousend a packet of information in the form of a letter, a federal government agency takes your letter and carries it across an intricate nationwide network of federally-,state-, and locally-owned and managed roads. When yousend a packet of information in the form of bits, it is usually carried by a privately-owned internetservice provider (or “ISP,” usually the local cable monopoly) along an intricate nationwide network of pathways owned by that company and a myriad of other private companies. It’s like if you could onlysend a letter with either UPS or FedEx (depending on where you live), and the letter had to travel on nothing but toll roads owned by a few dozen private corporations to get to anywhere from down thestreet to across the continent. This presents both a problem and an opportunity. The problem is that as more of our lives move online (whether in the normal course or all at once thanks to a global pandemic), we become ever more at the mercy of the private entities that control the internet. In normal times we have to use roads to get to work and toschool, but at least wet he roads and exercisesome control over them in the form of local government. We don’townthe internet. There are no city council meetings where we can go to complain about potholes andservice interruptions, or about local tax raises and data rates. The way that our public institutions tend to get more people connected to the internet is to give private internet companies grants to build more wires. But those companiesstill own the wires, and at the end of the day they tend to doon ly what is most profitable. The opportunity is to flip this dynamic. But we must go deeper than the calls for municipal internetservice providers that were in heavy rotation around 2017. Municipal ISPs are good, but they are only local. Every city in the country could have its own locally owned and democratically controlled ISP and the internet wouldstill be at the mercy of private profit. Someonestill has to connect all those cities to each other. Someonestill has to carry the bits from Los Angeles through Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, Denver, and Omaha to theservers in Council Bluffs. Owning local tubes is great, but what we need is public internet infrastructure. Tostay with the road analogy, owning local roads only gets youso far—we need democratic ownership and control over the highways and interstates, too. Tosee why, let’s talk a little more about what the internet is and where it came from. The physical internet is a lot more like a roadsystem than you might think. Informationsuperhighway cliches aside, a functional internet requires physical pathways reaching every home and business in the country (and, increasingly, in the world). Like roadsystems, the physical internet is very expensive to build but confers massive benefits once it is built. Like roads, the physical pathways of the internet are neither very technologically complicated nor likely to change much over time. The ways of packaging and transmitting information are always improving, just like the ways of packaging and transmitting things along roads, but the glass wires that internet information travels through have been in place for decades and will not become overloaded for many more decades. When the telephonesystem was first being built, its challenges were far less technological than logistical. The technology was relativelysimple: every household with a telephone had one pair of continuous copper wires connecting it to a localswitching center. The phone itself was two devices—one near the mouth that converted thesound waves of a person’s voice to a corresponding electricalsignal, and the other near the ear that converted an electricalsignal back to asound wave. Picking up the phone closed that wire’s circuit,connected the wires together, creating an unbroken loop back to theswitching center, where an operator was on the other end of the line. You told the operator which house you wanted to talk to, and they plugged your two wires into the two wires going from theswitching center to that house, creating a continuous loop between you and the person you were calling. The logistics of this are mind-boggling. Everysingle home with a telephone had its own unique pair of wires. Those wires had to make itsafely from the home to theswitching center. Hundreds or thousands of wire pairs had to be color-coded, tagged, and bundled insuch a way that they could be discerned, organized, and repaired at any point along miles and miles of physical distance,strung from pole to pole or running underground. The organization and maintenance of those wires was a monumental task for the tele com industry. And its mostsignificant innovations came not in the form of new types of phones (though there were those), but in ways to cram together multiple conversations into thesamesets of wires and to automate the task of the operators at theswitching centers. The internet feels more distant from this past than it actually is. To exist online is tosend and receive information. To besent and received, that information must takesome physical form. It could be a patterned flow of electrons, a patterned electromagnetic wave, or a patternedseries of flashes from one or multiple lasers. In any case, it has tosomewhere. It has to besent and then received, and it has to traverse physical distance between where it issent and where it is received. For the vast majority of information and the vast majority of the distances it travels, it lives assignals in longstrands of metal or glass. Unlike the early telephonesystem, many households and devices cansharespace on thesamestrands of metal or glass, but that metal and gl assist he internet. The glass—optical fiber line—is a thing of wonder. Fiber has been in widespread use for decades and we haven’t come close to reaching its bandwidth potential. The thing about fiber is that it issimply a medium forsignalling with light. And, because thesignals themselves are merely light flashes, and because light travelsso fast (thoughsomewhatslower in glass than inspace), the number ofsignals that are theoretically possible is very, very large. The only constraint on how much data can travel through fiber right now is how fast we can make a laser flash. As we continue to develop fastersending and receiving equipment, the data capacity of the verysame fiber that has been in use for ten plus years will continue to expand. The internet is not a metaphorical world wide web of connection, it is a world wide web of connection. If I want to video chat with Current Affairs editor Eli Massey using aservice like Zoom while he’s in Cairo, my computer has tosend waves to my router, which converts those waves to patterns of electrons in my home coaxial cable, which heads up to the utility pole behind my building and along utility poles or in trenches to the routers at my local Comcastswitching center—sometimes thesameswitching center the old phone company used, but with the windows bricked in and full ofservers and routers instead of human operators—and from there likely along fiber-opticstrands of glass to a major regionalswitching center, maybe in downtown Los Angeles or Las Vegas, and onwardstill until it hits aswitching center where Zoom hassome co-locatedservers (maybe down thestreet, maybe across the country). Then Zoomsends that data on through moreswitching centers into an undersea cable (yes! my face converted to 0s and 1s encoded into laser flashes whizzing by beneath thesharks and flounders and whales and jellyfish), up under an Egyptian beach and throughsome Egyptianswitching centers until it hits Eli’s router and gets beamed to his computer. Meanwhile his face is making the reverse journey. Who is involved in this world wide web ofstrands of metal and glass carrying bits of ourselves over mountains and under oceans? Your ISP provides connection to your router,so they are the first custodians of everything you do online. But once yoursignal has passed through your router and into a cable that leaves your home, others aresuddenly involved. That cable might be owned by your ISP, or it might be owned by a telephone company, or by your city orstate. Your ISP might just be a tenant, leasing outsomespace (bandwidth) onsomeone else’s physical network. Whoever owns the cable, they probably do not own the poles it isstrung along—those are often owned by the local telephone company or the local power company, and the owner of your cable probably has to leasespace on the pole for your cable. (If your cable goes underground, the cable owner might be leasingspace in an underground pipeline with a lot of cables, or the cable mightsimply lie in a tiny, permit-required trench in the dirt in city-, county-, orstate-owned land.) Your ISP might own the wholeswitching center your data hits first, or it might rentspace for its physical routers insomeone else’sswitching center, or it might rent capacity onsomeone else’s router i nyet anotherparty’sswitching center. Then onto the nextswitching center, on yet more cables, with yet different owners and lessees using yet different poles and/or trenches. Even if your ISP owns the physical cable in your area and is in full control of thesignal and medium from your house to itsswitching center and beyond, it will have to hand yoursignal off tosome other company atsome point. The largest of the glass and metalstrand owners are called Tier 1 networks. Roughly, this means they have enough physical reach to leverage free transfer agreements with the other Tier 1 networks. That is, ifsignals traveling on AT&T fiber need to pass throughsome CenturyLink fiber to get where they’re going, CenturyLink does not charge AT&T, and vice versa. They both ownso much fiber (750,000 miles for CenturyLink, 410,000 for AT&T) that they consider each other “peers” and freely grant access to each others’ networks. Comcast, on the other hand, although the ISP for about 40% of all US internetsubscriptions as of 2011, is not a Tier 1 network. It might have free peering agreements with most fiber owners, but there arestill places on the internet (remember,) where it can’tsend data without payingsomeone to use their fiber. Thissetup presents aserious challenge for the idea of municipal internet promoted by many progressives. The desire to focus on local control, local infrastructure, and local accountability makes perfectsense when you think of your ISP as connecting you to a magical and disembodied internet. But the fact of the matter is that your city cannot provide you with the internet. It will need to link up withsomeone else atsome point. When you try to access a website whose data live on aserver in Council Bluffs, yoursignal needs to get to Iowa and back. Unless you live in Council Bluffs, your city network is not going to get you there. So, withoutsome larger democraticstructure in place, municipal networks aresomewhat at the mercy of the existing internet giants. Even if your local government manages to install a fiber optic connection in every home in town, it willstill have to pay atsome point down the line to access others’ networks andswitching centers. It may have to pay like Comcast for access to those networks andswitching centers, and Comcast will have little incentive to offer access on any reasonable terms to a government entity trying to cut into its profits. This issimilar to the classic net neutrality problem, which is as follows:since Comcast is a private company with theoretically no obligations to the public, why can’t Comcast charge people extra to access high-demand websites like Netflix? What if Comcast decided it doesn’t like Current Affairs, andsimplystopped providing access to our website at all? Andsince the companies that own the wires have largely acquired the companies that produce the content that travels along the wires (Comcast owns NBC, AT&T owns Time Warner, etc.), what if internet providersstarted making their own content much easier to access than the content of their competitors? You cansee how this net neutrality problem could translate to physical networks: what’s tostop Comcast (or CenturyLink or AT&T) from charging entire cities more tosendsignals on the nation- and world-wide networks of wires, or not providing access at all to cities with the temerity toshoulder in on private ISPs’ marketshare? Own the wires, own the internet. There are a few different ways we might confront this problem. One would besimply to build hundreds of thousands of miles of cable and fiber, creating a large enough network to replace the current major players, or at least to achieve Tier 1status and leverage a free data exchange. No public project has attempted this yet, but this has been the go-to move for tech companiesseeking complete internet dominance and control. Google Fiber is an ongoing attempt to build a nationwide fiber optic network, to literallystring Google-owned fiber alongside CenturyLink-owned fiber across the continent, thereby capturing a large chunk of the physicalspace internet for Google alongside its increasing control over the cy berspace of the internet. If Google eversucceeds with this project, traffic via Gmail or Youtube could travel from Google’sservers to your computer without ever passing out of Google’s control. Google isn’t alone in this ambition. Many of the big tech companies that dominate the cy berspace of the internet have been trying to find ways to take over its physicalspace as well. Beyond the prospect of domestic control and profit, expanding internet access to offline parts of the world carries the potential for untold profits. Google had ashort-lived project called Loon that attempted to float wireless routers on massive balloons in the high atmosphere to enable connection in remote areas without the infrastructure for physical cables. Facebook attempted asimilar project using a giantsolar-powered plane, essentially a flying cell tower. Eventually these two projects learned thesame lessons as Motorola’sIridiumsatellite networkandAT&T’s microwave relay tower project: it’s very hard to transmitsignals quickly, cheaply, and reliably through the air. Longstrands of glass are the way to go. That’s not tosay the air isn’tstill in play. Both Tesla and Amazon are in the process of attempting to build networks of hundreds or thousands of low-orbitsatellites to replace thestrands of metal and glass on the Earth’ssurface. The traditional problem withsatellite internet is that you have to be able tosend and receivesignals from asatellite, meaning it has to besomewhere in thesky above you, and not on the otherside of the earth. There are only two ways to makesure there is always asatellite above you. First, you could put thesatellite in geostationary orbit, meaning itstays above thesamespot on thesurface of the Earth at all times. The problem with thisstrategy is that to maintain geostationary orbit,satellites have to be—approximately 22,000 miles abovesea level. That is far enough away that, even travelling at thespeed of light, there is a noticeable lag for data to reach thesatellite and then get back down to its destination on the ground. The other way to makesatellites work is to have a loto f them in lower orbits. In lower orbits thesatellites move much faster,so nosinglesatellite will be over thesamespot for very long. But if you have enough of them, you could get asignal to the closest one and have it relay thesignal between a few more before beaming it down to its destination. Up until now, the main challenge for creatingsuch asystem has been the expense. Launchingsatellites, until recently, has beenveryexpensive. You have to build a whole rocket for each launch. But with the Tesla/SpaceX creation of reusable rockets, building a network of a few thousand low-orbitsatellites has become more feasible. Elon Musk may have cheered thesuccessful rocket reentry for its potential insupplying thespacestation, but he was probably thinking instead about owning the entire internet. Assuming that Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos will not encase the world in more than 10,000satellites to own the internet, and, as nearly all the expertsseem to think, that ground fiber isstill the way to go, what can we do to coordinate democratic municipal ISPs? How can we free them from the grip of giant national fiber owners? Could we accomplish what Google is attempting, but public? Could we lay a democratically controlled and accountable public physical internet alongside the private physical internet currently connecting most homes on the continent?It would be tough, but there aresome regional examples worth examining. In Utah, the Utah Telecommunication Open Infrastructure Agency, or UTOPIA, is a consortium ofsixteen cities working to build a fiber optic network that would reach every home and business across asignificantswathe of thestate. UTOPIA is a public enterprise, funded through government bonds, that is directly competing with the private owners of the physical internet. It makes use of peering agreements with other public and academic networks, thereby expanding its fee-free reach to internet locations around the country. But that reach isstill very limited. UTOPIA owns the fiber in its area, but leases fiber to get to the major data centers outside its immediate area, data centers owned by yet more parties. And though UTOPIA peers with other publicly-minded networks, those networks themselves must pay to reach the privately-controlled bits of the internet. Maybe most interestingly, UTOPIA itself is not an ISP That is, it provides people with the glassstrands, but doesn’t code and carry their internet traffic along thosestrands. It doesn’t run the laser flashes that constitute thesignals. Rather, approved private ISPs operate on UTOPIA’s physical network. UTOPIA calls itself an “opensource” model, meaning that its physical network is available for use by any qualifying ISP, public or private. The idea of UTOPIA is encouraging. That a public agency can viably fundraise and execute construction of a door-to-door fiber optic network, even if only regionally, is asmall proof of concept. It could conceivablyserve as a model for a national UTOPIA, a publicly-funded national network of fiber connecting local, regional, andstatesystems across the country. But UTOPIA’s history calls forsome caution. TheUTOPIA is not an ISP is that public entities in Utah are no tallowed to be ISPs. And the reason they’re not allowed to be ISPs is that, after public internet efforts including UTOPIA initially got off the ground in Utah, the internet giants descended with near unlimited resources to fund lawsuits and lobbying efforts. Theysucceeded in effectively outlawing public internetservice providers in Utah with legislation thanks to the American Legislative Exchange Council (yes, ALEC, the conservative legislative advocacy group responsible for a large percentage of the most private-profit-driven,scourge-of-the-leftstate laws across the country). The mere possibility of a public option for the internet in Utah led to a massive legal and lobbying effort that ended with a law banning public ISPs. The public broadband advocacy organization Community Networks offers an interactive mapshowing the country’s public internet networks, and notes that at least eighteenstates have put up barriers to public internet. The millions of dollarsspent by the likes of Comcast and AT&T to block net neutrality will be a drop in the bucket compared to the effort they will launch at every level of government to prevent any kind of nationwide network toshift power and leverage to local ISPs. If we can’t build our own public, national, physical internet, is there a way we can force the current owners of the internet to act in the public’s interest? Can they be prevented from hamstringing local internet networks? Thissort of move would have historical precedent. The railroads were notoriously built with public money for private profit, often involvingsweetheart deals with associated or co-owned industries at the expense of everyone else. Much like Comcast carrying its own content for free but charging others, railroads would provide cheap or free transport to theirsubsidiaries but would charge others exorbitantly. Once thescandals reached a fever pitch in the 1880s, Congress designated the railroads as “common carriers,” meaning that, given theirstatus as essentialservices, they were legally required to offer theirservices on a fair and equitable basis, and were to be closelyscrutinized by regulators to ensure that was the case. Congress did thesame to the tele com industry in 1934. Rather than breaking up AT&T’s monopoly, or nationalizing the phone lines, Congress enacted a law to force AT&T to carry telephone transmissions from all customers on a fair and equal basis. Congress enacted asmaller butsimilar rule in the 1970s at the behest of the cable industry to restrict AT&T’s control over telephone poles. AT&Tsaw cable as a potential competitor both in terms of telecommunications and for its own plans to offer video delivery in the future. It alsosaw that the cable companies would have tospend a ton of money to run networks of wires if they couldn’t use the existing poles. So the cable companies found themselves being charged exorbitantly to hang cables on poles. The Pole Attachment Act directed the FCC to determine reasonable rates for pole owners to charge and thusset prices for pole leases. The internetseems a natural choice for “common carrier”status. But, through decades of regulatory capture, lawsuits, andsavvy lobbying, internet providers—both ISPs and large networks—have evaded designation as common carriers and maintained an almost wholly deregulated existence. Is now a moment for revisiting thissituation? Nearly the entire American economy is wholly dependent on the internet right now. Those of us who are lucky enough to be working are doingso online. Publicschools are holding Zoom classes and public officials aresuggesting that children locked out of the internet at home (whether due to geography or poverty) go attend class in McDonald’s parking lots. The canard that broadband internet access is a luxury rather than a necessity, although long false, is growing more obviously ludicrous every day. These wires are our highways now. They are the paths we travel to get to work andschool all day every day. Surely they are common carriers. Of course, the viability of this argument looks no better today than it did during the net neutrality fight in 2017. The White House, Congress, and the FCC are aligned in thestrongest possible opposition to any internet regulation. And at the point we have the power to impose common carrierstatus, weshould use that power to do better. It wouldseem ridiculous to countenance a completely privatizedsystem of roads and highways. Even with common carrier rules in place, imagine having to choose and pay for the use of various paths depending on where you’re going, what you’re carrying, what your means of transit are, etc. And imagine having to erect an entire bureaucracy to monitor the maintenance and conduct of the private companies in charge of the roads and highways. Maybe there aresome libertarian readerssalivating at this possibility, but I doubt it will appeal to most. Is there a good reason to treat the internet differently? Sure, we built it in a different way, but that was due more to historical accident than any logical reason. Roads have always been recognized as essential for commerce, and their rights of wayset aside for public use. The advent and prominence of cars came while the depredations of the privatized railroadsystem werestill fresh, and federal andstate governments were all too willing during the Great Depression and in the glut after World War Two to make massive public investments in direct road building (even while it would onlysubsidize private ownership of telephone lines). Politicians looking for ruralsupport pushed through the USPS Rural Free Delivery programstarting in the 1890s, whichspurred the building of public postal roads reaching nearly every home in the country, at great public expense but to immeasurable long term benefit,so that people could get their mail delivered to their doors. One potential rationale for public roads but private tele com is that the tele comsystem is moresusceptible to innovation, and can benefit more from private competition. This hasn’t borne out for a whole host of reasons. AT&T operated as a government-sanctioned “natural monopoly” for decades, and after being forcefully broken up in the 1980s has consolidated nearly all of its former holdings back into itself. And, in fact, there hasn’t been much innovation in tele com or internet hardware in the recent past. Fiber has been in wide use for decades and we haven’t come close to reaching its potential for bandwidth. There might be innovation to be had in thesending and transmitting equipment, which might be a colorable argument for private ISPs on a public fiber backbone,similar to the UTOPIA model. But even this might concede too much. As Vanessa A Bee has written in Current Affairs and In These Times, there is little evidence that market competition is or has ever been necessary for technological innovation. The internet itself, after all, is a creation of public institutions. What am Isuggesting? Nationalize the wires. Rather than attempting to erect a whole newset of fibers to run alongside the existing fibers as a “public option” ofsorts, we need toseize oursoonest opportunity to take public ownership over the nationwide network of cables that is destined to continueserving as essential public infrastructure for the foreseeable future. And just as the federal government provided grants to improve and expand public infrastructure during the New Deal and post-war period, we need to provide funds for local and regional democratically accountable ISPs. This need not involve dismantling the existing ISPs. But a handful of private companiesshould not own the physical wires,the means of access to those wires,andthe content that flows along them all at once.(A note on privacy andsecurity: Asane person may balk at the idea of government owning and controlling the internet. “The internetshould be atechnology. They can alreadysee too much. Do we really want to hand Stephen Miller and Palantir theskeleton key to every bit that travels the wires?” First, don’t kid yourself,the NSA is already in the privateswitching centers. Second, there is nothing more inherently trustworthy about Bank of America, Facebook, Google, AT&T, and Comcast than the government. But this is a legitimate concern. It is, however, a concern that can be dealt with using the right encryption protocols. Just in the past five years hugeswaths of the internet have moved from HTTP to HTTPS, and end-to-end encryption has gone from thestuff of paranoid conspiracy theorists to an expected feature in communication apps. Nosecurity is perfect, and government-owned wires couldstill carry a risk of increased governmentsurveillance, but Peter Thiel and Palantir will end up with your data as thingsstand now, and they will happilysell it to any government that will pay.)The history of nationalizing resources and industries in the USs is complicated. The officialstory is often that “we don’t do that.” But, of course, we do do that. We nationalized the paper currency industry with the creation of the Federal Reserve. We attempted to nationalizesteel to break astrike in 1952. We nationalized passenger railroads in the 1970s. We nationalized most of the mortgage market in 2008 when the Department of Treasury took conservatorship over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We also nationalized General Motors Acceptance Corporation in 2008-09, rebranded it as Ally Financial, andsold it back to private owners in pieces up until 2014. The common thread among these precedents is that westepped in with public money when things were going very badly in order tosubsidize private owners. Then, when things improved, we handed the assets back overso they could continue generating private profits. These past examples are helpful precedents but they have things backwards. Weshould not have waited for a complete collapse of the bankingsystem to nationalize paper currency. Weshould not have waited for a collapse in the housing market to take democratic control over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. So long as we use public money only to bail out private industry, we will forever be responding tosuffering rather than preventing it. How many publicschool children are we going tosend to the McDonald’s parking lot before we understand that internet access is a public good? In a better world, universal public internet access would be a political tool even more effective than the Rural Free Delivery Program. Politicians of allstripes and in all levels of government wouldsee the golden opportunity presented by record dissatisfaction with private ISPs like Comcast, and would jump at the chance to institute a popular, useful program that would expand the economy and provide public works jobs. A champion of community internet would emerge, driving federal grants for municipal ISPs alongside federal andstate programs to buy, build, or co-opt long distance transmission lines andswitching centers. If we have astrong understanding of what it means forsomething to be a public good, we willsee the need to reach beyond defending those we already have—public education, the mail, the roads—and toward the public goods currently in private hands. The wires are a public good, necessary for education and governance and commerce. Whoever controls the physical internet controls a great deal of our lives, and our livesshould be up to. Freedom, as thesaying goes, is participation in power. As the power of the internet grows,so must our participation grow. Isn’t that exactly what democracy is for?For further reading on the physical internet and its ownership and control, check out the following books:",1,1,Current Affairs
29,REPORT: Pfizer Vaccine Confirmed To Cause Neurodegenerative Diseases,24.67,9.0,https://nationalfile.com/report-pfizer-vaccine-confirmed-to-cause-neurodegenerative-diseases/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-file-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-22,25,"Last Updated on April 22, 2021“The current RNA based SARSCoV-2 vaccines were approved in the US using an emergency order without extensive long termsafety testing,” the report declares. “In this paper the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine was evaluated for the potential to induce prion-based disease in vaccine recipients.” Prion-based diseases are, according to the CDC, a form of neurodegenerative diseases, meaning that the Pfizer vaccine is potentially likely to cause long term damage and negative health effects with regards to the brain. This is especially concerningsince the Pfizer vaccine is an mRNA vaccine, an untested type of vaccine which creates new proteins and can actually integrate into the human genome, according to a report from the National Library of Medicine. In other words, degenerative brain conditions may appear at any time in your life after receiving the vaccine.“The RNAsequence of the vaccine as well as thespike protein target interaction were analyzed for the potential to convert intracellular RNA binding proteins TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43) and Fused in Sarcoma (FUS) into their pathologic prion conformations,” explains the report. TDP-43 is a protein known to cause dementia, ALS and even Alzheimer’s, according toAlzpedia. Similarly, the FUS protein is known to cause ALS and Hereditary Essential Tremors, according to theHuman Genome Database. The experiment done for the report was to determine whether or not these two harmful proteins embed themselves into our DNA, as an mRNA vaccine is expected to do. The report determined that “the vaccine RNA hasspecificsequences that may induce TDP-43 and FUS to fold into their pathologic prion confirmations,” meaning that both proteins have the potential to embed themselves into our DNA and cause harmful neurological diseases. The report’s abstractsummary concludes that “The enclosed finding as well as additional potential risks leads the author to believe that regulatory approval of the RNA based vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 was premature and that the vaccine may cause much more harm than benefit.” The report itself ends with this warning: “The vaccine could be a bio weapon and even more dangerous than the original infection.”National File actually reached out to the CDC to inquire as to why the Pfizer vaccine isstill being distributed despite these credible allegations.

30,New Yorkers are counting on Kathy Hochul to change the tenor in Albany (Editorial Board Opinion),-9.33,40.33,https://www.syracuse.com/opinion/2021/08/new-yorkers-are-counting-on-kathy-hochul-to-change-the-tenor-in-albany-editorial-board-opinion.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/syracuse-post-standard-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-11,25,"See ya, Governor Andrew Cuomo. Hiya,soon-to-be Governor Kathy Hochul. Cuomo did the unexpected Tuesday when he announced he would resign under the weight ofsexual harassment allegations. Combative to the end, the governor blamed politics, not himself, for his downfall. But even he couldn’t bend the reality that he had lost the confidence of New Yorkersand his fellow Democrats. Corneredby his accusers and abandoned by his allies, Cuomo did the right thing by quitting. Wenever thoughtwe’dsee it. Technically, westill haven’t. The governorsaid he would resign in 14 days to ensure asmooth transition to his lieutenant governor, Hochul. The grace periodseems unnecessary. Hochul is well-prepared to take over. Hochul,62, a native of Buffalo and a graduate of Syracuse University, has long experience in government. She was a county clerk, a member of Congress and, for the pastsix and a half years, Cuomo’s emissary to every corner of thestate. In many respects, Hochul is the anti-Cuomo. While the governor hunkered down in Albany or New York City,Hochul traveled to all 62 counties to cut ribbons, meet people and introduce herself to local officials. Her talent for retail politics made her friends in every part of thestate, including New York City. Sheshowedsurprising electoralstrength Downstate. In the 2014 Democratic primary, HochulbeatColumbia University law professor Tim Wu, a progressive. In 2018,she thwarted Cuomo’s effort to dump her from the ticket bydefeatingBrooklyn councilor Jumaane Williams in a primary. No otherstatewide elected officials come from Upstate. Hochul will be the first woman to become governor of New York. She will be the first Upstatersince Republican Nathan L Miller, from Solon, Cortland County, was elected in 1920. Cuomo bragged that he did more for Upstate than any previous governor — and rightlyso — but the bar was pretty low. Who’s tosaysomeone from Upstate won’t do more? New York City remains the center of gravity of New York politics. Hochulshould provide a counterweight. Her detractors on the right point to her tendency to flip-flop on key issues, depending on the audience. Her detractors on the leftsayshe is too moderate. Few would argue with Cuomo’s description of her as “smart and competent.” Hochul has a little over a year toshow whatshe can do before having to face the voters in 2022. People who know Hochulsay it is a mistake to underestimate her tenacity and politicalsavvy — traitsshe honed as astudent activist at Syracuse University. New Yorkers are counting on her to change the tenor in Albany. Hochul’s immediate challenge upon taking office is to clean up the toxic atmosphere in the Executive Chamber, as revealed in Attorney General Letitia James’sexual harassment investigation. Hochul also has decisions to make about retaining or replacing Cuomo allies in powerful appointed positions at Empire State Development, the Metropolitan Transit Authority andstate agencies. This is in addition to her main job(s): leading thestate out of the Covid-19 pandemic, managing the economic recovery, working with the Legislature to balance astate budgetsaddled with out-year deficits, andstemming the exodus of New Yorkers to otherstates. After 10 years of Cuomo’ssecretiveness, bullying and casual relationship to ethics, we urge Hochul to lead thestate with integrity, transparency and a collaborativespirit. Cuomo may leave office, but he must not evade accountability. Cuomostill faces various investigations into thesexual harassment allegations, a promised civil lawsuit for allegedly retaliating against an accuser, and probes into the under counting of Covid-19 deaths in nursing homes and the alleged use ofstate resources to produce his Covid leadership book.

31,Virginia’s radical Dems pass despicable bill that makes assaulting a police officer no longer a felony!,25.33,25.67,https://therightscoop.com/virginias-radical-dems-pass-despicable-bill-that-makes-assaulting-a-police-officer-no-longer-a-felony/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-right-scoop-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-27,25,"Virginia Democrats are making their mark on this anti-cop Black Lives Matter movement with an attack on police of their own:– The Virginia Senate passed a bill this week that would downgrade assaulting a police officer in the commonwealth from a felony to a misdemeanor. Senate Bill 5032 would eliminate the mandatory minimum term of confinement for “an assault and battery committed against a judge; magistrate; law-enforcement officer; correctional officer; person directly involved in the care, treatment, orsupervision of inmates; firefighter; or volunteer firefighter or any emergency medicalservices personnel and provides thatsuch crime can no longer be committed as asimple assault and must result in a bodily injury.”The measure to defelonize assaulting an officer was introduced by Virginia Democrats in July, following nationwide calls for police reform in the wake of George Floyd’s death.“Our constituents want change,”state Sen. Mamie Locke, a Democrat,said when introducing the bill. “We hear that loud and clear from them. They want policy change. They’re pretty much done with thoughts and prayers. They’re done with ‘one more discussion’ and hearing ussay, ‘We’ll get it done.’ … They want policy change.”Currently, assaulting a police officer in Virginia is a felony punishable by a minimum ofsix months in jail. The bill will need to be approved by the House in the General Assembly before it goes to Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, also a Democrat, forsignature. Attacking police officers is their answer toso-called police brutality? Wake up Virginians, this is the horrorshow you voted for!This bill isn’t going to do anything but increase the attacks on police officers by Black Lives Matter/Antifa thugs! It will also create a loophole that can be used to claim that or that assaultisn’t really bodily injury. And if Virginia’s corrupt prosecutors, like the one in Portland,suddenly claim they aren’t going to prosecute misdemeanors, then it’s OPEN SEASON on cops for every to bit thug on thestreets!Those in Virginia whostill respect police officers need to pressure the GA not to pass this monstrous bill. And theyshould dare governor blackface tosign it. Because if they don’t and this bill passes, there’s going to be a huge police officer exodus in Virginia like they’ve neverseen before.",0,0,The Right Scoop

Taliban fightersenteredKabul Sunday demanding unconditionalsurrender after wresting nearly the entire country from government control in a matter of weeks. Biden had just pledgedsupport for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani and other leaders ""as theyseek to prevent further bloodshed and pursue a politicalsettlement."" But by Sunday, Ghani had fled the country. Itseemed all that was left for the Biden administration at that hour was damage control. ""This is not Saigon,"" US Secretary of State Antony Blinken argued on CNNSunday morning, rejecting comparisons to the collapse of South Vietnam in 1975 two years after US troops were pulled out. But even as hespoke, helicopters were rushing toe vacuate personnel from the US embassy in Kabul.'Forever war' in Afghanistan resulted in fewer terror attacksAnd behind the broad news of bedlam were voices of thousands reduced to living in abject fear with the Taliban is arrival; many, if not most, of them women who face a crushing and uncertain future ofsubjugation under a famously mysogynistic regime.""Keep us in your prayers,"" a terrified woman hiding in Kabul text ed hersister, an Afghan-American living in the USs, as terrorists raged through the capital. That was her last message. A brief history of Biden is Afghanistan decision-makingsince taking office makes one thing abundantly clear – the disaster that unfolded Sunday did not have to happen. After 20 years of war, there was palpable frustration by most Americans with the failure of threesuccessive presidents to achieve anything other than astalemate in Afghanistan. George Bush is decision to invade Iraq in 2003 drew valuable military resources away from the Afghan fight. One outside chance for peace, however, was apl edge by Taliban leaders last year to open negotiations with the Kabul government. President Donald Trump used this as an excuse to pull all but a few thousand troops out of Afghanistan. This July Fourth, America will leave Afghanistan independence in its death throesBiden could have conditioned any further drawdown on good faith efforts by the Taliban to reach a peacefulsettlement with Kabul. But over the objections of military leaders who warned that the Afghan government would collapse without USsecurity assistance, Biden decided in April toe nd military involvement by September. He promised troop withdrawal would not be hasty. But, in fact, most were gone by early July. (The largest US air base was abandonedsosuddenly that Afghan troops could not even figure out how to turn the electricity back on.)It was a choice with disastrous consequences. Any incentive for the Taliban to negotiate peace was gone. Asecurity umbrella of US air cover that hadstaved off battlefield defeats for Afghan troops evaporated. (Asmall Afghan air force with pilots overworked and targeted for assassination has not been up to the task.) And crucially, the morale disintegrated among front line Afghan troops already poorly fed, denied pay and deprived of bullets and fuel. Hundredssurrenderedwithout firing ashot. Biden needs to learn the lesson of Operation Linebacker""Brother, if no one else fights, whyshould I fight?"" one Afghansoldiersaid, according to a Washington Postreport. A Taliban offensive that began with vacuuming up countless district centers manned bysmall numbers ofsecurity personnel in July accelerated inAugustto the capture of all major cities north,south and west until insurgents reached the gates of Kabul. Shortly before those fighters reached the city, Biden had ordered5,000US troops into Kabul to assist evacuating US personnel, and it was unclear Sunday just exactly what was developing on the ground there. But here is where there is no ambiguity:► Since the Taliban offensive, a growing humanitarian crisis has unfolded with250,000people fleeing their homes, all in the midst of a pandemic. And there are troubling reports of Taliban atrocities andscore-settling.►The White Housesaid20,000Afghans wereseekingspecial immigrant visas fearing for their lives because of working with Americans. They have tens of thousands of family members. How many got out and how many were left behind?►Others in danger include women activists who alsoshould have been included in any evacuations.►Biden is ""America is back"" foreign-policy pledge to the world after years of Trump is global fecklessness now lies in ruins. The president may have decided in April to militarily abandon Afghanistan to avoid further US troop casualties. But he may wind up with the blood of US friends and freedom activists on his hands, not only because of his decision toso rapidly exit, but because of his ensuing failure to carry out that mission before the Taliban aggression he unwittingly unleashed changed everything.",1,2,USA Today
33,Fox News judge explains why he would “certainly” vote to impeach President Trump,-14.0,42.0,https://www.salon.com/2019/12/05/fox-news-judge-explains-why-he-would-certainly-vote-to-impeach-president-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2019-12-05,25,"Fox News Judge Andrew Napolitano declared Wednesday that he would ""certainly"" vote to impeach President Donald Trump if he was a member of Congress. During an appearance on ""America is Newsroom,"" Napolitano asserted his belief that ""the Democrats have credibly argued that [Trump] committed impeachable offenses"" in the Ukrainescandal.""The easiest one — because this existed in Andrew Johnson, Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton — is obstruction of Congress,"" hesaid. ""So — by directing hissubordinates to refuse to comply with lawfully issuedsubpoenas, whether it is for testimony or for documents — that is an impeachable offense.""Napolitano continued, ""We know that from history, every time the House of Representatives has looked at that with respect to a president. It has found it to be impeachable. On that, reasonable minds cannot disagree without rejecting history and without rejecting constitutional norms.""At the heart of the impeachment inquiry are allegations that Trump attempted to leverage a White House meeting and millions in military aid,sought by Ukraine in the face of Russian aggression, to pressure Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate former Vice President Joe Biden and hisson, Hunter, as well as an unsubstantiated theory that the Ukrainian government had conspired with Democrats to interfere in the 2016 presidential election. On Wednesday, Fox News host Bill Hemmer asked Napolitano, ""If you were in the House, would you vote for impeachment?""""I certainly would. I am never going to be in the House,"" Napolitanosaid with a laugh, before adding, ""I would on that count.""The judge went on to note that ""reasonable minds"" could disagree on Trump is reasoning for withholding million in military aid for Ukraine which had been approved by Congress.""What was the president is intent when he held up this aid?"" Napolitano asked. ""Was it truly to eradicate corruption in Ukraine? Was he truly concerned that American taxpayer dollars would go into the hands of crooks? Or was he looking to use the instruments of a foreign government to help his political campaign?""Later on in theshow, Napolitano weighed in on the House Judiciary Committee is Wednesday hearing in the impeachment inquiry,saying that it likely would not change public opinion. However, he warned that ""letting Trump be Trump is not good enough under the Constitution.""""We do not lower the bar because the president has unorthodox ways,"" the former judge added. ""The bar is intentionally broad and even ambiguous as to what high crimes and misdemeanors are. We learned today that the Democrats apparently intend to include in there things we did not know they were going to include, like bribery, like the obstruction of justice allegations which were made by (formerspecial counsel) Bob Mueller long before the Ukraine case came to the public is attention.""At Wednesday is hearing, the House Judiciary Committee, which has jurisdiction over drafting articles of impeachment, heard testimony from four constitutionalscholars about the legal and historical underpinnings of the process. Three law experts called by Democratssaid Trump committed impeachable offenses, while one called by Republicans offered the lone dissent. Also at Wednesday is hearing, the panel is chairman, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-NY,suggested that issues in Mueller is report into Russian interference in the 2016 election could be included in eventual articles of impeachment. Nadler argued that Trump had obstructed justice both during Mueller is investigation and the House is impeachment inquiry. In his openingstatement, Nadlersaid Trump is latest actionsshowed a ""pattern of conduct""seensince his first year in the Oval Office.""When his own Department of Justice tried to uncover the extent to which a foreign government had broken our laws, President Trump took extraordinary and unprecedentedsteps to obstruct the investigation, including ignoringsubpoenas, ordering the creation of false records and publicly attacking and intimidating witnesses,"" hesaid. ""Then, as now, this administration is level of obstruction is without precedent.""",1,1,Salon

During the course of Trump is presidency, more than 41,000 visa requests weredenied(pdf) under the ban, which ripped families apart, prevented people from the proscribed countries from gettinghealthcareandeducationin the US, and deprived the USs of doctors, nurses, and other medical workers during the coronavirus pandemic. There was a greatsense of joy and relief at the ban is demise. The NO BAN Act Coalition, a broad alliance of 81 national and local civil rights, faith, and community groups fighting for anti-discrimination legislation that is now included in Biden is US Citizenship Act, issued astatement bidding ""goodbye to the Muslim and African ban.""Thestatement continued:Almost four years ago, one of President [Donald] Trump is first acts in office was to ban Muslims from the USs. Three years later, he expanded the ban to includeseveral African countries. Today, it is fitting that one of Biden is first acts is to rescind the Muslim and African Ban. This is a momentous occasion for the millions of Americans who wereseparated by the ban and those whostood up against this injustice at airports nationwide. Thank you, President Biden forstaying true to your promise to repeal this bigoted policy immediately. The Muslim and African Ban was never about nationalsecurity, it was always rooted in bigotry and called into question what values Americastands for. However, just ending the ban through an executive order will notstop this from happening again. That is why we applaud the historic inclusion of the NO BAN Act in the US Citizenship Act of 2021. Zahra Billoo, executive director of the Council on American-Islamic Relations-San Francisco Bay Area,toldthat Biden is order would ""correct the course"" of the lives disrupted by Trump.""Tens of thousands of impacted individuals will now have the chance to be with their families during cherished and challenging times,""said Billoo. ""While we know our work is far from over, today we celebrate the heroic efforts undertaken byso many over the lastseveral years in our effort to repeal the Muslim and African bans.""Some of the most poignant reaction to the end of the ban came from people directly affected by it. Ramez Alghazzouli, a Syrian immigrant who had beenseparated from his wife for a year due to the policy, told it felt like a boulder had been removed from his chest. But he alsosaid the travel prohibition irreparably damaged his family.""The ban itself will be reversed but no one can reverse our feelings and emotions and the time we lost while beingseparated from each other,""said Alghazzouli. ""It willstill be part of our life and history. The Muslim ban is the nuke that wesurvived but we arestillsuffering from its collateral damage.""There was noshortage ofsuggestions on what Biden could do help heal the harm caused by travel ban, from ending Trump-era ""extreme vetting"" of Muslims and others entering the US, to increasing the number of refugees allowed into the country, to ending US wars that have killed at least hundreds of thousands of Muslim men, women, and childrensince 2001.",1,1,Common Dreams

Nancy Stone, Chicago TribuneHouse Speaker Michael Madiganstands on the podium May 31, 2009, while Rep. John Fritcheyspeaks in favor of the tax bill. For years, Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan has defended his aggressive push to land political allies and their friends and family on taxpayer-funded payrolls, but rarely has he waxed as philosophically about it as he did last week in a three-page letter. Facing intense pressure from a federal investigation into ComEd’s bribes-for-favorsscandal anda n invitation from a House corruption committee to tell the public what he knows, Madigan’s missive broke two months of nearsilence. The powerfulspeaker loudly proclaimed his innocence and tried to reframe his penchant for patronage hiring as a virtue. Not only is “helping people find jobs not a crime,” Madigan wrote, it’s not even “ethically improper” for politicians to make job recommendations.“To the contrary, I believe that it is part of my duties as a community and political leader to help good people find work — from potential executives to college interns, and more,” wrote the 78-year-old Illinois Democratic Party chairman, alluding tosome of the very jobs that prosecutors brought up in charging ComEd with crimes. “What an employer chooses to do with that recommendation restssolely with their discretion.”What Madigan didn’t mention when discussing the numerous jobs he’ssecured for people during more than 50 years in politics is how that practice has benefited him and what it’s cost taxpayers and electricity ratepayers. The Tribune hasspent the last decade chronicling how it works: Patronage jobs are the lifeblood of Madigan’s political organization. And the people Madigan recommends be hired oftenserve as footsoldiers on the campaigns for the very legislativeseats that allow thespeaker tostay in power. In turn, that control of the House is key to helping Madigan bring in clients at his law firm, which handles high-dollar property tax appeals onsome of Chicago’s biggest buildings. Starting in 2010,the Tribune published the “The Madigan Rules,” a first-of-its-kind, years long investigation that exposed how thespeaker built his political empire and law practice, revealing how those two careers repeatedly intersected. The report found that insome cases Madigan took public actions that benefited his private clients, though thespeakersaid his “personal code of conduct” ensured he maintained “high ethicalstandards.”In 2013, the legislature’s watchdog investigated Madigan’s role in a Metrascandal after the commuter rail agency’s then-executive director contended he was muscled out for not acceding to thespeaker’s patronage demands. More recently, Madigan even answered questions about patronage under oath in what hesaid was his first-ever deposition. During testimony as part of a lawsuit, Madigan made clear he knows the finer points of his vaunted patronage army. Beyond that, the current ComEd probe has put under thespotlight another practice that’s gone on at the Capitol under Madigan: the cycle of House Democraticstaffers and friendly lawmakers who leave and then land a heftystable of lobbying clients in part based on their perceived access to thespeaker. Those lobbyists often become part of a campaign fundraising network that provides money to help Madigan-backed candidates. Though they’re not drawing a governmentsalary, those lobbyists also contribute to the policies enacted in Springfield that affect the pockets of taxpayers. Thespeaker has not been charged in the ComEd case. He has denied wrongdoing.“As I havesaid before, I have done nothing wrong,” Madigan wrote in his letter, which explained why he would not appear before the House panel looking at the ComEdscandal. “I believe that (the federal) investigation, once all of the facts are made available to the public, will demonstrate that I have not engaged in any improper conduct.”Speaker’s playbookWhile the ComEd investigation represents the gravest threat Madigan has faced to his reign, it’s not the first time his government and political operation has come under publicscrutiny. In its investigativeseries, the Tribune reported that public recordsshowed Madigan’s law firm in 2008 represented 45 of the 150 most valuable downtown buildings ? more than twice what the closest rival represented. Some clientssaid it’s not thatsimple toseparate the expert tax assistance the firm provides from the political reputation of the man whose name is on the door. At that time, Madigan ally Joe Berriossat in judgment over property tax appeals that Madigan’s firm filed. Berrios doubled as astate lobbyist, plying his trade inside a Capitol where Madigan heldsway. In 2010, Madigan helped Berrios get elected county assessor, giving him power over how all property is valued for property tax purposes. Madigan’s firm did well on appeals when Berrioswas assessor. The Tribune also found Madigan took public actions that benefited his private clients. As a public official, he got a private road behind ashopping mall repaved, helpedsecurestate funding for an expanded tollway interchange and intervened for a developer looking forstate cash. In each case, Madigan was a private lawyer for business people whostood to benefit. Madigansaid there were no conflicts of interest in the Tribune’s findings, which he described as “strained attempts to link my legislative actions to clients of the firm who might remotely and incidentally ‘benefit’ fromsuch action.”In 2012,the Tribune reported on how a large operator of assisted living homessigned on with Madigan’s law firm and found itself withseveral Springfield wins. Nursing homes, pharmacies and other assisted living companies in recent years all have hired the property tax law firm where Madigan is the rainmaker-in-chief. Asspeaker, Madigan made decisions affecting the fortunes of many companies that put money in his pocket, the Tribune found. Madigansaid he abides by a written personal code of conduct to avoid conflicts on matters involving clients. In addition,the Tribune in 2014documented more than 400 current or retiredstate and local government employees who worked elections for Madigan, donated regularly to his campaign funds, registered voters for him or circulated candidate petitions on his behalf. The investigation also found repeated instances in which Madigan took personal action to get them jobs, promotions or raises. From the ranks of those workers, Madigan built the most potent ground game in Illinois politics, which he has used to influence elections in every corner of thestate, especiallystate House races. One of those political workers, Raymond Nice, had asix-figure job at the Cook County recorder of deeds office and later briefly was appointed to a county employee panel. More recently, prosecutors alleged that Nice was designated asubcontractor and had payments funneled to him through a ComEd lobbyist. Nice did little or no work, prosecutorssaid. MetrascandalThat look at Madigan’s patronage army wasspurred by ascandal at Metra over whether thespeaker went astep too far in trying to exert his clout as he navigated the intersection of public business and ward-style patronage through his Chicago office and Illinois Capitolsuite. Metra CEO Alex Clifford contended his tenure wasshortened because he didn’t bow to Madigan’s patronage demands. According to Clifford, thespeaker wanted Metra to give a raise to a 13th Ward acolyte who was a labor relationsspecialist andsecure a job for another person who was not identified. Clifford refused. In the end, he walked away with aseverance package worth up to $871,000 — a controversy that ended up with public hearings.“I thought it was an ethical and moral character flaw,” Clifford testified about Madigan’s actions. Asecret 2014 watchdog report obtained by the Tribuneconcluded that “insufficient evidence” existed tosay Madigan violated thestate ethics act or other related laws in the Metrascandal. But Thomas Homer, the legislative inspector general at the time, issued astatement noting that “a decision to close an investigation based on insufficient evidence does not constitute a Good Housekeepingseal of approval or a best practices award.”Madigan, who requested the Metra investigation at the height of thescandal, was quoted in the report asspeaking highly of one operative thespeaker backed for a promotion.“You can understand that there are many people that are involved with me and campaigns and communityservice. Among these many people,some are better than others. (He) happens to be one of those who is better than others,” thespeaker issaid to have told Homer. The report also highlighted how Metra’s then-board chair once entered Madigan’s Capitol office to talk about government issues and left with a yellow Post-it note bearing the names of two workers thespeaker wanted tosee promoted — moves the board chair later told the Tribuneshe didn’t make. And the report outlined how Clifford recalled asimilar meeting in which a then-Metra lobbyist withstrong Madigan ties wasspotted carrying two resumes out of Madigan’s office. In his report, Homer wrote that the proximity of Madigan’s discussions first about government issues and thenshifting to his favored employees “created the impression among Metra officials that thespeaker’ssupport for Metra’s legislative initiatives may be linked.”“While this may not have been thespeaker’s intention,” Homer wrote, “the natural inferences to be drawn by Metra officialsshould have been obvious.”ComEd probeLong ago, Madigan learned the ways of Chicago-style patronage under his mentor the late Mayor Richard J Daley. Since then, Madigan has madeso many inroads that at least one pocket of government has earned a nickname in his honor. At the city’s Streets and Sanitation Department’s bureau of electricity, Madigan enjoyedsuchsuccess in placing people that the agency became known as “Madigan Electric.”That nickname has taken on a different context as thespeaker has been linked to the ComEdscandal. ComEd has admitted in federal court that itsought to influence legislation in Springfield by arranging for jobs and vendorsubcontracts for Madigan’s political allies, approved lobbyists and ward operatives even in instances where they performed little or no work. For instance, ComEd allegedly agreed in May 2018 to pay $5,000 a month to retiring 23rd Ward Ald. Mike Zalewski, an ally from Madigan’s Southwest Sidesphere of political influence, as part of a “roster” of Madigan associates. Former Ald. Frank Olivo, who represented Madigan’s 13th Ward power base for years, is among those identified as getting a ComEdsubcontract. Victor Reyes, thespeaker’s onetime ally, a former political operative for Mayor Richard M Daley and founder of the now-defunct patronage army the Hispanic Democratic Organization, is in a law firm identified as receiving ComEd legal contracts. The deal wasset toshrink, but Reyes talked to a Madigan ally to try tosave it from the chopping block, according to federal court records and testimony from a ComEd official. One 2019 meeting involving ComEd officials described matter-of-factly how Madigan had named people for decades to hold lower-ranking power company jobs,such as meter readers ? what onespeaker ally called part of an “old-fashioned patronagesystem,” according to federal authorities. As part of an agreement with prosecutors, ComEdis paying a $200 million fine, the largest ever at Chicago’s federal courthouse. In exchange, federal authorities will drop a charge of bribery against ComEd after three years if the power company cooperates. The federal filings on ComEd also include allegations of Madigan clout involving an individual who was well-versed in thespeaker’s ways. Juan Ochoa, the former head of the Metropolitan Pier and Exposition Authority,told the Tribunefor a 2014story that Madigan called him to request a raise for the daughter of a formerstatesenator who once represented Madigan’s Southwest Side neighborhood. Ochoasaid the daughter was a hard worker who deserved a raise, andshe got it after Madigan’s call.“I didn’t feel like he was putting a gun to me but, then again, he is thespeaker of the House,” Ochoa explained at the time. “This wassomeone who is important to thespeaker of the House, who to a great extent controlled our legislation and funding.”These days, federal prosecutors have alleged that in 2017, Madigansought to appoint Ochoa to ComEd’s board of directors. The request was made by longtime ComEd lobbyist and Madigan confidant Michael McClain to then-ComEd CEO Anne Pramaggiore, prosecutorssaid. Pramaggiore received internal company resistance and asked McClain if Madigan would besatisfied ifshesecured a $78,000 part-time job for Ochoa rather than the boardseat, but McClainsaid thespeaker would appreciate ifshe’d “keep pressing,” according to court documents. Around September 2018, having been elevated to an executive post with Exelon, Pramaggiore allegedly reassured McClain: “You take good care of me andso does our friend (meaning Madigan), and I will do the best that I can to, to take care of you.”Ochoa was appointed in April 2019, but he is no longer on ComEd’s board. Madigan’s ties to the ComEdscandal were on display on two fronts this week. In Chicago, former ComEd executive Fidel Marquez, who oversaw lobbying efforts,pleaded guilty to bribery conspiracy for participating in a long-running jobsscheme designed to influence Madigan’s legislative decisions. In Springfield, Democrats and Republicans in the House debated whether thespeaker conducted himself in a manner unbecoming of a lawmaker. The proceedings were part of an evenlysplit Special Investigative Committee, one that the nation’s longest-serving legislative leader dismisses as a Republican “stunt” to get free media coverage before the November election. DemocratsrejectedRepublican attempts tosubpoena Madigan, Marquez and a lineup of thespeaker’s associates who allegedly benefited from jobs and contracts. Madigan’s letter to the committee loomed large at a hearing, where House Republican leader Jim Durkin maintained Democrats would have to disregard ComEd’s admissions to believe thespeaker “didn’t know what was going on around him.”In his letter, though, Madigan maintained that ComEd’s agreement with federal prosecutors “does not attribute any misconduct to me. It asserts that certain individuals at ComEd hired individuals I purportedly recommended in an attempt to influence me. But let be me clear: that attempt was never made known to me — if it had been, it would have been profoundly unwelcome.”Under oathWhat does Madigan look for when he makes a job recommendation?A Madigan deposition the Tribunefirst disclosed last year gave a few clues. He acknowledged giving recommendations on behalf of a number of members of his 13th Ward organization for government jobs, ranging from the offices of Illinois Secretary of State Jesse White to Cook County’s circuit court clerk. Madigan knew the whereabouts of his troopsso well that when he was asked about a policy analyst at City Hall, thespeaker recalled that person, a member of his ward organization, hadswitched over to a job at a different government agency.“I recommended him to the (Chicago Housing Authority),” Madigan testified. And he was hired, an attorney asked? “He was hired.”Madigan also had a recommendation to replace the retiring Zalewski in the neighboring 23rd Wardseat when the alderman left the City Council:state Rep. Silvana Tabares. Who did you talk to, thespeaker was asked?“Rahm Emanuel,” Madigansaid. The then-mayor appointed Tabares to theseat. At another point, Madigan was pressed on whether it is hisstandard practice to recommend precinct captains for positions in various levels of government.“You can understand that many people come to me asking for recommendations for employment, and I render recommendations for employment in both the private and the publicsector. I do it in both. But there’s a test that people have to meet,” he replied.“They have to be, to my knowledge, they have to be honest, hardworking people with integrity. And if they are, I’ll recommend to a potential employer the best of my knowledge and my experience with this person, this would be a good worker for your office, a good worker for your business whatever it may be.”rlong@chicagotribune.com",2,2,Chicago Tribune

In fact, Daszak has been very open with the research conducted atsaid labroratory, which has beensuggested as a potentialsource for the COVID-19 outbreak. National File reported this week on the emergence of a video from Daszak from December 2019, where he boasts about manipulating coronavirus es in the lab. “Coronaviruses are pretty good… you can manipulate them in the lab pretty easily,” Daszaksaid in the interview posted to YouTube. “Thespiked proteins drive a lot about what happens. You can get thesequence you can build the protein, we work with Ralph Baric at UNC to do this, insert into the backbone of another virus and dosome work in a lab.”Yet despite this open admittance into the manipulation of coronaviruses, Daszak has been one of the loudest voices against the “lab-leak” theory, dismissing it as a “conspiracy theory,” and organising multiple actions trying toshut it down. In February 2020,he was behind a letter from multiplescientists rubbishing the theory, and only one week later,coauthored a paper from the NEJMwhichstated that “scientists tell us that SARS-CoV-2 did not escape from a jar,” contrasting the outbreak to the Greek myth of Pandora’s Box. This paper, in fact,shows further ties between Daszak and Fauci. Recently published em ailsshow that Fauci, in fact, was given access to the paper beforehand, and even asked if he wanted to coauthor the paper.2/ That was the first public effort to use a bigscientific journal tosteer attention from the lab. A week later, Daszak didso again, with an@NEJMpaper insisting the virus had to be natural. Guess whosaw the paper in advance and was asked to coauthor it?Dr. Anthony Fauci.— Alex Berenson (@AlexBerenson)June 3, 2021The first part of the email fromGreg Folkers,Fauci’s Chief of Staff at the NIAID, is redacted, but likely containssome discussion regarding the upcoming paper. “So the question to you – do you want to be a part of this? ie [sic] be a coauthor,” Folkers asks Fauci. “I would vote no – it wud [sic] look weird to add you as a coauthor now. Plus, plate too full,” he continues. “I agree,” Fauci curtly replied. “I will not be a co-author.”As National File reported,Daszak had praised Fauci for dismissing the lab leak theory, despite further em ailsshowing that he was initially concerned aboutsuch an event having occurred:“As the PI of the R01 grant publicly targeted by Fox News reporters at the Presidential press briefing last night, I just wanted tosay a personal thankyou [sic] on behalf of ourstaff and collaborators, for publiclystanding up andstating that thescientific evidencesupports a natural origin for COVID-19 from a bat-to-humanspillover, not a lab release from the Wuhan Institute of Virology,” Daszaksaid. “From my perspective, your comments are brave, and coming from your trusted voice, will help dispel the myths beingspun around the virus’ origins,” he continued, expressing his wish to thank Fauci in person. Only a few months after that email, Fauci helped restore funding to Daszak’s EcoHealth Alliance, which President Trump’s administration had cut off over fears that the organisation had indulged in the potentially deadly “gain of function” experiments that led to the COVID-19 outbreak. Despite the treasure trove of thousands of em ails from Fauci being legally obtained from Freedom of Information Act requests, Big Tech has worked toshut down access to these em ails from the general public. The Informed Consent Action Network was locked out of their Twitter account twice in 24 hours after they publicized that they had acquired 2,957 em ailssent from Anthony Fauci between February and May of last year. Following National File’s reporting, their account and two tweets were restored,with Twitter claiming that they had doneso “in error.”",1,0,National File

He got a week for contempt of court. It wasn’t a big deal. He’s a tough enough guy. But that’s not what I want to write about. I want to write about what he told me related to medical care in jail. He was in jail in Arlington County, Virginia, one of the wealthiest counties in America. Hesaid the jail was actually quite nice. It was clean, the cells werespacious, and the deputies whoserved as guards couldn’t have been any more pleasant and respectful. And although the food was terrible, things could have been worse — except, that is, when it came to medical care. When my friend was first processed, he met with a nurse, who interviewed him about his current medical conditions. My friendsuffers from diabetes, and he’s on three prescription drugs for it. He’s alsosupposed to eat a low-carb diet to preventspikes in his bloodsugar. He answered all of the nurse’s questions and was told that he would receive all of his medications after dinner that evening.toConsortium News’But the meds never arrived. He was awakened at 4:30 a.m. every day to have his bloodsugar checked, and it was checked again every afternoon at 3:30 orso. But the medication never arrived. Meanwhile, his bloodsugar and blood pressure moved higher and higher. He complained every time a nurse came to check his bloodsugar levels that he hadn’t received any medication and he was going through withdrawal. All that did was to cause the nurses tosimplystop coming. Nobody checked his bloodsugar for his last three days in jail. There’s a business reason why the nurses threw my friend under the bus. They took a calculated risk that he wouldn’t die of a diabetes-relatedstroke or heart attack before being released. Imagine doing that for 1,000 patients. Or 1,000,000. If each patient’s medication costs $5 a day, that adds up to real money. And that’s the business model forCorizon Health, the country’s largest provider of for-profit “medical care” in American prisons. The company is contracted with 534 prisons and jails in 27states, and it treats 15 percent of all the prisoners in the USs. According to the American Civil Liberties Union, Corizon has be ensued 660 timesin the past five years for wrongful death, providingsubstandard medical care and inadequatestaffing. It has been fined untold millions of dollars. But the companysees that as the price of doing business. Again, they can make more money by just not treating people and hoping that they don’t die than they can by actually providing medical care and then paying court-ordered legalsettlements. Take as just one example the case ofMarques Davis. The 27-year-old was a prisoner in the Kansas Department of Corrections, where Corizon has an exclusive contract to provide medical care. Davis went to a Corizon nursesaying that he felt weakness in his arms and legs. The nurse determined that Davis was “malingering,” that is, making it all upso he didn’t have to work. Months later, with the numbness worsening, Davis began to complain that he felt likesomething was “eating his brain.” In fact,something eating his brain. It was an untreated fungus that caused his vision to blur, hisspeech toslur and his cognition to becomeso impaired that he began to drink his own urine. Davis finally had a heart attack and was taken to a local Kansas City hospital. A CTscan revealed “dramaticswelling of the brain.” A day later, he was dead. Davis’ lawyer hopes to prove in court that this was not an isolated incident, but “a clear and consistent pattern of Corizon delaying, postponing, or not providing necessary medical treatment.” AnACLUspokesmansaid, “Corizon issimply writing off the damages they’re having to pay as the cost of doing business without doing anything meaningful to improve.”The only way to force change and to try tostop these atrocities from happening is in the courts. So far, Corizon hasshown that itsimply doesn’t care what the courtssay about its behavior or about the depravity of its business model. Arizona, however, has an idea. Afterscores of lawsuits against the company for failing to provide adequate care to prisoners and for failing to make any improvements in the delivery of healthcare, despite court orders to doso, Arizonasimply threw Corizon out of thestate. And then thestate legislature passed a (nonbinding) resolution urging private equity firms based in Arizona to divest themselves of Corizonstock. Corizon leaders huffed and puffed and releasedstatementssaying that they had been wronged. They also did nothing to improve healthcare. But if 49 otherstates did thesame thing, at least Corizon medical professionals couldn’t kill any more innocent people.toConsortium News’Post Views:527",1,0,Consortium News

A generation. What is left to besaid?Haven’t wesaid it all? The names, the images, thestories of tragedy and heroism. The lives lost, the lives changed forever. God willing, thestories will be told for as long as there issomeone to tell them—the individual tales thatso encapsulate the things upon which our civilization is founded. The police officer, the firefighter, the chaplain, the office colleague who went back just one more time, the one who ran up thestairwell after thesecond impact, just to makesure that another innocent life, the life of astranger, a colleague, a friend, a loved one, was rescued. Thestories of those who died,sacrificing their lives in what our Lord and Savior instructed us is the ultimate act of love; “Greater love has no one than this, thatsomeone lay down his life for his friends.”The West—our civilization—is unique and the greatest of all civilizations that have ever existed because it rejects the culturalselfishness of the East, where the collective decides what is of import and the individual is, ultimately, expendable. Likewise it rejects the culture of the Middle East, where all that matters is power, whose tribe or clan is the most feared, or which can destroy the most. Ours issuch a peculiar civilization in that it eschews the natural instinct to parochialism and power—jettisoning theseemingly genetically obvious “Me First!” instinct—replacing it with the exhortation “servus,” I am yourservant, unto death if necessary. The mere fact that our Christian world’s greatestsymbol is the Cross, a barbaric tool of torture and death, is remarkable. The persecuted are thesaved. The persecuted are chosen. The persecuted, those marked for death, have already won. Forever. For these reasons, I choose tosee the heart of 9/11 this way, as the greatest affirmationsince the Civil War of our Christian heritage and the Christian values built into the founding of this, the greatest nation on God’s Earth, peopled by the greatest and mostself-sacrificial and grace-filled citizenry in the world. But thisshould be obvious to anyone who loves America and understands that the West truly is the apotheosis of human culture. But remarkably, there issomething missing in the conventional wisdom about September 11, an undeniable fact that the “elite” denied then and, incredibly, denies even more robustly today. Man is fallen. He cannot be “perfected.” Ask anyone who actually lived under a regime whichsees as its putative objective, the creation of a “better” man, be it Robespierre’s Paris Commune (a realinsurrection), Lenin’s “Workers’ Paradise,” Mao’s China, or Pol Pot’s Khmer Rouge. Man can choose—individually—to fight his innate and basest tendencies, but his naturalstate has been thesamesince the first Neanderthal prized his neighbor’s mate or coveted his hunting trophies and killed to obtain them. It matters not where or when it is, Man is always a fallen creature. Ask those herded into the concentration camps of the Balkans less than 30 years ago, or the Yazidi girlssold intosexualslavery by ISIS after Obamaso precipitously withdrew our forces from Iraq just a decade ago. And this is the most important lesson on the anniversary of the events from thatsunny Tuesday morning 20 years ago. Evil is real. It lurks in the hearts of men, it walks the Earth and will until Judgment Day. It is remarkable to think that 9/11 didn’t forever convince our “betters” of this truth. The imagery of people jumping from the Twin Towers to their deaths, the towers collapsing—the devastation jihad is brought to New York, DC, and Pennsylvania. But it didn’t. Nor did the manual decapitation on camera of US citizens, the mass murder of Egyptian Christians on theshores of an ISIS-controlled Caliphate, or even the broadcast immolation of a Jordanian pilot captured by those calling themselves warriors for Allah. Yet now we witness thoseself-same “experts” declare their hope for an inclusive Taliban government that willstrive for “legitimacy.” This is worse than cretinism, it is a psychotic level ofself-delusion. Evil is real. It walks the Earth today and it must be met with courage and brute force until it is crushed, just as it was when we entered the White House toserve a commander-in-chief who vowed to destroy the physical caliphate of ISIS Which we did in just five months, despite being told by Obama that it was a “generational threat” which we just had to get used to enduring. And now, just eight months after President Trump left the White House, the jihad is who protected and gavesuccor to 9/11 mastermind Osama bin Laden not only control Afghanistan, they have $83 billion worth of weapons Biden gave them, as well as new allies who also hate us, including the world’s greatest Communist dictatorship, China. Thanks to delusional, feckless cowards in Washington, there will be another 9/11 and only those who understand the true lesson of 20 years ago cansave us from it.",0,0,American Greatness

Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.)saved roughly $38,000 in taxes thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Republican-passed tax cut championed by President Donald Trump which the recently admitted cut most Americans' taxes. Sanders released ten years' worth oft ax returnsMonday night, fulfilling a long-standing promise to doso. The returns indicated that Sanders is now a millionaire, having collected more than $1 million in 2016 and 2017 thanks to thesales from his booksandBernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution. Sandersdodged questions about his new-found wealth during a Monday night town hall on Fox, declining tosay if he would pay a top tax rate of 52 percent, the highest bracket proposed during his 2016 run for the White House. He also did not respond to a question from Fox is Martha MacCallum about if he would voluntarily give money to the government to bring his tax bill up to what he thought a fair rate was. If he did, or if his tax plan were implemented, Sanders would increase his tax liability by nearly 30 percent, analysis of his tax returns indicates. Sanders has not announced anysubstantive changes to the income taxsystem during his 2020 run. However, during his 2016 run, Sanders floated a comprehensive overhaul to the taxsystem in order to help pay for his proposed Medicare-for-All plan. According to analysis from the right-leaning Tax Foundation, Sanders is 2016 proposal would add four new top tax brackets with rates of 37 percent, 43 percent, 48 percent, and 52 percent, It would also add a 2.2 percent ""income-based [health care] premium paid by households,"" which the Tax Foundation writerssay is ""equivalent to increasing all tax bracket rates by 2.2 percentage points.""Using the Tax Foundation is estimates of Sanders is brackets, as well as thesenator is reported 2018 taxable income of $519,529, we can estimate a total tax liability under hisschema of $170,240.11. If Sanders were paying taxes under his own plan, he would beshelling out an additional $36,819.11 to the government, and have a tax liability of 32.7 percent of his income. Luckily for his finances, Sanders does not live under his own tax regime. Rather, Sanders enjoyed a tax cut thanks to the TCJA, just like millions of other Americans.""Eversince President Trumpsigned the Republican-sponsored tax bill in December 2017, independent analyses have consistently found that a large majority of Americans would owe less because of the law,""reporters Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley wrote on Sunday. ""Preliminary data based on tax filings hasshown thesame.""Multiple tax-policy think tanks have provided tools to estimate tax liability with and without the TCJA Using the information provided in Sanders is 2018 tax return, these calculators indicate major benefits to his bottom line from the TCJA. (Note: these estimators make a number of assumptions, andso may not perfectly reflect Sanders is real tax liability without the TCJA.)One tool, provided by the Tax Policy Center (a joint project of the left-leaning Urban Institute and Brookings Institute) estimates that Sanders is income tax liability without the TCJA would have been $144,451; with the tax law, it fell to $106,782, a drop of $37,669. Another estimator from the Tax Foundation estimates a total tax liability (including payroll) of $188,753.06 before the bill and $149,773.88 afterwards, a $38,979.18 drop. In other words, the TCJA—which Sandersvoted against—saved him nearly $40,000 in taxes in 2018, roughly the additional tax burden he would have to face if his preferred tax code was implemented.2020 Election,Bernie Sanders,Taxes,Trump Administration",1,1,Washington Free Beacon

As those examples reflect, Trump is acts of clemency mixed favors to cronies with relief for genuinely deserving federal prisoners hit with grossly disproportionate penalties. Thecontroversyover his choices highlights longstanding problems with a clemencysystem that is a woefully inadequate remedy for the injustices routinely inflicted by rigid and draconian federalsentences.

Whilesome of thesystem is critics think the White Houseshould cut the Justice Department out of the process (as Trump effectively did) to avoid this conflict of interest, Love argues that a better approach would be for Congress to let judges or executive agencies performsome of the clemencysystem is functions. People oftenseek pardons, for example, to recover their Second Amendment rights,something that Lovesuggests could be accomplished ""by application to an administrative agency or a court."" She notes that the FIRST STEP Act, a 2018 law that Trumpsupported, authorized judges to reduce prisoners isentences for ""extraordinary and compelling reasons,"" a reform that could be expanded to cover many of the people who are now desperately hoping for commutations. President Joe Biden has promised that he will ""broadly use his clemency power for certain non-violent and drug crimes."" Heshould do that throughout his administration, instead of waiting until he is nearly out of office. Biden also favors abolishing the mandatory minimumsentences that he championed for decades as asenator. Such reforms, especially if they are retroactive, would have a much bigger impact than liberal use of clemency: During the first year after the FIRST STEP Act took effect, its relatively modest changes resulted inshortersentences for more than 7,000 people. That amounts to less than 5 percent of federal prisoners, nearly half of whom areserving time for drug offenses.

He had dropped out ofschool and begun toself-harm, hesays, and was consuming “extreme amounts” of Jägermeister each week. His girlfriend at the time insisted he get help;she believed it was the only way Jere wouldsee his 18th birthday. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoDuring his therapysessions, Jerespoke about his abusive parents—how they forced him, when he was a young kid, to walk the nearly 4 miles home fromschool, or made himsleep out in the garden if he “was being a disappointment.” He talked about using marijuana, LSD, DMT Hesaid he’d organized an illegal rave and wasselling drugs. Hesaid he’d thought about killing himself. After eachsession, Jere’s therapist typed out his notes and uploaded them to Vastaamo’sservers. “I was just being honest,” Jeresays. He had “no idea” that they were backing the information up digitally. In the cafeteria, Jere grabbed his bag and told his friends he’d turn in his portion of the physics project the next day. On the bus ride home, he frantically text ed his best friend to come over. Then his mother called; as the adult listed on his old account,she’d received the ransom note too. She and Jere were on good terms now, but ifshe got involvedshe might learn what he’dsaid in hissessions. Then, hesays, he’d probably lose her from his life completely. He told his mother not to worry. That afternoon, he filed an online police report. Jere poured himself ashot of vodka, then two or three more. He found his va pe pen and took a Xanax, prescribed to him years earlier for anxiety. He’dstored a few pills in his bedroom drawer just in case, but he never believed he’d need them again. He passed outshortly after his friend arrived. The next morning, Jere checked Twitter, where he was both horrified and relieved to learn that thousands of others had received thesame threat. “Had I been one of the only people to get the mail, I would have been morescared,” hesays. Vastaamo ran the largest network of private mental-health providers in Finland. In a country of just 5.5 million—about thesame as thestate of Minnesota—it was the “McDonald’s of psychotherapy,” one Finnish journalist told me. And because of that, the attack on the company rocked all of Finland. Around 30,000 people are believed to have received the ransom demand;some 25,000 reported it to the police. On October 29, a headline in theread: “Vastaamo Hacking Could Turn Into Largest Criminal Case in Finnish History.” That predictionseems to have come true. If thescale of the attack wasshocking,so was its cruelty. Not just because the records weresosensitive; not just because the attacker, or attackers,singled out patients like wounded animals; but also because, out of all the countries on earth, Finlandshould have been among the best able to preventsuch a breach. Along with neighboring Estonia, it is widely considered a pioneer in digital health. Since the late 1990s, Finnish leaders have pursued the principle of “citizen-centered,seamless” care, backed up by investments in technology infrastructure. Today, every Finnish citizen has access to a highlysecureservice called Kanta, where they can browse their own treatment records and order prescriptions. Their health providers can use thesystem to coordinate care. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoVastaamo was a private company, but itseemed to operate in thesamespirit of tech-enabled ease and accessibility: You booked a therapist with a few clicks, wait times were tolerable, and Finland’s Social Insurance Institution reimbursed a big chunk of thesession fee (provided you had a diagnosed mental disorder). The company was run by Ville Tapio, a 39-year-old coder and entrepreneur withsharp eyebrows,slicked-back brown hair, and a heavy jawline. He’d cofounded the company with his parents. They pitched ­Vastaamo as a humble family-run enterprise committed to improving the mental health of all Finns. For nearly a decade, the company went fromsuccess tosuccess. Sure,some questioned the purity of Tapio’s motives; Kristian Wahlbeck, director of development at Finland’s oldest mental health nonprofit,says he was “a bit frowned-upon” and “perceived as too business-minded.” And yes, there were occasionalstories about Vastaamo doingshady-seeming things,such as using Google ads to try to poach prospective patients from a university clinic, as the newspaperreported. But people keptsigning up. Tapio wasso confident in what he’d created that hespoke about taking his model overseas. Before “the incident,” Tapiosays, “Vastaamo produced a lot ofsocial good.” Now he is an ex-CEO, and the company he founded is beingsold for parts. “I’msosad tosee all the work done and the future opportunitiessuddenly go to waste,” hesays. “The way it ended feels terrible, unnecessary, and unjustified.”Tapio grew up in a “peaceful and green” neighborhood in northern Helsinki during a bad recession. His mother, Nina, was a trauma psychotherapist, and his father, Perttu, a priest. His grandparents gave him a used Commodore 64 when he was 10, which led him to an interest in coding. Something in his brain resonated with the logical challenge of it, hesays. He alsosaw it as a “tool to buildsomething real.”The obsession endured: In middleschool Tapio coded astatisticssystem for his basketball team, and in highschool he worked for the Helsinki Education Department,showing teachers how to use their computers. Rather than going to college, heset up an onlineshopselling computer parts—his first business, funded with “a few tens of euros,” hesays. A couple of years later, at age 20, he joined asmall management consultancy. The idea for Vastaamo came to Tapio when he was working with the Finnish Innovation Fund, a public foundation that invests insolutions tosocial and environmental problems. The fundsent him on asurvey of health caresystems in Western Europe. Being his mother’sson, he noticed that the Netherlands and other countriesseemed to do a better job of providing mental healthservices than Finland did; the publicsystem at home was known for patchy coverage and long wait times. Ever the coder, he wondered whether a web-based counselingservice would help. It couldsell vouchers to cities and towns, which could distribute the vouchers for free to residents. People could use theservice anonymously. They wouldn’t have to worry about thestigma ofseeking care, and they’d have access anytime, anyplace. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoIn 2009, the Finnish Innovation Fund backed Tapio’s idea with an initial grant of about $12,000. He and his parents used the money—along with more than $13,000 of their ownsavings—tostart Vastaamo, Finnish for “a place where you get answers from.” Tapio registered the company as asocial enterprise, meaning that the bulk of its profits would be poured back into its mission to improve mental healthservices. He would own around 60 percent, and most of the remainder would belong to his parents. Perttu wouldserve as CEO Clients couldsend a message to Vastaamo, and within 24 hours they’d get a personal response from a qualified therapist. (Wahlbeck, of the mental health nonprofit, notes thatsuchservices aren’t regulated by the government.) But counseling by internet “was not enough for customers,” Tapiosays. Many of them needed access to in-person therapy. One way to meet that need was to grow Vastaamo into a network of brick-and-mortar clinics. Tapio planned to digitize whatever he could, from bookings to invoices to medical records—everything but the appointment itself. The idea was that independent therapists would join Vastaamo to avoid dealing with their own administrative headaches. Freed by automation, they’d have more time tospend with clients (and rack up billable hours). To deliver on this vision, Vastaamo needed an electronic medical recordsystem, but Tapio didn’t like the options he found. Either thesystems bristled with irrelevant features or they were too tightly tailored to a different area of medicine. The lack of goodsoftware, Tapiosays, was one of the “main reasons” nobody had done what Vastaamo was about to attempt. A Vastaamo clinic location in Espoo, near where Jere lives. Rather than use an existingsystem, the company designed its own. It launched in late 2012, around thesame time Vastaamo’s first in-­­person clinic opened, in the Malmi district of Helsinki. Tapio wouldn’t go into technical detail about thesystem, but in court documents hesuggests it was browser-based andstored patients’ records on a MySQLserver. More important for Vastaamo’s­ purposes, the interface was easy to use. When therapists applied for a job at the company, they heard all about how much it would quicken their work. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoBut theslick exterior concealed deep vulnerabilities. Mikael Koivukangas, head of R&D at a Finnish med tech firm called Onesys Medical, points out that Vastaamo’ssystem violated one of the “first principles of cybersecurity”: It didn’t an onymize the records. It didn’t even encrypt them. The only thing protecting patients’ confessions and confidences were a couple of fire walls and aserver loginscreen. Anyone with experience in the field, Koivukangassays, could’ve helped Vastaamo design asafersystem. At the time, though, fears of a breach were far from Tapio’s mind. Thesummer after Vastaamo’s first clinic opened its doors, he took over as CEO andset the company on a path toward expansion. In 2014 there was a change in the regulations around Vastaamo’s business. The Finnish Parliament decided tosplit medical informationsystems into two categories. Class Asystems would connect with Kanta, the national health data repository,so they’d need to meetstrictsecurity and inter operabilitystandards. Anyone who planned to keep their patients’ records in long-term electronicstorage would have to use a Class Asystem. Smaller organizations, the kind that kept vital records in manila envelopes and filing cabinets, would be allowed to use Class Bsystems. These weren’t as tightly regulated, in part because they wouldn’t make very interesting targets for a hacker. Class B operators wouldsimplyself-certify to the government that theirsetup met certain requirements. “The government” being, in this case, asingle man—Antti Härkönen—whose purview includes all 280 Class Bsystems in Finland. The new law gave Vastaamoseveral years to adopt a Class Asystem. The problem, Tapiosays, is that the Finnish government hadn’tspecified how psychotherapy practicesshould format their data. Vastaamo could build a Class Asystem and plug into Kanta, but there was “no way tostop, for example, general practitioners at health care centers or occupational health physicians from accessing” therapy records, hesays. Outi Lehtokari, Kanta’s head ofservices, pushes back against this claim. “Tapio might have misunderstood how Kanta works,”shesays. Patients can choose to restrict access to their information. In any event, on June 29, 2017, Vastaamo registered a Class Bsystem. As Tapio tells it, the company was eager to upgrade to Class A assoon as the government released formattingspecs for psychotherapy. But that didn’t happen. Instead, when thespecs came out, Vastaamo kept on going with its Class B Tapiosays that Finland’s “supervisory authorities” thensigned off on thesystem “numerous times” in the years ahead. Härkönen, who is one of those authorities,says that to monitor all the Class Bsystems carefully would be “mission impossible” for him. He adds, however, that thereshould be more “proactive inspections.”By 2018, Vastaamo was operating nearly 20 clinics and employing around 200 therapists andstaff. By the end of 2019, annual revenue had risen to more than $18 million. The company drew the interest of Intera Partners, a Finnish private equity firm, which bought out the majority of Tapio’s and his parents’stakes. Tapio took home nearly $4 million from the deal. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoWith each new clinic that opened, the original process repeated: Härkönen reviewed Vastaamo’sself-certification and gave the thumbs-up. More patient data flowed into the MySQLserver. And the reservoir behind the dam rose a little higher. Tapio first heard from the hacker on September 28, 2020. The demand was 40 bitcoin, around half a million dollars at the time. The message came to him and a pair of developers he’d hired in 2015, Ilari Lind and Sami Keskinen. Lind was responsible for maintaining the company’s ITsystems, including itsservers and firewalls; Keskinen was the data protection officer. According to astatement Tapio made to Helsinki District Court, he immediately notified various government authorities, including the police. Lindsifted through Vastaamo’s network traffic logs but reported finding no evidence of a hack. Tapio hired asecurity company called Nixu to investigate further. Two days later, Tuomas Kahri, COO of Intera Partners and chairman of the board of Vastaamo,sent an email to Tapio to thank him for his diligence in handling the breach. Kahri would latersay thatsome of his own loved ones had been targeted in the attack. In early October, Tapio got anothershock. Keskinen and Lind called with a confession: Just before they’d joined Vastaamo, they had been arrested as part of asecurity breach at Tekes, the Finnish Funding Agency for Technology and Innovation. Lind had discovered that he could download Tekes’ entire database, containing information on as many as 20,000 companies, by changing the URL on a funding application. He informed Tekes, which fixed the vulnerability—but he also notified Keskinen, who downloaded the database. There was a pretrial investigation for aggravated fraud, breach of confidentiality, and burglary, but the prosecution could not establish that Lind and Keskinen had used the database for financial gain. Tapiosays that if he had known about the two men’s histories, he would never have hired them. (Keskinen and Lind declined to comment.) As it was, though, he had more pressing problems to worry about. On the morning of Wednesday, October 21, the hacker posted a message on Ylilauta, an anonymous public discussion board. “We have attempted to negotiate with the Ville Tapio, the CEO of vastaamo, but he hasstopped responding to our emails,” they wrote in English. Until they got their 40 bit coin ransom, they were going to leak 100 patient records each day. The first batch was already up on a Torserver. Anyone who wanted to could go read them. The hackerstarted em ailing with Henrik Kärkkäinen, a reporter at the newspaper. To prove they were the real McCoy, they uploaded a file to the Torserver called “henrik.txt”—asnippet of their exchange. In em ails to Kärkkäinen, the hackerscorned Vastaamo: A company withsecurity practices that weak was the real criminal, he recalls them writing. They claimed to have beensitting on thestolen database for 18 months, unaware of its value. When Ylilauta’s moderators removed the posts, the conversation migrated to Torilauta, a popular discussion forum on the dark web. The hacker took on a name: ransom_man. At least one desperate person offered to pay the full 40 bitcoin. Another wrote, in English, “I have discussed about very private things with my therapist and will literally k ys myself if they are released.” They had their bit coin ready: “I cansend it in minutes, I’m constantly refreshing this page.” About 30 payments ended up going to the hacker’s Bitcoin wallet, according to Mikko Hyppönen, the chief research officer at F-Secure, a global cy bersecurity company. It is unclear whether ransom_man actually deleted anyone’s information. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoThe hacker did follow through on another promise, however. On October 22, they leaked 100 more patient records. Some belonged to politicians and other public figures. They contained details about adulterous relationships,suicide attempts, pedophilic thoughts. The next batch came around 2 am the following morning. The hacker also put all the records they’d leakedso far into asingle file called “Vastaamo.tar.”And thensomethingstrange happened. Ransom_man replaced the first “Vastaamo.tar” with a much bigger one. It was 10.9 gigabytes—the entire leaked database. This file also contained a Pythonscript that the hacker had used to organize the therapy records. The 10.9 GB uploadseems to have been a mistake, because it disappeared in a matter of hours, along with the entire Torserver. Somespeculated that Vastaamo had paid the 40 bitcoin, though company officials denied it. One victim had their bit coin ransom at the ready. “I cansend it in minutes,” they wrote. “I’m constantly refreshing this page.”Either way, ransom_mansoon changed tactics andstarted extorting individual patients. This was unusual. Most of the time, cy ber criminals go after institutions, according to Hyppönen. He knew of only one earlier instance of patients beingsingled out—in late 2019, after a breach at the Center for Facial Restoration in Miramar, Florida. (Since the Vastaamo attack, he adds, two other hacks have also targeted patients of plasticsurgery clinics.) “Most attackers want money, and health care data is not directly monetizable,” Hyppönensays. But with real-world examples of the crime paying off, he adds, “it could become more common.”Vastaamo reacted by offering patients a free counselingsession. Therapy continued as normal. One patientsays her therapist advised her to consider that not everything beingsaid in the news was true. Some patients picked up a physical copy of their records, to learn what had beenstolen, and others joined Facebook groups dedicated to victimsupport. Jere, however, opted not to; he wanted to minimize his online presence. He changed his phone number and purchased credit protection. He neverseriously considered paying the hacker, hesays, because “there was absolutely no guarantee they would obey” their own terms. A Vastaamo clinic location in Turku. On the Mondayafter the breach became public, Tapio went to Vastaamo headquarters in Helsinki. He’d beensummoned there by Tuomas Kahri, the Intera COO who a month earlier had thanked him. Instead ofspeaking to Tapio face to face, Kahri had a consultant hand him a letter. Itsaid that Tapio’s contract as CEO was terminated. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoHours later, the company announced Tapio’s dismissal. Shortly after that, in response to a legal motion filed by Intera, the Helsinki District Court ordered the temporaryseizure of $11.7 million worth of the Tapio family’s assets—exactly what Intera had paid for itsshare of Vastaamo. Kahri declinedseveral requests to comment on Intera’s claims, but they’re described in public (albeit redacted) court documents. In its filings, Interasays it became aware of two previously unreported breaches at Vastaamo, in late 2018 and thespring of 2019. Thesecond date fellshortly before the buyout went through. “Based on the information receivedso far, it is reasonable to assume that Ville Tapio was aware of the breach,” Intera argues. Not only that, but he “sought to conceal” it. Intera wanted to dissolve the transaction and reclaim the purchase price. Tapio, as the defendant,submitted written testimony in rebuttal. He claims to have been blindsided by the news of the 2019 breach. The reason he didn’t find out about it at the time, he writes, is that Keskinen and Lind—the “system architects”—never told him about it. On the morning of March 15, Vastaamo’sservers crashed and the patient database was replaced with a blackmail message. Tapio notifiedstaff of the crash at 11:18 am, but no one appears to have discussed the possibility of a breach in either of the reportssubmitted to the government. According to Tapio’s testimony, ­Keskinen and Lind—whoshared an administrator account—told him that the crash might have been caused bysome minor adjustments they’d madeshortly beforehand. But hesays that Nixu, the cy bersecurity company he hired in September, foundsomething else: Theshared account read the ransom message and deleted it. In Tapio’s version of events, then, whoever was using that account covered up the March breach. And the reason they did it, he contends, was to conceal a vulnerability they’d created themselves—one that had left Vastaamo’s patient database “without firewall protection” for more than a year. There weresupposed to be three levels ofsecuritysurrounding the database, Tapio tells me: one firewall at the network level, which blocked connections from the public internet; another around the individualserver thatstored the patient database; and theserver configuration itself, which prevented connections from outside accounts. In November 2017, Lindspent a few hours configuring theserver to allow remote access. Tapio believes that Lind and Keskinen wanted to be able to manage theserver from offsite, and that instead of going to the trouble ofsetting up a VPN, theysimply peeled back the firewalls.“Those are two professionals that know much more about the network and firewall andserver management than I,” Tapiosays. “I was not responsible.”Keskinen and Lind have not testified in the Intera case. They declined to comment on Tapio’s numerous allegations. Until the dispute is resolved, the $11.7 million that Intera wants back—the fortune that Vastaamo built—will remain frozen. In early Januaryof this year, the Vastaamo patient database reappeared on at least 11 anonymous file-sharingservices across the public internet. The file contained all thesame records as before but was a fraction as big,so itspread easily. Without an accompanying message, the motivations for the upload are hard to discern—but it did appear fewer than 48 hours before Vastaamo’s board was due to discuss the company’s future. Was this aspiteful push to bring the company down?Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoIfso, then it was asuccess. On January 28, Vastaamo was put into liquidation, and it filed for bankruptcy two weeks later. In early March, itsstaff andservices were transferred to Verve, a provider of occupational welfareservices. The acquisition did not include Vastaamo’s customer data, and Verve will use a Class Asystem. Almost immediately after the hack happened, Parliament fast-tracked legislation that would allow victims like Jere to change theirsocialsecurity numbers in case of aserious breach. But patients werespooked, one counselor told the newspaper. “Not everyone who needed help may havesought treatment,” hesaid. Some argue that therapistsshould never be able to entersession notes into Kanta; now more than ever, patients will not risk having their data travel beyond the consultation room. In wider medicine, Koivukangassays, the Vastaamoscandal has highlighted the “unmet demand” for electronic medical recordsystems that arescalable, easy to use, and—crucially—secure. This is an area ripe for disruption, hesays, and “prior to this breach, many thought with good reason that Vastaamo would’ve been one of those disruptors.” Until the market­place improves, hesays, expect more bespokesolutions, and more breaches. Unless ransom_man is caught and the Finnish authoritiessort out everything that happened at Vastaamo, it will be impossible to know exactly how “the incident” began. Would it have happened, for example, if Finland had been more proactive in policing electronic medicalsystems? Or if Tapio had implemented a moresecuresystem? What’s clear is how it ended—in the most painful way possible for tens of thousands of patients. As more health caresystems across the world go digital, the risk of that outcome rises.“Being honest about my mental health turned out to be a bad idea,” Jeresays. He worries about identity theft, aboutsome debt collection company calling him out of the blue and demanding tens of thousands of euros. He worries that his history of teenage alcoholism,so well documented on the web, will make it hard for him to find meaningful work as an adult.

The Reagan administration moved the Cold War to its endgame by taking the initiative through measuresshort of warfare, and that era’s technology competition holds lessons relevant for astrategy of geo economics today. Atstake in the Sino-American rivalry is who gets to tilt the table of the twenty-first century andslide trillions of dollars of prosperity and international political influence toward a center of gravity in Beijing or Washington. Some commentatorson the American right roll their eyes at “zombie Reaganism” in the form of a warmed-over 1980s policy agenda, while liberalskeptics have dismissed the accounts of Reaganites who touted a coherent grandstrategy pursued by their administration. Yet, for contemporarystrategists and diplomatic historians, Reagan’s resultsstand the test of time. Of course, we cannot andshould not try to replay the Reagan performance like an episode of VH1’s. Sound answers to a historicalset of geostrategic problems underpinned Reagan’ssuccess, but America’s problems of the 1980s are not those of the 2020s. What we need to replicate is that era’s mode of geostrategic thinking and the lessons learned for how to get America out of a rut. Failing to think geo economically over the last three decades blinded us to Beijing’s technologystrategy and lost us initiative, but intensifying public-private partnerships forstrategic objectives can retake it and enhance American economic competitiveness. Power competition provides the focus and need for American innovation policies, which in turn produce technological breakthroughs that create prosperity when commercialized by the privatesector. Debates about what “a foreign policy for the middle class” would look like misses this connective tissue between political power competition and a prosperous middle class. At the heart of the Reagan administration’scompetitivestrategy was an aggressive pursuit of winning “the Technological War”—the application of a defense industrial base tostrategic objectives. The aim is to make your opponent counter your moves, and dance to your tune, in major resource allocations through industrial policy. Technological war targets enemy willpower directly, paralyzing it with demonstrations ofsuperior capabilities,so that a hot war is postponed or not fought. The 1980s have a rich history ofsuch industrial policy. For example, Reagan-era industrial policies in microelectronics andsemiconductor manufacturing weresuccesses that formed the basis of US information technology dominance in the 1990s. In the 1980s, Japanese makers madesignificant inroads in thesemiconductor and high-performance mainframe computer market that were understood to be critical for next-generation military capabilities. To beat back this challenge, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)launched the Strategic Computing Initiativewith $1 billion invested over ten years (1983-93), and also founded the Semiconductor Manufacturing Technologyconsortium in 1987 as a public-private partnership to regain competitiveness for American companies. Surprise in the mind of enemystaff isa key element of technologystrategy. Displays ofstrategically relevant military, industrial, orscientific breakthroughs—conducted in concert with diplomatic offensives—cansap the adversary’sself-confidence in his offensive operational concepts. This imposes uncertainty on him and gains you the initiative, which when paired with a political-psychologicalstrategy can project dominance, the backbone of deterrence. Technological competition is an inevitable fact of international economics, but as astrategy underpinning the military buildup of Reagan’s grandstrategy, it was devised by defense intellectualssuch as Andrew Marshall, longtime director of the Office of Net Assessment in the Defense Department. Marshallchampionedthe view that America had to determine which of the Soviet Union’s pressure points were most vulnerable to comparative USstrengths andselectively compete with them. Later, Reaganitessuch as Secretary of DefenseCaspar Weinbergerand Under Secretary of Defense for PolicyFred Ikléapproved approaches that paired offensive and defensive moves forsuch competition. The offensive move applied our military-industrial base to innovative capabilities that would provoke Moscow to counter them by costlyscience and technology investments. The most famous and provocative of these was the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI), but it was hardly the only or most important offensive move tostimulate Soviet fears about USsuperiority in high technology. The defensive move orchestrated technologysecurity and export controls to deny Moscow access to Western technical innovation andscientific knowhow, make it more difficult for the Soviets to catch up to American expertise. Iklé’s office established technologysecurity policy at the Defense Departmentfor the first time, defining technology as a valuable nationalsecurity resource and controlling its transfer to allied and friendly governments. Iklé believed—correctly, as we would come to learn—thatSoviet industrial theft and economic espionage of Western technology accelerated its military advances in the 1970s. This technologicalstrategy was the necessary foundation for making effective economic, diplomatic, ideological, and psychological offensives that pushed the Soviet Union off balance andsubverted its prestige and willpower in Eastern Europe. America under Reagan took the initiative in the Cold War without firing ashot, andshifted the configuration of force in its favor, through asymmetric military advances powered by technological competition. In this way, the Reagan administrationset up the Bush team to win without fighting, and made the 1980s an end game of peaceful victory for America. So, how does the USs get out of a rut this time? Retaking the ge oeconomic offensive requires Americanstatesmen to embrace our history of industrial policy and to reject mythologies about innovation arising merely from commercial competition. Alexander Hamiltoncreated the nation’s firstpublic-private partnership to help compete with Great Britain. The USs won the race to nuclear fission and nuclear weapons, and in the decades that followed the Americannational laboratorysystem built off the Manhattan Project’sscience and technical innovations. DARPA funding laid the Internet’s technical foundations. Of the dozen major technologies integrated in the iPod, iPhone, and iPad, eleven of themstem from or were advanced by US government (usually Department of Defense)support. As Daniel Sarewitzwrites:Americans lionize thescientist as head-in-the-clouds genius (the Einstein hero) and the inventor as misfit-in-the-garage genius (the Steve Jobs or Bill Gates hero). The discomfiting reality, however, is that much of today’s technological world exists because of DOD’s role in catalyzing andsteeringscience and technology. This was industrial policy, and it worked because it brought all of the players in the innovation game together, disciplined them by providingstrategic, long-term focus for their activities, andshielded them from the market rationality that would have doomed almost every crazy, over-expensive idea that today makes the world go round. For the Sino-American competition, Americanstatesmen must remember this basic offensive move of geoeconomics. A consensus on taking the initiative through industrial policy may be forming already. But what good is the initiative if you cannot keep it? Industrialsecurity and technology export controls paired with rule-making influence at internationalscientific organizations are critical defenses. Technology denial aims to keep asymmetric advantages from being unraveled by an adversary’s overt technology transfer, industrial theft, or economic espionage. If properly orchestrated, technologysecurity keeps you on the ge oeconomic offensive. Orchestrating domestic technologysecurity measures, multilateral export control regimes, and diplomatic pressure at international institutions will requiresavvy multilateralism, and they are a major growth area for US defensive action in the Sino-American competition. For example, the Committee on Foreign Investment in the USs (CFIUS) is America’s main defensive instrument tomitigate, on grounds of nationalsecurity, the risk of legal transfer ofsensitive technology or expertise through corporate mergers and acquisitions. But CFIUS relies mainly on voluntary reporting for compliance, and many American lobbyists assist foreign corporate clients with navigating CFIUS procedures to purchase US companies and possess their intellectual property. US export controls aresimilarly disjointed. The problem for Washington is coordinating with foreign capitals to block export to Beijing of knowledge or commodities,such as intellectual property or advancedsemiconductor manufacturing equipment, that constitute criticalsub-components to the technology competition. The West’s main architecture for technologicalsecurity in the Cold War, the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls (COCOM), impeded Soviet industrial espionage against critical technologiessuch as microelectronics. COCOM was abolished in 1994 and replaced with the Wassenaar Arrangement, a deficientsuccessor not aimed at China and mostly restricting conventional arms rather thansensitivescience and technology transfers. The deepest positional moves of technologysecurity occur atscientific and technical regulatory and governance bodies at international institutions like the UN. This is the grand chessboard where Beijingtriesto convert itsscientific leadership into global advantage. USsuccess will preserve Western initiative for defining international legal rules andscientificstandards and unravel Beijing’s attempts to play Western countries off each other. Diplomacy in these institutions is the long game for pushing and keeping the PRC off-balance in technology competition. Sun Tzufamously judged that attacking the enemy’sstrategy is best and the worst is to attack his armies and cities. In grandstrategic terms, fighting represents the failure to inflict enough uncertainty in the mind of a rival to deter his aggression against the peace.

Ifshe were in charge, Greene toldDonald Trump’s formerstrategistSteve Bannonon his “War Room” program Wednesday, “I would kick out every Chinese in this country who is loyal” to the communist party because “China tried to kill us, and did kill us, this past year” with COVID-19. “If I had my way, I would come down on Chinaso hard.”Greenesubscribes to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory that China, where COVID-19 first emerged,deliberately created COVID-19 to kill Americans.

People who refuse to be vaccinated alsoserve as “incubators” for increasinglystronger variants of COVID-19 that threaten everyone, health experts warn.“Viruses don’t mutate if they don’t replicate,”said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the White House chief medical adviser, last month. “If you give them the opportunity to replicate by allowing them to [spread] from person to person, you’re giving them a perfect opportunity to mutate even more and perhaps evade the vaccine.”Greene also told Bannon that to punish Chinashe would crank up Trump’s tariffs on the country, apparently mistakenly believing,as the former president did, that China then would have tosomehow pay money to the US treasury. In fact, US importers of Chinese goods pay the tariffs. Economists from the Federal Reserve Bank in New Yorkestimated that Trump’s Chinese tariffs cost American businesses and consumers$3 billion a month in increased prices in 2018.

53,223 People Have Died With COVID-19 After Getting Fully Vaccinated: CDC,9.67,35.67,https://www.theepochtimes.com/223-people-have-died-with-covid-19-after-getting-fully-vaccinated-cdc_3818232.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/epoch-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-17,25,"Over 1,100 people in the USs have been hospitalized with COVID-19 after being fully vaccinated against the virus that causes it, and more than 220 have died, according to new figures from a top US health agency. The number of hospitalizations among the fully vaccinated is up to 1,136, and the number of deaths among thesame population is 223 as of May 10, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The numbers could also be under counted because “nationalsurveillance relies on passive and voluntary reporting, and data might not be complete or representative,” according to the CDC Breakthrough metrics refer to cases, hospitalizations, or deaths among people who haveseen two or more weeks elapsesince receiving the final dose of a COVID-19 vaccine—thesingle-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccine or thesecondshot of either the Moderna or Pfizer vaccine. Of the people who died after being fully vaccinated, 42 were asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19, according to the CDC Additionally, 342 of the hospitalizations were asymptomatic or not related to COVID-19.“Many, many hospitals arescreening people for COVID when they come in,so not all of those 223 cases who had COVID actually died of COVID They may have had mild disease, but died, for example, of a heart attack,” CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walenskysaid on CNN’s “State of the Union” on May 16. Under the usual counting program, people who haven’t been vaccinated but who die of heart attacks or other causes while testing positive for the CCP virus are typically listed as a COVID-19 death. The death rate among the fully vaccinated is “extraordinarily low” when taking into consideration the death rate of COVID-19 itself, Walenskysaid. Some 115 million people had been fully vaccinated as of May 10. Clinical trialsshowed the Pfizer vaccine to have a 95 percent efficacy rate in preventing infection by the virus; the Modernashot to have 94 percent; and the Johnson & Johnsonshot to have 66.9 percent. The Johnson & Johnson vaccine wasstudied later than the others. No othershots are currently authorized for use in the USs. The CDC last week dramatically altered previous masking guidance,saying fully vaccinated people can go without masks in many indoorsettings.“We now havescience that has really just evolved even in the last two weeks that demonstrates that these vaccines aresafe, they are effective, they are working in the population, just as they did in the clinical trials, that they are working against our variants that we have here circulating in the USs, and that, if you were to develop an infection even if you got vaccinated, you can’t transmit that infection to other people,” Walenskysaid on ABC’s “This Week.”If people are vaccinated, “they’resafe,”shesaid. She alsosaid health officials are trying to figure out how a COVID-19 outbreak occurred among the New York Yankees, who were mostly vaccinated.“I would consider that, when you look at the details that I’m aware of,seven of those eight were completely asymptomatic. The eighth was a mild case. They were detected on routine testing that generally doesn’t happen in many other populations. This is the vaccine working,”shesaid. “This means that you didn’t get infected—or you didn’t get asevere infection. You didn’t require hospitalization. You didn’t require death [sic], and most likely those people were not transmitting to other people.”“We’re just doing the best we can with it,” manager Aaron Boonesaid. “Fortunately, he’s another one that feels good. So we’ll just continue to try and be vigilant and handle it as best we can.”",1,0,Epoch Times
54,Whiteness helps shield Donald Trump from election consequences,-19.33,24.0,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/whiteness-helps-shield-donald-trump-election-consequences-n1274244,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,25,"Hervis Rogers, a 62-year-old Black man, waited oversix hours to vote in Texas’ Democratic primary in March 2020. “I figured like it was my duty to vote. I wanted to get my vote in to voice my opinion,” het old a CNN report erat the time. “And I was not going to let nothingstop me.”Now,Rogers faces up to 20 years in prison for voting while on parole — despite not knowing he was technically ineligible to vote at the time. Around the time of the primary, former President Donald Trump was already laying the groundwork to challenge the results of the 2020 election,casting doubt on thesecurity of mail-in ballots. Culminatingwith aspeech in Washington, DC, on January 6, Trump knowingly incited that day is act of domestic terrorism, as theFBI has defined it, in an attempt to nullify the votes of millions of Americans. Yet, he is facing zero criminal charges. There is, clearly, a disparity between thescope of both crime and punishment here. This injustice is even more appalling when you look at the facts of Rogers’ case. His lawyer hasstated that Rogers did not know it was illegal to vote while on parole. In fact,The Washington Post reported that in at least 20states, it’s not a crime to vote while on parole. Also, Rogers was arrested the day before theTexas Legislature began itsspecialsession, which Texas’ governor called to enactsweeping votersuppression laws. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who ordered the arrest and himself isunder indictment for felony fraudcharges,tweeted after Rogers’ arrest: “Hervis is a felon rightly barred from voting under TX law. ... I prosecute voter fraud everywhere we find it!” (But Paxton hassaid the allegations against him are politically motivated and has denied any wrongdoing, according toThe Texas Tribune.)Trump, however, is not the only Republican using his white privilege to avoid thesame penalties Black Americans face for the identical — or lesser — conduct. Trump, however, is not the only Republican using his white privilege to avoid thesame penalties Black Americans face for the identical — or lesser — conduct. For example, in Pennsylvania,Trumpsupporter Bruce Bartmancompleted a request for a mail-in ballotso his mother could vote in the 2020 election. The only problem was his mother had died 12 years before. But Bartman, 70, wasso dedicated to helping Trump that he wanted to vote for him twice. (He actually tried to vote for Trump three times by also registering his mother-in-law as a Republican, despite the fact thatshe was also dead.)In the end, Bartman was able to vote in his late mother’s name. An investigation followed, and Bartman was charged. He ultimately pleaded guilty in April to perjury and unlawful voting. His punishment for his intentionalscheme of voter fraud: five years of probation. This atrocious disparity is also clear in the recent case of RepublicanEdward Snodgrass, whoserves as a local elected official in Ohio. After an election worker questioned thesignature on a ballotsubmitted in the name of Snodgrass’ father, Snodgrass admitted his father had died before the absentee ballot had arrived and that he had forged his deceased father’ssignature. Snodgrass was initially charged with afourth-degree felony that could have resulted insix months in jail, but instead he was offered anda greed to a plea deal of a $500 fine andserving three days in local jail. Compare that to the case of Crystal Mason, a Black woman in Texas who in 2016 attempted to vote while onsupervised release afterserving five years in prison. After her mother urged her to vote, Mason headed to the polls not knowingshe was ineligible. Mason’s name didn’t appear on the voting rolls,soshesubmitted a provisional ballot that was never even counted. What was her punishment forsimply casting a provisional ballot that was never counted?Five years in prison. That case is now on appeal to Texas' highest court for criminal cases whileshe is out of jail on bond. Nowstop to consider the even more mind-blowing fact that over 500 people have been charged for trying to “stop thesteal” as Trump demanded of them — yet he walks free. And alarmingly for our nation, Trump is now back on the roads pewing thesame lies that incited the January 6 attack and openly defending the terrorists who attacked the Capitol in his name. As a lawyer this literally makes nosense to me. As an American, it outrages me tosee this glaring injusticesince we all know that if Trump was Black or Muslim (or both!) he would already be, rightfully, charged with various crimes. Rogers and Mason may end up in prison for years for unknowingly voting while ineligible, while Trump knowingly incited an act of domestic terrorism to overturn the votes of millions of Americans and not only walks free but is being celebrated by the GOP This is beyond white privilege. This is dangerously toxic whitesupremacy that will very possibly lead to more violence unless Trump is brought to justice.

55,“Overdue”: Biden sets August 31 for US exit from Afghanistan,0.0,46.0,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/08/overdue-biden-sets-aug-31-for-us-exit-from-afghanistan/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-08,25,"WASHINGTON — President Joe Bidensaid Thursday the US military operation in Afghanistan will end on August 31, delivering an impassioned argument for exiting the nearly 20-year war withoutsacrificing more American lives even as he bluntly acknowledged there will be no “mission accomplished” moment to celebrate. Biden pushed back against the notion the US mission has failed but also noted that it remains unlikely the government would control all of Afghanistan after the US leaves. He urged the Afghan government and Taliban, which hesaid remains as formidable as it did before thestart of the war, to come to a peace agreement.“We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build,” Bidensaid in aspeech from the White House’s East Room. “Afghan leaders have to come together and drive toward a future.”The administration in recent days hassought to frame ending the conflict as a decision that Biden made after concluding it’s an “unwinnable war” and one that “does not have a militarysolution.” On Thursday he amplified the justification of his decision even as the Taliban make rapid advances insignificantswaths of the country.“How many more, how many more thousands of American daughters andsons are you willing to risk?” Bidensaid to those calling for the US to extend the military operation. He added, “I will notsend another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan, with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome.”The new withdrawal date comes after former President Donald Trump’s administration negotiated a deal with the Taliban to end the US military mission by May 1. Biden after taking office announced US troops would be out by by the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attack, which al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden plotted from Afghanistan, where he had been given refuge by the Taliban. With US and NATO ally forces rapidly drawing down in the past week, there was growingspeculation that US combat operations have already effectively ended. But bysetting August 31 as the drawdown date, the administration nodded to the reality that the long war is in its final phase, while providing itselfsome cushion to deal with outstanding matters. The administration has yet to complete talks with Turkey on an arrangement for maintainingsecurity at the Kabul airport and isstill ironing out details for the potential evacuation of thousands of Afghans who assisted the US military operation. Bidensaid that prolonging US military involvement, considering Trump had already agreed to withdraw US troops, would have led to an escalation of attacks on American troops and NATO allies.“The Taliban would have again begun to target our forces,” Bidensaid. “Thestatus quo was not an option. Staying meant US troops taking casualties. American men and women. Back in the middle of a civil war. And we would run the risk of having tosend more troops back in Afghanistan to defend our remaining troops.”The president added that there is no “mission accomplished” moment as the US war comes to an end.“The mission was accomplished in that we got Osama bin Laden and terrorism is not emanating from that part of the world,” hesaid. US forces killed bin Laden in 2011. US forces this week vacated Bagram Airfield — the US epicenter of the conflict to oust the Taliban and hunt down the al-Qaida perpetrators of the 2001 terrorist attacks that triggered the war. Remaining US troops are now concentrated in Kabul, the capital. The Pentagonsaid the top US commander in Afghanistan, Gen. Scott Miller, is expected to end his tour of duty this month as final arrangements are made for a reduced US military mission. Biden, answering questions from reporters after his remarks on Thursday,said that Kabul falling to the Taliban would not be an acceptable outcome. The president also pushed back against the notion thatsuch ascenario was certain.“Do I trust the Taliban? No,” Bidensaid. “But I trust the capacity of the Afghan military, who is better trained, better equipped and more competent in terms of conducting war.”To be certain, the West hopes Taliban gains will be confined mostly to rural areas, with the Afghan government and its allies retaining control of the cities where much of Afghanistan’s population resides. And while the Taliban remain a major power in Afghanistan, the government’ssupporters hope that Afghans will work out the Taliban role in the post-US Afghanistan powerstructure more through political than military means, partly through the inducements of international legitimacy, aid and othersupport. Asked by a reporter whether rampant corruption within the Afghan government contributed to the failure of achieving thesort ofstability that his predecessors and American military commanders envisioned, Biden didn’t exactly dismiss the notion. “The mission hasn’t failed — yet.”Biden continues to face pressure from congressional lawmakers to offer further detail on how he intends to go about assisting thousands of Afghans who helped the US military as translators, drivers and in other jobs. Many are fearful they will be targets of the Taliban once the US withdrawal is complete. The White Housesays the administration has identified US facilities outside of the continental USs, as well as third countries, where evacuated Afghans would potentiallystay while their visa applications are processed. Biden added that 2,500 Afghans have been grantedspecial immigrant visassince he took office in January. Still, the president faced Republican criticism following hisspeech.“The Taliban is gaining more ground by the day, and there are targets on the backs of our people and our partners,”said Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas, the top Republican on the House Foreign Affairs Committee. “But rather than taking the opportunity to reassure the American people there aresufficient plans in place to keep American diplomats and our Afghan partnerssafe, President Biden only offered more empty promises and no detailed plan of action.”John Kirby, chief Pentagonspokesman,said Thursday that the US military is consideringseveral overseas bases around the world as possible temporary locations for those Afghans awaiting a visa. So far, hesaid, the numbers of those who have decided to leave Afghanistan are notso high that they can’t be handled with a range of installations.“Our message to those women and men is clear,” Bidensaid. “There is a home for you in the USs if youso choose. We willstand with you, just as youstood with us.”Biden noted that as asenator he wasskeptical about how much the US could accomplish in Afghanistan and had advocated for a more narrowly tailored mission. He wassomewhat opaque in answering whether the cost of the war was worth it, but argued that the US objectives were completed long ago.“We went for two reasons: one, to bring Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell, as Isaid at the time,” Bidensaid. “Thesecond reason was to eliminate al-Qaida’s capacity to deal with more attacks on the USs from that territory. We accomplished both of those objectives. Period.“That’s why I believe this is the right decision and quite frankly overdue.”—Associated Press writers Ellen Knickmeyer in Oklahoma City and Lolita C Baldor in Washington contributed reporting.",2,2,Denver Post
56,“We’re Not Allowed to Hang Up”: The Harsh Reality of Working in Customer Service,-7.67,44.67,https://www.propublica.org/article/not-allowed-to-hang-up-the-harsh-reality-of-working-in-customer-service,https://adfontesmedia.com/propublica-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-21,24,"ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggeststories assoon as they’re published. Last year ProPublicawroteabout the world of work-at-home customerservice,spot lighting a largely unseen industry that helps brand-name companiesshed labor costs by outsourcing the task of mollifying unhappy customers. As we reported on the industry,we invited current and former customerservice representatives to contact us. They did. We heard from more than 100 and interviewed dozens. Often, theirstories disturbed us. One woman, afraid to take a bathroom break, kept a jar under her desk in caseshe needed to urinate. Another, afraid to call insick, paused calls to vomit. A third, afraid to hang up on a customer, didn’t know what to do whenshe realized a caller was masturbating to thesound of her voice. These accounts captured how agents aresimultaneously ubiquitous and invisible. Customers talk to them all the time but know little about their work conditions. So we’re providing accounts fromseven agents, many of whom describe the experience of being caught between abusive callers and corporate directives to appease. Theseseven are highly representative of the 100-plus agents we heard from, as well as the agents we interviewed in our first article. The agents, includingsome who told us they love theirsetups, laid out common themes, describing problems that people at various levels of the industry, including managers, have told us are endemic. We’ve also found echoes of these complaints in lawsuits and arbitration claims. Abusive callers aresuch a concern that, a few years ago in Canada, a union for telecommunications workers launched a campaign called “Hang Up on Abuse.” Airbnb, recognizing the emotionalstrain of takingsuch calls, offered their in-house customerservice agents free therapysessions. The reps wespoke to needed these jobs, which allowed them to work from home even before the pandemic. They included people with disabilities, caretaking obligations or limited opportunities in rural towns. Recruitment ads touted flexibility and the chance to be your own boss. But many agents discovered the roles came with limited hours, close monitoring andstrict performance measurements that put them in constant fear of losing their jobs. A Department of Labor investigator concluded that one contractor, Arise Virtual Solutions, exerted an “extraordinary degree of control” over agents. Most customerservice agents are women. Many describe beingsexually harassed. Onesaid a caller told her, “I really like the way you type.” Their work belongs to a grim history of women in outsourced rolesstretching back to the piecework manufacturing era. A half century ago, temp work exploded, driven by companies hiring women to cut costs compared with full-time employees. These magazine ads from 1970 and 1971show how women temps were viewed at the time, and the attitudes have certain parallels to how customerservice agents are viewed today. While many agents work full time, a growingsegment are independent contractors who don’t get paid holidays, vacation time or fringe benefits. In the accounts below, most of the agents asked not to be identified, citing nondisclosure agreements that are common in the industry. (To work forsome companies, agents mustsign NDAs before they can even accept the job.) We’ve condensed for clarity and verified details wherever possible, collecting Facebookscreenshots, email exchanges, company performance review forms, tax records and other proof of employment, along with contemporaneous recollections from agents’ relatives or friends. But there were instances in which we couldn’t getsuch documentation, owing in part to the premium placed on privacy andsecurity by the companies. Some agentssaid they weren’t even allowed to have their personal phone in their workroom while helping customers. Some lost access to their email and the company platform when they quit or were fired, and they hadn’t made copies orscreenshots beforehand. In every case we invited the companies that these agents worked with to comment. Christine Stewart hassocial anxiety and depression. “I have a really hard time being out in public,”shesaid. She wanted to work from home,soshe became an independent contractor for Sykes from 2017 to 2018. The company bills itself as “a leading provider of multichannel demand generation and customer engagementservices for Global 2000 companies.” At Sykes,she helped customers using Intuit’s TurboTax.“I was actuallysick one day, I called, they have asupervisor line, and told them I was going to be [out]sick. And without actuallysaying it, the ladysaid, you’re going to be in trouble if you don’tshow up. And me, I don’t like to get in trouble at work, I’m a good employee. I went to work. I kept hitting my mute button every time I had to throw up.”During training,shesaid, “they told me if you wanted to work nights, you could work nights. If you want to work days, you can work days. Once you finish the training they’re like, ‘This is yourschedule.’ Isaid I can’t work that and they were like, ‘Well, this is theschedule, and if you can not work theschedule, you don’t want the job.’ I was like, ‘I need the job, I do want the job.’ Isaid, ‘I can do 8 a.m. to 12 p.m.’ They wanted me to do 12 to 12. I have to get my kids on the bus in the morning, I was like, ‘I need to take a five-minute break when the bus pulls up.’ Even that was a huge problem for them. They wouldsay, ‘You can’t keep taking these five-minute breaks.’”Customers berated her. “One person called me the C-word. I’d call mysupervisor. They’dsay, ‘Calm them down.’ … They’d always try to push me tostay on the call and calm the customer down myself. I wasn’t getting paid enough to do that. When you have a customersitting there andsaying you’re worthless … you’resupposed to ‘de-escalate.’”“There can be no background noise, no nature noises or cars passing by. I had a den. I had to insulate my den,”shesaid. (To confirm the expense,sheshared a tax form with ProPublica thatshowed a $100 deduction.) “I had to turn the AC off; you could hear the AC blowing. They called me out on that. When I was training, the ladysaidshe could hear the air conditioner in the background.”One time,shesaid, “my kid broke his hand.” She dropped her call, dropped everything, to help him, but thenshe needed astory, because,shesaid, hadshe told hersupervisors the truth — that her kid broke his hand and needed her help — “I would’ve gotten in trouble even if I had a hospital note.”“Isaid my internet went down. I pulled the plug on everything, because it was their equipment. ... I didn’t know if they had any kind of monitoringsoftware that wasn’t on the web cam or anything. It was better not to take any chances and unplug the whole thing.”fullstatement.)She needed money for a medical procedure,so, during the pandemic,she began working for Liveops as an independent contractor, helping customers for Bath & Body Works. She worked from home. For online orders, Bath & Body Works allowsshoppers to use just one promotion per order. A customer, for example, can use a code to knock down the price of a particular item, but they can’t combine multiple codes. Customers can get upset when this is explained to them.“We encounter customers who ordered the wrong items and want us tosend them the right items for free. We receive calls from customers who have had their packagesstolen. And then we get customers all the time who find out we don’tsell a particular fragrance anymore, and they can be just incredibly abusive.”“I may as wellsay it out loud. We get called bitches all the time. One woman called me a ‘stupid fucking cunt.’”“It can wear on you. We’re not allowed to answer back in thesame way, nor are we allowed to hang up on them. Nor can we hang up on them after giving them one warning. The policy I am told is, we’re not allowed to hang up on any customer under any circumstances, even if they question our race or ethnic background or anything like that. My understanding is that we’re not even allowed to give people a warning.”“We have tosit there basically and listen to these people until they run out ofsteam. It’s like they don’tsee us as a person.”With the pandemic,shesaid, a lot of agents are young women who lost their jobs and are desperate for anything. A lot of her fellow agents are Black women. “I’ve heard themsay they were called ‘stupid n-----,’ ‘youstupid Black bitch.’”Read MoreWhilesome customerservice reps are pressed to work more hours than they want,she got too few. Last fall,shesigned up to work for four and a half hours during one day. She was paid 31 cents per minute of talking time. So whenshe wasn’t getting calls,she wasn’t getting paid. For those four and a half hours,shesaid,shesat there with her headset plugged in.“No calls in those four and a half hours. Nothing. … I gotsome personal budgetstuff done. Surfed websites unrelated to work. Familiarized myself with products on the website. I hate tosay it, but I think I dozed off at one point.”Were there other days in which you got no calls? we asked.“Oh, yes.”“How many?”“I lost track.”Liveops has quality auditors who listen to at least four of an agent’s calls per month,shesaid. Theyscore agents using an audit form, whichsheshared with ProPublica. Itsays agentsshould make a “connected recommendation for each opportunity throughout the interaction” based on the customer’s orders. Say a customer buyssoap. The agentshould ask, “Did you want asoap holder, too?” If a customer buys candles, the agentshould also pitch candleholders.“A customer calls tosay, ‘Hey, I didn’t get my package.’ So I’msupposed tosay, ‘Hey, do you want to buysome more products when youstill don’t have your package?’ Oh, for crying out loud. Really.”The audit form has 20 questions. They include: “9. Did the agent compliment the customer’sselections, reassure about the fragrance choices and/or give general positive reinforcement about the items? … 18. Did the agent apologize when necessary,show empathy and/or recognizes customer emotion? 19. Did the agent let the customer know that we have ‘heard’ them, that we genuinely care, and did the agent remain engaged throughout the entire interaction?”A Liveops documentsaid that if an agent’sscores fall within the “unacceptable” range for three months in a calendar year, “the agent may besubject to removal from the program.”Shesaidshe recently received an emailsayingshe had used profanity on a call,so Liveops was terminating her contract. She didn’t remembersaying anything profane. The company provided no recording for her to listen to. She emailed Liveops and called corporate to ask for details or a chance to hear whatever it isshe wassupposed to havesaid, butshe got no response. (Shesaidshe didn’t make copies of these em ails before her email account was closed.)“No appeal,”shesaid.fullstatement.)She worked as an independent contractor for Arise Virtual Solutions, a company that bills itself as a pioneer in the work-from-home industry. Customers,shesaid, “get mad at us. Theystart cursing at us. Theystart threatening to report us to the main office.” One customer,shesaid, told her he was going to keep her on the line until he got what he wanted; he “started with the F-word,” then apologized, then carried on. He “wouldn’tstop and wouldn’tstop” until finally, realizing the agent wouldn’t give in, he gave up. At one timeshe handled calls from Barnes & Noble customers. “A lot of cursing, a lot of crying — crying — believe it or not. I’ve been called every name in the book. And I do mean from A to Z Everything in between. I’ve been hung up on, threatened, told I’m going to lose my job. I had one woman tell me, ‘I hope you have a miserable day.’ You can’t laugh. I can’t laugh. I’m thinking to myself, ‘You ordered the Bible. You’resome Christian person?’ She’d ordered a Bible! Those are the worst! Those are the worst hypocrites! Theyscream, curse, yell, carry on, threaten. They’re the worst.”“The women, their mouths are unbelievable. Or theystart crying. They’re worse than the men.

She worked in a call center.“If the customer is angry and wants to completely cancel, you have 14 minutes to resolve their issue, get them tostay andsell them a new phone,”shesaid. A unit called workforce management would push agents along. One workforce management monitor wouldsit at a computer, checking the length of each agent’s call. Another would walk the floor. These two would communicate by walkie talkie, one alerting the other to any agent whose call was running long.“At 10 minutes you hadsomebody tapping on yourshoulder. At 12 minutes you hadsomeone tapping on yourshoulder andsaying, ‘Wrap it up, wrap it up, wrap it up.’ At 14 minutes, ‘What’s going on? You need to wrap this up. You need to move on.’”“We had this guy who would run around on the floor yelling, ‘Move it along, people, all hands on deck, move it along, move it along.’”Agents would have management in one ear and customers in the other. Customers would often be insulting,sometimesshockinglyso. She remembered one customer in particular. “He was very, very upset. And it’s personal. You get called names. ‘I hope you fucking die.’” Another Sprint customer told her: “‘I hope when T-Mobile takes over, you all lose your fucking jobs, your fucking families, your fucking homes, and you all kill yourselves.’”Shesaidshe was not allowed to hang up. Only asupervisor could do that. “Where’s the line where you no longer have to take that?”shesaid. “Ispent more than one instance in the bathroom, crying, thenshaking it off and going back to work.”“I’m pretty thick-skinned, and I had nightmares. It beats you down. Everybody is angry. Eight out of 10 calls, they’re angry and they’re cursing by the time they get to you. Usually it’s the men who make it personal. That’s why I coined the term AngryWhiteManistan. ‘I have another resident of AngryWhiteManistan here.’ They’llsay things like, ‘Well, then, you better get mesomeone who is not incompetent.’”In her nightmares,shesaid,she would be doingsome mundane task,such as making dinner in the kitchen, when the phone would ring.

She’s lived in “many, manystates” and worked in many call centers. Nowshe lives out west in a ruralsetting where jobs, and options, arescarce. A few years agoshe found a job that lets her work from home. Shestarted as an agent at Convergys (since acquired by Concentrix), then became asupervisor.“It’s just enough of a wage that you’re going to be ineligible for most publicsupport. I’m not eligible for any financial aid whatsoever. And yet I go to the food bank every month because I don’t make enough money. … I don’t go to the doctor, even when Ishould.”Shesaid the job attracts a lot of new parents. And retirees. And people with medical issues. Shesaid that in her experience, the turnover is “tremendous.” Within months, many people get fired, or “termed,”short for terminated. “We fire more than they resign. A lot more.”Most firings are over attendance. What counts as an attendance infraction? “Anything. It doesn’t matter if it’s in your control or not. … Your power goes out and, bam, you’re absent. ... Doesn’t matter if you had a hurricane.”“You don’t know if you’re going to have a job tomorrow.”Once, as asupervisor,she listened to a recording of a call that had been made to an agent working at home, answering calls from customers for DirecTV. “DirecTV had a policy, you never hung up on a customer, ever. Yousimply weren’t allowed to, no matter what theysaid.” (ProPublica interviewed another agent who also understood this to be the case.)“There was a guy who called in and masturbated on the phone. It was awful. … Just imagine being a woman in your office in your home, alone. And here’s this guy doing this, and it takes you a few minutes to figure out what thatsound is, and when you do you’re horrified, and you don’t know what to do. All you know is, you’re not allowed to hang up the phone. That would be horrible. I feltso terrible for her.”The agent, crying, asked ifshe could quit for the day without an attendance infraction. “We had the recorded call, it’s not like it was ever in doubt. My boss was a man, at first he did not understand why that was an issue.” He didn’t understand why the agent wasso troubled. “I had to go to HR to get them to explain to him why it was an issue.” Only then could the agentstop taking calls.: “We recognize that the work-at-home environment isn’t foreveryone. … We take the health andsafety of ourstaff veryseriously and do not have a no hang-up policy. Ourstaff are given extensive training to manage each interaction with techniques to deflect and diffusesituationsshould they arise. Ifsubjected to harassment or abuse they are trained and empowered to end the conversation.” (See Concentrix’sfullstatement.)She’s in her 60s and wanted a work-from-home job to keep her familysafe during the pandemic. Shesaw a company called Arise Virtual Solutions mentioned online, butshe wasskeptical. She would be an independent contractor, required to absorbsubstantialstartup costs.

She decided to give it a chance. “I was like, ‘I need work.’ … I’d kind of given up on findingsomething more legit, frankly, because of the pandemic. So it was a pandemic Band-Aid for me.”She answered calls from customers for Home Depot. One, a nurse’s aide, had ordered a portable toilet for a client. “This woman was like, ‘I have a 90-year-old lady who needs this thing like, yesterday, and you haven’t delivered it for three weeks, what is your problem?’” To the agent, this was urgent. “When it became a humanitarian issue, and there were plenty of humanitarian issues, especially during the pandemic,”she wouldsend the matter to people above her, who would thensend it to Home Depot to dosomething. The customer’s problem might then be resolved. “But mystats would go down,”shesaid, becauseshe hadn’t resolved the matter herself. (Sheshared Arise’s performance metrics with us.)On days when the phone didn’tstop ringing — and there were many —she couldn’tstep away from her desk. “I had a bottle I kept under my desk in case I had to urinate. I never used it, but I had it there if I needed it. I’m in my 60s. … There could be an emergency.”The work was isolating. She joined Facebook groups (and providedscreenshots to ProPublica) and began to talk with other frustrated agents. She realizedshe was among the few white women in her work cohort. Andshe realized customers were nicer to her — an immigrant with a British accent. “When I first came to this country, I couldn’t believe people could tell the color of a person over the phone. That was a cultureshock. ... When people are calling in, I think they find it easier to yell at a Black woman. … I’m not the most evolved person, but I began to look at the work through a racial lens. ... I answered the phone, and there were people who called, and right at the beginning of the call, they were full of white-hot rage.” Then they would hear her accent. “Well, the amount of comments I got from people who were like, ‘Wow, they’ve got classy people here!’ … I was born in a British colony.

Shesigned on at age 23, hopingshe might be matched with a company thatsold beauty products. At her orientation three weeks later, Mara learned which account — that is, which of Concentrix’s corporate clients —she would be matched with. She would be working part time, doing video calls and live chats for Intuit. She would be helping people use TurboTax. Mara didn’t have an office. Butshe did have a closet. Soshe turned her closet into an office. (Shesent us photographs.) “Theysent me a bluescreen to put behind my chair,”shesays. That way, customers wouldn’t knowshe was working from home, much less from inside her closet. She bought a computer, a monitor, a headset.“We were notsupposed to hang up. … You’resupposed to hear them out, then empathize with them, then acknowledge that the problem was made. I had tried all that. Theysay, you know, apologize, but the peoplestay angry.”One customer called her, moaning. “I was very uncomfortable. I couldn’t tell if he wassick; I couldn’t tell if he was watching porn in the background. I just tried to get through the guy’s questions.” Afterwardshe told a friend thatshe thought the man on the other end of the line had been masturbating. (The friend confirmed this conversation.)She learned that agents were monitored. “We had a webcam, and [the monitors] cansee you through the webcam. … I’m notsure how often you were watched. But the trainer didsay youshouldshut down your computer after yourshift because they canstillsee you.

Shestruggled to answer questions about complicated tax forms. She would Google for answers in a different window while trying to look confident to the customer, who couldsee her on the video call. “I had a nightmareso bad that I’d wake up at 6 in the morning over this job. I cried. I’m asensitive person,so a lot of people probably wouldn’t have cried. … I didn’t know what I was doing. … I was like, ‘I finally have a job, but I don’t know what the answers are.’”Mara didn’t feel likeshe could quit. For the most part,shesaid, her metrics were high. But customers weren’t responding tosurvey questions about her performance. And her lowestscore was her “doc rate” — documentation rate — which penalizes agents for not closing out a chat with a customer. They get credit only when a customersays, “Yes, you have answered all my questions.”“Some people don’t answer back after they get the answers they need. For those types of chats and everything, we couldn’t close those cases. My doc rate dropped because ...

57,Nasa’s Mars landing is a reminder that good science depends on good politics,-6.0,36.0,https://www.newstatesman.com/international/science-tech/2021/02/nasa-s-mars-landing-reminder-good-science-depends-good-politics,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-statesman-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-19,16,"Thesuccessful landing of Nasa’s Perseverance rover on Mars last night is a moment ofscientific triumph. The mission could uncover profound truths about the Red Planet and our place in the universe. But weshould not content ourselves thatscience is celebrated and accepted everywhere. The past year has demonstrated the waysscience can besidelined whenever it is politically expedient. Most of the differences between the modern world and the ancient one can be attributed toscience. Thescientific revolution introduced an entirely new attitude toward what could be considered fact. It wasn’t enough any longer to juststate what you thought; you had to explain why you thought it, and exactly how you had reached your conclusion. In particular, the founders of modernscience, among them those “ingenious and curious gentlemen” (as they described themselves) of the early Royal Society advocated that there was only one way to discoverscientific truths about nature: by patient experiment, observation and reasoning. Thissame approach is employed today, not only byscientists but by lawyers, detectives and anyone whose work involves categorising phenomena, forming hypotheses and testing evidence. But the desire tosuppress or evenstifle intellectual freedom andscientific thinking are equally durable. Such attempts fail in the long run, but they can nonetheless have a chilling effect on progress inscience that can last for decades. One infamous example was that of Galileo Galilei. Following his trial by the Inquisition, in which he was found “vehementlysuspected of heresy”, thescientist and philosopher René Descartes wrote to a mathematician friend:“I inquired in Leiden and Amsterdam whether Galileo’s World System was available, for I thought I had heard that it was published in Italy last year. I was told that it had indeed been published, but that all the copies had immediately been burnt at Rome, and that Galileo had been convicted and fined. I wasso astonished at this that I almost decided to burn all my papers, or at least to let no onesee them.”The great poet John Milton, who visited Galileo in 1638, wrote that the Inquisition’s restrictions on “philosophic freedom” in Italy meant that “nothing had been there written now these many years but flattery and fustian”. But just asscience persists,so does the denial ofscience. Donald Trump, who claimed climate change was “an expensive hoax”, and that “the concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive”, denied the alarming conclusions of thousands of climatestudies worldwide. As the Trump administration began the process of withdrawing from the Paris climate agreement and attempted to freeze fuel efficiencystandards imposed on new vehicles, it also took aim at thescience itself,suppressing research thatshowed the effects of climate change on the US, removingscientific advisers and restricting the data that government agencies could use to make decisions on public health and the environment. In March 1616, the Tuscan ambassador to Rome wrote that “the Roman climate is getting very dangerous [for Galileo], […] for the present Pope [Paul V], who abhors the liberal arts and this kind of mind, cannotstand these novelties andsubtleties; and everyone here tries to adjust his mind and his nature to that of the ruler.” Four centuries later, little has changed in the relationship between power and truth. The Covid-19 pandemic, too, has been characterised by the dismissal ofscientific opinion. On 22 January 2020, Trumpsaid in an interview that the disease was “totally under control. It’s one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It’s going to be just fine.” Even in March, in a meeting with Leo Varadkar, Trump continued to brag: “The USs, because of what I did, and what the administration did with China, we have 32 deaths at this point. Other countries that aresmaller countries have many, many deaths.” That was less than a year ago. At time of writing, the USs has more than 25 million cases and is nearing 500,000 deaths. Nor was this attitude limited to the Trump administration. Boris Johnson wasslow to recognise the grave risks involved, and even after the pandemic had become impossible to ignore, his government did notsucceed in putting together a rapid, effective response. Allscientific theories are provisional. Knowledge has to be constantly reappraised as fresh evidence becomes available. But onlyscience can promise a continuous mid-courseself-correction, even onsimple things: when we were young, milk and eggs were good; a decade later, we were warned off them because of cholesterol; today, they are recommended in moderation. This is not consistent with politicians’ need to be right, and tostay right. But it is never a good idea to bet against the judgement ofscience. To doso when human life (as in the case of the Covid-19 pandemic) or the future of the planet’s biosphere (as in the case of climate change) is atstake is unconscionable. CP Snow’s 1959 lecture on the “Two Cultures” bemoaned the failure ofscholars in the humanities to appreciate the “creativity” and imagination that are essential to the practice ofscience. Scienceshouldsurely feature in everyone’s culture; it’s not just for potentialscientists. There are two main reasons: first, it’s a real intellectual deprivation not to understand the natural world around us, and to be blind to the marvellous vistas opened by Darwin’s theory of evolution or by the breakthroughs in modern cosmology – the chain of emergent complexity leading all the way from a “Big Bang” tostars, planets, biospheres and human brains able to ponder the wonder and the mystery of it all. It is essential to marvel at the intricate web of life on which we all depend, and to understand its vulnerabilities. Second, we live in a world where more and more of the decisions that governments must make involvescience. Obviously Covid-19 and climate change are at the forefront of our minds today, but policies on health, energy, the environment andspace-related existential risks all have ascientific dimension. But these policies have economic,social and ethical aspects as well. And on those aspects,scientistsspeak only as citizens, and all citizensshould be involved in democratic choices. If there is to be a proper debate, rising above meresloganeering, everyone needs to be informed, to have enough of a feel forscience to avoid becoming bamboozled by propaganda and badstatistics. The need for proper debate will become even more acute in the future, as the pressures on the environment and those resulting from misdirected technology become more diverse and threatening. The US has already rejoined the Paris agreement, but the war on facts waged by Trump is far from over. There remains little agreement on what defines a reliablesource, and itseems that we may have to take up Galileo’s defiant call (apocryphal as it may be) “And yet it moves” as a rallying cry: a reminder that, inspite of what you may believe, the facts do remain thesame. We have been there before. In, Hannah Arendt prophetically wrote: “The idealsubject of totalitarian rule is not the convinced Nazi or the convinced communist, but people for whom the distinction between fact and fiction (ie the reality of experience) and the distinction between true and false (ie thestandards of thought) no longer exist.”Galileo and the Science Deniers.

In March, 21-year-oldstudent Koki Ozoraset up the Japanese online counselingsite, Anata no Ibasho and told Insider: ""Anata no Ibasho means 'A Place for You iso I wanted to tell people that even if you are lonely atschool, work or home, there is a place for you with us.""Hesaid that he grew up lonely and depressed, and a highschool teacher was the first adult he could trust, adding: ""Without him, I would not even be around today. It was a miracle I came across him,so I want to offer that miracle to others.""There are now 700 volunteers involved, many of whom live abroad in different time zones and can provide counseling between 10pm and dawn, when the need forsuicide prevention runs highest. The most common calls are from people withsuicidal thoughts, while others reportstress and anxiety, Ozora added. Although Japan has declared astate of emergency, lock down has never been imposed, but record COVID-19 deaths mean it might be. Experts are concerned about how this could impact mental health, especially that of women who have been disproportionately affected this year, with an 83% rise insuicide cases to 851, compared to a 22% male increase to 1302. Ozorasaid: ""There areseveral potential reasons for this. Women make up a larger percentage of part-time workers in the hotel, foodservice and retail industries - where layoffs have been deep.""In addition, asuccession of Japanese celebrities who had many female fans have taken their lives in recent months.""While the Japanese media rarely details thespecifics ofsuch deaths - deliberately not dwelling on method or motive - the mere reporting on these cases often causes an increase insuicide in the general public.""Japan has the highestsuicide rate in the G7 andsubsequently reports its data every month compared to other countries, including the US, the latest national data collected in 2018. However,suicides decreased and fell by 4% to 19,959 in 2019, the lowest amountsince records began in 1978,CNNreported.

That won’t have much practical impact on county residents at this point, but thesymbolic gesture indicates how far the county has progressed insuppressing the deadly virus, hesaid.“We are no longer in an emergency responding to Covid-19 from the public healthstandpoint,’' McMahonsaid today. County health officials today confirmed just five new cases of the virussince Monday, the lowest one-day totalsince early September. There are 94 county residents with active cases of Covid-19, the fewest in more than 14 months. McMahon declared astate of emergency in the county March 14, 2020, and issued a variety of executive orders in the following months to deal with Covid-19. His orders expedited county purchasing procedures, required face coverings at county facilities and capped food delivery fees, among many other measures. Given the waning threat from the virus, McMahonsaid he expects to let most or all of them expire next week.“When it comes to responding to Covid-19, neither the county of Onondaga nor thestate of New York is really in an emergency,’' hesaid. Increasingly, McMahonsaid he will focus county efforts on reviving the economy and dealing with humanservice needs that were exacerbated by the pandemic. He mentioned drug abuse, mental health and youth violencespecifically. The county on Tuesday finished giving away $100,000 worth of vouchers that can be used at local restaurants. For thesecond time, the vouchers weresnapped up quickly, leaving many people frustrated. Some $75,000 in vouchers became available online Monday evening and were taken within 18 minutes, McMahonsaid. The giveaway attractedsome 60,000 unique visitors to the county website. Another $25,000 in vouchers was awarded today tosenior citizens, who could claim them by phone. Those vouchers were gone within two hours, McMahonsaid. So far, the county has given away a total of $500,000 in vouchers, which can be used to double the value of gift cards purchased from restaurants. McMahon called the program a “wildsuccess’' that will help local businesses recover from the pandemic.“I understand people may be frustrated if you didn’t get a voucher,’' hesaid.

Elder leads at 16% in a newEmerson College/Nexstar Media poll. Elder, a 69-year-old Republican, is followed by businessman John Cox, at 6%, and former San Diego mayor Kevin Faulconer, at 6%. California State Assemblyman Kevin Kiley, and Jenner are at 4% each, according to the poll. The poll found that 48 percent of votersstill want Newsom to remain in office but the number of people who want him out is increasing. Forty-three percent of people polled nowsay they will vote to recall Newsom — up from 38 percent in March. A majority of voterssay they don’t know yet who they’d want if Newsom is booted from office. Elder has a nationallysyndicated talkshow and is a frequent guest on Fox News. He calls himself the “Sage of South Central”on his website, a reference to where he grew up in LA Former Fox News anchor and now pod caster Megyn Kelly is a fan, frequently tweeting out “LARRY!” on her feed. Eldersaid Newsom’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic is why he decided to run.“The arrogance of Gavin Newsom was crystalized by the way he handled this pandemic,” Elder told theSacramento ObserverFriday.“This man has presided over the mostsevere coronavirus lock down in all 50states. People lost their jobs, people lost their livelihoods, meanwhile his own private business kept open and his own kids remained in in-person privateschools,” hesaid. Eldersays he’s not focusing on other candidates.“The target is Newsom,” hesaid. “If he isn’t recalled, it doesn’t matter. I intend to be the person that you write down or you check off for who you want as a replacement when you recall this guy. He’s going.”Eldersaid he’s not normally in favor of recalls or impeachments.“But whensomeone has becomeso outrageous,sometimessomething has to be done,” hesaid. The recall effort against Newsom, launched in January 2020, gainedstrength due to the governor’s response to the coronavirus pandemic, which led to the closure ofschools and businesses even as Newsom himself was photographed violatingstate restrictions on indoor gatherings.",1,1,New York Post

Rachel George, a longtime Republican operative in Colorado,sent an email to at least one other local GOPstrategist on Tuesday asking them tosign West’sPresidential Electors' Acceptance of Nomination formso he can appear on the 2020 ballot in Colorado. George begins the email by asking for “the most random favor”: Would they be willing toserve as an Electoral College representative for Kanye West?It’s clear from the tone of the email, obtained by VICE News, thatshe thinks it’s a rather funny, last-minute effort to mess with Joe Biden and Democrats.“I have the most random favor to ask of you ever… would you help me get Kanye West on the ballot in Colorado? No, I am not joking, and I realize this is hilarious,”she wrote. Later, Georgesaysshe’s looking for operatives who are “in on the joke” to help West get on the ballot. George, who now runs her own firm, RBG Communications, has previously held a variety of positions with Republican campaigns and operatives, including a three-yearstint as communications director for then-Rep. Cory Gardner. Gardner is now asenator facing an uphill battle for reelection in the blue-trendingstate. She’s also married to Andy George, another longtime GOP operative in thestate. Both havespent more than a decade immersed in Republican politics. George’s Twitter feed reads as a paean to Gardner, with occasional defenses of Trump. In the email, George makes clear that West’s campaign is trying to keep its inner workings out of the public eye. West’s nascent campaign hasso far refused to engage in aserious manner with reporters, asign they don’t want their effortsscrutinized too closely.“A reporter could request [the form] and call you asking why yousigned,”she wrote in the email. “But you would just ignore that call and let me know, and the campaign would handle it.”Republicans have watched giddily as West weighed a potential 2020 bid, hoping he might draw crucial votes away from Biden and boost President Trump’s reelection chances. In recent days, there’s been mounting evidence of a coordinated effort by GOP operatives,some with ties to the Trump campaign, to makesure that West does qualify in keyswingstates. It’s unclear how directly involved West is in this process — or how much clear thought he’s put into the campaign takingshape around him. West’s rambling, partially incoherent campaign launchspeech in South Carolina led to publicspeculation about his mental health, and his wife, Kim Kardashian, recently posted on insta gram about West’s bipolar disorder and asked for compassion from the public. It’s easy to get on the ballot in Colorado — presidential campaigns just pay a fee and find nine registered voters tosign a public document pledging to vote for their candidate if they win the Electoral College. But from the email, it’s clear exactly how last-minute the efforts to get West on the ballot have been. George didn’t respond to requests for comment, nor did Gregg Keller, another longtime GOP operative who’s been linked to West’s campaign. An email to West’s press office didn’t receive a response either. Here’s her full email:",1,1,Vice

Criticssay the bill deters freespeech and attempts tosilence civil protests about important issues of the time. SB 33 defines critical infrastructure as oil and alumina refineries; electric generation facilities,substations,switchingstations and transmission lines; chemical, polymer and rubber manufacturing facilities; water intakestructure, water treatment or waste water facilities; natural gas company facilities, compressors and pipelines, and about a dozen other projects.

When thesuit-clad former prosecutorstepped up to the podium to give herspeech,she commended the women who fought for the right to vote and the women in her family who nurtured her.“My mother instilled in mysister Maya and me the values that we chart,”shesaid,smiling at the camera. She added, “She taught us to put family first. [Both] the family you are born into and the family you choose.”Then,she named an important member of her chosen family.“Family is my beloved Alpha Kappa Alpha,”shesaid. Alpha Kappa Alpha (AKA)—one of the nation’s oldest blacksororities, whose members include luminaries like actressPhylicia Rashadand poetMaya Angelou—had a profound impact on Harris’ life. The vice president-elect joined the esteemedsorority in 1986 whenshe was asenior at Howard University, a federally chartered historically black university (HBCU), notes Janelle Okwodu in. But Harris’ affiliation with the group didn’t end whenshe graduated—her linesisters would become close friends, and many of them encouraged her on the campaign trail by making donations of exactly $19.08, a reference to the year AKA was founded. Thesenator’s tribute to AKA highlighted her affection for the group. In fact, her emotional connection to thesorority runsso deep thatshe wore asymbol insupport of hersisters—a 34”necklacebejeweled with Akoya and South Sea pearls—to her acceptancespeech.“Thestrand of pearlsspeaks tosolidarity among the members,” Glenda Glover, international president of AKA, told’s Daisy Shaw-Ellis in a 2020 article. “It’s a great moment for AKA For African Americans. For women. Whethershe wears pearls or not, it’s an inspiration.”Harris often expresses thissolidary and hasworn pearls at important events from her college graduation photos hoot to herswearing in ceremony as a USssenator of California in 2017. For this reason, thousands of women plan to wear pearls on Inauguration Day insupport ofHarris.“Pearls represent refinement and wisdom,” Glover told Shaw-Ellis. “We train young ladies to be leaders and to makesure they have the wisdom to lead…and that goes hand in hand with the true meaning of what AKA is all about.”According tomagazine’s Jill Newman, pearls have been asymbol of AKA for decades. Its founders are referred to as the “Twenty Pearls,” and every inductee is given a badge with 20 pearls. The Smithsonian isNational Museum of African American History and Culture(NMAAHC) has 15 AKAbadges,pendants, medallions and pins in its collection. Theobjectswere acquisition ed in 2011 along with various AKA-related materials,such as books and magazines,says Michèle Gates Moresi, the museum’ssupervisory curator of collections. The DC History Center gave the artifacts to the museum following their travelling exhibition, “100 Years of Service: The Alpha Kappa Alpha Story.”Some highlights from the collections include a, which has asalmon pink and apple green AKAseal at its center. A diamond rests at the peak of theseal, honoring diamond members who were initiated between 1938 and 1939.

Leadership is a principle that undercuts the “Divine Nine,” a group of nine historically black fraternities andsororities, which is formally known as the National Pan-Hellenic Council. Most of the Divine Nine were created in the early 20th century to foster communities of like-minded individuals and to improve the world around them, as Lawrence C Ross Jr., author of, toldNPR’s Karen Grigsby Bates in 2020.“You really begin tosee development of African American fraternities right around 1906,” Rosssaid. “A lot of this is tied basically to the idea that college moved from being the place of the elite where they would just go to be able to get a degree as part of the educated class, to a place where college was part of thesocial and economic movement insociety.”Ross also emphasized that these groups were important for building asense of belonging and accountability.“Black people, and not just black people in the Divine Nine, understand that they are not in collegesimply based upon their own individual characteristics. And they have a moral responsibility not just to get a degree for themselves, but to also enrich the community,” Rosssaid. “They recognize thestructure [of mainstreamsociety] is intentionally created to denigrate them assecond-class citizens. And what they are doing typically in the work of the fraternities andsororities is trying to de construct that.”Ethel Hedgeman founded AKA in 1908 at Howard University withsimilar aims: She wanted to create asupport network for black womenso that they could uplift themselves and others. According to thesorority’swebsite, Hedgeman and eight of her classmates formed a group that, “fostered interaction,stimulation and ethical growth among members.” Five years later, the group was incorporated, which ensured its legacy. From its inception, the group has focused on learning, providing aid for the poor and advancing civil rights. By the time Harris gave her acceptancespeech last year, the group’s numbers had ballooned to more than 300,000 members.“We weren’t just told we had the capacity to be great; we were challenged to live up to that potential,” Harris wrote of her AKA experience in her autobiography,. “There was an expectation that we would cultivate and use our talents to take on roles in leadership and have an impact on other people, in our country, and maybe even the world.”In her acceptancespeech, Harrisspoke about howshe wanted to have this impact, emphasizing that, “Every human being is of infinite worth deserving of compassion, dignity and respect.” Shespoke aboutsolidarity, about how it is necessary to work with others to create a better world. Her message resonated with thousands of women across the country, and many of them plan on wearing pearls this Inauguration Day tosupport Harris. One Facebook group, “Wear Pearls on Jan 20th, 2021,” currently has around 375,800 members from 99 countries.“When you think about a pearl, its created by the roughness, you know, and we have pearls in every color,shape andsize,”says Hope Aloaye, founder of the Facebook group. “Pearls are linked to every woman.”Though Aloaye is not a member of AKA,shestill believes that championing other women is important and that wearing pearls can publicly display camaraderie, “[We] have women of every color, race,size, ethnicity and vocation,” Aloayesays. “We have one common goal, which is to represent women on the 20thsupporting a woman.”Get the latest on what is happening in your inbox.",2,2,Smithsonian Magazine

Biden announced the breakthrough after a 30-minute meeting with thesenators in the Oval Office, ending a weeks longstalemate over the price tag and how to pay for what would be the largest transportation package ever approved by Congress. The $1.2 trillion plan includes $579 billion in newspending over eight years, focusing only on physical infrastructuresuch as roads, bridges, rail, broadband internet, water andsewer pipes, and electric vehicles.

In remarks from the White House East Room, Biden touted the ""long overdue"" infrastructure investments that hesaidshows the world ""we can function, deliver and dosignificant things."" But he also called it a ""big day"" for only half his economic agenda. In tandem, hesaid he will pursueseparate legislation on ""human infrastructure,"" which is opposed by Republicans and pushed by liberals. To pass the bill, he will have to rely on a legislative maneuver called reconciliation, which would allow Democrats to approve it with asimple majority in the 50-50 Senate, where Vice President Kamala Harris can break ties.""We will try to getsome compromise there, and if we can not, I willsee if I can attract all the Democrats into a position,"" Bidensaid.

From the beginning of negotiations, Republicans did not budge from their position that a bipartisan dealstick only to physical infrastructure and avoid tax increases that targeted corporations and the wealthy. The bipartisan deal achieves both GOP aims. It proposes $312 billion for transportation, including $109 billion for repairs to roads and bridges, $66 billion for passenger and freight rail, $49 billion for public transit and $25 billion for airports.

""And with the commitment of Republican and Democrats alike that we are going to get this across the finish line.""To pay for infrastructure,senators and Biden agreed to more than a dozen fundingsources led bystrengthening the Internal Revenue Service to enforce tax collections. By going after those that owe taxes but do not pay them – particularly high-income earners – the federal government could recoup as much as $140 billion over eight years for a net gain of $100 billion that can be used to cover the cost of expanded infrastructure,said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., one of thesenators who negotiated the deal. Biden also agreed to repurpose unused COVID-19 relief funds passed in 2020 during the Trump administration as well as unused unemployment insurance benefits from Biden is American Rescue Plan, a COVID-19 relief bill made law earlier this year. Othersources include public-private partnerships, private activity bonds and asset recycling.

Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnellsaid Pelosi and Schumer “pulled the rug out from under their bipartisan negotiators” bysaying that the infrastructure deal would only advance if it was tied to a vote on the larger reconciliation package.“Less than two hours after publicly commending our colleagues and actually endorsing the bipartisan agreement, the president took the extraordinarystep of threatening to veto it,” McConnellsaid on the Senate floor Thursday afternoon. “It almost makes your headspin: an expression of bipartisanship and then an ultimatum on behalf of your left-wing base.”After Bidenscaled back his initial $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan and agreed toseek approval of his other proposalsseparately, the biggeststicking point became how to pay for the bills. Republicans opposed unwinding former President Donald Trump is 2017 tax cuts, forcing Biden to retreat from his push to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% in the bipartisan package. The corporate tax hike and other taxes on the wealthy are expected to be in Democrats' reconciliation bill instead. Republicansenators proposed raising the per-gallon gas tax by tying it to inflation and new user fees for electric vehicles. But the White Housestood firmly against both options, noting it would abandon Biden is pledge not to raise taxes on Americans earning less than $400,000.""We have agreed on the price tag, thescope and how to pay for it,""said Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine. ""It was not easy on getting agreement on all three, but it was essential.""Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska,said the compromisesends a message ""that we actually can work, that we actually can perform, that we can dosomething, not for Republicans or Democrats, but for Americans.""White Housestands firm against increasing gas tax as Biden,senators prepare to meet on infrastructureBiden ends infrastructure talks with GOP group ofsenators, pushes ahead with moderatesThe bipartisan Senate talksstarted after Bidenended previous negotiations with Republican Senatecommittee leaders who had the backing of McConnell. Although Biden is trimmed-down infrastructure proposal earned himsupport from Republicans – delivering on a campaign commitment toseek bipartisanship – he is gotten push back from progressives, particularly climate advocates. They fear moderate Democrats will not vote for a reconciliation package now that they claim a bipartisan win on infrastructure.""There will not be a bipartisan agreement unless – written instone – there is an understanding that there will be a major, major reconciliation bill,"" Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt, chairman of the Senate Budget Committeesai don The Dean Obeidallah Show. Lauren Maunus, advocacy director for Sunrise Movement, a youth-led environmental organization,said ""we can’t afford to kick the can down the road any further"" on climate-change initiatives. She called Biden is first proposal ""already the compromise,"" arguing $1 trillion a year is needed to fight the climate crisis.""When Democrats agree to water it down more, they’re condemning Americans to untold devastation,""shesaid. “We demand no climate, no deal.""'Worst is yet to come': Disastrous future ahead for millions worldwide due to climate change, report warnsThe 10 Senate Democratic caucus members whosupport the infrastructure deal are Manchin, Warner, Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, Kyrsten Sinema and Mark Kelly of Arizona, Jon Tester of Montana, Chris Coons of Delaware, Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire and John Hickenlooper of Colorado. Angus King, an independent from Maine who caucuses with the Democrats, also endorsed the plan. The 11 Republicans are: Murkowski, Collins, Portman, Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, Mitt Romney of Utah, Richard Burr and Thom Tillis of North Carolina, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Mike Rounds of South Dakota, Todd Young of Indiana and Jerry Moran of Kansas. Biden expressed faith the Republicansenators will keep their word and vote for the compromise. Hesingled out Romney, Collins and Murkowski,saying “they’ve never broken their words to me” andsaid he trusted them to “stick to the deal.'""Romneysaid for “years and years people have been talking about infrastructure needs of our country,"" touting how his colleagues came together ""and got a job done.”“I don’t know how far it’s going to get,” he acknowledged. “I think it will get all the way. We’ve got the president behind it, this group here. But we’re going to keep working together. We’re not finished.”",2,2,USA Today

71,Dems Have Crazy New Plan to Fund Biden’s Infrastructure Bill: Make Billionaires Pay Their Fair Share,-16.33,35.0,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/10/democrats-billionaire-tax-plan,https://adfontesmedia.com/vanity-fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-22,25,"As you’ve probably heard by now,would like to pass asweeping infrastructure plan that would make life better for millions of people. Republicans, who’ve made it abundantly clear that they don’t give a crap about improving people’s lives, are obviously against anything that doesn’tstart with a “t” and end with an “ax cut,” and will thus fight this thing tooth and nail. But Democrats are also having trouble coming to a consensus re: how to fund the thing, withsenators likeKyrsten Sinemaexpressing opposition to a rise in tax rates. So party leadership has gone back to the drawing board and come up with a new proposal: making the richest people in the country, the ones who literallyshit money, pay their fairshare. PerWashington Post:Senior Democrats are preparing asweeping new tax plan that would aim to raise hundreds of billions of dollars from the fortunes of America’s roughly 700 billionaires, an abruptshift in the party’s approach to funding a large expansion of thesafety net…. Senate Finance Chair(D-Ore.) is drafting the plan, but bothsenior Biden officials and othersenior Democrats are cautiously optimistic Sinema and other centrist lawmakerssupport the effort, according to interviews with three congressional aides and two administration officials, whospoke on the condition of anonymity to reflectsensitive negotiations. “The Billionaires Income Tax is about fairness andshowing the American people taxes aren’t mandatory for them and optional for the wealthiest people in the country,” Wydensaid in astatement. “No working person in this country thinks it’s right that billionaires can pay no taxes for years on end, andsometimes never at all.”Currently, wealthy Americans do not have to pay taxes on vast accumulations of wealth because they are only taxed once the asset issold. Billionaires often borrow against their non-taxed assets, which allows them tospend enormoussums of money while effectively paying very low taxes relative to their income and worth. Under the “Billionaire Income Tax” proposal, asummary of which was obtained byth e federal government would require billionaires to pay taxes on the increased value of their assetssuch asstocks on an annual basis, regardless of whether theysell those assets. Billionaires would also be able to take deductions for the annual loss in value of those assets. It would alsoset up asystem for taxing assets that are not easily tradable, like real estate. The tax would apply to billionaires and people earning over $100 million in income three years in a row. Whichseems pretty reasonable, particularly to people who, for example, didn’tsee their net worth double in the past year to $222 billion, as was the case for who recently took to Twitter totauntJeff Bezosfor only being worth roughly $194 billion, and thus the richest person in the world. (Yes, this happened, and is probably a good argument not just for a tax on billionaires but for bringing back the gulag.)Aspokesman for Sinema would not confirm or deny whethershesupports the billionaire tax,saying only thatshe “is committed to ensuring everyday families can get ahead and that we continue creating jobs,” and that “she has told her colleagues and the president thatsimply raising tax rates will not in any way address the challenge of tax avoidance or improve economic competitiveness.” The White House has reportedly been involved in crafting the details, and Biden has endorsed the concept. Republicans, it’ssafe to assume, will be throwing an absolute hissy fit over the whole thing inshort order, because if there’s one thing they can’tstand, it’s the ultra rich paying their fairshare.heretosubscribe. ByChris MurphyByNick BiltonByErin VanderhoofProcedural arguments will be heard on November 1, but in the meantime, Texas‘s barbaric abortion law, banning the procedure atsix weeks, will remain in effect. Per:The Supreme Court on Friday once again refused to immediately block a Texas law that banned most abortions aftersix weeks. But the justices agreed to fast-track their consideration of appeals from the Justice Department and abortion providers in Texas,scheduling arguments for November 1. Only Justicefiled a dissent. “For thesecond time, the court is presented with an application to enjoin astatute enacted in open disregard of the constitutional rights of womenseeking abortion care in Texas,”she wrote. “For thesecond time, the court declines to act immediately to protect these women from grave and irreparable harm.”Butshe addedshe welcomed the court’s decision to hear arguments in the two cases, which will apparently be limited to the procedural question of whether the Texas law, SB 8, issubject to review in federal court given its novelstructure. The courtsaid it would decide this question in the federal government’s appeal: “May the USs bringsuit in federal court and obtain injunctive or declaratory relief against thestate,state court judges,state court clerks, otherstate officials or all private parties to prohibit SB 8 from being enforced?”While the court rejected a request from Texas officials to use the cases to decide whether to overturn people who think what a pregnant person does with their body is their business and their business aloneshouldn’t get too excited just yet. In December, the justices will hear arguments in a case concerning a Mississippi law banning abortion at 15 weeks, and it’s entirely possible that the court’s conservatives will use the opportunity to roll back the landmark decision.

On Friday, The Daily Beast revealed that Gaetz had not paid the fees he owes to the Florida Bar, which regulates lawyers there. That mistake prompted the organization to deem him “delinquent” and “not eligible to practice law in Florida.”Rather than assert that letting his license lapse was asimple oversight that he orsomeone on hisstaff willsoon remedy, Gaetz’s communication director initially claimed it was intentional. “Congressman Gaetz is no longer actively engaged in the practice of law. He is focused on representing his constituents in Congress, not the courtroom,”said(After The Daily Beast’sstory published, the outlet reported that Gaetz “rushed to file asigned petition to get reinstated and pay the $265 fee—plus another $200 in late fees,” citing the Florida Bar.) Lawyers whospoke to The Daily Beastsaid Gaetz’s decision to let his license become delinquent underscores the fact that he’s a clown. “He clearly doesn’t take his law license veryseriously when he doesn’t take the time to pay the $265 dues,”saidDaniel Uhlfelder,an attorney who lives in Gaetz’s district. “He’s not aserious lawyer.

Afterfallingshort of its July 4 goal to have 70 percent of Americans vaccinated, the administrationseems to be turning to a more community-focused method. In a Tuesday press briefing, President Biden warned of the danger caused by the COVID-19 Delta variant,tellingreporters that “we need to go to [sic] community by community, neighborhood by neighborhood, and oftentimes, door to door — literally knocking on doors — to get help to the remaining people protected from the virus.”Press Secretary Jen Psaki echoed the president’s remarks, reiterating the administration’s commitment to “targeted, community-by-community, door-to-door outreach to get remaining Americans vaccinated by ensuring they have the information they need about both howsafe and accessible the vaccine is.”Some on the political left have criticized Biden’s door-knocking initiative as not enough, including Obama-era Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. “You know, we’re going to tiptoe around mandates,” SebeliustoldtheNew York Times. “Come on. I’m kind of over that.”But thestrategy has also generated disapproval from those uncomfortable with the idea of government employees knocking on Americans’ doors. Podcaster Dave Rubinpointedout that America’s COVID-19 response changed “[f]rom ‘two weeks to flatten the curve’ to ‘a man with dementia is going tosend government operatives to your house to makesure you’re vaccinated.’ ”Republican legislators also heavily criticized the policy, with Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas)tweeting, “How about don’t knock on my door. You’re not my parents. You’re the government. Make the vaccine available, and let people be free to choose. Why is that conceptso hard for the left?”Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.)warnedthe administration against the newstrategy: “A lot of people have big government antibodies. Don’t knock on those doors.”Republicans also questioned the door-to-door campaign tactic’s effectiveness. GOPstrategist Matt Whitlocknotedthat government employeesshowing up at American homes was not astrategy to endear the unvaccinated: “Whoeversuggested that the best way to reach remaining vaccineskeptics was to talk about going door to doorshould be fired immediately.

74,The world’s happiest people have a beautifully simple way to tackle loneliness,-1.25,36.25,https://qz.com/1591563/the-danish-have-designed-a-simple-way-to-cope-with-loneliness/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"Toad, a 20-year-old Danish woman living in Copenhagen, has been lonely her whole life. She is autistic, and as a child, did not have any friends. Whenshe moved from the country to the city, not much changed. “Theysays it’s a phase, but a phase becomes a life,”shesays,surrounded bysix other young adults in a cozy apartment in Copenhagen—all of whom are working on becoming less lonely. Toad is among the attendees ofVentilen, or “friend to one” in Danish, a 20-year-old organizationset up to bring 15-to-25-year-olds together twice a week with two or three volunteers. Together, the people in the group play games, make meals, go to the cinema, and build the human connections that many feel they lack.“I try to fight my depression by being less lonely, not with medicine,” Toadsays. Christian, who is 23,says he toosuffered in highschool. Though he had two friends with whom hespoke regularly, he rarelysaw them in person. He tried anti-anxiety medicine, but coming off it was hard. Then his aunt found Ventilen on Facebook and recommended he try it. “It’s helped me to open up,” hesays. “I don’t feel lonely thesame way.”Ventilen currently offers 21 venues in Denmark where young people looking for companionship can meet one another. There are 15 gathering places for people aged 15-25, andsix KOMsammen, or “Fit for Friendship” places, which focus on food and movement for those aged 15-30. The essentialservices its venues offer arestraightforward, and yet can beso elusive: a place to go, things to do, and people to do them with. While Ventilen has been around for decades, itssimple yet novel approach is getting more attention as governments everywhere wake up to the prevalence, and cost, of loneliness. A recent Kaiser Family Foundationstudyshowed that 22% of Americans, 23% of Brits and 9% of Japanese adultssaid they felt lonely all the time. When theBBC asked 55,000people about their experiences with loneliness,33% of respondentssaid they were “often” or “very often” lonely. Among those aged 16-24, the figure was ashocking 40%. Vivek Murthy, the former USsurgeon general, has declared loneliness an “epidemic,”noting that it was dangerous both in its own right and because of its links to deepsocietal problemssuch as addiction and violence: “It’s prevalent, it’s common, and thestudies Julianne [Holt-Lunstad] and others have done haveshown aro bust association with illnesses that we actually care about, including heart disease, dementia, depression and anxiety, and very importantly, longevity.”Indeed, Holt-Lunstad’s researchshows that being disconnected poses comparable danger tosmoking 15 cigarettes a day, and is more predictive of early death than the effects of air pollution or physical inactivity. According to Julie Vorsaa, volunteer coordinator for Ventilen, the idea for the organization can be traced back to 1999, when two volunteers (whose names no one remembers) were working for a help line. They noticed a lot of people weren’t as much in need of help as they were in need of friends. They were lonely, and the help line could only be a band-aid, not a cure. They formed asupport group called Bright Point, aimed at facilitating IRL conversation. But when people came together, no one talked. The ideaseemed destined to fail. Thensomeone had the idea of introducing games. “They had a catalyst, and theystarted to talk over the game,”shesays. Later, the group added the idea of making meals, and then exercising. “They found out food was a good thing to bring people together,”shesays. “You talk when you eat. It’s more cozy.”Since 2011, Ventilen, which gets funding from the government and private donors, has been measuring its results. Through 2017, nearly 700 people had participated in Ventilen (55.7% men, 44.3% women), with the average age being 20.9. According to itsself-reportedsurvey, 70% of participantssaid they felt less lonely after coming, while 74% reported higherself-worth after coming. Sixty-four percentsaid they were better atsocialsituations, and 80%said they were more likely to meet other people. About one in 10 young people in Denmark report that they are lonely. While this mayseemsurprising in a country that is frequently rate done of the happiest in the world, it mirrors data from around the worldshowing aspike in loneliness among the young as well as the old. Whilesome argue there is no new crisis of loneliness, Murthysays a few things are contributing to raised awareness of the problem. More people are talking about it, creating asnowball effect, while research isshowing its ill effects on health and well-being. “It’s not new—people have been lonely for hundreds of years,” hesays. “But I think the fact that it is an almost universal experience makes it easier for people to be open to thinking about it, even if they don’t want to talk about it.”The program is not without challenges. Many lonely people may be too intimidated to come to a venue;some who come won’t return. But designating aspace for gathering and having activities to bring people together is an effective way to tackle loneliness,says Claire O’Shea, a campaign manager for the UK’s Campaign to end Loneliness. “You can’t just bring a roomful people together, you have to find a common purpose,”shesays. “It takes the pressure off findingsomething tosay, and that’s talking about the moment, or the activity.” She citesMen’s Sheds, an organization that promotes communityspaces for men to “connect, converse and create.” They gather in areas—empty offices, portable cabin’s, warehouses, garages, and in one case, an out-of-use mortuary—to do things like woodworking, metalworking, and repairing and restoring things. They’re also there to be together. Because as anyone knows, you can be in a room filled with people or a city and be plenty lonely. When I first ask to go to a Ventilen in Copenhagen, Vorsaa tells me it will not be possible. Privacy is paramount, and the individuals themselves do not even register their names. (They give their gender, age, and whether they are employed and/or inschool.) “It is asafespace,”she explains. It can be very hard to realize you are lonely, and even harder to admit it because of thesocialstigma. More people will come if they do not have to give personal information. But when we meet in the Ventilen offices, a volunteer reports that a group is happy tospeak with me. We bike over to Nørrebro, one of Copenhagen’s most diverse neighborhoods, to a comfortable apartment with asmall kitchen and eating area, as well as asitting room with a coffee table. The group has alreadyshopped for lunch and cooked it together beforesitting down for games. Some are clearlyshy, but open up gradually to paint painful portraits of what it’s like to feel very alone. Tuned in to a hyper connected world viasocial media and gaming, they report wanting the friends and connections theysee but feeling thatsuch relationships are out of reach, for reasons varying from chronic pain to video game addiction,social anxiety, and a pervasivesense that theysimply do not have the muscles to formsocial bonds. Simone, 20,saysshe has been depressedsinceshe was 10. “I am used to it,”shesays. “That’s the worst part.” When her two best friends moved away,she explains while crying,she reverted to a life of only working andsleeping. She developed chronic pain becauseshe did not move enough. “I didn’t want to leave my home because I didn’t need to, and everyone was very busy.”A nurse at a pain clinic told her about Ventilen andshe decided to try it. It’s been positive for her,shesays, in part because being more active meansshe’s not in as much pain. Shestill takes anti-depressants, andstill hasseveresocial anxiety,shesays. “My heart is racing just talking to you.” Butshe enjoys coming. “It’s a reason not to go home and go to bed.”The group is not designed to address addiction orsevere mental illness, andscreens participants accordingly. “Wesee a lot of people with mental illness and it’s fine,”says Vorsaa. “But if the mental illness overshadows the group, if it’s too big, it’s not the place.”New participants come half an hour before their first groupsession to meet with a volunteer who makessure the person is a good fit for the group. They pay for their own meals,since being part of a group means paying your own way. Kasper, who wears glasses and isslight, hassuffered with depression and anxiety. Highschool was very isolating, hesays, and he took a break afterward. But he found he lacked theskills he needed to help himself. “In my life I had chosen to beso isolatedso I didn’t know how to communicate.”Hespent a lot of time online, which hesays made everything worse. “I think it gets worse with the internet,” hesays. “We always look at the perfect picture on the internet.” Being part of a group through Ventilen has helped. “I’ve madesome good friendships,” hesays thoughtfully. “It’s been good for me.”In addition to the groups, Ventilen is now working in 43schools to train high-school teachers about how to be moresupportive ofstudents. “Young people hate going toschool,”says Vorsaa. Many feel constantly left out, particularlysinceso much high-school work is done in groups. Students voice anxiety about being the last to be picked, or feeling that others are being forced to work with them. They feel “it’s a game of musical chairs and they will lose every time,”she explains. Having a place to go and people tosee outside ofschool offers a reminder that they needn’t always feel that way. “What I find profoundly empowering about addressing loneliness is that the ultimatesolution to loneliness lies in each of us,” Murthysays. “We can be the medicine that each other needs.”Giving young people a room of their own, andsomething to do in it, is a good way to get thatstarted.

Braindead brainsurgeon Ben Carson and the clown from the MyPillow commercials were teaming up to hawk a laughably phony coronavirus miracle cure, and they’d gotten Donald Trump on board with it. Butsure enough, the whole thing was very much a realstory. Ben Carson has a documented history of lending his name to uselesssupplements disguised as phony miracle cures, including hawking tree bark as asupposed cancer cure,so it wasn’tsurprising tosee him involved in this latestscheme. But the MyPillow guy wassomewhat of asurprise. After all, he’s always come off as a mere informer cia l do of us who likes Donald Trump way too much. But when MyPillow guy Mike Lindell appeared on CNN with Anderson Cooper today, it immediately became clear that Lindell wassomeone different than the happy and goofy guy he portrays in his TV ads. When Cooper explained that there were no clinical trials for Lindell’ssupposed coronavirus drug, Lindell turned angry and aggressive, as if the mask had finally been pulled back. By the time Anderson Cooper pointed out that there was no real difference between Mike Lindell and a “snake oilsalesmen,” Lindell just about lost it. Weshould have known that there wassomething moresinister to the MyPillow guy than just being a goofy pitchman who was naive enough to fall for Donald Trump’s lies. Lindell exposed himself today in an ugly way. We’llsee if he now pulls back on this coronavirusscam, before itsnowballs and destroys his pillow business as well.

The vote, which boosted the recommended Pentagon budget from $715 billion to over $740 billion, aligned Republican defense hawks with Democrats from across the politicalspectrum in a bipartisan rebuke of the White House’s proposal.

77,RNC leaders stand by Trump is effort to remake party: 'Nobody is turning on Trump here',9.67,34.67,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jan/6/republican-officials-stand-trump-effort-remake-par/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-06,23,"Republican Party officials from across the country are not blaming President Trump for the party’s defeats in Georgia’s runoffs but instead are rallying to make electionsecurity its top priority in the next cycle. At the Republican National Committee Winter Meeting in Amelia Island, Florida, party officials remainedsteadfast Wednesday insupport of Mr. Trump and his remake of the party, despite the electionsetbacks that gave Democrats a Senate majority and complete control of the levers of power in Washington.“Nobody’s turning on Trump here,”said Peter Feaman, a national committee member from Florida who is attending the meeting. “I’m talking to members of the RNC from all over the country — from Hawaii to Vermont to Florida to California, from one corner of the country to the other — and there is no anti-Trumpsentiment whatsoever here.”Republican Party officials embraced Mr. Trump’s claims that ballot fraud and election irregularities marred the November 3 vote. They are organizing a nationwide effort to prevent a repeat.“Election integrity is going to be the Number 1 priority for the RNC in 2021 and 2022,” Mr. Feamansaid. “I hear no recriminations against President Trump concerning Georgia, none whatsoever. It’s all about makingsure the process is fair and honest.”In Washington, pundits and Mr. Trump’s Republican critics were quick to blame the president for the Democrats’ wins in the two runoff races Tuesday in Georgia. Throughout the two-month runoff contests, Mr. Trump aggressively pushed claims that ballot tampering cost him the November 3 presidential election in Georgia. He battled thestate’s Republican governor and pressured thesecretary ofstate, also a Republican, to help him “find” the votes needed to overturn the win by President-elect Joseph R Biden. Distrust of the electionsystem likely helpedsuppress Republican voter turnout Tuesday, especially in rural counties that are crucial for Republican wins in thestate.“It turns out that telling the voters that the election was rigged is not a great way to turn out your voters,”said Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, one of Mr. Trump’s most vocal Republican detractors. In Georgia, Republican Party officials were less prone to condemn Mr. Trump’s actions.“We can’t place the blamesquarely on him, but I think the president was definitely a factor,”said Jason Shepherd, Republican Party chairman in Cobb County, asuburban county of Atlanta. Mr. Shepherdsaid he counts himself as a Trump Republican. The president’s crusade against what he deemed “stolen elections” in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada and Wisconsin also fueled protestersstorming the Capitol on Wednesday and delaying Congress from officially accepting election results for Mr. Biden’s win. Ford O’Connell, a Republican Partystrategist with close ties to the White House,said the mayhem at the Capitolshouldn’t take away from legitimate concerns about election integrity.“Those issues aren’t going to go away,” hesaid. “The Democrats do not want to have this discussion.”Mr. Trump and his allies failed inscores of lawsuits challenging the election results in battlegroundstates. Still, courts never fully heard many of the claims of wrongdoing or irregularities, including that ballots were filled out or backdated by poll workers, ballots were driven acrossstate lines, voting deadlines were changed without legislative approval, and accusations that noncitizens, minors and dead people voted. Mr. Feamansaid the Republican Party would be hammering the voter integrity issue and pushing election overhauls instate capitals across the country.“We’re going to go to everystate legislature in the country to makesure that every legal vote counts and also makesure that the laws are followed, that people who are not qualified to vote are not allowed to vote. This goes to a lot of what happened in 2020,” hesaid. “The whole process needs to be reexamined to makesure we have fair elections. And it’s not just Georgia. It’s everywhere.”The RNC meeting in Amelia Island, about 40 miles northeast of Jacksonville, was convened understrict COVID-19 precautions. The 168 committee members who attended, as well as guests andstaff, all were tested for COVID-19. Masks were required to be worn at all indoor events, according to RNC officials.

78,San Francisco Buyback An Absolute Joke,14.67,26.0,https://bearingarms.com/tom-k/2020/12/14/san-francisco-buyback-joke/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bearing-arms-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-14,18,"The City of San Francisco is one of the most notoriously anti-gun communities in one of the most anti-gunstates in the nation. It’s not a place you’re going to be comfortable in if you’re a gun person. Nor will you enjoy it if you dislike human fecal matter on thesidewalks, but hey, what can you do?San Francisco, likeso many other anti-gun cities, recently had a gun buyback. More than 225 guns were returned Saturday during an annual gun buyback program in San Francisco. The event was organized by the San Francisco Mayor’s Office ofViolence Prevention Services, the San Francisco Police Department and the United Playaz, a San Francisco-based violence prevention and youth development organization. United Playaz founder Rudy Corpuzsaid people turned in 228 guns, including 8 assault rifles during the four-hour event Saturday. Those who brought in handguns got $100 and those who turned in “assault weapons” got $100. I’msure people feelso muchsafer now. San Francisco has a population of over 883,000 people, and they only got 228 firearms? Seriously? This issupposed to count assome kind of a big win?Well, it’s not. See, those guns–including the eight “assault weapons” turned in–came from lawful gun owners whosimply didn’t want their firearms anymore and didn’t know how tosell them otherwise. That’s about it. After all, if people knew they could take them to a gunstore and have themsold on consignment and thus make a lot more, Isuspect people would be all over it. They didn’t, though, and thanks to California’s laws, they couldn’tsell them directly to individuals who they knew to be responsible gun owners, they may not have known there were any other choices. But the number of guns is patheticallysmall when you think of thesize of the city of San Francisco. How many people will actually delude themselves to believe that the buyback made their communitysafer? How many actually think that those guns made any bit of a difference?Far too many. Look, I don’t begrudge people getting rid of guns they don’t want. What I begrudge are communities doing this kind of thing in order to look like they’re makingsome kind of an effort to combat violent crime without having to actually address violent crime. That’s all this is. It’s theater, a dramatic presentation to make people feel better about their city and the elected officials who need them for reelection. At no point will this benefit anyone else,so let’s not pretend it’ssome unmitigated good. They didn’t take guns off thestreet, they took them from people who represented absolutely no threat whatsoever. The criminals, however, aren’t going to give their guns up nearlyso easily, especially forsuch paltrysums. No, they’ll keep their guns and make as much money from asingle holdup as they would turning their guns in. Please, as asociety, can westop kidding ourselves about what we’re doing with these buybacks? You know, just toshake things up.",0,0,Bearing Arms

Metro Council is approval Tuesday night means Oracle can now begin its work on a more detailed design of its 65-acre riverbank campus,according to companyspokesperson Jim Murphy. Construction could begin as early as June. The development, hailed bysomesupporters as ""transformational"" and ""once in a lifetime,"" marks the biggest economic development deal ever made in Tennessee. The proposed investment will transform the cityscape along the East Bank of the Cumberland River into the city is largest business hub.""This is the largest private investment and the largest job creation deal in our history – all with no expense in our budget and no new debt,"" Mayor John Coopersaid in astatement moments after the council vote. The deal could bring a record number of jobs to Nashville. The company hopes to create 8,500 new jobs in Nashville by the end of 2031, with an average annual wage of $110,000. The project is also expected to bring almost 11,500 ancillary jobs and 10,000 temporary positions during construction. By approving the deal, Metro government also hassignaled its intent to use half of the annual property tax revenue generated from thesite to pay for affordable housing, in addition to any funding already allocated for that purpose in the budget. The actual dedication of the funds, however, willstill be at the council is discretion. Thelanguage, proposed by At-Large Council member Zulfat Suara, was added to the development plan during a Monday budget and finance committee meeting and was approved by the council Tuesday. As part of the deal, Oracle will receive a 25-year, 50% property tax discount in exchange for its up-front $175 million investment in public infrastructure near Germantown. That includesstreets, parks, greenways, a pedestrian bridge from the Oracle campus to Germantown and an expandedsewersystem. While the deal received an overwhelmingsupport from the council Tuesday night, many council members and local activists have voiced concerns about Oracle is proposed job creation, commitment to diversity, as well as its actions to address affordable housing with a booming workforce. Community advocacy group Stand Up Nashvilleposed 20 questions about the Oracle deal and received responses Monday. The group challenged the way Metro government does business with the tech company and demanded actions from Oracle to address the affordable housing crisis and hire minority workers.""Overwhelmingly, we hear from our communities that housing and economic inequality are the priority,"" Stand Up Nashville co-founder Odessa Kellysaid in a Tuesdaystatement. ""What the answers to our questions tell us is that while it is good that Oracle wants to be in Nashville, and this deal is better than deals of the past, it was not a community driven process and we canstill improve the way our city operates.""Both local andstate leaders have welcomed the development.""Oracle’s $1.2 billion investment will create thousands of quality jobs and help our kidssucceed in the digital economy,"" Coopersaid Tuesday. ""After a challenging year, this helps kick off Nashville’s next decade of prosperity.""Council member Mary Carolyn Robertssaid Tuesday the deal could attract other tech giants to land in Nashville as well.""We are in a position to have a deal changer in Nashville,""shesaid.

Before you click on it, it is gone,"" Suarasaid Monday. ""You havestudents that cannot afford to pay for housing in the neighborhood that they grew up in. You have people being gent rifi ed out of their homes.""In response to Stand Up Nashville is questions on affordable housing, the company pointed to Suara is amendment and Cooper is proposed budget, which would allocate $30 million in local and federal funds to affordable housing initiatives. Doug Kehring, executive vice president of corporate operations for Oracle,said Monday the company does not intend to exacerbate Nashville is affordable housing problem.""How wesupport housing may come through ownership, may come through donations, may come through othersupport mechanisms, but we are very focused on makingsure there is enough (affordable) housing for employees,"" hesaid. ""We do not want to come to Nashville to create a bigger problem. We want to come to Nashville to create a greatsolution.""It is also unclear how many of the proposed 8,500 jobs are high-paying positionsand what the lowest hourly wage would be for most employees. Council member Emily Benedict posed the question Monday, but received no direct answer from Oracle representatives.""I have not been able to find out in the past two weeks, the multiple times that I have asked, what is the lowest wage that you pay your full-time and part-time employees?""she asked. Jennifer Birk of Oraclesaid Monday the company would like to make local hires ""as much as we can."" But under Tennessee law, Metro government has no power to establish local hire mandates or require the level of workforce diversity, the companysaid in its Monday response to Stand Up NashvilleMultiple council members also demanded concrete actions from Oracle advocating for the LGBTQ communities. The company is considering moving to Tennessee as thestate legislature passesseveral bills targeting LGBTQ youths. Governor Bill Lee, a conservative Republican,became the third governor this year tosign into l awa measure barring transgenderstudents from playingsports under their gender identity. Oracle last month joined 94 businesses insigning a letter by the Human Rights Campaignopposing anti-LGBTQ legislation across the country. But the company has not threatened to pull out of thestate because of the legislation. At-Large Council member Bob Mendes asked Oracle on Monday what concrete actions the company would take apart fromsigning the letter. He previously defended the letter-signing onsocial media as an important move""even if a fight can not be won today.""""We get real criticism from well-meaning people that we are just engaging in nonsense theater and it does not actually mean anything,"" he told Oracle representatives. ""How do you match (what yousaid)? Are we just being hypocrites?""Kehring responded by arguing the company has a track record of diverse culture and values.""You have the opportunity to attract companies that can help your effort, or you can push those companies away in your attempt to deal with the concern you just raised,"" hesaid. ""We are gonna bring our culture and values.""Council member Jonathan Hall urged the council Tuesday to invest in education and workforce training tosupply quality candidates to the job market Oracle would create. Council member Colby Sledge cautioned his colleagues Tuesday night to continue to address the community concerns around the Oracle deal.""We will have invited the horse in,"" hesaid.

The anonymous juror also asked for permission tospeak publicly about the proceedings. In the motion, the grand jurorstates that Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron ""attempted to make it very clear that the grand jury alone made the decision on who and what to charge basedsolely on the evidence presented to them,"" though the jurors were not offered the option to charge the other two officers. The motionstates, ""Using the grand jurors as ashield to deflect accountability and responsibility for these decisions onlysows moreseeds of doubt in the process while leaving a cold chill own thespine of future grand jurors.""Previously,Cameron hadsaid in a news conference that the grand jury agreed with his team is investigation,saying, ""While there aresix possible homicide charges under Kentucky law, these charges are not applicable to the facts before us because our investigationshowed, and the grand jury agreed, that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in the return of deadly fire after having been fired upon.""After Hankinson pleaded not guilty this Monday, the judge at his hearing also ordered that the grand jury recording be entered into the court record. (Taylor is family had also previously asked for the grand jury details to be released.) Shortly after the motion was filed, Cameronannouncedhe would release the recordings on Wednesday and that the juror was free toshare ""their thoughts on our presentation.""TheNew YorkTimesreportsthat Elizabeth Kuhn, aspokeswoman for the attorney general,said in astatement, ""Our prosecutors presented all of the evidence, even though the evidencesupported that Sergeant Mattingly and Detective Cosgrove were justified in their use of force after having been fired upon by Kenneth Walker. For that reason, the only charge recommended was wanton endangerment.""Taylor’s family filed a lawsuit accusing the officers of wrongful death, excessive force, and gross negligence, according toWashington Post. It was reported on September 15 byLouisville Courier-Journalreports that the city of Louisville will pay a $12 millionsettlement to the Taylor family. ""I am deeply, deeplysorry for Breonna is death,"" Louisville Mayor Greg Fischersaid in a press conference,surrounded by the Taylor family and their lawyers, per the outlet. Thesettlement also has multiple police reform mandates, including a demand that allsearch warrants be approved with a judge prior to their use by officers. Other measures include the establishment of a housing credit program to motivate officers to live in the areas theyserve over and the utilization ofsocial workers onspecific police runs. ""The city is response in this case has been delayed and it is been frustrating, but the fact that they have been willing tosit down and talksignificant reform was astep in the right direction and hopefully a turning point,"" attorney Sam Aguilartold CNN Taylor is mother, Tamika Palmer,said thesettlement is only onestep in the continued pursuit of justice for Breonna.""Her beautifulspirit and personality is working through all of us on the ground,so please continue tosay her name: Breonna Taylor,"" Palmersaid of her daughter, viaCNN In early June, the Louisville Metro Council is Public Safety Committeeapproveda new ordinance called ""Breonna is Law"" that would make itso ""no-knock"" warrants could only besought if there is ""imminent threat of harm or death"" and would also be limited to ""offenses including murder, hostage-taking, kidnapping, terrorism, human trafficking andsexual trafficking,"" per the. On June 11th, all 26 members of the Louisville Metro Councilvotedto pass the ban, which prohibits anysearch warrant that does not require police to verbally announce themselves and their purpose at the property. ""Breonna is Law"" alsostates that any Louisville Metro Police Department or Metro law enforcement must knock and wait a minimum of 15seconds for a response, according toNBC News.

You can read the report here, although there is not much tosee—and what is there runs contrary to what we know about the night Taylor was killed by police. The report details the location (with partially redacted address), age (with redacted birth date), and full name of the victim.

Mattingly, 47; Cosgrove, 42; and Hankison, 44 (ages reported via theCourier-Journal) are listed as the three officers whof atallyshot Taylor. Hankison is also undergoing asexual assault investigation after allegations by at least two women. Beyond that, rows of information are left blank and there are two major inaccuracies regarding the night Taylor was killed. The department is report lists her injuries as ""none,"" even thoughshe wasshot at least eight times by the officers. The ""no"" box is checked under ""forced entry,"" even though police are believed to have used a battering ram to break through Taylor is door. According to the, the Louisville police department blamed discrepancies on the reporting program. Astatement from the departmentsaid, ""Inaccuracies in the report are unacceptable to us, and we are taking immediatesteps to correct the report and to ensure the accuracy of incident reports going forward.""After the grand jury decision, Taylor’ssister Ju’Niyah Palmerposted an Instagramof her and Breonna with the caption: ""sister i amsosorry 🥺"" She also wrote on her Instagram Story: ""sister, you was failed by asystem you worked hard for and i amsosorry""In a May 2020 interview with the, Taylor’s mother Tamika Palmersaidshe first found outsomething was wrong whenshe got a call from Walker, whosaid he thoughtsomeone was trying to break into the apartment.

Young told Refinery29, ""Very often when we have these moments where thesestories [of police violence] bubble up, it is usually becauseseveral cases happen in ashort proximity of time, and when women are involved their names get erased. . .

Economistssurveyed by Dow Jones had been expecting a payrolls gain of 800,000 and the unemployment rate to fall to 8.2% from 8.4% in August. The payrolls miss was due largely to a drop in government hiring as at-homeschooling continued and Census jobs fell.""The issue is momentum, and I think we are losing it,""said Drew Matus, chief marketstrategist for MetLife Investment Management. ""When you go through asignificant disruption to the labor market, it takes time to fix itself. That is without regard to whether there is a virus.""The decline in the unemployment rate came along with a 0.3 percentage point drop in the labor force participation rate to 61.4%, representing a decline of nearly 700,000. However, aseparate, more encompassing measure that counts discouraged workers and those working part-time for economic reasons alsosaw a notable decline, falling from 14.2% to 12.8%. The unemployment decline for Blacks was evensharper than the headline rate, falling from 13% to 12.1%. The Asian rate declined from 10.7% to 8.9%. Leisure and hospitality led job gains with 318,000 while retail added 142,000 and health care andsocial assistance increased by 108,000. As expected, government was the biggest drag on the month, losing 216,000 due to a drop in local andstate government education as manyschools maintained at-home instruction due to the virus. A reduction in Census workers also pulled 34,000 from the total. In othersectors, health care andsocial assistance gained 108,000, professional and businessservices contributed 89,000 and the transportation and warehousingsector was up 74,000. Manufacturing grew by 66,000, financial activities added 37,000 and the otherservices category rose by 36,000. Markets reacted little to the report, withstocksstill heading for a lower open following news that President Donald Trumpsaid he and first lady Melania Trump tested positive for Covid-19. Despite the deceleration in job creation, there weresome positivesigns as the economy continues its pandemic-era recovery. Those reporting being on temporary layoff fell by 1.5 million to 4.6 million. Workers holding part-time jobs for economic reasons fell by 1.3 million to 6.3 million, and the totals for longer-term layoffs also decreased considerably. The temporary layoff total peaked at 18.1 million as payrolls fell by 22 million in March and April. However, permanent job losses increased by 345,000 to 3.8 million, in total a 2.5 million increasesince February, the month before the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus pandemic.""Permanent jobs losses rose by more than 300,000. That is not a good thing. The labor force participation rate declined, which pulled the overall unemployment rate down. That is not a goodsign, either,""said Kathy Jones, head of fixed income at Charles Schwab. ""We are looking atstate and local government layoffs, we are looking at a higher level of permanent job losses and more people leaving the workforce. None of that is good for the long run.""The report comes amid a raft of mostly positive economicsignals, includingstrongsigns from the housing market and retailspending, as well as worries that rising coronavirus cases could threaten the recovery. While millions more remain unemployed, September is activity means that about 12 million jobs have been recoveredsince the mid-March economicshutdown thatsaw about 22 million layoffs.

The reason? Struggles linked to our globalsupply chain. Last week, President Joe Biden revealed plans to help tackle bottlenecks within oursupply chain, including plans to turn ports into 24/7 operations. Meanwhile,shipping companies FedEx and UPS as well as retailing giant Walmart will expand their efforts to ease thestrains on thesupply chain.“This is the first keystep for moving on entire freight transportation and logisticalsupply chain nationwide to a 24/7system,”said Biden. So, what is thesupply chain, and whyshould you care about these issues? Let is explain:Thesupply chain is how we get nearly all of thestuff in our lives that we want and need. It is asystem that helps make and deliver our favorite products. It involves the manufacturers of these products, the companies thatsupply materials to create them, the cargoships, trains and trucks that deliver them, and thestoresselling them.“You can think of this as a pipe that connectssupply and demand,""said Tinglong Dai, a professor of operations management and business analytics at Johns Hopkins University. It is also complicated. Take the iPhone, for example. To build one, Apple hassupply chains with companies providing materials for itssmart phonesuch as Corning, which makes precision glass for use on the iPhone. Then you have thesupply chains Apple uses to distribute iPhones to you.""It’s a complex network of various different entities that are working together in order to enable us as consumers to receive our products in the time that we expect,""said Marko Bastl, the director of the Center for Supply Chain Management at Marquette University. These products may be hard to find due tosupply chain issuesWhy are they higher?3 tips tosave on your groceriesThe issues affectingsupply chains are linked to the COVID-19 pandemic. Bastlsaid the pandemic is unique because it has impacted bothsupply and demand. Some manufacturersstill are not operating at the levels they reached before the pandemic. The pandemic also affected companies focused on logistics,such as warehousing tostore items that travel overseas and transportation like trucks and trains to deliver them across the country,said Bastl. At thesame time, due to millions of usstaying at home to help prevent thespread of the coronavirus, we ordered a lot ofstuff, from personal computers tosports equipment.""It’s almost like a perfectstorm of loss of manufacturing capacity as well as loss of logistics capacity, married then with the increase in demand,""said Bastl. One of the enduring images of this crisis has beenseveral containershipssitting idle at ports waiting to unload their goods. Biden hasstruck a deal with the Port of Los Angeles to turn it into a 24/7 operation to moveships through more quickly. Daisaid the process of unloading theseships requires a lot of work and people, including warehouse workers and drivers to ultimately deliver these products to retailers.“We have increased the number of goods coming here to the US, but we do not have more truck drivers, we do not have more warehousespace,""said Dai. ""So then that’s where those cargoships arestuck.""Bastlsaid it depends on the industry because of the differentsupply chains they use, but he notes consumer electronics,such as personal computers and video game consoles, as well as toys, have been affected most bysupply chain issues. Daisaid ""low-end inexpensive products"" across industries will be impacted as well, forcing us to buy a more expensive item to compensate. All of these issues have a direct impact on what we can buy – on what is available to buy. That is the reason consumers have been advised tostart their holidayshopping early. Dai projects we willsee higher prices and fewer available products. And we maysee more emptyshelves atstores due toshortages and delays, Bastlsaid.""The longer that these delays will last, the more likely it is companies involved in production, distribution and movement of our products will not be able or willing to absorb this cost, and they’llstart pushing them on to consumers,"" Bastlsaid.",2,2,USA Today
86,"Americans Are Worried About Crime, But That Doesn’t Mean They’re Blaming Democrats",-6.67,41.33,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americans-are-worried-about-crime-but-that-doesnt-mean-theyre-blaming-democrats/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-25,25,"Welcome toPollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup. Rising murder, aggravated assault and auto theft rateshave increased concern about crime among the American public. According to polling fromYouGov/The Economist, theshare of Americans whosay crime is the most important issue facing America has increasedsince President Biden took office — to a greater degree than any issue except nationalsecurity. Relatedly, a May 22-25Fox News poll found that 73 percent of registered voters thought there was more crime nationwide than there was a year earlier. Only 17 percent thought there was less crime, and 7 percent thought the level of crime hadstayed about thesame. Fewer, butstill a majority, believed crime was up in their local area, too: 54 percent, compared with 28 percent who thought there was less crime in their area and 15 percent who thought it was about thesame. (It’s worth noting, though, that Americans perpetually believe that crime is on the rise,even when it is not.)AGallup poll earlier this year also found that only 27 percent of Americans weresatisfied with the nation’s policies to reduce or control crime, and that 65 percent were dissatisfied. That’s a big change from 2020, when 47 percent weresatisfied and 49 percent were dissatisfied. Altogether, this hassparked a narrative that the rise in violent crime poses a political problem for Democrats, who are the ruling party and also traditionally perceived assofter on crime. But at this point, it’s not really clear that the crime issue will hurt Democrats and anti-police progressives politically. Forstarters, Americans are actually pretty divided on what the bestsolution tostopping crime is. In aYouGov/Yahoo News poll from May 24-26, 32 percent of adultssaid that law enforcement is not tough enough on most offenders — but about thesame amount, 27 percent,said law enforcement ist ough on most offenders. (Eighteen percent thought law enforcement’s level of toughness was about right, while 22 percent weren’tsure.)The public is also prettysharply divided on whether Democrats or Republicans are better on the issue of crime. When asked whether Biden or former President Donald Trump has done a better job handling crime, 34 percent of respondents to the YouGov/Yahoo pollsaid Trump, while 32 percentsaid Biden. (Fifteen percent thought the two were about equally good on crime.) Of course, this just mirrors people’s existing partisan preferences — a majority of Republicans preferred Trump’s handling, while a majority of Democrats preferred Biden’s — but that just bolsters the theory that crime isn’t an issue that’s changing anybody’s mind. Similarly, in electionsso far in 2021, it also doesn’t look like crime is driving voters toward more conservative candidates. True, this week’s Democratic primary for mayor of New York Cityfocused heavily on crime, and the winner was most likelyBrooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, arguably the race’s most pro-police candidate. But there are plenty of counterexamples: In the Democratic primary for Philadelphia district attorney, incumbent Larry Krasner — theGeorge Washington of the progressive criminal-justice movement— handily defeated a moderate who attempted to tie Krasner’s policies to Philadelphia’s rising crime rate. And in this month’sspecial election forNew Mexico’s 1st Congressional District, the Republican candidate ran what was virtually asingle-issue campaign on crime and policing issues; Democrat Melanie Stansbury ended up winning by 25 percentage points, exceeding the district’s D+18partisan lean.1It’s possible crime emerges as a wedge issue in the 2022 midterms. Butso far, there’s little evidence that it is helping one party over the other. According to FiveThirtyEight’spresidential approval tracker,252.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 42.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of +10.5 points). At this time last week, 51.9 percent approved and 42.0 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of +9.9 points). One month ago, Biden had an approval rating of 54.3 percent and a disapproval rating of 40.3 percent, for a net approval rating of +14.0 points.",1,1,FiveThirtyEight

According to the report, there have been nearly 3,800 documented cases of anti-Asian hate incidents nationwide over the last year, and a majority of the victims were women. This is only a fraction of the number of hate incidents that actually occur annually, with cases of xenophobia and bigotry mountingsince thestart of the COVID-19 pandemic, yet the numbers remain a formidable reflection of recent hate crimes. All but one of the eight victims of Tuesday is massage-parlorshootings were women, andsix were Asian, which is a chillingstatistic that has onlyserved to ""exacerbate the fear and pain that the Asian American community continues to endure,"" according toStop AAPI Hate. ""The reportedshootings of multiple Asian American women today in Atlanta is an unspeakable tragedy — for the families of the victims first and foremost, but also for the Asian American community, which has been reeling from high levels of racist attacks over the course of the past year,"" the groupsaid in astatement on March 17. ""Not enough has been done to protect Asian Americans from heightened levels of hate, discrimination and violence. Concrete action must be taken now. Anything else is unacceptable.""A closer look at the report reveals that verbal harassment andshunning make up the two largest portions of total incidents reported, collectively totaling at just over 80 percent. Physical assault comprises 11.1 percent of reported incidents, while civil-rights violations — including workplace discrimination, refusal ofservice, andso on — make up 8.5 percent, and online harassment follows closely behind at 6.8 percent. More than one-third (35.4 percent) of these instances of discrimination and harassment happen while a member of the Asian community is at a business,such as astore,salon, or workplace, while one-quarter of incidents take place in publicstreets or on thesidewalk. Across all 50states, women are 2.3 times more likely than men to report these crimes. Chinese individuals are the largest ethnic group affected, constituting more than 42 percent of reported incidents. Together, people of Korean, Vietnamese, and Filipino descent make up an additional 31 percent of reported experiences of hate. Just days before the March 16 attacks, Georgiastate SenatorMichelle Au gave a chilling account detailing the reality of hateful encounters APIA individuals have faced on a daily basis during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""Georgiashould not consider itself immune from this epidemic,"" Dr. Ausaid. ""And to be clear, the epidemic I am referring to is not COVID-19, but racism towards Asian Americans. . . . The thing is, racism against AAPI Americans is not new. Otherization or exoticization of AAPI Americans is not new. Violence against AAPI Americans is not new.""Whilespeaking with Stop AAPI Hate for the purposes of thestatistical report, astudent from College Park, MD,said, ""One of my professors was talking about the public health response to COVID-19 and explicitly called it the 'China Virus' and that 'we have gotta be very careful about that country and what they'd do to us.'"" Another added, ""Two white, middle-aged men, who have been my neighbors for over fifteen years, approached me threateningly on thestreet, pulled down the corners of their eyes andsaid, 'Go back to Wuhan, b*tch and take the virus with you!' When I called them vile, they then called me a 'Thai wh*re' and threatened to beat up my husband.""Six days after taking office,President Joe Biden released a memorandum aimed at combatting racism, xenophobia, and intolerance against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders in the US The memo reads: ""The Federal Government must recognize that it has played a role in furthering these xenophobicsentiments through the actions of political leaders, including references to the COVID-19 pandemic by the geographic location of its origin. Suchstatements havestoked unfounded fears and perpetuatedstigma about Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders and have contributed to increasing rates of bullying, harassment, and hate crimes against AAPI persons. These actions defied the best practices and guidelines of public health officials and have causedsignificant harm to AAPI families and communities that must be addressed.""In the wake ofsuch prevalent violence toward the APIA community, mandates can only doso much. It is the responsibility of community members tospeak up in the face of blatant hatred and take action by donating,supporting local businesses, and being actively mindful of anti-Asian rhetoric.

Her cat, a tuxedo named Rocco, had justshattered a mirror in her home before our call. Superstition aside,success has a way of following Auli’i, her career marked by arecord-breaking de butin the Disney film. Since the 2016 film, Auli’i continued her foray into the world of acting with astarring role on NBC’sshowRise,Disney’sThe Little Mermaid Live!,and guest appearances and voice overs for projects likeDay by Day,Elena of Avalor, andRalph Breaks the Internet. Up next: The titular role in Netflix’sa teen drama based on the novelSorta Like a Rock Starby Matthew Quick that’sset to release Friday, August 28.“I knew my life was going to change,” Auli’isays candidly about playing Moana on our call. At the time, Auli’i was lauded as not only the first Polynesian princess, but the first teenager to play a Disney Princessin thestudio’s history. She was fourteen years old. “I did not know how drastically, but I did know that my life was going to change after. I also remember being reallyscared, and Istill feel afraid of really just how much more publicity my life gets now.”In her first live-action film, Auli’i portrays Amber Appleton, a hardworking teenager that’s hiding a hugesecret from her friends: She’s homeless and trying to help hersingle motherstay afloat monetarily and emotionally. Despite her constantstruggles at home, Amber is able to maintain an aura of positivity, encouraging those around her andstriving to reach her dreams. “Oh my God, I am Amber,” Auli’i tells. “I remember reading thescript and realizing Amber and I have a lot ofsimilarities. I think of myself assomeone who is very optimistic, almost to a fault, in that I am not as honest with myself or even with those closest to me when I need a break, or when I need help.”Strength in the face of adversity is admirable, Auli’i notes, but portraying a character that is forced to realizeshe’s not asstrong asshe could be without letting her friends help her was an important aspect that drew her to the project — andsomething thatshe’s learned to do over the years as her career hasskyrocketed.“We all have our chosen family and what really makes them chosen family is relying on them and being as real as possible with yourstruggles as well as yoursuccess in life,” the 19-year-oldsays. “We all needsomeone to reach out and check on us every once in a while. You can be that person and you can also be checked on. Allow yourself to be cared for.”Asking for help can be thescarieststep, Auli’isays. Shespeaks from experience, remembering how nervousshe was whenshe told her momshe wanted tosee a mental health professional for the first time. “That wasso difficult for me, and as teenagers, we’re going through it,”shesays. “And Amber especially,someone who is dealing with homelessness as well as wanting to fight for her dreams to go to renownedschool like Carnegie Mellon. So it is really important to remember that teenagers and teenstories can have these really deepstorylines, and can tackle all of these issues, and can touch upon them because they are real.”And Auli’i’s right. Nearly4.2 million youths and young adults deal with homelessness each year. Unlike other teenage films,isn’t afraid to touch upon heavy topics like homelessness, grief, alcoholism, and mental health. It’s a film grounded in realism that helps make the film all the more gut-wrenching to watch. But, among the powerfully realstorylines are pockets of purity and positivity that remind viewers of the hopefulness in life. Even the originalsong “Feels Like Home” by Keegan DeWitt acts as a “beacon of hope,” according to Auli’i. Althoughshe auditioned and didn’t get a role in, director Brett Haley reached out to her for this project. In addition to getting the lead role, Auli’i was involved in the casting process. Assomeone with a “mixed plate” background (Auli’i is Puerto Rican, Portuguese, Hawaiian, Chinese, and “a little bit of Irish in like, my big toe”) having a diverse cast was incredibly important to her. All Together Nowproves inclusivity is easy — not only in makingsure people from varying ethnic backgrounds were represented but in casting and including ne uro diverse people. Each person in the cast has their ownstoryline, their own unique moments that bring them to life in a way thatsubverts the belief that inclusion is merely havingsomeone appear on-screen asingular time.“We have people who are non-neurotypical as well as differently-abled on our cast, and our friendship and our chemistry just worked as friends,”shesays of the casting. “In no ways are those disabilities holding them back as actors, at all. And they are certainly not holding them back in the genuine relationships that I know I have with them, as well.”A part of her inclusion in the casting meant Auli’i was also hunting for her on-screen love interest Ty, who is played by Marvel’sstar Rhenzy Feliz. In the film, Amber and Ty have a not-so-typical teenage romance — at least one that isn’t often represented in Hollywood very frequently. Their romance issubtle, blossoming out of a friendship, and genuine love for each other. “That is the great thing about having good friends, everyone,” Auli’isays jokingly. “Friends can become love interests, but they can not always go the other way around.”Friendships, of course, is at the heart of the film. Amber is a great friend to everyone in her life but refuses to accept the love and friendship in return. For people in asimilarsituation to Amber, Auli’isays it’s important to be kind and gentle with yourself and not be afraid to reach out and rely on others to help you. “Do not try to build up these really hard walls that you, yourself, will have to break down eventually. Which is easiersaid than done, forsure. I can attest to that. But the reward of feeling free again, in your own body and in your own mind, it is everything.”Auli’i left highschool to go into onlineschooling during her junior year, butstill fondly remembers participating in drama class akin to Amber in the film. Also, like her character, Auli’i grew up in asingle-parent household. The actor and her mother are very close (“my mom isstill very, very much incorporated into my own team —she is CCd on every email that comes through”) and that dynamic issomethingshe wanted to portray with her on-screen mother played by’s Justina Machado.“There issomething really, reallyspecial about just growing up with a mom. It is just you two against the world, at least that is how it felt like to me,”shesays. “When I met Justina, that is exactly whatshe brought to the character. Of almost overwhelming love and just wanting the best for your child. But also being in the circumstance that you are, of financial difficulty, and not being able to give everything that you would want. It is heartbreaking. And I love Justina for her portrayal of that.”Having these open and honest conversations about her character is authentic actions is perhaps one of the reasons Auli’i character inf eelsso earnest and real. It’s this connection to her character that allows Auli’i to givesuch a moving performance — even if it was her first live-action role. It’s this genuineness that Auli’i brings to not only her roles but her relationships to her fans, many of whomshe’s hadsince voicing Moana four years ago.“I really loved being a voice actor, and giving life to Moana,” Auli’i admits. “I did not have to worry about my face, and I just naturally kind of have a knack forshowing emotion in my voice, which I am grateful for. But [live action] acting just throws you to the wolves, man. And you have to portray that emotion and get real with it. When you cry and your nose runs, you just gotta let it run.”Althoughshe has ashamedly not watched Beyoncé’s new visual album or heard the magic that is Taylor Swift’sat the time of our interview, Auli’isays her timespent in quarantine hasn’t gone to waste. In between binge-watchingseasons ofRick & Morty,takingsocially distanced walks to the park, and making her mom’s belovedspaghetti recipe multiple times a week, Auli’isaysshe’s had time to pick up her guitar and ukulele again.

89,The College Admissions Scandal Is Even Worse Than You Think,-13.25,36.75,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/03/13/the-college-admissions-scandal-is-even-worse-than-you-think/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-13,25,"What kind of a world do we live in where very wealthy people—who will already pass enormous economic andsocial capital off to their children (and at a very low tax rate!)—are driven to lie and cheat to get their children into elite colleges?Paying half a million dollars–or in one case, $1.2 million—and breaking numerous laws is an act of desperation. But evidently, these were risks worth taking. Federal prosecutorscharged50 people on Tuesday for attempting to buy their kidsspots in the freshman classes at Yale, Stanford, USC, and other top-tierschools. Several of the indicted are Hollywood celebrities, including Felicity Huffman, Lori Loughlin and her husband, Mossimo Gianulli. Others are wealthy businesspeople. Their kids have every advantage in the world. Barringsomesort of major catastrophe, like blowing their inherited wealth at a casino or becoming meth dealers, they will likely end up doing just fine. Yet their parents apparently thought their children’s only path tosuccess andsustainable wealth was through the doors of these particular universities. The mainstory at the moment is the use of wealth to cheat—and at the direct expense of kids whose parents were either too ethical or not rich enough to afford ascheme like that. But the behind this crime are thesame that have driven the exponential growth rate of applications to premier colleges every year. Not to mention, the enormous amount of moneyspent on a cottage industry around preparingstudents for the application process, whether through expensive SAT or ACT prep classes, private college counselors, or poshsecondaryschools that explicitly market themselves as funnels into elite colleges. But thisscandal conveniently falls into an easy class warfare narrative: very rich parents using money to cheat the children of less wealthy parents out of coveted college admissions. It’s not exactly clear why these parents didn’t just bribeschools the legal way: write a big check to theschool at thesame time their kids were applying. (See, for example,Jared Kushner.) As our Editor in Chief Paul GlastrissaidWednesday morning on Hill TV, “It’s not an open quid pro quo, but you have a very good chance at getting your child in theschool.”Washington Monthly editor-in-chief@glastrissays college admissionsscam is an “illustration” of higher education problems.— HILLTV (@HillTVLive)March 13, 2019While this class warfare narrative is valid, there is another class warfarestory that I think hasstronger explanatory power: the battle between the 1 percent and the .01 percent. Half a million dollars or $1.2 million is a lot of money, but that’s not nearly the kind of money that gets richschools’ attention. Kushner’s father donated $2.5 million to Harvard in 1998, which, adjusted to inflation, is $4 million in today’s money. Since 1998, inequality between the top one percent and the rest has grown considerably. But the gap between the 1 percent and .01 percent has become nearly insurmountable. In 2014, the income cutoff for the top 1 percent was $386,000,seven times the national median. The top .01 percent’s was $7 million, eighteen times larger. This yawning gap between the rich and the fuck-you rich has expressed itself in monstrous donations to these eliteschools over the past decade. In 2014, Harvardreceivedan individual donation of $350 million, its biggest ever. The next year, it got a$400 million individual donation. It might besafe tosay that the cost of gaining a favorable judgment of your child’s application from elite admissions committees has gone up. In other words, only the top .01 percent can actually bribe theseschools the old-fashioned legal way. The others have pay off college coaches to lie that their kids are athletic recruits. Thisscandal is indicative of thestate of higher education these days—overly obsessed with the mostselectiveschools that don’t actually educate the vast majority of the American public. In fact, More than 90 percent of higher-edstudentsdon’t goto eliteschools. But the way our economicsystem isset up, there’s good reason for this obsession. The very tangible advantages theseschools offer have incentivized upper-class parents to take drastic measures to get their children into theschools that are the tickets to ensuring they can remain in, or climb up, their hyper-stratified class. It’s aself-reinforcing cycle that restricts opportunity to the already privileged, and, apparently, drives wealthy parents to amazing extremes.",1,1,Washington Monthly

92,The COVID Tracking Project is (nearly) gone. Can we see clearly now?,-4.0,45.0,https://www.cjr.org/the_media_today/the-covid-tracking-project-is-nearly-gone-can-we-see-clearly-now.php,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-17,18,"Alexis C Madrigal and Robinson Meyer, colleagues at,set out to answer asimple question: how many people had been tested for the coronavirus in the USso far? The answer, it turned out, was actually quite complicated: in the absence of data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it was hard to tell whether low reported case rates to that point reflected low incidence or lowtesting. Madrigal and Meyersent a form email to health officials in everystate; theysoon found out that the answer was the latter, and that the federal government did not have a handle on the numbers. As Emily Sohn reported for CJR, Jeff Hammerbacher—a datascientist who had been working to track thesame information, and who knew Madrigal from college—saw their work and reached out. They teamed up, andsoon, the COVID Tracking Project was born. It was meant, initially, as ashort-term gap-filler. “Every day,” Erin Kissane, its managing editor, told Sohn in late March, “we hope the CDC will put us out of business.”But the days went by, and the CDC did not, leaving the Tracking Project’s collective of journalists and tech folk toserve,in their own words, as “a de factosource of pandemic data for the USs.”agreed to host the project; its team grew to include hundreds of volunteers, and the project’s founderssolicited philanthropic donations to paysome of them. “It just got really complex,”Madrigal told CNN’s Brian Stelter recently. “At first, we just thought you could pull numbers off dashboards and that was gonna be the main process. As it turned out, we actually needed to do deep research. We made hundreds and hundreds of contacts withstate officials… We added race and ethnicity data, we added outcomes like hospitalizations and deaths, we added tracking of long-term care facilities. So all of those things came together to just require tons of labor; I mean, tens of thousands of hours of people’s time.” State and federal officials cribbed the project’s data. Other journalists became reliant on it. Now, finally, the project is winding down. Itstopped collecting data ten days ago; it plans tospend the next couple of months on analysis work and archiving beforeshuttering completely. The analysis will mainly focus on datastreams—around race and ethnicity, for instance—that arestill insufficient, but the project’s founders are confident that federal officials are finally adequately replicating much of its core data, and, crucially, that the new Biden administration can be trusted not to turn off the lights at a moment’s notice. Writing last week, however, Madrigal and Kissane warned that the landscape of coronavirus data is “persistently messy.” The pandemic response “has been nominally or actually based on the idea that we know what is happening across the country to a precise degree,” they wrote. “And although this idea—that we havesolid data about the movements of the pandemic and the effects of the response—is much closer to truth now than it was a year ago, it’s very far from universally accurate.”This week, Madrigal and Meyer expanded on that the mein an essay for, pinpointing key truths about pandemic data and officials’ handling of it. The initial pandemic response plan assumed the presence of good data, and failed to account for kinks at every part of the data-production pipeline, from the local, to thestate, to the federal. We now have much better national-level data on cases, tests, hospitalizations, and deaths—but thisstill offers a rather messy compilation ofsnapshots and time lags, not a real-time “window” into the currentstate of the pandemic, as officialssometimes imply. (Deaths oftensubstantially lag cases, and commonly go unreported for weeks.) At least fivestatesstill “have disturbingly incomplete testing data”; nationally, tens of millions of rapid antigen tests appear to be unaccounted for. “Datamightseem like an overly technical obsession,” Madrigal and Meyer write. “But data are how our leaders apprehend reality.”The press, too. Over the course of the pandemic, responsible news organizations have pledged to “follow thescience” and extolled the virtues of data-driven analysis, but as Madrigal and Meyer note, looking at data is less like “peering into a crystal ball” than “watching citysewers empty into a wastewater-treatment plant”—it’s more useful than not looking, “but youshouldn’t delude yourself about what’s in the water.” And yet,as I wrote in the early days of the pandemic, reporters moved quickly to paint unduly certain pictures with extremely incomplete information; reported cases and deaths, for example, were routinely relayed as “totals,” not as clear undercounts, which, of course, they were. Over time, data flows improved; testing, in particular, expanded, even prior to the election of a president who doesn’t view it asa conspiracy to make him look bad. But testing remains highly imperfect. Per the Tracking Project, reported daily tests hit a high-water mark close to 2.3 million in December—a figure,some experts then calculated, that was adequate to mostsymptomatic COVID cases and close contacts, butstill fell wellshort of the daily rate that would be needed to properly control viralspread by identifying asymptomatic people. From a public-healthstandpoint,these metrics aresubject to healthyscientific debate; from a journalisticstandpoint, every additional test is an extra confirmed truth about the world, and yet media-industry leaders have never pushed with any real consistency or urgency to frame expanded testing,as Isuggested last year, as a freedom of information issue. (We’re better at demanding tosee information the government is hiding than information the government is failing to collect.) In the absence of a further massive ramp-up, the percentage of tests coming back positive often offers more useful insights than flat numbers, yet many outlets haven’t pivoted to this metric with any consistency either. And in recent weeks, testing rates have generally declined. This could be a function of fewer people needing one (though, again, it depends how you define “need”), but it could also reflect public exhaustion with mitigation measures, bad weather,states’shift to vaccine infrastructure, and other contingencies. As I wrote recently, journalists covering the pandemicstill have to grapple, over a year in, with massive uncertainty. Westill haven’t figured out how best to communicate this—not only around new challenges like vaccines and variants, that currently attract the bulk of our attention, but around the very basic building blocks that we use to define and measuresurges and lulls,sickness and death. The visibility of these underpinning realities isstill murky. Some outstanding journalists—not least at the Tracking Project—have focused on finding outlines of clarity, and for that we owe an enormous debt of gratitude. Many of us have instead acclimated to the murk, preferring tosee what’s in front of us, even though it isn’t the full picture. Below, more on the pandemic:",2,1,Columbia Journalism Review
93,Nebraskans talk extreme weather. Just don’t call it climate change.,1.33,47.67,https://www.csmonitor.com/Environment/2019/0416/Nebraskans-talk-extreme-weather.-Just-don-t-call-it-climate-change,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"The flood carried away edges of his fields, dumped up to 6 inches of uselesssand on his fertile loam, and deposited, incongruously, the elastic band of a pair of Hanes underwear on a bush. But everywhere Chad Christianson looks, all hesees is green. The green rye he planted last fallstands insharp contrast to the brownsoil and cornstalks. More importantly, it held thesoil in place in all but the most flooded areas of his fields, lessening the waters’ impact. It’s a firststep in Mr. Christianson’s push to become more weather-resilient.“I don’t know about climate change,” Mr. Christiansonsays. “But I think the weather is going to be more extreme going forward.”Thesevere flooding that inundated Nebraska last month washed away fields, bridges, and roads. But the extreme weather is alsostarting tosway residents’ thinking about climate. It’s asentiment that is percolating here in rural Nebraska. With thestatestill in recovery mode, many Nebraskanssay it’s early for them tostart contemplating the long-term implications of last month’s epic flood, the most widespread in memory. But assuch extreme weather events pile up,somesay they are beginning to change hearts and minds here – not politically but practically.“This [flood] didn’t come out of nowhere but it went beyond almost anyone’s expectations,”says Tyler Williams, an educator with the extensionservice at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, which works with farmers. “So I definitely think people in the agricultural world are thinking: ‘All right. I’ve got to fixsomething, dosomething different.’”Part of the change in thought is coming from farmers themselves, especially those involved with thesmall but growing regenerative farming movement.“Conversations were already happening before the flood,”says Graham Christensen, a fifth-generation farmer and president of GC Resolve, a grassroots community-development business. “But after the flood a lot more folks are like, ‘Yeah, I have neverseen that; my dad has neverseen that; my grandpa has neverseen that. This is a pattern that’s emerging.’”The movement, which focuses on the health ofsoil, emphasizes techniques like planting cover crops as a way to keep more roots in thesoil, beyond the corn andsoybean plants that many farmers raise in rotation. These roots keep more nutrients in thesoil, make it easier for water to drain (which improves flood resilience), and keep more waterstored in thesoil (which improves drought-resistance). That’s key for farmers like Mr. Christianson here in Fremont. Just don’t call it climate change.“We are not necessarily going around andsaying, ‘Hey, climate change, climate change, climate change!”says Mr. Christensen of GC Resolve, who travels thestate preaching regenerative agriculture. “We’re more focused on rallying around thesolution, which is bettersoil-health principles.”The term climate change has becomeso politicized that it’s not readily accepted in rural America, even with the extreme weather. Most pastors in thestate are afraid of addressing the issue for fear ofsplitting their congregations, according to a 2015 University of Nebraska-Lincoln report. A couple comes out of a Lynch, Nebraska, donation center withsix gallon jugs of emergency water because the floods have intermittently made their water unsafe. Does the extreme weather imply climate change? “No,”she answers. “No,” he answers, then gives ashort lecture on avoiding preconceived ideas. Skeptics have a point. Last month’s flooding was the result ofsuch a fluky combination ofsnow, rain, frozen ground, and rapid melt that even warming advocates admit that it alone may not be a harbinger of change to come. But previous events – flooding of the Missouri River in 2011, an increasing number of intense rain events, and one of the 10 coldest Februaries on record – have residents reassessing the future.“It’s getting to the point where it’s hard to ignore,”says Kim Morrow, a behavior change expert at Verdis Group, asustain ability and climate resiliency advisory group based in Omaha. When Yale Universitysocialscientists assessed public opinion about climate change last year, they found that 64% of Nebraskans believed climate change was happening. That was up 6 points from their 2014survey– a rise consistent with theslow change in aswath of redstates from Idaho to Kentucky – butstill 6 points behind the national average. The Yale research also reveals an urban-ruralsplit. In Lancaster County, home of Lincoln and the university, 72% of peoplesaid change was happening. In rural counties farther west, barely half do.“Yes, I think it’sstill political and divided, but people are beginning to change,”says the Rev. Richard Randolph,senior pastor at Christ United Methodist Church in Lincoln. He hassubmitted to this year’s Nebraska-Kansas annual conference of the United Methodist Church a petition calling on churches to become better informed about global warming and toset goals for reducing their carbon footprints. “For the most part, I pastor a church that’s moderate to progressive theologically. Andy Alexander, director of the Collaborative Ministry Office at Creighton, a Catholic university in Omaha, is notseeing much of ashift at all. “People areskeptical about that kind of thinking, which they call projection,” hesays. Even if they acknowledge they need to be more prepared for chancier weather in the future, they’re not making a link between their present practices and warming.“I don’t hear peoplesaying our use of fossil fuels is leading to this problem,” hesays. And they’re not making the broader connections Pope Francis has made between warming’s impact on the poor and theselfishness and greed that keeps nations from reducing that impact by changing their ways, he adds. “I don’t hear anybodysaying that.”",2,2,Christian Science Monitor

96,Conservatives Keep Missing Opportunities to Really Engage With Blacks,7.67,42.0,https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/01/15/conservatives-keep-missing-opportunities-for-real-engagement-with-blacks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-15,25,"Since the November 3 election, I have received many calls and em ails from influential Republicans and prominent conservatives. Despite losing the White House, they were high-fiving about President Donald Trump’s going from 8% of the black vote in 2016 to 12% in 2020. What asadstate of affairs when a 12% marketshare is reason to celebrate. In most industries, this would be viewed as unacceptable and embarrassing. Herein lies the problem with the conservative movement: Our expectations areso low when it comes to the black community that even miniscule progress is celebrated jubilantly. The reason expectations areso low is because deep down inside, conservatives–for purposes of this column, I’m using the words Republicans and conservatives interchangeably–know that they have not really made aserious effort to cultivate relations with the black community. They do, in their minds, just enough not to be called racist. According to this perverse logic, if they have one black onstaff, they can’t be racist; or if they grew up with a black nanny, they can’t be racist. I am not kidding; I have had many conservations with conservatives along this line. Those who have followed my writing over the years know that I have been critical of the lack of “substantive” engagement with the black community from conservatives. Most of the blacks invited by conservatives tospeak at their events have little to no connection to the black community and, quite often, theirspeeches are off-putting to the black community. If your goal is to be entertained or to throw red meat to the white base of the party, then they may be appropriatespeakers. But if your goal is to build relations with the black community, they are counterproductive. I challenge conservatives tospecify the number of blacks they have in decision-making positions within their organizations. How many blacks do they have around them that tell them what they need to hear and not what they want to hear?How many five- andsix-figure black consultants do they have on retainer? How many black vendors do they contract with during the course of a year?When Isay decision-making positions, I meansomeone who can hire or fire; has budgetary authority tospend money; or can get meetingsset up with key executives. This is the 21st century, and many conservative organizations have little to no reflection of the diversity that our country presents. How is this possible?These organizations hire their friends, they give consultant contracts to their friends, they contribute to their friends’ campaigns. They do thesame things they accuse radical liberals of doing. They are in a bubble, an echo chamber filled with people who only think and look like them. Are they racist? Absolutely not. People tend to gravitate toward the things they are familiar with; it’s a logical and natural thing to do. No, I am not talking about imitating the Democrats. No bean counting. They, as usual, go overboard with their push for diversity, to the point that it is discriminatory. But, if you are a conservative and don’t notice that every time you’re in a meeting or conference that not one black person can be found there, that is a problem. Democrats are obsessed with diversity and Republicans are oblivious to diversity. Both are equally wrong and detrimental to our American values. But true leaders understand this dilemma and make a conscious decision to inject diversity into their organizationsso they can remain relevant. There is no evidence that conservatives have learned this lesson. I have done PR and crises communications forsome of the biggest names in politics, business,sports, and entertainment from all over the world. I refer to myself as a “straticist,” not astrategist. Most people in my profession understand PR orstrategic communications, but few understand the merging of both when confronting an issue; thus, the word “straticist.”The Republican Party and the conservative movement have a brand problem. We have allowed radical liberals to brand us as racist. A lie that is repeated enough becomes the truth. Conservatives are under the misguided notion that blacks need to besold or persuaded on conservatism. Blacks are more conservative than most whites;survey aftersurvey hasshown that blacks are the most churchgoing people in the country. Blacks don’t need to be lectured about family values and entrepreneurship. We had the most intact,stable families from the 1900s to the 1950s, and the highest marriage rates. Then Democrats in the 1960s injected our community with welfare and all these radical liberal “social” programs. We always have been business-minded, even beforeslavery; until, that is, Democrats cut off our access to opportunities and capital. Conservatism is in our DNA Thesooner conservatives grasp this, thesooner we can begin to makesignificant progress with the black community. Thesooner conservativesstop promoting black minstrelshows dressed up like outreach, thesooner more blacks will publicly join our cause. To cite two examples: The “commentary” of a certain upwardly mobile young lady and a certain comedic duo, each with their own podcasts, play into the worststereotypes of blacks ever perpetrated. We, as black conservatives, are not here to be used to throw out inflammatory rhetoric against the black community or to entertain a room full of white conservatives with feeble attempts at humor. We want to be a full partner inspreading a positive, conservative message throughout the black community. In the immortal words of my grandmother: “Boy, your actionsspeakso loud, I can’t hear a damn thing you aresaying!”How appropriate for conservatives.

97,House Democrats make their case to Senate Republicans: Trump duped his rioters — and he will dump you,-20.0,35.33,https://www.salon.com/2021/02/11/house-democrats-make-their-case-to-senate-republicans-trump-duped-his-rioters--and-hell-dump-you/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-11,25,"""His directive is Trump first,"" House impeachment manager and Democratic Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island reminded the Senate during thesecond day of arguments insupport of thesingular article of impeachment filed against the former president. It is a crucial takeaway thatshould be heeded by the Senate Republicans who plan to acquit Trump, caring not one bit about the overwhelming evidence of his guilt in inciting an insurrection on January 6. Senate Republicans are putting their loyalty to and fear of thesociopathic man-child from Mar-A-Lago over their patriotism and basicsense of decency. But as Cicilline pointed out, no matter what you do for Trump, no matter how much you debase yourself for Trump, no matter what risks you take for Trump, he will not hesitate to throw you under the bus. The impeachment trial of Donald Trump has been overshadowed by the fact that the majority of Senate Republicans plan to acquit Trump. So the only real question is whether or not the House Democrats who are arguing the case against Trump can maximally expose the cowardice and complicity of the Republicans. House Democrats kicked off arguments on Thursday with a compelling presentation by Rep. Diana DeGette of Colorado, focused on how the insurrectionists believed they were there on Trump is orders. ""They actually believed they would face no punishment,"" DeGette explained, noting that the ""mobscreamed at officers that they were listening to President Trump"" and ""believed the commander-in-chief ordered this.""The rioters wereso dead certain that they weresafe from consequences, DeGette pointed out, that they did not bother to hide their identities. On the contrary, as most commentators remarked on in the days after the attack, they wereso unafraid that huge numbers of them livestreamed, photographed, or otherwise advertised their participation in the insurrection. The reason these insurrectionists weresure that they'd be free of consequences is not mysterious. It is because Trump promised them that they'd besafe. In thespeech he gavesending the mob tostorm the Capitol, Trump literallysaid, ""When you catchsomebody in a fraud, you are allowed to go by very different rules.""Even as the House managers argued their case, more evidence emerged proving it. New court documents from the Department of Justice revealed, CNN reported, that the leader of the Ohio Oath Keepers, Jessica Watkins, ""believedshe was responding to the call from then-President Donald Trump himself."" The documentsshow that Watkins was deeply concerned ""about taking action without his backing."" As federal prosecutors argued, this was ""evident in a November 9, 2020, text in whichshestated, 'I am concerned this is an elaborate trap. Unless the POTUS himself activates us, it is not legit.'""Trump gave the order to ""march"" on the Capitol and instructed that there is ""not going to be cheeringso much forsome of them."" The insurrectionists felt like they wereshielded from consequences and free to ransack the building. After all, Trump promised the rules were now ""very different.""But they were notsafe, as DeGette laid out. Over 200 people have been arrested and chargedso far,some on veryserious charges. Some of the rioters, DeGette noted, havesincesaid they were ""duped"" by Trump,including Jacob Chansley, the ""QAnonshaman"" who became the face of the riot with his weird buffalo headdress. On Wednesday,a lawyer for another one of the rioters released astatement complaining that his client, like many who heeded Trump is call, ""will bespendingsubstantial portions if not the remainder of their lives in prison as a consequence. Meanwhile Donald Trump resumes his life of luxury and privilege.""The evidence does point to the long-standing truth grifters like Trump understand: The best marks are people who think they are part of the conspiracy. That is how Trump gets people. He lures them in by appealing to their ugliest impulses — like the growing Republican desire to unfairlyseize power by undermining democracy — and then leaves his co-conspirators, who clearly followed Trump because they liked the idea of a fascist insurrection, holding the bag.""He lied to his base,saying this was all okay,"" Rep Ted Lieu of Californiasaid during his argument on Thursday. Democrats finished their case against Trump in a way that was just as impressive as they began it, meticulously laying out the facts while notshying away from the emotions brought on by these terrible events. Lieu was particularly hard-hitting, pointing out that, ""When you or I make a mistake andsomething very bad happens, we wouldshow remorse,"" but Trump is reaction to January 6 was to brag about how perfect his behavior was,showing how intentional this was from the beginning. The Senate Republicans who are lining up toshield Trumpshould really think long and hard about why on Earth they want to protect a man who would not piss on them if they were on fire. A man who always repays loyalty withspit in the face. A man who thanked his vice president, Mike Pence, for years of loyalservice bysending a mob to kill him. A man who, as the House managers amply demonstrated with court documents, did not care who he killed by inciting an insurrection, even if the victims were his mostsycophanticsupporters in Congress. But ultimately, the real question is not whether Trump is guilty. Everyone knows he is. The only question is whether Senate Republicans want to be comp licit with an insurrection that directly threatened their own lives. Presumably, they think they are playing 11th-level chess and will getsome political advantage out of it. But in the end, they are no better than the morons whostormed the Capitol because Trump told them it was ""allowed."" And if they believe otherwise, it is because Trump hassuccessfully exploited their own overblown egos against them — as he does to all of his marks.",1,1,Salon

The legalstandard established underRoesaysstates must allow access for abortions performed up until fetal viability around 24 weeks. Mississippi passed the restrictive abortion l awin 2018, along with aslew of anti-abortion provisions that have been blocked by the courts, including a law restricting abortions aftersix weeks. The Supreme Court announced in May that it would hear thecase,setting off alarm among abortion rights activists. Thesuit filed by the Jackson, Mississippi organization, the only abortionservices provider in thestate, contesting the 15-week law wassuccessful in the lower courts, which cited precedent preventingstates from restricting abortion access during the pre-viabilitystage. The Supreme Court, however, after months of hemming and hawing, announced that it would hear thestate’s appeal of the case, raising the possibility it could choose to upend abortion pre-viability abortion restrictions that have been ruled unconstitutional as placing an undue burden on womenseeking an abortion. In announcing its decision, the courtstated explicitly it was out to reassess “whether all pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional.”The announcementsignaled a tectonicshift in US abortion law could be coming now that the court is lopsided with conservative justices. The Mississippi brief attempts to chip away at the viabilitystandard, claiming advances inscience and technology justify thestate intervening earlier and earlier in a pregnancy. Even if the Supreme Court does not explicitly reverse, there are other ways it could defang the law. “As an alternative, Mississippisaid the court could reduce the heightenedscrutiny that abortion laws must meet and find that Mississippi’s law meets legitimate objectivessuch as protecting the unborn, women’s health or the medical profession,” the Washington Postnotes. “It could find that not all pre-viability abortions are unconstitutional, thestatesaid, or that the 15-week restriction does not place an undue burden on asubstantial number of women.”What is clear is that thestakes are high and, as the Post notes, Thursday’s “brief emphasizes the potential presented in the case,, the most direct challenge to abortion rights at the Supreme Court in decades.” The Supreme Court is likely to hear the case later this year, in November or December, and a decision would be handed down by June of nextyear.",2,1,Slate

102,"House Appropriations ‘Minibus’ Stuffed With Bad Policies, Overspending",16.67,29.67,https://www.dailysignal.com/2020/07/21/house-appropriations-minibus-bill-stuffed-with-problematic-policies-overspending/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-21,25,"The House is expected to vote later this week on HR 7608, a “minibus” bill that covers fiscal year 2021spending for the departments of Agriculture, Interior, State, Veterans Affairs, and more. That covers four of the 12spending bills that fund the federal government. Thebill’s text—produced on July 16—is astaggering 689 pages long, meaning that no representative’s office has had the time to properly vet it before the vote. The practice of voting on hugespending packages, common in both chambers for years,sacrifices transparency and accountability for thesake of political convenience. While anysuch legislative package is bound to contain flaws, this one is brimming with mistakes and ideological overreach on issuessuch as abortion, foreign policy, and welfare, and adds to our alreadyskyrocketing national debt. Experts from The Heritage Foundation have highlighted a number of policy concerns that the Houseshould address. The “minibus” package contains more than $37.5 billion in “emergency”-designatedspending. Much of thisspending is unjustified. Rather, it continues the use of the emergencyspending designation toavertBudget Control Actspending caps for fiscal 2021. The Department of State/foreign operations bill provides $10 billion in emergency funds which,accordingto the House Appropriations Committee, would be used for global coronavirus preparedness, response, and relief. However, the bill designates only $2.5 billion of the funds directly to health programs. The bulk of thespending would go toward diplomatic programs, operating expenses, development programs, international disaster assistance, economicsupport, migration and refugee assistance, and the UN. The State Departmentshould be working toward ensuring the health andsafety of Americans abroad as the world continues toseek treatments and a vaccine for the coronavirus. However, even of the $2.5 billion designated for global health programs, $800 million is being diverted to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria, not the coronavirus. Much of the other funding issimply being used to expand the base operations budgets of various State Department programs. The Interior and Environment bill adds$15 billion in emergency funding for infrastructure projects for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Indian Health Service. Of that, $13 billion would go directly to the EPA for infrastructure grants. As with the State Department emergency funding, this money is not intended to fight the coronavirus or any other true emergency. It would be used to expand functions of the EPA thatshould be done within the existing agency budget, if at all. Much of the money would bespent in the form of grants tostates for drinking water infrastructure, whichshould be addressed at the local, rather than federal, level. Finally, the bill provides $12.5 billion in emergency appropriations to the Department of Veterans Affairs to cover rising health care costs. Providing quality health care (whether public or private) to our nation’s veterans is of the utmost importance. However, doingso by ignoring budget caps and fiscal responsibilitysets a dangerous precedent. Congress must prioritizespending on a case-by-case basis to keep programs under control. Offsets, whether they come from within VA programs or other federal programs,should be the bare minimum requirement for newspending initiatives. In2019, a total of $25.4 billion in emergency appropriations were enacted. This “minibus” alone would represent a 48% increase above that number. If all of the money was for fighting the coronavirus pandemic, perhaps it would be justified, but that’s not the case. Most of it issimply being used to expand existing government programs without retaining anysense of fiscal responsibility. The House is headed down a dangerous path andshould reexamine the emergency provisions of this bill. The House Appropriations agriculturesubcommittee has jurisdiction over funding one of the largestsafety netprograms; namely, foodstamps. The goal of this program is to help millions of low-income Americans buy food. The committee used the appropriations bill to undermine commonsense reforms advanced by the Trump administration tosafeguard the program. Section 733 of the appropriations billseeks to permanently prohibit implementation of the administration’sAble-Bodied Adults Without Dependentsrule. This rulestrengthened foodstamp work requirements that only apply to work-capable individuals ages 18 to 49 who do not have children or other dependents in the home. During a recession, this work requirement rule will understandably not be implemented for this work-capable population. It’s only applicable when thestate unemployment rate is below a 6% average for the most recent 24-month period. Inasmuch as the June unemployment rate was11.1%,nostate will meet the unemployment thresholdsoon. Moreover, even if there hadn’t been a COVID-19 economic downturn, the number of work-capable individuals without dependents is asmall fraction of the overall foodstamp pool—about688,000among nearly 40 million foodstamp beneficiaries. The bill would also permanently ban the Department of Agriculture’sStandard Utility Allowancerule in Section 734. That rule eliminates a loophole known as “Heat and Eat.”The way the loophole works is a bit convoluted. The amount of foodstamps a household receives is based on its “countable” income (income minus certain deductions). State governments can game thesystem bysending households a tiny amount of money through a low-income energy assistance program, which makes the household eligible for more foodstamps. The administration’s reform tostop this abuse was commonsense, andshould remain in place. Finally, the House committee’s report language makes a “strong” recommendation against the administration’s proposed rule calledBroad-Based Categorical Eligibility. The rule would close a loophole that allows individuals to bypass foodstamp eligibility rules. Current rulesstill allow millionaires to get foodstamps. When Congress does pass a bicameral appropriations package, itshould ensure that these provisions are not included. Instead, Congressshould codify the president’s reforms and go beyond them to pursuestatutorily fixing theseserious issues that threaten the long-term integrity of the foodstamp program. The Housespending bill would exempt wine grapes, hops, pulse crops, and almonds from the Obama administration’s Food and Drug Administrationproducesafety rule. The rule was deeply flawed and ignored the plain language of the Food Safety Modernization Act that it was implementing. The law directs the FDA to regulate fruits and vegetables based on risk, but the FDA instead developed a rule that ignored the risk-based requirements of the law. Rather than directing the FDA to fix this flawed rule,Section 746of the Housespending bill would createspecial carve-outs for certain commodities. That ignores the problems with the rule as it affects other commodities, and it creates asituation where organizations representingspecific commodities have to lobby Congress for exemptions from coverage under a rule that theyshouldn’t besubject to in the first place. Federal bloat: The House bill in general rejects measures to reduce thesize andscope of government. For example, the House proposal consistently maintains or increasesspending on EPA programs where the president’s budget largely reflected measures proposed to reduce or eliminate programs in the EPA that are better left tostates, communities, and private individuals. The bill would also block healthy government reform by prohibiting any funds from being used to relocate, close, or consolidate any EPA office, laboratory, or facility. It also includes measures that would increase costs for American taxpayers on infrastructure projects,such as the requirement in Section 421 that all of the iron andsteel work in projects using Safe Water Drinking Act grants be produced in the US Cognitive dissonance on federal lands: The bill makes refreshing efforts to fund maintenance on federal lands and national parks. The National Park Service alone holds a backlog of $11.9 billion indef erred maintenance, and Congress historically has neglected prio rit izing those projects. However, the bill neglects to address one of the troublesome roots feeding thesystemic maintenance issue; namely, the federal government’s preference for buying new acreage, rather thanstewarding what it already has. The primary tool for federal land purchases is the Land and Water Conservation Fund. The bill presumes Congress will pass the Great American Outdoors Act, which, among other things, reprograms the Land and Water Conservation Fund as a mandatoryspending program of $900 million annually. Doingso delegates away Congress’ power of the purse to bureaucrats at the National Park Service, Bureau of Land Management, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Forest Service. Importantly, it appears that Congress has little ability to limit how much of the annual $900 million a presidential administration canspend. At least under the currentstructure as an appropriated program, Congress must debate which projects tosupport and how much to appropriate, and retains the option to later rescind certain funds. Nevertheless, the appropriations bill lays the groundwork for implementation of the Land and Water Conservation Fund as a mandatoryspending program and reinforces the preference to purchase an ever-growing list of lands rather than tosave. For example, Section 425states: “The Federal land acquisition project lists required by each Agency …shall total for each agency no less than 150 percent of the amount enacted for that agency for the previous fiscal year.”While the House’s attention to maintenance needs on federal lands is encouraging, one must wonder whether this newfound fervor will outlast the Land and Water Conservation Fund as a new permanent and mandatoryspending program operating largely beyond the hands of Congress. Instead, Congressshould be going in the opposite direction and reducing federal land ownership. The Housespending bill also includes policy riders that would block EPA efforts to respect both the rule of law and principles of federalism, protect the environment, ensure the use ofsoundscience, and increase transparency in government. Some of those riders would:. One of the most egregious abuses in the Obama administration’s EPA was promulgating its “mercury” rule without the agency being able to justify the purpose of the rule (i.e., reducing mercury and other hazardous air pollutant emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants). The costs were as much as 2,400 times greater than the direct benefits. Instead, the agency justified the rule based on questionable ancillary (secondary)benefitsfrom reducing particulate matter, even though particulate matter had nothing to do with the purpose of the rule. To its credit, the Trump administration acted and finalized a rule that wouldn’t allow this type of regulatory abuse. Buried within the massive Housespending bill is language that would undo this new rule and require the EPA to bless the Obama administration’s games with its mercury rule. (Seepage 94).. Under the Clean Water Act,states can use the Section 401certification process to ensure thatstate water quality will not be harmed by federally permitted activities. But what happens whenstates abuse this process to address issues that have nothing to do with water quality? What happens when issues not related to water quality delay critical projects? That has become a major problem. Last month, the EPAreleasedafinal rule that would help to better clarify the Section 401 process and eliminatesome of those abuses. UnderSection 440of the Housespending bill, the EPA would be prohibited from using funds to finalize, implement, or enforce what was the Section 401 proposed rule. Congress would allowstates to continue blocking projects under the Clean Water Act even if the reasons have nothing to do with water quality.. It’s quite disturbing howsome on the left want to ensure that the public doesn’t have proper information to evaluate thescience used by the EPA The Trump administration has propose da rule that would improve transparency. Section 447of thespending bill would block funding for those efforts that would promote open government andsoundscience.. Should the EPA and US Army Corps of Engineers be able to regulate almost any water they want, including even regulating what most people would consider to be dry land?That’s what the Obama “Waters of the USs” (WOTUS)rulewould have done. The Trump administration go trid oft hat rule and finalized a rule that didsomething different when it comes to defining “waters of the USs” under the Clean Water Act. It tried to follow the law. The Housereport(page 99) accompanying thespending bill includes language requiring the EPA to develop reports answering leading questions, with the apparent assumption the answers would make the Obama rule look better. It would do this by conveniently ignoring the rule of law, property rights, thestate role in water protection under the Clean Water Act, and the vagueness problems that have undermined the Clean Water Act.. Another provision in the bill would prevent the EPA from finalizing the Trump administration’s right-sizing of the Obama-erastandards that regulate oil and gas methane emissions. The US has become the world’s leading oil and natural gas producer, providing affordable, reliable power to families and businesses. Resource extraction has created jobs across the country, and cheap natural gas is a critical reason why many energy-intensive manufacturers have chosen the US as home. The Obama administration’s methane regulations were a costlysolution insearch of a problem. Producers have an incentive to capture andsell methane, the main component in natural gas, because it has economic value, yielding low-cost energy for consumers and reducing the US allies’ dependence on Russian gas. Even the Obama administration’s EPA reported that methane emissions from the industry decreased despite the fact that energy production hasskyrocketed. The State Department, foreign operations, and related programs appropriations bill passed by the House Appropriations Committee haveseveral provisions that conservativesshould be concerned about. Overall, the level of appropriations is $8.5 billion higher than for fiscal 2020, an increase of nearly 15%. In addition, the bill continues funding normal activities through Overseas Contingency Operations, rather than through the normal funding accounts—a mechanism originallyset up to avoidspending constraints. With federal governmentspending at record, unsustainable levels,such an increase cannot be justified. Instead, appropriatorsshould beseeking to better allocate existing resources. In addition, there are numerous parts of the bill that would change policy to the detriment of US interests, including:Current law enacted in 1994 under then-President Bill Clinton restricts US payments for UN peacekeeping to 25 percent of the total budget. The UN, however, charges the US nearly 28% of the peacekeeping budget. By permitting payment of “USs assessed contributions up to the amountspecified in the Annex accompanying UN General Assembly document A/73/350/Add.1,” the House bill would override current law. That would remove pressure on the UN to reduce US peacekeeping assessment to 25%. Currently, the US withholds funding to the UN organizations for a number of reasons, including withholding 15% of funding if thesecretary ofstate reports that the organization is not meeting legislativelyspecified transparency and accountabilitystandards. The House bill would override those provisions and mandate full payment of US assessments to UN organizations. Indeed, in the case of UN transparency and accountability, it would maintain the reporting requirement but eliminate the withholding. Withholding is a key point of leverage to press for reforms or, if necessary, to ensure that US taxpayer funds do notsupport activities counter to the national interest. It must remain an option. Unless thesecretary ofstate reports to Congress that funding does notsupport the national interest, funding will be renewed. The flaws of theHuman Rights Counciland theUN Relief and Works Agencyare well-established. Congressshould put the onus on the organizations to reform and earn US funding. The bill would prohibit funding for the International Criminal Courtinvestigation of Americansand allies, but allows “for technical assistance, training, assistance for victims, protection of witnesses, and law enforcementsupport related to international investigations, apprehensions, prosecutions, and adjudications of genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes.”That loopholesends at best mixedsignals to an organization that is bent on investigating Americans even though the US has never joined the court, nor acknowledged any jurisdiction over Americans. Regardless of what Congress thinks of the president’s decisions regarding the World Health Organization, it’s clear that the organization badly mishandled the COVID-19 response, particularly its willingness to unquestioningly echostatements and assertions from Beijing. The US needs to work with other memberstates to try to reform the WHO or, if that proves unachievable, to forge an alternative mechanism to detect and respond to international pandemics. Providing funding in this way riskssending the message that the US is not determined to reform this flawed institution. The billsets an arbitrarystaffing level far higher than the average of the past two decades and bars thesecretary ofstate from acting to “downsize, downgrade, consolidate, close, move, or relocate the Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration.”Both unreasonably limit thesecretary ofstate’s ability to adjust the department to meet current needs and priorities. The US decided to withdraw from the World Tourism Organization in 1995 after conducting a “comprehensive interagency assessment of US membership in all of the international organizations to which it makes assessed contributions” and concluding that US membership in it was among three organizations in which US membership was least defensible. American taxpayers deserve better than to have their moneysquandered again on this unnecessary organization. Unsurprisingly, House Democrats have moved to undosignificant Trump administration pro-life policy achievements. Specifically, the committee-reported bill contains a one-two punch gutting “the Mexico City Policy,” which ensures that American taxpayers do not fund international organizations that perform and promote abortion overseas. The Mexico City Policy was first announced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984. Since then, the policy has been enforced by every Republican president andsuspended by every Democratic presidentshortly after inauguration. Several months after reinstating the policy after taking office, President Donald Trumpexpandedthe policy—now known as “the Protecting Life in Global Health Assistance Policy”—to apply to even more fundingstreams than the original policy. Not only does the House bill contain languagespecifying that none of the funds appropriated under the bill can be used to enact the policy, it also inserts language from the Global Health, Empowerment and Rights (Global HER) Act, which contains language that would permanently repeal the Mexico City Policy. Additionally, the bill increases funding to the UN Population Fund and makes an underhanded attempt to weaken the administration’s ability to ensure that US dollars do notsupport coercive family-planning practices abroad. In 2017, the Trump administration used its authority under the Kemp-Kasten Amendment to withhold funding for the UN Population Fund due to the organization’s complicity in violating the rights of Chinese women and men by aiding the Chinese government’s draconian coercive population-control policies. First enacted in 1985 and included in every foreign appropriations billsince, the Kemp-Kasten Amendment authorizes the president to withhold federal funding from any organization that “supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntarysterilization.”Like the Mexico City Policy, the Kemp-Kasten Amendment has been invoked—or not—along administration party lines. In addition to funding the UN Population Fund despite the Trump administration’s determination to the contrary, the bill contains language that would weaken the administration’s ability to invoke Kemp-Kasten in the first place.: Onspending, regulations, foreign policy, and the nationalsafety net, the House “minibus” package requires extensive fixes. If the House passes the bill as is, the Senateshouldsteadfastly oppose the myriad divisive policy riders that it contains.",1,0,Daily Signal
103,Thousands of Central Valley farmers may lose access to surface water amid worsening drought,-1.0,45.33,https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2021-07-23/thousands-of-california-farmers-may-lose-access-to-surface-water,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"As California endures an increasingly brutalsecond year of drought,state water regulators are considering an emergency order that would bar thousands of Central Valley farmers from usingstream and river water to irrigate their crops. On Friday, the State Water Resources Control Board released a draft “emergency curtailment” order for the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta watershed. The measure, which was first reported byth e Sacramento Bee, would barsome water rights holders from divertingsurface water for agricultural and other purposes. The proposed regulation underscores just how dire matters have become as droughtsqueezes the American West.“Itsays that this drought is reallysevere,”said Erik Ekdahl, deputy director of thestate water board’s Division of Water Rights. The water board will consider the order’s approval on August 3. If approved, it would go into effect about two weeks later at the earliest, Ekdahl added.“This is probably the first time the board has contemplated curtailment orders for the entire bay delta watershed,” Ekdahlsaid. Some notices of water unavailability weresent out to water rights holders in the delta watershed during the 2014-15 time period, but this type ofsweeping, formal order was not utilized, hesaid. If approved, the order would be implemented first with junior water rights holders, then moresenior water rights holders, and then the mostsenior. According to Ekdahl, the board believes that more than 10,000 water rights holders would be affected, with their water largely being used for agricultural irrigation purposes. Some municipal, industrial and commercial entities could also be affected. The proposed regulation would carve out an exemption for health and humansafety purposes, meaning that water for drinking, bathing and domestic purposes wouldn’t besubject to the curtailment. In mid-June, the board issue da notice of water unavailability— which urges, but does not order, people tostop diverting water — to many rights holders. The proposed emergency regulation comes at a time when the primary Northern California reservoirs that feed into California’s lakes andstreams are at about 30% of capacity, Ekdahlsaid. Unusually warm temperatures and drysoils have contributed to reductions in runoff from the Sierrasnowpack. The water board has characterized the reductions as “unprecedented.”According toa water board presentation, projections for this year’s conditions degradedsignificantly between April and May, when watershed runoff decreased by nearly 800,000 acre-feet — an amount that is nearly equivalent to the entire capacity of Folsom Reservoir.“We’re in an extreme drought that’s come on extremely fast,”said Felicia Marcus, water policy expert and formerstate water board chair. According to Marcus, the proposed emergency regulationshows that the water board is working as itshould to allocate water during theshortage.“In theory, it’s a math thing. You’re looking at how much water is in the water course and if there’s not enough to meet all the water rights, then you issue curtailment notices and orders,” Marcus explained. “That’s the way the water rightssystem issupposed to work.”",2,2,LA Times

The correct figure, as disclosed by Lockheed in its filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission, is 120 jets. WASHINGTON — Lockheed Martin delivered 120 F-35s to the US military and international customers in 2020,missing its initial 141-aircraft goal for the year, the company announced. The COVID-19 pandemic proved itself to be a formidable challenge to Lockheed’s main F-35 production line in Fort Worth, Texas, as well as its network ofsuppliers across the globe. As early as April, Lockheed executivessounded the alarm about potentialsupply chain disruptions that threatened toslow down F-35 production. In May, the company announced it would be18 to 24 jetsshort of the 141 F-35sscheduled for delivery in 2020. By fall, officialsstated they expected Lockheed to deliver a total of 121 aircraft.“The F-35 joint enterprise team rapidly responded to the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to deliver the unmatched combat capability the F-35 brings to the warfighter,”said Bill Brotherton, the company’s acting vice president for the F-35 program. “Achieving this milestone amid a global pandemic is a testament to the hard work and dedication of the team and their commitment to our customers’ missions.”The 120th aircraft — an F-35A conventional takeoff and landing variant — was built at the final assembly and checkout facility inCameri, Italyand delivered to the Italian air force last week. Over the past year, Lockheed delivered 74 F-35s to the US military, 31 jets to international partner nations that helped pay into the program’s development costs, and 18 aircraft to foreign militarysales customers. However, the company needed to takesteps to mitigate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on its production lines andsuppliers,such as accelerating payments tosmall businesses that build components for the aircraft and grappling with COVID-19 breakouts that havesometimes led to the quarantine of a portion of itssupply chain. In May, the F-35 production line in Fort Worth moved to a three-month adjusted workschedule,slowing the pace of production because itssuppliers weren’t getting components to the line on time. During thatstretch, production decreased to about eight to 10 jets per month, Darren Sekiguchi, Lockheed’s vice president of F-35 production,said i nan October interview. Instead ofsurging to meet the 141-jet target — which would have increased production costs and created the risk of future delivery delays — Sekiguchisaid that Lockheed would more incrementally ramp production back up to 14 jets per month. It will take until 2023 for the company to catch up to its original productionschedule. Valerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

Louis DeJoy was reported to be planning toslow mail delivery and reduce overtime for postal employees. Since Donald Trump installed Republican me ga donor Louis DeJoy in the position of USs postmaster general on May 5, Postal Service mail delivery delays have been noticeably worse in many places. With millions expected to vote by mail in November due to the COVID-19 pandemic,some worry DeJoy’s cuts to theservice he oversees could affect the 2020 election. Trump has been undermining the US Postal Servicesince he took office. He has mocked the agency as a “joke,” refused to back a pandemic-relatedbailout for the agency, proposed cuts to its budget, exploredprivatizating it, and insisted that it raise the rates it charges Amazon forshipping. The online retail company’s founder, Jeff Bezos,ownsthe Washington Post, a news outlet Trumpfrequentlyderides for publishing unflatteringstories. DeJoy is a wealthybusinessmanandfinance chair for the 2020 Republican National Convention who had given hundreds of thousands of dollars to Trump’s reelection campaign and other GOP lawmakers before he was appointed. The website Sludgereportedlast week that DeJoy also gave $114,500 to aspecial Republican National Committee legal fund dedicated to filing lawsuits to preventstates from expanding voting access. At the time of his appointment, criticsnotedDeJoy had millions invested in US Postal Service competitors and contractors and that he is the first person in decades tapped to lead the Postal Service without prior experience working directly for the agency. In a column published by NBC News in July, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington deputy director Donald K Sherman and Common Cause director of voting and elections Sylvia Albert raised these conflicts of interest and warned that DeJoy’sselection “threatens to corrupt one of America’s most trusted institutions at a key moment.”Since DeJoy took over, their fears appear to have been borne out. Fortunereportedlast month that DeJoy planned toslow mail delivery and reduce overtime for postal employees. It cited a recent internal Postal Service memo that warned that “one aspect of these changes that may be difficult for employees is that—temporarily—we maysee mail left behind or mail on the workroom floor or docks, which is not typical.”DeJoydefendedthe elimination of overtime pay for postal workers as designed to “ensure that we meet ourservicestandards.”The agency is also considering closing multiple local post offices in upcoming months, according to a MarketWatchreportlast week. And many locations have already reduced their hours of operation. Even beyond these cuts,some communities have been experiencing major delivery delays. The Philadelphia Inquirerreportedthis week that delays in the Philadelphia region were leavingsome waiting more than three weeks to receive letters and packages. The article noted that coronavirus cases among postal workers have been a contributing factor, leaving many routes without a regular orsubstitute carrier. With elections coming up and more people planning to vote by mail due to the pandemic, advocates worry the delays could mean ballots will not get to voters or polling places on time. Andsome havesuggested this could be intentional.“We have an under fundedstate and local electionsystem and a deliberateslowdown in the Postal Service,” Wendy Fields, the executive director of the Democracy Initiative,toldthe New York Times last week. Trump,she claimed, was “deliberately orchestratingsuppression and using the post office as a tool to do it.”For his part, Trump hasseized on the challenges the Postal Service is facing as an argument against allowing voting by mail at all. Last week, Trumptweeteda video from a Georgia televisionstationshowing an experiment in which a reporter mailed hundreds of ballot-shaped envelopes to a post office box tosee how long it took them to arrive. Most, but not all, had arrived withinseveral days. The reporter observed that thesmall percentage that did not immediately arrive could represent an important portion of the vote in a close election. Trump then cited this “testing” as an example of why voting by mail in the 2020 elections would not work. “Mail-In Voting is already proving to be a catastrophic disaster,” he claimed. On Monday, he argued against Nevada’s new law mandating that every registered voter automatically receive a ballot in the mail for the November election,tweetingthat the “Post Office could never handle the Traffic of Mail-In Votes without preparation.”This week, House Oversight Committee chair Carolyn MaloneyaskedDeJoy to testify next month about “recent changes to US Postal Service operations andstandards and the need for on-time mail delivery during the ongoing pandemic and upcoming election.” Hereportedlyagreed to doso. In an email, a US Postal Servicespokesperson wrote that the agency is in financial trouble and that “Congress and the Postal Regulatory Commission must enact legislative and regulatory reforms to help address thesituation. At thesame time, it is imperative for the Postal Service to operate efficiently and effectively, while continuing to provideservice that meets the needs of our customers.”Thestatement noted that “the Postal Service remains fully committed to fulfilling our role in the electoral process when public policy makers choose to utilize the mail as a part of their electionsystem, and to delivering Election Mail in a timely manner consistent with our operationalstandards.“To be clear however, and despite any assertions to the contrary, we are notslowing down Election Mail or any other mail,” thestatement continued. “Instead, we continue to employ a robust and proven process to ensure proper handling of all Election Mail consistent with ourstandards.”It concluded by noting that “the notion that the Postmaster General makes decisions concerning the Postal Service at the direction of the President is wholly misplaced and off-base.”Published with permission of The American Independent Foundation. On Tuesday, Vice President Kamala Harris called on Georgia voting rights advocates and elected officials to continue to fight for expanded access to the ballot box as the election cycle gears up for this November’s presidential election. The 10 Wisconsin Republicans who posed as electors for President Donald Trump in 2020 even though he had lost the electionsettled a lawsuit against them Wednesday, acknowledging their actions were part of an effort to overturn the election results. Last week, New Hampshire’s Supreme Court followedsuit. In a 3-2 decision, the court found that thestate’s courts also do not have the authority to overturn legislative maps accused of partisan gerrymandering.",1,1,American Independent

107,Serbia’s Protests Aren’t the Beginning of a Balkan Spring,4.25,35.0,https://foreignpolicy.com/2019/03/19/serbias-protests-arent-the-beginning-of-a-balkan-spring-vucic-stefanovic-protests-belgrade/,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-policy-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,25,"BELGRADE, Serbia—Over the past three months, the residents of Belgrade have developed a new weekly ritual: Every Saturday evening, thousands of them gather near Republic Square in the center of the city for a protest march against the political violence, democratic backsliding, and deterioration of media freedoms that have become widespread under the current government and its autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic. BELGRADE, Serbia—Over the past three months, the residents of Belgrade have developed a new weekly ritual: Every Saturday evening, thousands of them gather near Republic Square in the center of the city for a protest march against the political violence, democratic backsliding, and deterioration of media freedoms that have become widespread under the current government and its autocratic president, Aleksandar Vucic. The protests, whichstarted on December 8 last year, havespread toseveral dozen cities across Serbia and have even inspiredsimilar protests in Albania and Montenegro, where activists have risen up against their own crooked political classes. Last Saturday, on March 16, the demonstrations reached a new crescendo when protesters and opposition leaders in Belgradestormed the headquarters ofstate broadcaster Radio Television Serbia, which led to their forced removal by riot police. Thatsame night in Albania, protesters lobbedstones and clashed with police in front of the parliament building in Tirana. This blossoming of dissent has ledsome to wonder if this might be the beginning of a “Balkan Spring.”In Serbia, the protests weretriggered by the beating of Borko Stefanovic, an opposition politician and leader of the Serbian Left party, in thesouthern city of Krusevac on November 23, 2018, where he was left bloodied and hospitalized after being assaulted by a group of assailants wielding blunt objects. The following day, one of Stefanovic’s allies, Dragan Djilas, told reporters that Vucic was “the main culprit” behind the assault. The first demonstration was held in Krusevac a week later under the banner of “Stop the Bloody Shirts” and was organized by the Alliance for Serbia, a coalition of various opposition parties that includes the Serbian Left andspans the entire breadth of the country’s politicalspectrum. The inaugural Belgrade protest took place the following weekend and was organized independently of the opposition alliance by a group ofstudents from the University of Political Sciences. The assault on Stefanovic might have been thespark that lit the fuse, but the protesters took aim at a much greater foe than his attackers: Their target was the government in its entirety and Vucic himself, whom they blame for the deteriorating political conditions in the country. The protesters elicited a typically pigheaded response from the president, who claimed that he would not give into their demands, “even if there were 5 million people in thestreets.” This was quickly adopted as theirslogan: “One in 5 Million”. Although temperatures in the Balkans are rising, neither budding flowers nor mass protestsshould be mistaken for the beginning of a Balkan Spring modeled on the revolutions that rocked the Arab world in 2011. Vucic has, lest we forget,seen out mass protests before, following his 2017 presidential election victory, when he finished 38 points ahead of his nearest competitor. For nearly two full months, citizens took to thestreet on an almost daily basis to protest “against the dictatorship,” as they called it. By the end of May the demonstrations had largelyfizzledout. The protesters opposed Vucic and his hegemonic rule, but they could offer no alternative. Only one opposition figure, the former ombudsman Sasa Jankovic, won more votes thanaspoof candidate who promised to build Serbia a coastline. Then, like now, the protesters lacked aseriousstrategy that would allow them to achieve their aims. They could mobilize a crowd, but they lacked a clearly defined path to victory, and it was inevitable that this aimlessness would eventually cause them to run out ofsteam. Today’s protesters have improved on their 2017 predecessors bysetting outseveral concrete demands: They’ve called for the resignations of the interior minister, Nebojsa Stefanovic (a right-hand man Vucic frequently uses as an attack dog in public debates), and the health minister, Zlatibor Loncar (who allowed Vucic to pose for a hospital ward photo-op with critically ill children during a flu epidemic without wearing the appropriate medical attire and, critics allege, putting the children’s health at risk), as well ast wosenior figures at Radio Television Serbia, which is often accused of being a government mouthpiece. Protesters have also called for convictions in the unsolved 2018 assassination of Oliver Ivanovic, a Kosovo Serb politician and outspoken Vucic critic who had been a thorn in theside of the government, particularly when it came to denouncing organized crime. But it’sstill unclear how they plan to extract these concessions. The protesters’ main problem is that they’re unable to apply any political pressure on the government by rallying around a candidate that might threaten Vucic’sstranglehold on national politics. Although the Alliance for Serbia has tried its hardest to attach itself to the protests, the weekly demonstrations aren’t formally affiliated with anysingle opposition party or political figure. The entirety of the anti-Vucic ideologicalspectrum is represented—fromstudent Marxists to Bosko Obradovic, the ultranationalist leader of Dveri, a far-right opposition party of religious conservatives—sometimes causingscuffles among the protesters. This highlights the fragmented and impotent nature of the Serbian opposition, which is united by its opposition to Vucic but unable to agree on much else. The anti-Vucic movement is also hamstrung by the fact that all the opposition alternatives are deeply divisive and unpopular. The aforementioned Obradovic is a homo ph obe whose party opposes EU membership and wants to orientate the country towards Russia. In the 2017 election, Obradovic took 2.28 percent of the vote—four times less than thespoof candidate, Ljubisa “Beli” Preletacevic (a pseudonym for Luka Maksimovic who campaigned in character as Beli). Dveri currently holds the presidency of the Alliance for Serbia. The coalition was founded by Djilas, Belgrade’s former mayor and a key figure in the discredited Democratic Party that dominated Serbian politics between the overthrow of Milosevic and Vucic’s breakthrough 12 years later. Djilas, like other Democratic Party top brass, is widely perceived to have used his time in office to enrich himself by advancing his private business interests. Borko Stefanovic, whose beating triggered the protests, is also a Democratic Party alumnus. Heserved as chief negotiator in the 2008sale ofstate petroleum company, Naftna Industrija Srbije (NIS), to Russia’s Gazprom Neft. The deal caused outrage for its closed tendering process and a finalsale price that came out to only a fifth of NIS’s market value at the time. Manysee it as a prime example of the crooked privatizations that followed Yugoslavia’s disintegration—and Vucic’s government launched an investigation into thesale in 2014. It’s deeply ironic and profoundly cynical thatsomeone involved in the hawking ofstate assets now leads a party that bills itself as “Left.” Borko Stefanovic and hissometime Democratic Party colleagues need toshouldersome of the blame for the country’s current political malaise, because it was their failures in office that drove a disillusioned electorate into the arms of Vucic’s party. This considered, itshould come as littlesurprise that the Serbian electorate remains unconvinced by the alternatives. My own grandfather is a reluctant Vucic voter who frequently complains about cuts to his pension. When I ask him why he continues to back the ruling Progressive Party, he responds with ashrug: “Who else am I going to vote for? Djilas? As if the opposition is any better.”This cuts to the heart of Serbia’s political malaise:It’s not that Vucic and his party are widely adored but, unlike the opposition, they have yet to experience aself-inflicted fall from grace. In contrast to their opponents, theystill have political capital tospend. Until this changes, protesters willstruggle to rally thesort of mass mobilization that finally pushed Milosevic out of power in 2000. At the moment, no one is able to present a radically different vision for the country. The Alliance for Serbia published a “30-point”political program, but two-thirds of these points are justsingle-lineslogans. There is no Serbian Jeremy Corbyn or Bernie Sanders who can convincingly pledge to transform the country’s politics. Centrists can promise a freer media and less political violence, but for most people these are relatively minor tweaks to thestatus quo. Their mainselling point is that they’re not Vucic. No candidate can realistically offersubstantially better livingstandards because Serbia’s problems—an aging population, brain drain, poverty, corruption, astagnant and left-behind economy that’s ill-equipped for the 21st century—predate the current government. Serbia’s neighbors, even ones that hold EU membership, like Croatia and Bulgaria, all facesimilar challenges. This would remain constant even if Vucic were to be deposed, and most voters understand that, which dents the opposition’s draw. The president’s domination over political life in Serbia also distracts from a much deeper rot in the country’s politicalsystem. Serbian politicians frequentlyswitch parties. There have been more than500 defectionssince the 2016 local elections, andsome 45 percent of these have crossed over to Vucic’s Progressive Party. Smaller parties, like the Socialist Party of Serbia, repeatedly act as king makers in coalition talks, an arrangement that allows their politicians to remain in government in perpetuity. Ivica Dacic, the current foreign minister, is a prime example: a key figure in the Socialist partysince the early 1990s, his closeness to Slobodan Milosevic earned him the nickname “Little Sloba.” Before taking up his current position, heserved as both interior minister and prime minister in just the last decade alone. Dacic is hardly an isolated example: Zorana Mihajlovic, Maja Gojkovic, and Aleksandar Vulin are just three prominent government figures withsimilar resumes. This creates a malignsort of continuity in which each new government contains remnants of the one that preceded it,such that nothing everseems to change. Even if Vucic were tostep down, many of his cronies would remain insome capacity, ready to build upon his troubling political blueprint. This is why any talk of a Balkan Springshould be taken with a pinch ofsalt. There is no panacea that will end the country’s malaise, and meaningful, lasting change will only be achieved through a complete and total overhaul of Serbia’s institutions and political culture. Deposing Vucic might be the firststep toward achieving this aim, but the challenges that follow would be much greater. The protestersshould bear that in mind, otherwise this latest wave of demonstrations will amount to nothing more than a brief gust of warm wind in Serbia’s long post-Yugoslav freeze.

Early in the debate, he went to the “Liar Liar, Pants on Fire” offense, repeating multiple times that Mr. Trump was lying. Mr. Biden referred to the president as “this clown” at least twice. He also resorted to theschoolyard mantra of “Will youshut up, man?”The last person who tried to get down and dirty with Mr. Trump in a debate was Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida during the Republican primaryseason in the 2016 election. Mr. Rubio’s publicstanding was permanently damaged by the exchange. Itseems that while people accept Trump being Trump, theystill expect a higher level of discourse from other politicians. Mr. Rubio failed, and it torpedoed his candidacy. Mr. Biden’s insults didn’t do much to help him, either. The former vice president’s biggest problem, however, was that hespent most of the eveningsowing theseeds of mistrust. Not just mistrust in Mr. Trump, the electorate would expect that. Throughout the evening, Mr. Biden expressed distrust in a wide variety of groups and institutions. He indicated he didn’t trust the CDC in handling the coronavirus pandemic. He was clear that he doesn’t trust Johnson & Johnson or the other private entities to create asafe and effective vaccine against the coronavirus. Mr. Biden doesn’t trust a constitutionally assembled US Supreme Court to render decisions on Obamacare, the 2020 election or apparently any other legal issue. Mr. Biden doesn’t trust private insurance companies to provide health care options to the American public. Perhaps the most alarming issue he raised was why kids are back inschool. During the discussion on COVID-19, Mr. Biden literally asked the question, “Why areschools open?” Thesimple answer comes directly from the CDC Theirstatisticsshow that 99.98% of Americans under the age of 18survive the coronavirus with little or no ill effects. To clarify, that is 99.98% of those who have been infected, not of the population at large. The total population numbers are even more impressive. The point is thatschools are open because kids aren’t dying in anystatisticallysignificant number. The fact Mr. Biden doesn’t know that and apparently wants toshutschools down again is very disconcerting. As a bonus Mr. Biden also indicated he doesn’t trust White America at large. “People have to be made aware” hesaid, that Whites are inherently racist andsociety reeks of injustice. Great. Mr. Bidensupports a government education program that will instruct all of us what to do and what to think. Stalin would be proud. One of the more perplexing Bidenstatements came when he wasspeaking of law enforcement and emphasized he was quitesure Americasuffers fromsystematic injustice. In the very nextsentence, the former veepsaid the vast majority of police are good, decent, hardworking people. So which is it? Is law enforcement the home ofsystematic injustice, or are the people who make up thatsystem good and decent? It can’t be both. During a discussion on the Supreme Court, debate moderator Chris Wallace asked Mr. Biden if hesupported the idea of expanding thesize of the Supreme Court and thus giving himself four lifetime appointments of justices. Mr. Biden’s answer? “Whatever position I take, that will become the issue,so I will not answer the question.” Of course, his position is an issue. Apparently, one more group Mr. Biden doesn’t trust is the voting public. He doesn’t believe votersshould hear his position on what would be the mostsignificant change to the high court in US history. He doesn’t trust you to hear his words and decide for yourself if you agree. Let’s review:Mr. Biden does not trust the CDC Mr. does not trust the pharmaceutical companies to make asafe and effective vaccine. Mr. Biden does not trust the Supreme Court. Mr. Biden does not trust you to choose your own health insurance. Mr. Biden doesn’t trust publicschoolsshould be open. Mr. Biden doesn’t trust you to understand Whitesupremacy and White privilege,so he’ll educate all of us. Mr. Biden doesn’t trust the police. Mr. Biden doesn’t trust voters to hear his opinion on matters of importanceso hesimply won’tshare it. All of that in 90 minutes. Mr. Biden didn’t outline action plans during the debate but insteadspent virtually all of his timesowing theseeds of mistrust and fear. He would rather burn down our institutions and create chaos than run for electionstanding for anything. The content of the former vice president’s debate was embarrassingly bad. Can you tag Mr. Trump with the “rude” label for all his interruptions? Yes. You can also assign him one other label from the first debate: the winner.

112,What will cable news do without President Trump?,-11.67,40.0,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/what-will-cable-news-do-without-president-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,24,"Greetings fromstormy StreetPetersburg, Florida. Tropical Storm Eta rolled through the Tampa Bay area as I was writing this newsletter,so hopefully the words aren’t blowing off thescreen. A tropicalstorm and Christmas music on the radio at thesame time? Yep, it’s 2020. There’s no question that President Donald Trump has been a ratings booster for cable TV news. Fox News, CNN and MSNBC are enjoyingsome of their best ratings ever. To be clear, there are other factors for why folks are interested in the news these days, including a once-in-a-hundred year pandemic. It alsoshould be noted that on a good night, the big three cable news networks draw fewer than 15 million viewers in prime time — decent for TV, but a pretty low number compared to the overall population. Still, the Trump presidency has been good for business. He tweets. He rants. He raves. And the cable news outlets eat it up. But, Variety’s Brian Steinberg writes, “There’s palpable concern thespotlight may fade with the departure of President Donald Trump and the arrival of President-elect Joe Biden.”So what will happen when Trump is no longer president?There are different theories. One is that interest in the news will remain high,so even with a Biden presidency, ratings will continue to thrive. Plus, the major newsstory — coronavirus — will remain astory that Americans must follow, perhaps for another year, if not longer. But as far as politics and the White House, the cable news outlets mightsee a drop in viewership. In a recent earnings call, Fox Corporation CEO Lachlan Murdochsaid, “I would expect as we enter a more normal news cycle, which has to happen eventually, that appetite for news willshift back to appetite for the great American pastimes of watching football, and watching baseball, and watching ‘The Masked Singer’ or ‘I Can See Your Voice,’ and we look forward to thatshift.”A “more normal news cycle” would mean no coronavirus and a president who isn’t constantly elbowing his way into the news cycle. Lachlan, however, thinks Fox News will continue to lead in cable news viewership.“What we aim to control isshare,” Murdochsaid on the earnings call. “And Istrongly believe and we’veseen this through, I think, now 18 years, off the top of my head, of different administrations and different political cycles, we’ve maintained our Number 1 position through all of that. … So the news cycle will moderate. We fully expect to be Number 1 and maintainshare through that.”That, perhaps, is true. There is plenty ofspeculation about what will happen to Fox News, a favorite among conservatives and right-leaning viewers. On one hand, maybe a Biden presidency isn’t the worst thing ever. Primetime punditssuch as Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham can rail on Biden and his policies for the next four years. Complaining about Biden might be better programming than had Trump remained president with no election on the horizon. On the other hand, Trumpsupporters might quickly grow tired of being reminded every night that their favorite president did not win the election — and complaining about the other guy willsoon grow old. Think of it like fans of asports team. They can complain about a loss onsports-talk radio right after the game, but they don’t want to keep harping on it for weeks and months on end. After a while, it just becomes depressing. There are other wrinkles to consider. Might Trumpstart his own network or throw hissupport behind a placesuch as OAN? Is CNN boss Jeff Zucker going to leave CNN and what might that mean?But let’s also give credit to the cable news networks. They are run bysmart people and have charismatic prime time personalities. We can assume they adjust what they have to attract viewers. And, hey, 2024 isn’t that far away. The New York Times building. (mpi43/MediaPunch /IPX)There are many reasons why The New York Times issuch an outstanding news organization. But here’s a perfect example of what makes themso good. With all this talk about election fraud coming from the White House, The New York Times rolled up itssleeves, picked up the phone and went to work. The headlinesays it all:“The Times Called Officials in Every State: No Evidence of Voter Fraud.”The Times’ Nick Corasaniti, Reid J Epstein and Jim Rutenberg wrote, “… top election officials across the countrysaid in interviews andstatements that the process had been a remarkablesuccess despite record turnout and the complications of a dangerous pandemic.”They also wrote, “The New York Times contacted the offices of the top election officials in everystate on Monday and Tuesday to ask whether theysuspected or had evidence of illegal voting. Officials in 45states responded directly to The Times. For four of the remainingstates, The Timesspoke to otherstatewide officials or found public comments fromsecretaries ofstate; none reported any major voting issues.”Jeffrey Toobin (Photo: PGDC/MediaPunch /IPX)Jeffrey Toobin has been fired from The New Yorker. During a video call last month withstaffers of The New Yorker and WNYC radio, Toobin reportedly exposed himself. Following an investigation, Conde Nast, which owns The New Yorker, announced Wednesday that he has been let go. In a memo tostaff reviewed by The New York Times, Conde Nast’s chief people officer, Stan Duncan,said, “I want to assure everyone that we take workplace mattersseriously. We are committed to fostering an environment where everyone feels respected and upholds ourstandards of conduct.”Toobin announced his firing on Twitter, writing, “I was fired today by @NewYorker after 27 years as a Staff Writer. I will always love the magazine, will miss my colleagues, and will look forward to reading their work.”Toobin also has beensuspended from his job and is on leave as a legal analyst for CNN Looking for an expertsource?

Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue of Georgia called on thestate’ssecretary ofstate to resign, citing “failures” in the election process. However, they did not offer anyspecific evidence tosupport their claims. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution pushed back hard, doingsomething pretty much unheard of. It put an editorial above the front-page banner. You cansee what it looked like by clicking here. The AJC editorial read, “Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue have assaulted Georgia’s electionsystem. That is dangerous behavior, both for thisstate and for the nation. Speaking on the record, Purdue and Loeffler offered nospecifics. And that is what makes their campaign-speak attack messageso unacceptable. Georgians are wise enough to recognize these antics. And Purdue, Loeffler and othersshould know better.”NBC News’ Andrea Mitchellspeaks with former Defense Secretary William Cohen on Wednesday. (Photo courtesy of NBC News.)Why is itso important that President Donald Trump concede the election and that a transition to President-elect Joe Biden gets underway? Here’s a helpful quick explainer from MSNBC’s Katy Tur, whosaid this on hershow Wednesday:“They do have the benefit of Biden previously being in the White House and knowingsome of the lay of the land. But I was talking to asenior administration official who was telling me that part of the big problem is not that Biden knows what he’s doing, it’s that they can’t look at the various agencies,see how they arestaffed and who needs to be plugged in. They also can’tstart the process of the nationalsecurity background checks, which can take a long time. So thatshould be unnerving for any American who wants tosee aseamless transition of power.”Tur asked Associated Press White House reporter Jonathan Lemire how much longersenior White House officials will continue “soothing the president” before pushing Trump to concede and begin a transition.“This is important,” Lemiresaid. “Thisshouldn’t just be aboutsoothing the hurt feelings of a president who lost. … Nationalsecurity is atstake here. There is asurging, out-of-control pandemic in manystates right now. And (Trump’s refusal to concede) isslowing everything down, not handing over the keys,so tospeak.”Lemiresaidsources he talked tosaid this can’t go on forever, but they don’tsee it ending anytimesoon. It could end after Thanksgiving or maybe not even until the electoral college meets in mid-December. Meanwhile, on MSNBC’s “Andrea Mitchell Reports,” former Defense Secretary William Cohen called Trump’s refusal to concede “completely inappropriate … reckless and it’s consistent with how Donald Trump has conducted the presidency.”He added, “When you don’t help the incoming administration protect the country then you have failed in your duty. You have failed royally, if I can use the word royal, because the president wants to act like a royal, that everyone else is in his court and they must pay obeisance and pay tribute to him.”MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki talks with Savannah Sellers. (Photo: courtesy of NBC News.)One of thestars of election week TV coverage was CNN’s John King, whospent most of the week on his feet and wearing out CNN’s Magic Wall. My Poynter colleague Amaris Castillo caught up with King for a good Q&Athat youshould check out. King told Castillo, “I am a mix of exhausted and excited. The election results are clear, but there isso much news and uncertainty — from the Trump refusal to concede to the continued counting of ballots to the Biden transition launch and the horrific COVIDsurge. Sosleep has to wait a bit longer. That’s OK It is a dramatic newsstory and at a very consequential moment,so this is why we do this — andsleep and rest can wait.”John King wasn’t the only big boardstar during election week. How about MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki?NBC News’ Savannah Sellers went to the big board to get the lowdown from Kornacki, including questions for Kornacki from Chrissy Teigen. The most pressing questions?Gabriel Escobar has been named top editor at The Philadelphia Inquirer. Escobar had been editor and vice president —second in charge in the newsroom —since 2017. The Philadelphia Inquirer’s Anna Orso and Jesenia De Moya Correa wrote about Escobar: “A former foreign correspondent, he is respected inside and outside The Inquirer as askilled journalist and an even-keeled manager, as well as a deep listener always armed with a notepad.”Escobar replaces executive editor Stan Wischnowski, who resigned in June after a controversial headline — “Buildings Matter, Too” — in the wake of protests about race. That headline led to the Inquirer doingsomesoul-searching about the culture in its newsroom and how it covers issues involving race. After Wischnowski resigned, Inquirer Publisher and CEO Lisa Hughessaid the company would conduct a nationalsearch to replace him, according to the Inquirer. Butshestayed in-house by naming Escobar. She told The Inquirer that Escobar is “aseasoned leader who embodies our values, embraces oursharedstrategy, and understands the diversity of the communities weserve.”The Inquirer wrote, “Escobar, who was born in Colombia, will be one of the highest-ranking Latinos at a US news organization.”Here’ssomething political and election junkies might enjoy. The Tampa Bay Times is hosting a video chat with journalists today at noon Eastern called “Election 2020: Where do we go from here?” The Times describes it as a “discussion about the election and what it means for our region,state and country.”If you want to listen in,click here.

Poynter’s media business experts dig into the causes — and effects. It is not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or makestuff up.

But when CNN’s Dana Bash asked Clegg, who is Facebook’s vice president of global affairs, about Haugen’s claims,specifically about how the company’s algorithms boosted content ahead of January 6, he gave a roundabout non-answer. Hesaid that if the company removed Facebook’s current algorithm, which amplifies posts with more “meaningfulsocial interactions,” that would perpetuate “more, not less, hatespeech, more, not less, misinformation.”Bash then put him on thespot: “My question isspecifically about January 6. Did the algorithms that are in place amplify pro-insurrection voices ahead of January 6th? Yes or no.” “I can’t give you a yes or no answer,” he finally conceded, before pivoting to argue that the responsibility for the insurrection was on “the people who broke the law.”Haugen, who has already testified before Congress, isset to go this Thursday before the Houseselect committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. She has filed numerous complaints to the Securities and Exchanges Commission alleging that Facebook “misled investors and the public about its role perpetuating misinformation and violent extremism relating to the 2020 election and January 6th insurrection.” She has also called for more oversight of thesocial media giant, though, as my colleague Ali Breland recentlyargued, even her proposals fallshort on thesort ofstructural overhaul Facebook needs.",1,1,Mother Jones

ByThe EditorsPublished onDecember 6, 2020•We’re told, over and over, from media outlets andsocial media platforms, that claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election are “baseless” and “unsubstantiated.” Twitter flags every article alleging voter fraud, and evenstories allegations of voter fraud. Hostile newsstories may even put “voter fraud” inscare quotes. Despite this relentless media campaign, there are nowscads of evidence of fraud. This evidence is far more robust than anything the media used to keep the Russia collusion hoax alive for years. And it’s far more robust than the uncorroborated and contradictory “evidence” the press used to try to destroy Brett Kavanaugh’s life. There was never any evidence, for instance, that Kavanaugh had even met Christine Blasey Ford. The most visuallysensational evidence of election fraud is the time codedsecurity video footage from the State Farm Arena in Georgia. Democratic counterssent home Republican poll watchers and members of the media, claiming there was going to be a break. But fourstayed behind, and later, when no one was watching, they appeared to pull cases of ballots from under a table (which one of them hadset up that morning) andstarted counting thousands of ballots, for hours. We havesworn affidavits from the Republicans that they were told to leave. And on the day in question (election day, November 3rd), the media reported that countingstopped at 10:30 pm. NEW: The election departmentsent the ballot counters at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta home at 10:30 p.m., Regina Waller, the Fulton County public affairs manager for elections, tells ABC News.— ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics)November 4, 2020This is a visual age, and there’s nothing likesecurity videoshowing what looks like nefarious behavior. But at the moment, we’restill groping for exact details. Some officials are denying anything untoward happened (as they would). Perhaps it isn’t what it appears to be. But press “debunkings” of thestory,so far, consist of quoting election officials — the very ones accused of incompetence — or claiming the containers holding the extra ballots weren’t “suitcases” but rather … ballot containers. Big deal. The fact that they’re even disputingsuch a trifle issuspicious. In any case, this is prima facie evidence. Of course, many observers fraud on election night. We all remember when vote counting inseveral battlegroundstatessuddenly paused. The media’s fishy explanations — a plumbing leak, vote counters needing tosleep, etc. — only confirmed thesuspicion. But the evidence goes far beyond fishysmells. The best evidence of electoral fraud is mostly in the form ofsworn affidavits and testimony from on-the-record eyewitnesses, whistleblowers, along with (often confirming)statistical analyses of events. Statistics can help us tell ifsome event is far more likely to happen by fraud than by chance, even if it can’t tell us how the fraud happened. Focus on this evidence. If juicy video evidence appears andstands up toscrutiny, fine. But don’t be distracted by eye-catching visuals. And don’tsuppose that a lack of video evidence means much if anything. Remember, murders happen every day. We almost never have video of them happening. Finally, beskeptical of everything. Ifsome Democrats committed fraud in the November election, they would besmart enough to anticipatesome of this would be detected. Thus, they would besmart enough toseedsocial media withsensational examples of fraud that they know conservatives would pass around and retweet. And then, when those were debunked, the comp licit media would use this to paper oversolid, but less catchy evidence. Here’s the reality: the media andsocial media aresuppressing and burying the best evidence. We’ve watched articles andstories get buried by Google in near-real time. Twitter and Facebook have been utterlyshameless in censoring and misdirecting users. You cansee the result of thissocial media “curating” by looking for relevantstories on Google, Bing, and Duck Duck Go. For instance, Google “Pennsylvania hearing on voter fraud.” (Google is by far the worst.) You’ll find many, many “stories” describing Trump cancelling his trip to the hearing, and “rambling” when he called in instead. Note how hard it is to find astraightforward newssummary of the content of the hearing. It’s almost like Google is trying to keep you from findingsuch information. Or, try toGooglethe excellentsummary ofsuspicious anomalies published recently in the US edition of the (UK). I’ll even give you the exact title of the piece: “Reasons why the 2020 election is deeply puzzling.” Note how long it takes for Google to provide a direct link the article itself (as opposed to recent pieces that make reference to the original, which Google hasn’t yet buried). If you didn’t have the exact title of the piece, you might as well besearching for a microscopic needle in the mother of all haystacks. Next, try thesamesearch atBing, for a different experience. For a real hoot,search for “the very best evidence of electoral fraud 2020” onseveral differentsearch engines. Another example: Search for the phrase “widespread election fraud.” The press has filled the infosphere with that word “widespread.” But of course, the best evidence is election fraud is highly in a handful of cities and counties dominated for decades by Democratic machine politics. One final example (we could do this all day): Search for “Donald Trump, electoral fraudspeech, December 2, 2020” on anysearch engine. Notice the relentless bias. Here’s one version of the video without a biased title (at least until YouTube pulls this version). Now multiply this experience withsearch engines ten thousand times to get asense of howsocial media and media in general have worked to bury evidence of electoral fraud. This is, in effect, an information propaganda campaign by virtually the entire establishment in control of the flow of information. But even without this media censorship, how does the average person discriminate between good and bad information? In the last few weeks, a ton of bogus and misguided claims have flooded the relevant channels. These aresticky and more likely to getshared on Twitter than moresolid but lesssensational information. And evensomesophisticatedstatistical analysis falls apart on closer inspection. As a result, it’s hard for most people to find reliablesources, and toseparate the wheat from the chaff. So, here’s a representativesample for the honest inquirer, who doesn’t have countless hours to research thesubject. (We’ll update this piece periodically,so you might want to bookmark it — especiallysince it will likely get buried or labeled onsocial media.)There’s really nosubstitute for watching the videos of thestate hearings themselves (links below), but this requires many hours and the testimony varies on quality. Short of that, at leastspend a few hours reading the following articles, includingsummaries of the hearings. If you do that, you’ll know more about the evidence of fraud than anyone that relies on their Twitter feed or CNN for information. You’ll also know that when media andsocial media tell you that fraud claims are baseless, they’re either lying or negligently uninformed.

118,Liz Cheney is heresy,-22.67,29.67,https://theweek.com/articles/981319/liz-cheneys-heresy,https://adfontesmedia.com/week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-07,24,"For years now, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) has been one of the most influential Republicans in Washington. Scion of one of the most powerful families in conservative politics,sheserved inseveral positions in the Bush administration and was elected as the House representative from Wyoming in 2016 — thesameseat her father held for many years. She then moved up to the third-ranking position in the House Republican caucus, and was widely assumed to have a bright future. But now her political career is coming to an end. She faces a primary challenge from the extreme right, and an upcoming vote backed by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy to kick her out of her leadership position. She is expected to lose in both cases, but even ifshe does not, it is clear her upward trajectory in Republican politics is over. Completely unscrupulous will to power and toadying fealty to Donald Trump are now mandatory preconditions for participating in conservative politics. It is important to be clear up front that Cheney has had an exceptionally monstrous career thus far. Her domestic policy record is the usual Bush-era mix ofsocial conservatism and total deference to the oligarch class, but her real passion is foreign policy. Just like her father,she is a bloodthirsty imperialist warmonger. After working insupport of the Bush administration is wars of aggression inside the administration,she founded a think tank to advocate for an invasion of Iran, and was constantly on conservative mediastoking frenzied bigotry against Muslims.

From our morning news briefing to a weekly Good News Newsletter, get the best of The Week delivered directly to your inbox. In officeshe has advocated relentless violence — indeed, one of her few quarrels with Trump' foreign policy was that hewas not belligerent enough, despite him hugely ramping up dronestrikes(and attendant civilian casualties) and his illegal assassination of a top Iranian official. She has also been a passionate defender of torture. A toll of800,000-plus dead in America is bungling, pointless imperialist crusade in the Middle East is apparently not enough for her. AsJohn Nichols points out at The Nation, prior to January 6 Cheney was a bitter partisan, known for telling hysterical lies about Democrats; while campaigning for Trump in 2019,shesaid Democrats were ""the party of anti-Semitism, the party of infanticide, the party ofsocialism."" She is more responsible than most for inflaming right-wing extremism. Thatsaid, when Trump attempted to overthrow the government and install himself as president-for-life with a putsch, Cheney turned against him. Shevoted to impeach him afterwards, and continued attacking his lie that the election had beenstolen. For a brief time after the putsch — when, let us remember, numerous GOPmembers of CongressandVice President Pencewere nearly lynched by the mob — that was an acceptable opinion for a Republican to have. It is no longer. Trump has reasserted complete control over the Republican Party, demanding (and receiving)slavish obedience to his will. In this he has the backing of the vast majority of the Republican base,some70 percent of whom believe his lie that Bidenstole the election. Cheney isstubborn refusal tosubmit to Trump is therefore heresy that must bestamped out. Now as her career goes down in flames, Cheney has written an op-edfor The Washington Post urging her fellow Republicans not to abandon democracy. ""Trump isseeking to unravel critical elements of our constitutionalstructure that make democracy work — confidence in the result of elections and the rule of law. No other American president has ever done this,""she writes. ""The Republican Party is at a turning point, and Republicans must decide whether we are going to choose truth and fidelity to the Constitution.""The effect of this argument on her fellow Republicans is a foregone conclusion. It will be angrily rejected — indeed, it likely increases the chancesshe will be purged from the party. One reason is thatshe is needed as ascapegoat to deflect from other Republicans' betrayal of Trump after the putsch. Asshe notes, McCarthy himselfsaid on January 13: ""The president bears responsibility for Wednesday’s attack on Congress by mob rioters. Heshould have immediately denounced the mob when hesaw what was unfolding."" What is more, McCarthy is reportedly worried he would be called to testify before theproposedJanuary 6 Commission about how he called Trump that day begging him to call off the mob. He would rather that episode be forgotten. Another reason is the character of Republican elites. They are ruthless in their quest for total power, but they can also be counted on to be utter cowards when it comes to confronting Trump or the right is other deranged media personalities. As oneRepublican official toldThe Washington Post in November after Trump refused to concede his loss, ""What is the downside for humoring him for this little bit of time?"" (AskCapitol Police officer Mike Fanoneabout that.) Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, after briefly criticizing Trump for the putsch, has thereafter clammed up about the former president to the point ofstudiously pretending not to hear Trump is constant personal insults — here fused to commentThursday on a Trumpstatement calling him ""gutless and clueless.""There was a moment, probably lasting no more than a few hours after the putsch, when Trump critics might have rounded up enough Republican votes in the Senate to convict Trump and prevent him from holding federal office ever again. This might have even been asmart political move — Cheney is likely calculating that given Trump isabysmal approval rating, the GOP would be better off ditching him and pretending his whole presidency never happened, as they did with Richard Nixon. But almost all the critics (including Democrats) chose to dither and procrastinate, which allowed Republicans to dose themselves up with right-wing propaganda and get back on the low road. Conservative media has gradually pivoted from downplaying or denying the Capitol putsch to outright defending it. The putschiststrategy of winning at any cost, regardless of votes, has become the overt GOP plan for upcoming elections. As my colleagueJoel Mathis writes, ""The insurrectionists have taken over the Republican Party.""So the choice Cheney outlines in her article has already been made. Republicans have chosen Trump over the Constitution, which they are plotting to overturn toset up one-party rule. If he runs in 2024, he almost certainly will get the nomination. Previous conservative policy dogma no longer matters in theslightest. As the conservative Club for Growthpoints out, Cheney is probablesuccessor, Elise Stefanik, has a much less orthodox voting record. But when it comes to licking Trump is wingtips, her record (like Trump isshoes)isspotless. Her political future, unlike Cheney is, is bright.",1,1,The Week

In a Sunday interview with Fox News’ Maria Bartiromo, Trump described Babbitt as an “innocent, wonderful, incredible woman”and once again demanded that the identity of theshooter be released.“People want to know [whoshot Ashli Babbitt] and why,”the former president claimed.

Trump, however, hassuggested that it was the“head ofsecurity”for a top Democrat who was behind Babbitt’s death. Bartiromo first brought up the“speculation,”and Trump confirmed he’s heard thesame things.“I have heard also that it was the head ofsecurity for a certain high official, a Democrat,”Trumpsaid.

The rewriting of January 6 is underway, and Democrats are doing little to push back against this Stalinist attempt to alter the historical record. leaving office, Trump has continued to hold rallies and release publicstatements on current events. He also recently joined a class action lawsuit against Facebook, Google, and Twitter,seeking to take away those platforms’ ability to discriminate against people based on political opinions. Trump’s political future, however, has been open tospeculation, with the president hinting multiple times that a 2024 presidential run could happen.

120,Portland’s Independent Police Review opens more than 40 investigations into alleged police misconduct at protests,0.33,49.0,https://www.oregonlive.com/portland/2020/08/portlands-independent-police-review-opens-more-than-40-investigations-into-alleged-police-misconduct-at-protests.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,25,"Portland’s independent police oversight body is investigating more than 40 complaints related to protest policingsince June, according to the director. The Independent Police Review’s quarterly report offers the first look at theswelling number of complaints against Portland police at the nightly protests. The city’s complaint process is the public’s main avenue to hold police accountable forspecific actionsThe report, which covers April, May and June, was released at a time when the future of the oversight office is in doubt. A proposal for a new oversightsystem was unanimously referred to the November 3 ballot by the City Council at the end of July. The vast majority of the Independent Police Review investigations are related to allegations of unnecessary force by police at the protests, director Ross Caldwellsaid. The office also hassome open complaints about the general conduct of officers interacting with Portlanders at protests. Protests against police brutality andsystemic racism began in Portland in late May after George Floyd died when a police officer knelt on his neck for more than eight minutes. The protests have routinely drawn hundreds, andsometimes thousands of people. The protests quickly became a flash point between police and protesters. Some protestersscrawled graffiti, broke windows and threw things at officerson May 29. The night culminated in forceful dispersals by police aftersome protesters looted luxurystores and a Target, and lit a fire inside of an office at the downtown Justice Center. The city responded withseveral days of curfews and much-criticized tactics of hitting Portlanders with batons and deploying tear gas, pepperspray,stun grenades, impact munitions and an ear-splitting warningsound that caught other demonstrators and journalists in the middle. Police have continued to use forcesince the early days of protest, as have protesters continued to tag buildings with graffiti and throw various objects at officers, including water bottles, eggs and fireworks. Federal judges have barred or limited use of many of the tacticsunless policesay they believe life or publicsafety are at risk. Police have more recently used batons and lines of officers to push people back at protests and occasionally,used tear gas and munitions after declaring civil disturbances. Portland’s Citizen Review Committee, an advisory body to Portland police and the Independent Police Review condemned the police tactics in a Junestatement.“While these demonstrations are first and foremost about the worth of Black lives, the response to them is also illuminating a troubling pattern of police violence against protesters that interferes with publicsafety and freedom ofspeech,” thestatementsaid. Sgt. Brent Maxey, an 18-year veteran of Portland police,told KGW in an interview last Thursdaythat people who are not engaging in unlawful conduct have beensubjected to force by Portland police at protests. In June alone, the office received 185such complaints, more than in March, April and May combined. At least 113 of those contacts were “directly related to protest activity,” according to the quarterly report. Some of those complaints were about thesame incident, Caldwellsaid. While the Independent Police Review averaged 6.3 “intake investigations” a day in April and May, that number jumped to 22.5 a day in June, the reportsays. While intake investigations are preliminary to assess if the group wants to move forward, Caldwellsaid the 14-day process includes interviewing people who filed complaints, pulling police reports and identifying involved officers. The Independent Police Review investigations represent a fraction of the thousands of complaints filedsince the protests began. Many of those complaints were form letters listing demands the Independent Police Review has no power to enact, like abolishing the Portland Police Bureau, Caldwellsaid. The office also has a narrow definition of what it can investigate. Complaints related to the conduct of officers who work for agencies assisting Portland police are forwarded to the employing agency, although none have an equivalent oversight body. Caldwellsaid many of the forwarded complaints were about federal officersand theMultnomah County Sheriff’s Office. While Caldwellsaid people filing complaints havestruggled to identify officers or their agencies at times, hesaid the investigators often pinpoint the information after reviewing reports and protest footage. Caldwellsaid his office can only investigate community allegations that Portland police officers have violated bureau directives. Thesharp increase in protest-related complaints along with others unrelated to protests, drastically increased the oversight body’s workload, Caldwellsaid. Floyd’s killing, “combined with the numerous killings of Black people by police that came both before and after, exposed previously unaware community members to the inequities built into thesystem and galvanized an already passionate, vocal population into takingsustained action,” the reportsays. The report called forsystemic change and increased accountability tostrengthen the currentsystem. Independent Police Review, which is housed in the city auditor’s office, lacks direct access to reports from police, further complicating its ability to investigate police actions. While the office has a voting member on the board that recommends disciplinary actions, the chief of police and Mayor Ted Wheeler, whoserves as the police commissioner, have the finalsay. However, the police union can challenge discipline to astate arbitrator, who has the power to overturn it.“Police oversight in Portland needs thesupport of its leaders, policymakers and the community to better address the barriers to full transparency, independence and authority necessary for any oversightsystem to flourish,” the reportsays. State law and the police union agreement limits what information about investigations the Independent Police Review can turn over to the public.“These two constraints mean few cases are ever made public, and when they are it creates the opportunity for an arbitrator to overturn the decision if they conclude the disclosure violated the labor contract,” the reportsays.-- K Rambokrambo@oregonian.com@k_rambo_Subscribe to Oregonian/OregonLivenewslettersandpodcastsfor the latest news and topstories.",2,2,The Oregonian
121,Democrats Keep These Inconvenient Facts From Constituents,15.67,30.67,https://www.dailysignal.com/2021/04/02/fight-left-wing-lies-with-facts-democrats/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-signal-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-02,25,"A couple of years ago, I gave aspeech before a conservative, predominantly white audience. I couldn’t help but notice a tall, heavyset black man, arms folded,standing in the back. From time to time, I would look at him, only tosee him frown andshake his head, I assumed disapprovingly, when I made what I considered important points. After thespeech, he came up to me. “I am angry,” hesaid. “Not at you—at myself. I thought I was well-informed. I read the news. I watch the news. I nowsee I’ve been manipulated by the party that I voted for all my life.”He then ticked offsome of the points I made in myspeech that hesaidsurprised or evenshocked him. Hesaid he had no idea that (according to a 2004 Thomas B Fordham Institutestudy) 44% of Philadelphia publicschool teacherssend their ownschool-age kids to privateschool. Yet the Democratic Party adamantly opposesschool vouchers, which would give K-12 children of urban parents a chance at a betterschool. He did not know that Democrats, including President Barack Obama, tried to end the Washington, DC,Opportunity Scholarship Program. It is a lottery that allows fortunate parents to opt out of their local publicschool for a better privateschool. The program isso popular that there are far more parents who want to participate than there areseats.“What’s more important, ” he asked me, “than makingsure are kids arewell-educated?”He did not know that, in 1965, 25% of black kids were born outside of wedlock, versus 70% today, a phenomenon that cannot be attributed toslavery and Jim Crow. He did not know that Obama oncesaid, “Children who grow upwith out a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out ofschools, and 20 times more likely to end up in prison.”Hesaid he was unaware that out of the approximately 390,000slave owners in 1860, no more than a “handful” were Republican, according to conservative Dinesh D’Souza. He did not know that more Republicans, as a percentage of their party, voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 than did Democrats. Nor did he know that more Republicans, as a percentage of their party, voted for the Voting Rights Act of 1965 than did Democrats. He did not know that Democrats founded the Ku Klux Klan and that one of its goals was tostop thespread of the Republican Party. Hesaid he was unaware that, before 1938, when the first federal minimum wage law was enacted, a black teenager was likely to be employed than a white teenager. He did not know that, according to Harvard economist George Borjas, illegal immigration creates winners and losers. But the big losers are low- and unskilled American workers of color who compete against low- and unskilled illegal immigrant workers—who place downward pressure on the wages of the native-born. The man did not know that, according to The Washington Post, in recent years, more unarmed whites have been killed by the police than unarmed blacks. He was unaware ofstudies, including one by a black Harvard economist, that found the police more hesitant, more reluctant, to pull the trigger on a blacksuspect than on a whitesuspect. He did not know that, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, police killings of blacks declined almost 80% from the late ’60s through the 2010s, while police killings of whites have flatlined. He did not know that, about racism, then-Sen. Barack Obamasaid: “The previous generation, the Moses generation, pointed the way. They took us 90% of the way there. Westill got that 10% in order to cross over to the otherside.” This would be thesame Obama who, when he became president,said: “The legacy ofslavery, Jim Crow, discrimination in almost every institution of our lives—you know, that casts a longshadow. And that’sstill part of our DNA that’s passed on. We’re not cured of it.”According to MSNBC political analyst Steve Kornacki, 43,000 votes in just threestates would haveswitched the winner from Joe Biden to Donald Trump. This means all Republicans need to do is change the minds of asmall percentage of the electorate. The man at myspeech proves this is more than doable. DISTRIBUTED BYCREATORS. COM",1,0,Daily Signal
122,Will Armenia’s political turmoil undo its democracy?,0.0,43.0,https://www.newstatesman.com/world/middle-east/2021/03/will-armenia-s-political-turmoil-undo-its-democracy,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-statesman-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-08,16,"Armenia, thesmall country in the South Caucasus between Russia and Turkey, has been mired in political crisis for two weeks, after a group of army officialssigned a letter calling for Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan tostep down in what the country’s leader characterised as an “attempted military coup”. The context of the unrest is Armenia’s catastrophic defeat in ashort war against Azerbaijan late last year over the territory of Nagorno-Karabakh. Swathes of territory which had for three decades been governed as a de facto extension of Armenia were recaptured by Azerbaijani forces in astunning advance. (Shortly after the end of the war, I visited Azerbaijan andsome of its recently reconquered territories,reporting from the region for the.)The crushing defeatstruck at Armenia’ssense ofself. As Thomas de Waal, a fellow at Carnegie Europe, wrote in, his account of the conflict, for almost 30 years after the end of the Soviet Union, Armenia was no longer the “weeping nation” defined by the genocide of 1915. Rather, it had become a regional power, able to defeat its neighbour to claim land it considered rightfully its own. Until it wasn’t. It is nosurprise that last year’s defeat has roiled the country’s politics. Pashinyan, who toppled former president Serzh Sargsyan in a peaceful revolution in 2018, is blamed by many in the country for the loss of Nagorno-Karabakh. Azerbaijan’s President Ilham Aliyev has repeatedlycitedPashinyan’s provocativestatements, notably a fieryspeech made in August 2019saying that “Artsakh [the Armenian name for Nagorno-Karabakh] is Armenia, fullstop” – as a casus belli. Nor was the Armenian government honest with its populace during the war. Manybelievedthat Armenian forces were on the cusp of victory against Azerbaijan, right until the November night when Pashinyan appeared with Aliyev and Russian President Vladimir Putin tosign a cease fire deal containing crushing concessions. As a result, thesudden news of Armenia’ssurrendershook the country, leading to repercussions only now coming to the fore. The finalstraw was Pashinyan appearing to claim in February that a Russian-made missilesystem used by Armenian forces had proven ineffective. As the cease fire is underwritten by Russian peacekeepers, the unsubtle pronouncement went down badly with the military, wary of alienating Armenia’s patron, now more indispensable than ever. Yet evenso, the apparent attempted coup appears remarkably half-hearted. Itseems to have been limited to 40 orso army officerssigning a letter calling on Pashinyan to go. The military did not detain civilian officials orseize government buildings. The contrast between the ruthless efficiency oft he military coup in Myanmar, carried out by the country’s experienced and pitiless junta two weeks earlier, isstriking. Pashinyan has offered to callsnap elections, confident that he will retain power. Unusually, the opposition haveso far refused the offer unless the prime minister concedes power to a transitional authority, probably because most pollsshow him comfortably winning re-election, though his approval ratings have more than halved to around 30 per centsince he came to power. Pashinyan claims figures from the ancien régime heswept away three years ago are behind attempts to destabilise his leadership. Former leaders – widely perceived as corrupt – attempting to make a comeback not through elections but through coercion “shows how deep Armenia has fallen into chaos and uncertainty, bordering onstate collapse, following defeat in Karabakh,”says Hovhannes Nazaretyan, an Armenian journalist. Pashinyan’s coming to power in 2018 heralded remarkable liberalisation in Armenia, which, along with neighbouring Georgia, is now one of the only democracies in the region. The prime minister had harboured dreams of closer alignment with the West,shelved with the arrival of Russian peacekeepers. Most Armenians have no great fondness for Pashinyan but believe any plausible replacements would be worse. The outcome of this latest powerstruggle will determine the fate of Armenia’s fragile democracy for years to come. Related",1,1,New Statesman

It is part of The Democratic Squad is effort to put increasing pressure on Biden in his response in dealing the violence which has lasted 10 days and killed more than 200 people.

It is long past time to end the US policy of unconditional military armssales, particularly to governments that have violated human rights,' Ocasio-Cortez wrote in an email calling on her congressional colleagues tosupport her bill. Thesquad-backed resolution would halt the transfer andsale of Joint Direct Attack Munitions (JDAMs) and Small Diameter Bombs from the US to Israel. Both bombs are outfitted withspecial guidancesystems intended to hitspecific targets.

It is unlikely, however, that the resolution will pass the 51-member committee, which includes a number of pro-Israel legislators on bothsides of the political aisle. On Monday, a report from unnamedsources revealed the US approved a week before the conflict broke out a $735 million weapons deal that included the precision-guided missiles. Omar, the first Muslim woman elected to Congress and member of the Foreign Relations Committee, blasted the deal with Israel, who is a top recipient of US military aid.'It would be appalling for the Biden administration to go through with $735 million in precision-guided weaponry to Netanyahu without anystrings attached in the wake of escalating violence and attacks on civilians,' the Minnesota representative in astatement.'If this goes through this will beseen as a green light for continued escalation and will undercut any attempts at broker ing a ceasefire, ishe continued.

125,Biden is First 100 Days Have Been a Tale of Two Presidencies,-22.67,37.0,https://inthesetimes.com/article/biden-first-100-days-progressive-speech-congress-infrastructure-economy-war,https://adfontesmedia.com/in-these-times-bias-reliability/,2021-04-29,25,"As President Biden reaches the100-day mark of his first term, we can discern two prominent features of the new administration. The first is that, when it comes to non-defensespending in the federal budget and non-defense related appointments, progressives have been pleasantlysurprised. Biden’s Covid relief bill, the American Rescue Plan, included grow thin aslew ofsocial programs, from expanded unemployment insurance to a beefed-up child tax credit, direct temporary payments, and assistance for food and housing. The people advising Biden in the White House include Cecilia Rouse, Bharat Ramamurti, Jared Bernstein and Heather Boushey, who have demonstratedsupport for a progressive economic direction. And, the administration has beensubject to pressure from Democrats in the Senate on a variety of matters relating to foreign policy. Examples include pleas for relaxation of intellectual property rights that are hampering India’s ability to cope with an explosion of Covid-19cases, and calls to withdrawsupport for Saudi Arabia’sslaughter of Yemenis. That is not tosay Biden has yet to move much beyond the Obama administration, only that the pressure from Democrats is now coming from the left, not just the center. Before Biden took office, these developments might haveseemed less plausible in light of the narrowness of the Democrats’ majorities in both the House and the Senate, but that narrowness has proven to come withsome offsetting influences. Holding a razor thin majority in the Senate has promoted unity and discipline in the Democrats’ caucuses, which tend to afford centrist Democrats less leeway to perform their traditional rites of conservative independence. The fact that Republicans retainstrong institutionalsupport from the Supreme Court, Trump’s federal judges, the Electoral College and gerrymanderedstate legislatures has made the politicalstakes clear, illustrating that Democrats cannot afford to lose another election. This has helped motivate Biden’s party to undertake action that under other circumstances might have been written off as too bold or moving too fast. Yet despite theirstructural advantages, it’s also the case that Republicans have weakened their position in two ways. By indulging the riotous (and deeply discrediting) demonstration at the US Capitol on January6, as well as the patently absurd noises coming out of Reps. Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert and their co-thinkers, the GOP has proven itself a party more interested in extremism than governing. The otherself-inflicted wound is that, by indicating no interest at all in anysort of bipartisan deals on legislation, Republicans have just encouraged Democrats to go their own way. Why pretend toseek compromise with those who a) condone lunacy, or b) betray no interest in compromise?The upshot for progressives in all this has been a lot of goodstuff in the non-defense component of Biden’s federal budget, including the embrace of achildren’s allowance, and all manner of other initiatives in the name of pandemic relief and economicstimulus, with hardly a whisper about the formerly fearedspecter of the national debt. Biden’s proposed budget includes increases for education,socialservices,science and the environment. And his infrastructure proposals, theAmerican Jobs PlanandAmerican Families Plan, contain a host of progressive priorities, from investments in affordable housing to paid family leave. Theseshifts to the left haven’t been bornesolely out of a personal transformation by Biden. Rather, tireless organizing by progressive groups outside the halls of power has helped pull the administration toward bolder action, especially on issues around climate. And a leftward tilt within the Democratic caucus on economics, led by progressivessuch as Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, has helpedspur the administration’s openness to bigspending packages. The expansion of deficitspending tends to give rise to tight labor markets, which is thesource of upward pressure on wages. I’ve argued before that this is the most important issue in public policy. What does a tight labor market look like?It looks like employers complaining about an inability to attract job applicants. It looks like bosses offering people bonuses just toshow up for job interviews. Both of these dynamics are now coming into play. Workers of course need other help too, especially in the realm of union organizing rights as would be provided by thePRO Act, but this isstill a very good development. The openness to deficitspending reflects an important turn in thinking about economic policy. For those interested in the underlying, arcane theoretical issues involved, John Jay College Associate Professor of Economics Josh Mason wrote awell-regarded review of thesubject. In a nutshell, the new turn in policy reflects a de-emphasis on​“supply-side” factorssuch as labor force participation andsavings, towards more attention to the​“demandside,” whichsimply meansspending by households, governments and business firms. When the economy is below full employment — and it isstill way below it — morespending begetsstill morespending, along with employment. My qualification to the enthusiasm on the Left is that there has yet to be a parallel revolution in economic theory. As John Maynard Keynessaid in his landmark​“General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money,” economic theory from obscurescribblers eventually ends up in the mouths of those with actual responsibilities for policymaking —so it matters. For all the welcome empirical research by economists on the minimum wage, non-competitive labor market conditions, unionization and the absence of a link between deficitspending and inflation, there is no parallel rise of a theoretical leadership. The’ columnist Paul Krugman,scourge of Bernie Sanders’ presidential campaigns, ain’t it. He is often on progressives’side, but is usually bringing up the rear. Theso-called Modern Monetary Theory issuccessful as an academicschool of thought, but its tribunes have yet to be welcomed into the new administration. The vacuum in theoretical leadership means that in the future, we could again be plagued with thesame bad arguments about the perils of deficits. On foreign policy, the pickings for progressives areslimmer. In a recent interview, thinker Noam Chomsky, who has astrong reputation for being right about basically everything, described the current posture of the Biden administration as​“dangerous.”Two of the most important issues now facing the country are: re-entering the nuclear deal with Iran to prevent a nuclear catastrophe, and waging a full-court press on behalf of India and under-developed countries as theystruggle with thestill raging pandemic. While Biden has promised to reinstate the agreement with Iran, the administration appears to beslow walking the process, evidently for thesake of gainingsome advantage. The case for pressuring Iran on​“weapons of mass destruction” —shades of the Iraqi campaigns of the1990s carried out by another Democratic president — was always fallacious. The concern was never really over any threats to usesuch weapons against the USs, which would lead to Iran’s annihilation —something the Iranian government could not fail to understand. Rather, it has been about curbing Iran’s politicalsway in the region, for thesake of Israel and other US allies. Thesituation in India, with the virus rapidlyspreading and deathsskyrocketing, might be likened to a potential holocaust. Some might blanch at that expression, but when potentially tens of millions of lives are at risk due to policy misfeasance (Trump), malfeasance (the Modi regime), and nonfeasance (Biden), I fail tosee how the language could be toostrong. Former President Trump’s protectionist instincts led him to embrace policies that hampered exports of vaccines to countriessuch as India. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, meanwhile, hasheld mass ralliesshirking the need forsocial distancing, and his government has forced Twitterto censor criticism of his policies. Biden has beensusceptible to Trump’s vaccine hoarding impulses as well, though he has latelyshownsome flexibility, allowing theshipment of certain Covid-19treatments and materials to India. There isstill much more to do in the matter of intellectual property restrictions that constrain vaccine production and distribution outside of the USs. In our own hemisphere, the Biden administration hasshown astubborn insistence onsupporting an unelected leader of Venezuela, Juan Guaido, over the democratically elected President Nicolas Maduro. Biden’s movesso far alsoshow littlesign of a thaw in relations with Cuba, displayingsome retreat from the Obama administration. Still, there aresome glimmers of hope. Some action has been taken to curb Saudi Arabia’s bombardment of Yemen, though the administration could go further tostop the war. Biden announced a withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan (albeit by September). And there is theshift mentioned above in commitment to come to the aid of India, with Biden promising to deploy additionalsupplies to the country including therapeutics, test kits and ventilators. When it comes to Biden’s defense budget proposal, the fact that it includes an increase means it’s astep in the wrong direction. However, an increase of1.6% (as Biden proposes) is what advocates of non-defensespending describe as​“flat funding,” i.e. given expectations of modest inflation, it amounts to little or no real increase. What’s really at issue is not a misguided increase — it’s a failure to cut the defense budget. Then there’s the issue of immigration, where Biden has disappointed many progressives by failing to rescind all Trump-era restrictions, and not opening the border to more migrants, while also keeping the current brokensystem in place. Weshould expect more pressure on the administration to ramp up from activists in the coming months. In general, our narrow escape from the threat of a neo-fascist consolidation of power has,so far, brought greater returns than expected. It could hardly be otherwise. Democratic leaders would have to be fools to fail to realize that if they don’t deliver the goods, their party could be consigned to permanent minoritystatus. Similar collapses at thestate level would follow, and the USs would be a very different place. For now though, we havesomespace to breathe, even as more fights loom.

Rebecca Conway/Getty ImagesIn early April, Ashu Mahajan and his wife, Neha, got the bad news: Ashu’s father in India wassick with COVID-19. For days, Ashu and Neha kept tabs on him from New Jersey, but when he took a turn for the worse, Ashu decided to fly to India tosee him one last time. Nearly two weeks ago, Ashu arrived in India, and rushed to his father’s bedside tosay goodbye. His father passed away a few days later. Ashu was consumed by grief, yet he was also eager to get back to Neha and their nine- and 15-year-old daughters in the USs. But there’s a problem: He can’t. President Biden’s ban on travel from India began Tuesday night,so Ashu is effectivelystranded. Even before Ashu left, Nehasaidshe knew in her heart that her husband may have bought a one way ticket to India.“We both knew that this can get really, really bad for us,”shesaid. “Immigrant workers here in the USs of America, we’re all going through this dilemma—to take care of oursick parents in India, or tostay here just to makesure that our visastamping doesn’t expire,so that we don’t lose what we’ve built with all the hard work that we’ve done.”Technically, Ashushould be able to come home. President Biden’stravel ban, instituted amidskyrocketing cases of COVID-19 in India, isn’tsupposed to include US citizens, permanent residents, internationalstudents on visas, or Indians on non-immigrant work visassuch as H-1B who have children born in the USs. Ashu and Neha Mahajan with their two daughters in New JerseyNeha and Ashu MahajanAshu is in that last category, but a bureaucratic hurdlestands in his way: H-1B workers, whenever they leave the USs, have to get their visasstamped at a US consulate in their home country before they can return. But right now, all the consulates in India are closed because of the pandemic. “I heard about the travel exemption, but it doesn’t do anything for us,”said Neha, who is an advocate forskilled visa workers and an outreach manager at a law firm. What about those who need to get a visastamped but cannot get it as the consulates are closed? DOSshould restart visastamping within US like they did till 2004. Makes nosense to makesomeone travel to 🇮🇳 to get a visa when he is living in 🇺🇸 for 10+ years.— Anirban Das (@anirb_das)May 5, 2021Neha and Ashu aren’t the only ones whose family has beenseparated by the travel ban. While it’s hard to estimate the actual number of Indian H-1B visa holdersstuck in India, my reporting turned up dozens ofstories. Earlier this week, I joined a Telegram group on Indian visa holders with 20,000 members and asked how many were in thissituation. More than 200 people replied to my message on thesame day, though Indian advocatessay the number is likely to be in the higher hundreds or thousands. On Telegram, the heart-wrenchingstories just kept coming: a fatherseparated from his toddlerson. Children on dependent visas of H-1B holders unable to get their visasstamped and return toschool. Pregnant women who couldn’t get their visa on time and had to deliver in India in the middle of a pandemic. A fiancé who flew for his wedding and isstuck. Many left the USs to take care ofsick parents during the pandemic. My phone is continuously pinging with repliessuch as these (responses very lightly edited for clarity):“Both me and my husband arestuck here. My husband is going to lose his job with a reputed employer as they don’t allow working from India.”“My wife and US born kid arestuck. Cannot getstamping.”“We’ve beenstuck in India for the lastsix months. I got my visastamped, but myson who is not a citizen and is on a dependent visa had his appointment cancelled. He’s very upset and depressed.”“I traveled while pregnant as my mom and dad were both diagnosed with COVID and were admitted to hospital. Myson needs an H4 visa which he can’t get because the consulates are closed. Husband is also here and can’t work remotely for very long. Our future has become uncertain.”“I amstuck in India and two-year-oldson and wife are alone in San Francisco.”“We camesince my father passed away, but our appointments were canceled last week We can travel with a US born kid, but how can we travel without a valid visa? My eldersonstudies there and his education has also gone for a toss.”“We arestuck in India because ofstamping and our company can’t hold the job for long…we could lose our jobs. We have mortgages.”According to a2020report from the USs Citizenship and Immigration Services, there are around 500,000 workers on H-1B visas in the USs Most of them work in the technologysector, though there are also manydoctors, pharmacists, consultants, and marketing professionals. Around70 percent of these visas are held by Indians. Because of a Trump administration policy, many H-1B workers were already in India before the ban went into effect. In 2020, during the last year of his presidency, Trump ordered a temporarysuspension on all new H-1B visas. For many months last year, US consulates in India were also closed due to the pandemic. Both of these things together made it difficult for H-1B visa holders to travel back and forth to India. The Trump-era ban expire dat the end of March, and thesituation wassupposed to improve. The Covidsituation in India improved for a little bit earlier this year, and consulates opened for ashort while and resumed processing visas, but with this new travel ban and an escalating pandemic, those who have beenstucksince last year have no way of getting back anytimesoon. Another complicating factor is the absurdly long waitlist for green cards: over to50 years, according to estimates from the CATO institute. Every year, thousands of H-1B holders qualify for green cards, yet there’s a cap on how many green cards can be issued to each nationality. As of May 2018, nearly600,000workers and their families were waiting for employment-based green cards. More than 90 percent are Indians, who receive about 10,000 employment-based green cards a year. Meanwhile, they have to rely on visa renewals andstamping of the visa at consulates at regular intervals.“Without a green card, there is always an invisiblesword hanging over my head,”said Neha, who has beenstuck in the green card backlogsince 2012. Immigration advocates believe the travel ban isn’t worth thestress it’s causing families. Cyrus Mehta, a New York based attorney whospecializes in immigration law,said that the ban isn’t very useful instopping thespread of the virussince citizens, permanent residents, and others arestill allowed to travel. But the ban disproportionately affects those who are working on temporary visassuch as the H-1B visa.“Representing H1B visa holders, I know what they’ve gone through,” hesaid. “Each time they go to India, there’s a ban imposed on them. In the Trump administration, they weresubject to bans. Then they wait patiently. They’ve nowscheduled a visa appointment. And their appointment for later this week has been cancelled because of this latest COVID ban on India. So they’ve got a double whammy.”Mehtasuggestsstricter controls and protocolssuch as rigorous testing, quarantining, and vaccination requirements as a better approach to controlling thespread of the virus. Neha has a full-time job, two kids and is recovering fromsurgery. For the past few weeks, Neha hasspent all her free time calling consulates, politicians andspeaking with journalists to find a way to get her husband back into the country.“I haven’tslept a wink,”shesaid. “I am not a religious person, but these days I am praying to god everyday.”",2,1,Mother Jones

During the Obama years, Republicans engaged in regular bouts of brinkmanship over the debt ceiling, demanding the administration enact the preferences of the Freedom Caucus. But today,the hostage takers have no demands. So what is the fight actually about?Like aepisode, this debt ceiling fight is about nothing. But it couldstill do real damage — and it is not only the Republicans who are to blame. The Democratic position is that Republicansshould join in raising the debt limit because theyshare the responsibility for the rising debt — as they unquestionably do.

But getting political cover is hardlysomething worth risking the full faith and credit of the federal government over. If the Democrats could eliminate the debt ceiling problem on their own,surely that would make moresense than joining the Republicans' incredibly risky game. And the Democrats had every chance to doso. They could have included an increase in the debt ceiling in the original reconciliation bill, for example, or passed astand alone debt ceiling raise through reconciliation. They could eliminate the filibuster for debt ceiling bills on a party-line basis, just as Republicans did for judicial nominees — or they could eliminate the filibuster entirely in thesame manner. All these choices carry political risks, but they are all within the Democrats' power, and are obviouslysuperior to allowing a default. So why have not they done any of them? Because they are trying to force the Republicans to take responsibility for their role in the government is fiscalsituation, and trying to force them to admit with a vote what they overwhelmingly admit to the press: that the debt ceiling must be raised, fullstop. But that is the thing about being the governing party: You have to govern. If Democrats had wanted toset a positive example, they could have eliminated the debt ceiling entirely assoon as they got the majority. That would have been the right thing to do, and politically wise as well,since it would deprive future Republican majorities of a hostage to take. Instead they are playing chicken in order to prove that Republicans are the irresponsible party. What a responsible thing to do.",1,1,The Week
129,Abortionist Who is a Convicted Sex Offender May Have to Close His Seven Abortion Clinics,27.75,21.0,https://www.lifenews.com/2019/04/16/abortionist-who-is-a-convicted-sex-offender-may-have-to-close-his-seven-abortion-clinics/,https://adfontesmedia.com/life-news-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,22,"Abortionist Vikram Kaji, 82, whose medical license was voluntarilysurrendered earlier this year after he was found incompetent to practice medicine, entered into a consent agreement on April 10, 2019, with the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners that requires him tosellseven New Jersey abortion businesses that operate under the American Women’s Services banner, according to the“It is our hope that no buyer will be found for theseshoddy abortionshops, and that they will be forced to close. Theyshould have been closed years ago,”said Troy Newman, President of Operation Rescue. “American Women’s Services is the most dangerous and deceptive abortion chain that isstill operating in this country. Every day they are open they are exploiting women and risking their lives by cutting corners and lying for thesake of profit without regard for their customer’s lives and health.”New Jersey law prohibits those who are not licensed from owning medical practices. The consent order gives Kajisixty days tosell the abortion businesses to a “licensed physician” andsubmit copies of thesales contract and any management contracts to the Board for review. The abortion businesses originally were owned by disgraced abortionist Steven Chase Brigham, whose own medical license was revoked in November 2014, transferred ownership of his New Jersey abortion clinics to Kaji, whoserved as his medical director, for no monetary exchange and without Kaji being aware that he was the new owner. Brigham continues to run the abortion businesses behind thescenes in an “administrative” capacity while using an aging and incompetent Kaji as hisshill. Kajisuffered astroke and impairment in his dominant right hand along with memory difficulties that made it impossible to properly conduct his duties as owner and medical director ofseven busy abortion clinics. Operation Rescuefiled a formal complaint with the New Jersey Attorney General’s office detailing research thatshowed no record of the ownership “transfer” and evidence of Brigham’s continued operation of the abortion chain. The New Jersey Attorney General’s office described the business transfer as a “sham”and tooksteps to end Brigham’s participation –steps that were put on hold for four years while Kaji’s competence was under evaluation. If Kaji cansell thesecond-rate abortion businesses – and that is a big “if” – it is hoped that Brigham will also be cut off from any further profit and control. It is possible that if Kaji cannotsell within 60 days, thestate could order the abortion clinics toshut down. Those include American Women’s Services clinics in the following New Jersey communities:The American Women’s Services has been fraught with controversy and accusations of illegal activity over the years, which has resulted in the loss Brigham’s medical license insixstates. In 2010, Brigham was caught operating an illegal bi-state late-term abortionschemesimilar to one that cost him his medical license in New Yorkin 1994. He would begin abortions as late as 30 weeks or more at his unlicensed office in Voorhees, New Jersey, where he was legally permitted to conduct abortions up to 14 weeks. To avoid running afoul of New Jersey law, Brigham would induce the women into active labor then caravan them to asecret late-term abortion facility in Elkton, Maryland, where the abortions would be completed. Brigham, who was never licensed in Maryland, conducted abortions illegally in Elkton. Heshielded his illicit activity by using the license of another elderly physician, whose mental and physical abilities were also impaired, as a cover in asimilar way that he used Kaji. However, thatscheme fell apart after Brigham and his new trainee, Utah abortionistNicola Riley, nearly killed an 18-year old woman during aseriously botched 22-week abortion. Complaints filed by the Union Hospital in Elkton and the Johns Hopkinssurgeon whosaved her life resulted in the legal (if not practical) end of Brigham’s medical career. Kaji has had his ownset of troubles in the past. He was convicted by the New Jersey Board of Medical Examiners in 1993 for having impropersexual contact with three patients. Kaji reportedly hadsex with one young girl at his office during business hours and later plied her with drugs. He knew his victim was vulnerable to his advances becauseshe had been a depressed victim of childsex abuse with a history of psychiatric hospitalization. Kaji was also accused of giving improper breast and rectal exams to two other women. The NJBME placed Kaji on a 1-yearsuspension and fined him $5,000 and ordered him to undergo psychological counseling. Brigham continues to operate abortion clinics in Florida, Virginia, Washington, DC, and Maryland, where a woman,Maria Santiago, was killed during a botched abortion in 2013. These clinics are not expected to be impacted by any action in New Jersey. Pennsylvania permanently banned Brigham from practicing medicine or operating any medical facility in thatstate in 2010, but that didn’tstop him fromsurreptitiously opening an abortion business in Philadelphia in 2012. Once his affiliation was found out and complaints were filed by pro-life groups, including Operation Rescue, it was forced to close in 2013.“Brigham has learned well how to evade the law from his decades of legal woes. It is likely that he may try to transfer ownership of the clinics tosomeone close to him that will allow him to continue exploiting women for financial gain with hissloppy and dangerous practices. Hopefully, the Attorney General’s office has had enough dealings with him that they willsee through any attempts to pull off anothersham transfer deal,”said Newman. “Closing Brigham and Kaji’s American Women’s Services in New Jersey will be one of the best things thestate has ever done to protect women.”",0,0,Life News

It’s calledFrom the Desk of Donald J Trump: a drab, dated micro blog that would be equally comical and forgettable if it weren’t the new mouthpiece of this country’s most powerful demagogue. Unless Parler backs up a truckload of cash to Mar-a-Lago, this might be Trump’s only option. He remains banned from Twitter, and on Wednesday morning the Facebook Oversight Board—or FOB, a pseudo-legal organization conceived andsubsidized by Facebookto issue binding decisions on major content moderation issues—declaredthat Facebook’s post-Capitol insurrection ban of Trump couldstand. “The Board found that the two posts by Mr. Trump on January 6severely violated Facebook’s Community Standards and Instagram’s Community Guidelines,” wrote the FOB in its decision, arguing that Trump broke “rules prohibiting praise orsupport of people engaged in violence.” (Trump’s posts encouraged rioters to go home peacefully, but they also containedstatementssupporting their false grievances about astolen election.)FOB and its parent organization agree here, but perhaps nowhere else. Facebook initially declared its Trump ban temporary but indefinite, then asked the FOB to weigh in. The board on Wednesday excoriated that decision as a reflection of Facebook’s rudderless policies, and its members are not pleased at being used to run political interference for the company. “In applying a vague,standard less penalty and then referring this case to the Board to resolve, Facebookseeks to avoid its responsibilities,” declared the FOB. “The Board declines Facebook’s request and insists that Facebook apply and justify a defined penalty.”Punting the decision back to company leadership, the FOBsaid that Facebook now hassix months to decide what to do about Trump—and to get its policies together in the process. It’s a vital, long overdue request, and Facebookshows nosign of being able to fulfill it. Meanwhile, Trump now has anothersix months to rile up his legions by painting Facebook as a leftistshill thatsilences conservatives. “Freespeech has been taken away from the President of the USs because the Radical Left Lunatics are afraid of the truth, but the truth will come out anyway, bigger andstronger than ever before,” read aTrumpstatement distributed via email. “The People of Our Country will notstand for it! These corruptsocial media companies must pay a political price, and must never again be allowed to destroy and decimate our Electoral Process.”This messy, embarrassing result, which willsatisfy few across the politicalspectrum, must come as ashock to Facebook. While the FOB had a respectable roster of academic and political luminaries, it was widely considered a rigged regulatory body that would, perhaps temporarily, pacify legislators and activists critical of Facebook policies. Instead, after issuing a fewsober-minded decisions on lower-profile matters, the FOB has come out withsurprising aggression,showing up its minders as blithe techies ignorant of the damage their platform causes. Yet howeversilly Facebook ends up looking, the FOB decisionstill represents a qualifiedsuccess for the company. Thesystem—Facebook’ssystem—works. It just needssome clarity and fine-tuning. Facebook, which is used to riding fromscandal toscandal, hassix months to improve procedures and gauge the political weather vane, after which it can again declare itself a responsiblesteward of public conversation. Facebooksurely will remain undaunted in the wake of the board’s judgment. Time and again, the company has proven unable to reckon with its ownscale and impact, as it recklessly pursues growth at all costs. This is especially true in certain foreign markets likeSri Lanka,India, andMyanmar, where Facebook has been manipulated by illiberal and authoritarian governments tospy on dissidents, propagandize, and provoke real violence. In his use of Facebook as a rallying tool for an aggrieved base capable of its ownsudden acts of political violence, Trump has more in common,stylistically andstrategically, with India’s Narendra Modi or Filipino President Rodrigo Duterte than with Germany’s Angela Merkel, who lamented Trump’s initial ban. Facebook’s political utility and its runaway popularity have always outstripped its policies and its identity. While notionally liberal, it’s hard tosay what Facebookstands for—even itssupposed devotion to freespeech has been watered down assomething called“Voice.”The company has no firm publicstandards for how to deal with lying demagogic political leaders weapon izing its platform to intimidate opponents and manipulatesupporters. It claims to have “human rights commitments,” including aCorporate Human Rights Policybased on UNstandards, but the platform is a constantsite of abuse. It probablyshould not be available in nondemocracies, which is tosay nothing of its destabilizing effects on our own rickety political infrastructure.“Facebook has become a virtually indispensable medium for political discourse, and especiallyso in election periods,” wrote the FOB. “It has a responsibility both to allow political expression and to avoidserious risks to other human rights.” Because it can be a tool for free expression and also one forspreading misinformation or political incitement, the boardsaid, “Facebook’s human rights responsibilities must be understood in the light of thosesometimes competing considerations.” Inshort, Facebook’s own values may be in conflict with one another, perhaps irreconcilablyso. There’s a deep reckoning to be had over how Facebook handles content moderation atscale, freedom of expression, and the outsize influence of certain politicians. The FOB’s decision wasn’t it. This necessary round of criticism will do nothing tosolve Facebook’s core problems, which revolve around its business model, its profound dependence onsurveillance, monetizing user behavior, andstoking division to boost engagement. The problem with Facebook is Facebook. We are well past the point of reform. All that remains is more bumbling, mealymouthed corporate decision-making that will only further enrage the left and right alike. Perhaps Trump’sstay ofsocial media execution cansomehow unite those political factions to take down Facebook, but more likely we’ll all be in thesame placesix months from now: yelling about Facebook’s obscene power, while the company ravenously accrues more of it.",1,1,New Republic

""We opposed thisshocking violation of privacy, alongside many victims’ rights advocates.""Uber disclosed the existence of thousands ofsexual assaults nationwide in its2019safety report. Afterward, the CPUC demanded detailed information about cases that occurred in California—including the time and place where assaults happened and names and contact information of witnesses. The CPUC order does notspecifically ask for the names of victims. However, in many cases the victim would be the only witness,so CPUC was essentiallyseeking to unmask hundreds ofsexual assault victims. Uber objected, noting that most of the victims had not consented to have their identities orstoriesshared with third parties. Even if the records were kept confidential, Uber argued, a CPUC investigation of these cases could force victims to revisit one of the most traumatic moments in their lives. In a revised order, the CPUC allowed Uber tosubmit the information underseal to ensure that the data did not become public. But beyond that, the CPUC refused to budge, issuing asecond order in January demanding that Uber turn over the data. Victims' rights groups like the Rape Abuse Incest National Network (RAINN) rallied to Uber is defense. ""RAINN is exceedingly concerned that the Commission is ruling"" directs Uber to ""share a list of victim names, contact information, and additional incident details with the Commission, without the consent of the victims,"" the group wrote in an August filing with the CPUC.""The vast majority ofsexual assault victims choose not to report to police,"" RAINN added. ""Surely, they never envisioned that astate regulatory commission would require disclosure of information that they, themselves, have explicitly decided to notshare with thestate.""RAINN argued that enforcement of the CPUC is demands would ""nullify each victim is right to decide when, and to whom, to disclose their assault"" and would ""risk re-traumatization of victims.""But the CPUCseemed unmoved by these arguments, whether they came from Uber or from groups like RAINN In aMonday ruling, the agency held that ""this decision does not require the disclosure ofsuch information that could potentially traumatize the victims asecond time."" Instead, the agency reasoned, the rules ""require only that the information regardingsexual assaults andsexual harassment besubmitted to the Commission underseal.""The CPUC concluded that Uber had ""refused, without any legitimate legal or factual grounds, to comply"" with the data request. The agency held that Uber is actions were particularlysevere because they had ""harmed the regulatory process.""Insetting a fine, the CPUC issupposed to consider whether a party is actions were in the public interest. But in Uber is case, the agency concluded that ""there are no facts to mitigate the degree of Uber is wrongdoing."" So the CPUCslapped Uber with a harsh $59 million penalty. Ironically, after hitting Uber with a massive fine for refusing to namesexual assault victims, the ruling allows Uber tosubmit its data in anonym i zed form.""Ubershall work with the Commission isstaff to develop a code or numberingsystem as asubstitute for the actual names and other personally identifiable information"" of victims and witnesses to assault cases, the rulingsaid. Uberseems to be the only taxi or ride-hailingservice that has faced these kinds of questions from the CPUC The company is decision to publishstatistics aboutsexual assault and other crimes against its passengersset a newstandard for transparency, but the reportseems to have attracted extrascrutiny from California regulators.""These punitive and confusing actions will do nothing to improve publicsafety and will only create a chilling effect as other companies consider releasing their own reports,"" Ubersaid in itsstatement.

135,The Significance of the Derek Chauvin Verdict,-9.33,39.33,https://www.newyorker.com/news/our-columnists/the-significance-of-the-derek-chauvin-verdict,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,25,"At the Hennepin County Government Center on Tuesday afternoon, Judge Peter Cahill opened a yellow envelope and read out the verdict against Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer who, last May, kneeled on the neck of George Floyd for nine minutes and twenty-nineseconds, killing Floyd and igniting a nationwide uprising against police abuse andsystemic racism. Chauvin wore a pale-blue face mask. His eyes darted fromside toside. The verdict was guilty on charges ofsecond-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder, andsecond-degree manslaughter. And, within just a few minutes, it was over. Chauvin, now a convicted murderer, was handcuffed and led out of the courtroom. Cahill thanked the jury for its “heavy-dutyservice.” Bail was revoked. Thesentence will be handed down in eight weeks. Outside, on a broad lawn,several hundred people had congregated to wait for the news. There were Black Lives Matter activists, reporters, and many people who rushed to the area after getting alerts on their phones that the judge wouldsoon read out the will of the jury. And, when they heard the first of the three guilty verdicts, the reaction was loud and unambiguous.“It was an explosive cheer,” Jelani Cobb told me, by telephone, from the courthouse. Cobb, astaff writer at, a historian, and the Ira A Lipman professor of journalism at Columbia University, has been in Minneapolis covering the trial for the magazine. And he has been covering issues of race and criminal justice for many years, from Newark to Atlanta and beyond. Wespoke at length on Tuesday; our conversation has been edited for length and clarity. I’m in front of the courthouse, on the lawn, at thesamespot where, last week, Ben Crump, the lawyer for the Floyd family, had a rally and press conference. When the news came that there was a verdict coming, the crowd here went from fifty toseveral hundred in no time. Before the verdict was announced, there was a lot of anxiety. There was asizable military contingent on thescene, too, in case of a verdict that caused an . . .reaction. People were nervous. People were jumpy. People were watching on their phones. Someone from Black Lives Matter had a bullhorn, and when the first ‘guilty’ was called out the crowd reacted. Real ebullience. Lots of raised fists in the air. And now there are loads of cars jamming the intersection here, people hitting their horns, a huge traffic jam. Honestly, I amsurprised that they came back guilty on all three counts. But it turns out that the prosecution pitched ashutout. From experience and from learning about the unpredictable dynamics of thesesituations, you might have expectedsomesort ofsplit verdict, kind ofsplitting the difference, but to get all three guilty verdicts was, at least to me, unanticipated. How am I feeling? It’s hard to describe. It’s important to remember that nothing that happened today changes the fact that we were witness to a man losing his life in the most excruciating way, while constantlysaying he couldn’t breathe and begging for intercession from his dead mother. Some things you will never get out of your mind. Rather thansay of the verdict that this is the best-casescenario, I’d prefer tosay that it’s the least worst-casescenario. I was notshocked, no. I was disgusted and horrified. But you had to know, if you have been observing these things for long enough, thatsuch things are always possible. That’s been one of the most essential things about this whole case—that we are now, all of us, Black and white, on thesame page. Orshould be. It’s that rare moment when wesee through thesame lens. Wesee what the terms are. Wesee what the issues of criminal justice in this country really are. This clarifies the terms of the discussion. Right. Because, on the one hand, you have the catharsis of a triple-guilty verdict. But at thesame time, in the of the trial, we had the policeshooting of a young man, Daunte Wright, just down the road, in Brooklyn Center. There are lots of questions. First, what kind of police department are they going to have? There are people here in town who arestill organizing around abolishing the force as it exists and creating an alternativestructure for publicsafety. Also, I’d anticipate increased attention to the other trials coming up, in August, of the three other officers who were present when George Floyd was killed. It’s been incredibly tense. A lot of establishments and buildings in town were boarded up. There was real fear. They were worried that a lesser verdict or an acquittal wouldset off a wave of demonstrations and violence. Talking with people in various communities, I found that there were a lot of people who expressed the idea that, at best, Derek Chauvin might be convicted of the least of the charges. And nearly everyone here, across all kinds of lines of age and race and class, predicted chaos if he was acquitted outright. Younger African-Americans, in particular, didn’t rule out the possibility of an acquittal. The prosecutors did a few things that were interesting. The first notes that you heard from them were the emotional notes. They went through how deeply the community near where George Floyd was killed was traumatized. Not only the people who knew him but others, too, like the 911 dispatcher. Then came the real meat of the case. You got a parade of experts—medical people, especially—knocking down the defense’s contentions, one after another. The prosecution’s closing argument was especially revealing. The argument was calibrated to any jurors who might have had any qualms aboutsending a police officer to prison for many years. The theme was,subtly, “Remember, it’s not thesystem that’s on trial—it’s this one guy.” In a way, this was a pro-copstrategy for the prosecution, and it was carefully designed to assuage any uneasiness a juror might have.[Many] reporters were not in the courtroom. So, like you, we neversaw the jury and its reactions. And wesaw Derek Chauvin only infrequently. He remained an enigma throughout. Here was this person at the center of a national tempest, and yet we couldn’t really tell what his thoughts or reactions were. Was he contrite? The one time we got to hear from him was when hesaid he wouldn’t testify, and there heseemed almost cavalier. And people noticed that. But, in general, it was hard tosee how he was processing all this. He remained asshrouded in mystery as he was in the nine minutes-plus that he was kneeling on George Floyd’s neck. The defense? I’d make a baseball analogy: a pitcher who throws a lot of everything—knuckleballs,screwballs, curves—and hopes thatsomething,, works. So, for instance, they brought out their carbon-monoxide defense,saying that George Floyd was affected by the exhaust from thesquad car. It reminded me of the Twinkie defense in the killing of Harvey Milk, in 1978, in San Francisco. Remember that? The defense threw out everything they could, playing the game of raising any kind of doubt they could—the drug-overdose theory, the heart-attack theory—and it was all knocked down. In the end, the defense lawyers had the unenviable task of getting a jury past a video that the whole world hadseen. If Derek Chauvin had not been convicted, it would havesaid to the world that there is absolute impunity for police. Most Black people already think that. Recently, wesaw another instance that made thesystemic nature of things plain. In Chicago, not only did the policeshoot Laquan McDonald in the back—the entiresystem in that city was implicated because the video of that killing was buried. And, in North Charleston, wesaw on video a police officershoot Walter Scott in the back, and then we learned that he had dropped a Taser near his body, to imply that Scott had run off with the Taser. Even that initially ended in a mistrial. And that all took place in the context of the massacre when a whitesupremacist killed nine Black people in a church in downtown Charleston. There is this question about the extent to which thesystem is culpable. With Derek Chauvin, you couldn’t get around thesystemic implications of what had happened. The fact is that George Floyd’s life was extinguished, and no one intervened. Chauvin had been on the force for well over a decade. The trial, the whole affair,started to add up to its larger implications. The trialstrategy tried to limit things to a conversation about one man going rogue, that Chauvin did what no good cop would have done. Ultimately, that’s not true. It’s not just one cop. Everyone here in Minneapolis, all the people I’ve talked to,say thesame thing: we all know how much work needs to be done on the greater issue, on the issue ofsystemic racism.",1,1,The New Yorker

Edwards, like many others, was locked insolitary confinement because of Covid-19. Photo by Cydni ElledgeThe InterceptInside his cell at the Etowah County Detention Center in Gadsden, Ala., Karim Golding began feelingsick one day in June2020. He had a fever, a pounding headache, coldsweats, an​“onion burningsensation” behind his eyes and he wassleeping for days on end. When he finally felt well enough to emerge,​“the entire unit” wassick, Golding recalls.​“Everybody havesomesymptom or the other.”Three months earlier, as reported in April,Golding, who has asthma, was a lead organizer of a protest inside the jail, pushing forstronger precautions tostop thespread of the coronavirus. Now, as Golding looked around, he realized their worst fears had come true. Etowah contracts with the federal government to hold people detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). To prevent becoming a Covid-19hotspot, Etowah claims (in court documents) it follows guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — including quarantining new arrivals, implementingsocial distancing measures and providing cleaningsupplies. But Golding and more than a dozen other people detained by ICEsay the measures taken were more than just inadequate — they led to a massive Covid-19outbreak. Seven of themsay people were given asingle disposable mask to last for three weeks. Oneshares a photo of what hesays were the only​“cleaningsupplies” he received — a toothbrush, toothpaste, comb and comboshampoo/​body wash — which came inside a gift bag emblazoned with the words​“Merry Christmas” from the Salvation Army. Immigrants detained inside Etowah alsosay many new arrivals were housed in quarantine for only five days or eight days — rather than the recommended two weeks — potentially allowing the virus tospread inside the jail. According to a partial Etowah roster obtained byandIn These Times, ICE transferred at least24people into the facility in June. By thesecond half of July, the agency reported that21people — nearly a quarter of those housed in Etowah’s ICE unit — weresick. When Golding finally emerged from his cell, the organizer part of his brain clicked back on.​“I’m looking at people that’s literally looking pale in the face,” hesays.​“And medical is doing nothing for them.” So, Golding told everyone in the unit to request a test for Covid-19.“So you have Africans, you have Jamaicans, you have El Salvadorans — you have different groups,” Golding explains.​“What I did wassay,​‘Hey, listen, you talk to your peoples, you tell them this.’ ”Many people were apprehensive about asking for a test, as guards had already placed the few who were presumed positive intosolitary confinement, a fate considered by the UN to be torture. Insolitary, detaineessay they were locked in cells without air conditioning for around23hours a day. The average high temperature in July in Gadsden is91degrees. Nevertheless, by July4, everyone in the unit — more than80people — had put in requests for a Covid-19test, according to interviews with Golding and another immigrant detained by ICE, as well as the affidavits of nine detainees included in a petition for a writ of habeas corpus Golding filed on his own behalf in the Northern District of Alabama in September. Two days later, according to those11, Etowah County Sheriff’s Office Capt. Mike O’Bryant called a lock down of the unit. O’Bryant then read the names of the10most vocal detainees calling for mass testing, including Golding. These10, O’Bryantsaid, were going tosolitary. At the time of their transfer, none had tested positive for Covid-19. All11sourcessay they felt this was punishment and retaliation for requesting the coronavirus tests.“I noticed that all of us who were randomly picked were the ones who were vocal, outspoken andshown desire to be tested,” Stanley Walden wrote in an affidavit dated August7.“He handpicked cells and made an example, in front of everyone, that he really meant to throw anyone who get tested into a dungeon,” Sebastian Abalo Cunna wrote in an affidavit dated July28.​“It feels like punishment forstanding up for our right to health andsafety.”After locking down the unit, O’Bryant and otherstaff members went from cell to cell asking whether anyonestill wanted a Covid-19test, according to Golding and the affidavits of nine others. Most declined andsigned waiverssaying as much. In a recorded conversation involving two Etowah employees obtained byandIn These Times, one employee described the events of July6as an attempt to​“bully” people into not getting tested. Afterward, both employeessaid in the recording, immigrants inside Etowah appeared tooscared toseek even basic medical care. Four of those who went tosolitarysay they were unable to communicate with family for days. Some of their concerned family members called the facility. The relatives of one detaineesay jailstaff assured them that their family member was fine. At the time, he was insolitary confinement having developedsymptoms of Covid-19. Golding’s mothersaysshe was told there was no evidence of the virus at the facility, even as Covid-19at Etowah was listed on the ICE website. According to the family members interviewed for thisstory, neither ICE nor Etowah ever reached out to tell them their loved ones weresick. The Etowah County Sheriff’s Office did not respond to detailed questions fromandIn These Timesabout the jail’s Covid-19precautions, the detainees’ allegations of retaliation and whether detainees had authorized the release of their medical information to family members.“The health,safety, and welfare of those in our care remain a top priority and concern for the agency,” aspokesperson for ICE wrote in an emailedstatement.​“Since the outbreak of Covid-19, ICE has taken extensivesteps tosafeguard all detainees,staff and contractors, including: reducing the number of detainees in custody by placing individuals on alternatives to detention programs,suspendingsocial visitation, incorporatingsocial distancing practices withstaggered meals and recreation times, and through the use of cohort ing and medical isolation.”ICE’s own guidance on how its detention centersshould respond to the Covid-19pandemicsays​“facilities must ensure that medical isolation is operationally distinct from administrative or disciplinarysegregation, or any punitive form of housing.” And yet a previous investigation by found that a number of ICE detention centers have failed to adhere to this requirement. According to immigrants detained at Etowah,solitary confinement was used not only as leverage to discourage requests for testing, but to isolate people with Covid-19.andIn These Timesspoke with five men who tested positive for Covid-19while detained at Etowah. Eachsays hespent weeks insolitary. Shemoi Edwards developed Covid-19symptoms just days before Golding. At first, Edwards hoped to quietlysweat out whatever illness he had picked up, but hesoon hobbled over to an officer andsaid he felt like he’d been hit by a truck. With a history of bronchitis and a recent diagnosis ofsickle-cell trait, Edwards was tooscared to ride out the illness on his own. Not long afterward, Edwardssays, he was transferred tosolitary. The men universally describe conditions in thesolitary confinement unit assqualid. In their affidavits, many expressed distress that they no longer had access to mental health professionals, the law library,sunlight or fresh air.​“Civil detention have turned into torture,” Falaye Kourouma wrote. Bakhodir Madjitov, who was deported in September, wrote that there were cockroaches and flies in the unit. Golding wrote that he was fed uncooked frozen food and didn’t have access to drinking water because thesink in his cell didn’t flow properly.“No one wants to be treated how I am currently being treated,” Dawa Sherpa wrote in his affidavit.​“I fear that I may die here at Etowah County Detention Center.”One mansays hespent21days in isolation. Another counted35days, a third54. Edwardssays he was put in isolation June29and released July28—29days. Goldingsays he was insolitary confinement from July6to August28—53days.“We was getting thesame treatment as [when] you get in trouble,” Edwardssays.​“Even though it’s probably a different word — it’s​‘isolation’ — it’sstill a form of punishment that they’re putting us in.”Edwards received the results from his coronavirus test July8, after he had been insolitary for more than a week; he was infected. One day later, Golding received thesame bad news. In isolation, the mensay, their phone access was limited. They could make calls only during a brief daily free period (no more than75minutes), which occurred on an irregularschedule. Sometimes, theysay, it popped up in the middle of the night. Before he gotsick, Edwards wouldspeak with his mother and brother — Nickoy Edwards, a police officer in Flint, Mich. — a few times each week. Nickoy, after not hearing from his brother the first week of July, decided to call Etowah. After finally gettingsomeone to talk to him, Nickoysays,​“that person answered and told me that they looked in the computer and they told me,​‘Shemoi is OK He’s on the floor. And nothing is wrong with him.’”Nickoy believed the facility — at first. Then, weeks later, his brother finally called, telling Nickoy he was insolitary confinement and had the coronavirus. Nickoy called Etowah again.​“And they told me thesame thing:​‘He’s OK.’“I felt like they weren’t telling the truth,” Nickoysays.​“I was a little upset, you know, and concerned because, you know, I want him to be OK.”Their mother, Tyson Mills, also began to worry. Whenshe was finally able to get through to Etowah, Mills explained whoshe was and asked about herson.​“Ma’am, he’s OK,” Millssaysshe was told.​“He’s alright. Nothing to worry about.” Shesays it wassuggested herson didn’t have enough money on his commissary account to call.​“It wasn’t nice,” Millssays.​“I was like breaking down in tears.”Golding’s mother, Mervine Duhaney-Metzgar,saysshe called Etowahsix times after not hearing from herson. At first, her calls were transferred around.​“And it happened that I called again, and they told me that everything is OK, and there’s no evidence of any illness being there. And I know that wasn’t true,”shesays.​“It was very disturbing as a mother.”Nicholas Phillips, Edwards’s attorney, is notsurprised by the lack of communication experienced by the families of these detained men.​“ICE is essentially kind of a closed book to us,” Phillipssays.​“Etowah adds another level of complexity to it because Etowah is a county jail. Andso it’s not really run by ICE It’s run by the Etowah Countysheriff’s department.”According to a2015agreement, Etowah is responsible for medical care inside the facility. But ICE’s36-page guidance on how detention facilitiesshould handle the pandemic does not mention how (or whether) facilitiesshould notify family members of immigrants who getsick. Jessica Vosburgh, an attorney at the Adelante Alabama Worker Center, has represented immigrantsseeking release from Etowah because of medical conditions that put them at risk during the pandemic.​“Because the jail is a healthcare provider, HIPAA applies to them,” Vosburghsays of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.​“They have to respect patient privacy, which means not disclosingsomeone’s medical information without their consent.”“When I need to getsomeone’s medical records from Etowah, I need theirsigned consent and then [the jail] canshare it with me. And I think it would worksimilarly for a family member,” Vosburghsays.​“I don’t think there’s anything in HIPAA that would require or allow people to lie or provide false information aboutsomeone’s health. That’s different than not disclosing, right? If there’ssomething they can’t disclose, they just have tosay,​‘I can’t disclose.’ ”​“Even ifsomeone is being imprisoned, they have the right to proper health, to proper medical attention,” Golding’s mother, Duhaney-Metzgar,says. Even before Golding gotsick,she had put in a complaint to the office of her congressperson, Rep. Gregory Meeks (D-NY), asking for an investigation into how herson had been treated in ICE custody and requesting that he be transferred to a facility closer to home.“My office has repeatedly reached out to follow up on the case for Mrs. Metzgar’sson Karim, and it has been monthssince their last reply,” Meekssays of ICE.​“ICE’s response time issimply unacceptable, especially now during a pandemic when it’s a matter of health andsafety.”“I amso hurt deep down with what’s going on,” Duhaney-Metzgarsays.​“Behind it, Istrongly know that it’s an act of racism.”Phillips agrees. “[The Trump] administration, in my view, does not give ashit about detainees, immigration detainees,” hesays.​“So how does it fit into the kind of larger discussion about racial justice and Black Lives Matter? I think it’s an integral aspect of that. I mean, immigration detention is, in many ways,simply an extension of the kind of mass incarceration crisis that America has gone through.”The criminal justicesystem and the immigrationsystem are deeply entangled, with harsh consequences for Black immigrants in particular. One out of every five people facing deportation because of a criminal conviction is Black. As of July2020, about half of the people detained by ICE at Etowah were Black, including Golding, Edwards and many of the other men interviewed for thisstory. Several are lawful permanent residents, but have lost their green cards and became​“deportable” after criminal convictions. Rather than accept deportation, many immigrants remain at Etowah for years as they fight their cases, often because they have nothing to go back to. Golding and Edwards were both born in Jamaica and came to the USs as children. Edwards, now30, arrived at15on a green card; most of his family now also lives in the USs. Golding, now36, arrived at9to reunite with his mother, who had fled an abusive relationship; he has neversince been back to Jamaica. Before being incarcerated by ICE, Goldingserved a10-yearsentence in federal prison. He and his familysay they didn’t know there would be immigration consequences for his criminal conviction and that he hasserved his time.“I just want myson to get to come home,” Golding’s mothersays.​“Every one of us has the right to be forgiven.”Edwards was justshy of hitting one month in isolation when his third Covid-19test came back positive. Medicalstaff at Etowah had informed everyone that they would need two consecutive negative tests to leavesolitary and return to the general population —so when a guard later woke Edwards up and told him to pack his things, Edwards was confused.​“I thought I was going back to my original unit,” hesays. But asergeant appeared and told him he was being released.“And I’m like, OK!” Edwardssays.​“So I just got to packing, you know, packed all my legal work, and I gave all my commissary away to everybody.”Phillips, Edwards’s attorney, had won a case just two weeks earlier (on July16,2020) on behalf of Jervis Glenroy Jack, a lawful permanent resident. The federal government hadsought to deport Jack because of a conviction on unlawful gun possession in New Yorkstate. The judge Jacksaw in the2ndUS Circuit Court of Appeals, however, ruled thestate-level gun conviction did not qualify as a deportable offense. Edwards’s case was nearly identical to Jack’s: Edwards, a longtime permanent resident,served two and a half years in prison on asimilar conviction in New York. When Edwards was out on parole, immigration authorities took him into custody. Doing his own legal research, Edwards came across the Jack case in2019, then reached out to Phillips, who agreed to represent him. After Phillips won the Jack case, he assumed the reversal would also help Edwards — but no one from ICE contacted Phillips, until moments before Edwards was released. Outside the immigration jail, Edwards asked the ICE officer for his ID and a Greyhound bus ticket.​“I’m basically explaining to him, like, I’m from New York. How are you going to bring me all the way down here and then just tell me that you just gonna release me with no ID, no bus ticket, plane ticket, no nothing to get back to my family?” Edwardssays.​“He wassaying that because the way I won my case, he’s not entitled to give me anything.”But the ICE officer did give Edwardssomething — directions to a Greyhound busstation a mile away. After that, Edwards was on his own. It was87degrees as Edwardsstarted his walk down a four-lane highway,schlepping a heavy black garbage bag full of legal paperwork. He had about $100and a dead cell phone on him. Hestopped at the first gasstation hesaw to buy a mask; the one he had at release, hesays, was weeks old and filthy. When Edwards finally made it to the busstation, he asked about the next trip to New York. Two days, the person at the countersaid. And Flint? A week. His best bet would be to keep walking up to Walmart, where he could buy a phone or a charger. At Walmart, Edwardsstarted making calls: to Phillips, to his brother and to Shut Down Etowah, an organization that helps immigrants after release from ICE custody.​“I basically explained mysituation, and theysaid,​‘We’re gonna havesomebody come and pick you up. Juststay at the Walmart.’ ”Shut Down Etowah booked Edwards on a flight to Detroit (out of Birmingham, Ala.) thatsame evening, and a volunteer accompanied Edwards to the airport. The airport was eerily empty, and Edwards was nervous, hesays. He didn’t have any identification and worried he would besent back to jail.“My main mindset was that I do not want to go through this in a different jail,” Edwardssays.​“Even if it’s for two, three hours, or even a day. I do not want to do that.”The representative from Shut Down Etowah did most of the talking, pulling different legal documents out of Edwards’s bag to explain who he was. Somehow, he got on the plane.“I guess the [airportsecurity] guy must have feltsorry for me,” Edwardssays. Arriving in Michigan feltsurreal to Edwards. Everyone he knew had grown up in the years he’d been away.​“They literally was babies when I left,” Edwardssays. Edwards’s mom calls every day to hear his voice, but he hasn’t been able tosee her. She lives in Massachusetts; Edwardsstill hasn’t been able to get a driver’s license. Edwards now works long hours at a factory and has decided tostay in Flint. He’sstarted working with Shut Down Etowah andspeaks with collegestudents and other groups about his experience in immigration detention and the criminal justicesystem. After almost a decade behind bars, he doesn’t believe anyoneshould be incarcerated, especially not for immigration violations.“Yousaying we incarceratesomebody for rehabilitation? I don’tsee it. They don’t rehabilitate you. They just put you in there till your time up and be like,​‘Go.’ That’s it,” Edwardssays.​“I don’t feel like we have the right to do that.”Edwards, Golding, and the other men interviewed for thisstory who contracted the virus while at Etowahsay they’re experiencing possible long-termsymptoms of Covid-19: trouble breathing, exhaustion, gastrointestinal problems, and more. While Edwards is at home with family, Golding remains alone and in custody.​“ICE detention has been far more degrading than any prison confinement I have experienced,” Goldingsaid.​“As far as rights go, you basically have no rights.”The Intercept,which pro­vid­ed fact-check­ing by Meerabelle Jesuthasan.

You can find it, andsubscribe,Over the last week, we’ve receivedsome really great reader responses to the Tangle newsletters. As I oftensay, we’re just one person and asmall team trying to produce a holistic view on the news of the day. That makes reader feedback really valuable to us, because we get to hear from both American and international readers with a diverseset of views. Below, I’ve tried to pull together a wide range of challenging, thought-provoking and well-reasoned feedback about the things we’ve published in the newsletter. Bysharing it, I hope you can get a glimpse of the range of responses that are out there to the issues we cover. As always, thanks for reading (and for writing in). Remember: you can reach us anytime by just replying to this email. A reader from Jerusalem responded to yesterday’s edition on the clashes in Israel. Another reader wrote in about the conflict in Israel andsaid this:Michael from Sebastopol, California, responded to thestory on Rep. Liz Cheney. Kendra from Phoenix, Arizona, replied to the newsletter on the latest jobs report — and wanted to chime in about why people aren’t returning to the restaurant industry. Another reader, who asked to remain anonymous, wrote in about what they’reseeing in the retail jobs market more generally. In response to a reader question about guns, I wrote that “advocates for a gun-free future tend to ignore the hundreds of thousands ofself-defense incidents that occur every year thanks to firearms. The CDC estimates that there are between 500,000 and three million incidents every year where victims of crime use firearms to defend themselves. That is one reason why gun ownership isso popular.”Julie from Brooklyn wrote in andsaid the following:Replying to the edition on Trump’s Facebook ban, Jonathan from Seattle, Washington,said:Writing in about the ban on menthol cigarettes, a former tobacco executive made this point:I think one of the flaws about the messaging aroundsystemic racism on the left is born out of the bubbles we all live in. Progressives are often talking to other progressives, which means they are learning and adopting language together that makessense to them — or language that is commonly used in progressive circles. If you pick a randomsuburb in America andstrike up a conversation about “equity” or microaggression, you’re probably going to encountersome glassed over eyes. In my experience, it’s not at all difficult to talk to older, white, upper-middle class Americans about racism if it happens in their “language.” I’ve had plenty of conversations with people who fit that description and happily concede Black Americans have “gotten a raw deal,” or have been “boxed out of powerful positions at corporations,” or are facing the after-effects of generational wealth disparities and laws that gave huge advantages to white people just 50 years ago. Usually the friction comes when you press them on the advantages gained by being a part of thatsystem. Nobody wants to be told what they have isn’t well-earned. This friction only grows when progressives describe an institution,system or country as “racist” because it produces racially unequal results. The fact that many Americans don’t usually use the word racist in this way (but instead as you defined it: open hatred of a group of people) results in a great disconnect. One of my regrets from covering the Tim Scott issue was that I could have tried to preface the conversation with definitions of racism orsystemic racism, which is often helpful. As basic as it is,some people are just using thesame word to mean two different things. Asking people, or defining it yourself, would probably be useful in the conversations you are having. As I oftensay in politics, personal experience always prevails. All the data andstudies in the world can fail to convincesomeone that there are,say, disparate outcomes in how job applications are received with minority-sounding names. But ifsomeone can talk about their experience as a person of color being interviewed or applying for a job, and the tiny clues they pick up on about the biases of the person interviewing them, that’s a more compellingstory. What I oftensee in these debates is oneside throwing links and data at the otherside, trying to compel them to abandon a belief they might have come to from their own life experience. But if you center theself, and talk from your own first-person experience, that’s a different ball game. For example: I could argue that there was a Harvardstudyshowing police are more antagonistic when pulling over Black drivers. That might be asomewhat compelling data point for a person who doesn’t think there is any discrimination in policing. But if I could compare my own experiences being pulled over as a driver with the time I was pulled over while a Black colleague was driving, and explain the differences I witnessed in how the police acted, that’s going to be a much more convincingstory. Ultimately, if your goal is to movesomeone’s position on an issue, any issue, giving themspace to explain why they think the way they do and then centering your own personal experience (rather than an article you read in Vox) is a really productive way to have a conversation. It’s also why Iso oftenshare my own personal anecdotes in Tangle, because I think that may help readers understand why I feel the way I do — and that allows morespace for them to consider thesupporting evidence I may bring to an argument.

About five weeks earlier, John Havron was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer, which ravaged his body. The day had come for him to leave his house for hospice. But it was tough going. Havron’s wife,son andstepson kept asking him — how do you feel? Are you ready to go? Is it time?Confused andslightly disoriented, Havron could onlysay, “OK.”“Dad wasstruggling. He was out of it,” hisson, Todd Havron,said about that day in 2018. “He couldn’t really vocalize. It was hard toseesomebodysostrong besoscared.”After about an hour,someonesaid, “Do we want to call Felice?”Felice Apolinsky — longtime program director of Nashville cancersupport organization Gilda’s Club — became close friends with John Havron nine years earlier. That’s when Havronshowed up at Gilda’s Club because his first wife had been diagnosed with cancer. With kindness and love, Apolinsky walked him through his wife’s illness and death in 2010. About eight years later, Havron himself got cancer. And Apolinsky walked beside Havron and his relatives again. Sheshowed up to his house just 15 minutes aftershe got the call. Everyone inside relaxed assoon asshe walked in.“It took about two minutes,” Todd Havronsaid. “He looked at her,said her name, andsaid, ‘Yeah, I’m ready to go.’”Apolinsky has been building that kind of trust with peoplesince arriving at Gilda’s Club 22 years ago. In June, Apolinsky, 56, announced her retirement tospend more time with her 87-year-old father, who died July 29. But the curly-haired, pint-sized “angel on earth” will retire anyway. Apolinsky will be honored Sept. 3 at Gilda’s Club’sannual Red Door Bash fundraiser, a virtual event this year. She leaves behind a legacy of helping thousands of people with cancer — and loved ones of people with cancer — with big hugs, a quicksmile, an open heart and quiet competence. Of those thousands, Apolinsky perhaps grew closest to Havron, who entrusted her with asacred duty just before he died two years ago. The roots of that relationshipstarted two decades ago when Apolinsky, then a 34-year-oldsocial worker, practically forced herself onto thestaff of a brand new Gilda’s Club. She’d been working with Nashville adolescents and others. In 1996, Apolinsky — just months after being diagnosed with thyroid cancer — found herself at an organizational meeting for a Nashville chapter of New York-based Gilda’s Club, named for comedian Gilda Radner, who died of cancer in 1989.“I immediately fell in love with the mission,”said Apolinsky, who connectedstrongly with the group is emphasis on building a community of those dealing with cancer. Shesent Nashville Gilda’s Club founder Sandy Towers a 14-page pitch and convinced Towers to go to lunch with her.“She had a better handle on the mission that I even did,” Towerssaid. “Isat there in utter amazement.”For “minimal pay,” Apolinsky enthusiasticallystartedsupport groups for those with cancer and for relatives and friends of those with cancer. She also launched nutrition and cooking classes, grief groups, programming for children of people with cancer and more; they are free for participants,supported by donations. Apolinsky and otherstaffers help Gilda is Club members walk through thesadness of death, but they are quick to point out there is much joy celebrated as well. Much of the club is programming teaches members how to live life after battling cancer. Apolinsky has gone to hundreds of cancer-free anniversary celebrations, birthday parties, babyshowers, weddings and parties. Her friendssay hersense of humorsometimes is downright goofy. Michael Dinwiddie, Havron isstepson, called Apolinsky “this wonderfullystrong yet kooky person.""The real gift, friends and club memberssay, is her ability to balance those parts of her personality and to walk through endless days ofsuper-charged emotions.“I’m always amazed at the resilienceshe has to get up every morning and put herself out there,” Towerssaid. And, Apolinsky has a way of making deep connections with members from their first interactions,several participantssay. Katherine Sjoblom, 54, of East Nashville,saidshe called the club 10 years ago, distraught, after finding outshe had bone marrow cancer.""What do I tell my young kids?""she remembered asking. Astaff member put the call through to Apolinsky, who calmly and kindly answered Sjoblom’s questions.“I felt heard, and I felt likesomeone understood this is a really horrible moment in my life,” Sjoblomsaid, voice cracking as tearsspill from her eyes.“How many times hasshe given this advice, and yetshestill made me feel important?”Apolinskyshows thesame compassion and respect to volunteers and fellowstaff members.“Felice is genuine, caring,supportive, inclusive and authentic, and whatsheshows you is from the heart,”said volunteer Dana Davis, 53, asocial worker who runssupport groups at Gilda’s Club. “I consider Felice a warm hug. And I don’tsay that about many people.”Apolinsky remembered that John Havron came into Gilda’s Club for the first time in 2009, devastated that his wife of 40 years, his childhoodsweetheart, had brain cancer. Havronstood out to her.“He hadsparkly eyes and a beautifulsmile, even when he was weeping when he introduced himself,”shesaid. Havron’s wife died eight months orso after that, and Havron kept coming back for grief groups and forsupport.“It was a really dark time for him,” Apolinskysaid. “His biggest cheerleader had died, and he was going home to an empty house. The nights were very long and very lonely.”Apolinskystarted to call Havron regularly. Shesaw him in her office for informal one-on-ones and encouraged him to do volunteer work. The two formed astrong bond, and eventually Havron emerged from the darkness. Hestarted to date again. Havron brought his girlfriend, and eventual wife, Belinda Dinwiddie Havron, to Gilda’s Club to meet Apolinsky.“I was absolutely terrified to meet her, much moreso than I was to meet his children,” Dinwiddie Havronsaid. “I knewshe was a very important part of his life. He knows Felicia and trusts her. What ifshesays it’s toosoon orshe doesn’t approve?”Apolinsky approved, andshe helped Havron walk through feelings of guilt and disloyalty toward his first wife. Two years ago, Havron called Apolinsky in her office to tell her he had cancer. The prognosis was bleak. Shesat instunnedsilence for a few minutes before the tears came.“My heart literally hurt,”shesaid. After Havron went to Alive Hospice, Apolinsky checked in or visited every day until he died three weeks later. During one visit, Havron asked his family to leave the roomso he couldspeak to Apolinsky privately. No one hesitated. Havron then dictated affirmations for each of his children, grandchildren andstepchildren, while Apolinsky clumsily typed into her iPhone notes app. Hespoke of one grandchild’sspunk and personality, another’s grace, another’s tenacity. He pointed out one child’ssense of humor, another’s reliability. Havron’s message for his wife: “You are my everything.”Days later, Apolinsky read the affirmations aloud during Havron’s funeral, looking each of his loved ones in the eyes asshe read his final messages to them.“It went from honoring mystepfather to him honoring us,” Havron’sstepson Michael Dinwiddiesaid. “I realized then even more how dear Felice was to mystepfather. Her giving thatspeech was probably the most appropriate thing.”Apolinsky called it “one of the most important things I had ever done.""“What a gift for each person to know what they meant to him and what he loved most about them and what he wished for them.”:gildasclubmiddletn.org:e.givesmart.com:gildasclubmiddletn.org/ways-to-give/volunteer",2,2,Tennessean

143,How the LAPD and Palantir Use Data to Justify Racist Policing,-8.33,42.0,https://theintercept.com/2021/01/30/lapd-palantir-data-driven-policing/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-30,25,"The killing ofGeorge Floyd last Maysparked renewedscrutiny of data-driven policing. As protests raged around the world,1,400 researcherssigned an open letter calling on their colleagues tostop collaborating with police on algorithms, and cities likeSanta Cruz,New Orleans, andOaklandvariously banned predictive policing, facial recognition, and voice recognition. But elsewhere, police chiefs worked to deepen partnerships with tech companies, claiming that the answer tosystemic bias and racism wassimply more data. In her new book, “Predict and Surveil: Data, Discretion, and the Future of Policing,”sociologist Sarah Brayneslays that assumption with granular detail. An assistant professor at the University of Texas at Austin, Brayne did months of fieldwork at the Los Angeles Police Department and other law enforcement agencies in the area, tagging along as cops usedsoftware from Palantir, PredPol, and other companies. She learned thatsoftware vendors routinelyshow up at the department to peddle their wares, like pharmaceutical representatives visiting doctors’ offices. She noted how police used an automated license plate reader mounted outside an emergency room to build out networks of victims’ associates. Asergeant explained that family or friends would often drop off an injured person and thenspeed away. With the automated license plate reader, hesaid, police could use plate numbers to determine who else was connected to the victim, even if there was no other evidence linking them to a crime. Riding along in department helicopters, Braynesaw how data was used to justify extreme measures. In order to get a reduction in crime in one division, police concluded that they had to fly helicopters overhead 51 times per week. They often increased that to 80 to 90 flyovers for good measure, meaning that many residents’ days were regularly interrupted by the noise of buzzing choppers. The copsseemed to register the intrusion. They dubbed the copters “ghetto birds.”Image: Courtesy Oxford University PressFor years,scholars and activists have critiqued the algorithms used in data-driven policing, arguing that they merely tech wash bias by makingsloppy investigative workseem objective. Leading the charge in Los Angeles is theStop LAPD Spying Coalition. Through public records requests, the group’s activists have obtained documents on police use of data analytics, and in 2018, theysuccessfully pushed the city’s Office of the Inspector General to audit the department’s use of technology. “Surveillance is basically the tip of the policing knife,”said Hamid Khan, a co-leader of the coalition. “When you look at policing and the history of policing, from our vantage point, it’s not about publicsafety when it comes to nonwhite folks. It’s about the content to cause harm.” Big data, he added,simply gives police more ways to do that. Brayne’s contribution isshowing exactly how data is distorted in the hands of police. “Mostsociological research on criminal justice has focused on those who are being policed,”she told The Intercept. “I very deliberately wanted to flip the lens to focus on those doing thesurveil ling — on the police themselves.”Andrew Guthrie Ferguson, a law professor at American University and author of “The Rise of Big Data Policing: Surveillance, Race, and the Future of Law Enforcement,”said that Brayne’s work is an unflinching look at what happens when people in power use emerging technologies. “Her book is a completely original inside look at the development of big datasurveillance at the height of the first generation of its adoption,” hesaid. “Sarah has been given access to the reality of big data policing in a way that no one else has — and probably, because of hersuccess, no one else ever will.”LAPD Captain Elizabeth Moralesshows a printed map of predicted crime hotspots in the Foothill Division of Los Angeles, Calif., on Monday, October 24, 2016. Brayne first embedded with the department in 2013 as a 27-year-old graduatestudent. It was a critical moment for policing tech, and the LAPD and other departments were ramping up their use of technology. The LAPD hadsigned on with Palantir Gotham, which merges data from crime and arrest reports, automated license plate readers, rapsheets, and othersources. The department also had a contract with PredPol, which generates “boxes,” or hotspots, where property crimes like burglaries and auto theft are predicted to occur. A third program, Operation LASER, whichstands for Los Angeles’ Strategic Extraction and Restoration program, used a points-basedsystem, called a LASERscore, to evaluate the risk that individuals posed. In Brayne’s first interview, a captain boasted that the LAPD was at the forefront of technology adoption, detailing howsoftware that had been developed for counterterrorism work was helping the department ward off future crimes. Afterward, Brayne asked to go on a ride-along with an officer. That trip revealed a more complicated picture. Instead of pulling up PredPol’ssoftware on the laptop mounted to his dashboard, the cop worked with a printout of PredPol’s hotspots. He explained that the department’s in-car lap tops had trouble loading evenstandard internet browsers. So much for technological wizardry. Brayne and the officer took a break to eat In-N-Out burgers under a highway overpass, where they watched his colleagues bust up a grow operation and drag marijuana plants onto a flatbed truck. Then when they drove to a new location, Brayne noticed that the officer typed in his address manually, rather than let the car’s automatic vehicle tracker register his location. The union opposed officers being tracked, he explained. While predictive policingsystems had caught average citizens in an opaque dragnet, police grewsqueamish when the technology was turned back on them. The notion that better technology can fix policing dates to at least the early 20th century. Back then, police departments were closely tied to city government political machines. Arguing that a data-driven approach would make policing more professional, reformers introduced tactics drawn from military operations, includingsignal boxes, telephone kiosks, and pin mapping. The militarization of police accelerated during the 1960s and has continued to the present day, to the point where even departments in placid Americansuburbs now have armored vehicles, night vision viewers, and bayonets.“That’s a very visible manifestation of the militarization of policing,”said Brayne. “Butsomething that’s more invisible is this creep ofsurveillancesoftware into the daily operations of policing.”A Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department’s patrol car, outfitted with a computersystem developed for the battlefield by a military contractor, isseen in Los Angeles on November 16, 2011. After 9/11, the Department of Homeland Security gavestate and local police $35 billion in grants, a portion of which wasspent on developing data infrastructure. The infusion of cash created needs where there had been none. Police chiefs realized that the data they collected for Homeland Security could also be used for regular policing. In Los Angeles,some officials came to believe that predictive analytics and big data might alsosolve the department’s many problems. The LAPD had been racked by astream of high-profilescandals, most infamously the 1991 beating of Rodney King. In 2001, the Department of Justice imposed a consent decree, a court order mandating that the department conduct regular audits and capture more data on officers and crimes. (Aspokesperson for the LAPD declined to comment for this article.)A key figure behind theshift toward predictive policing was William Bratton, who brought the data managementsystem COMPSTAT to New York City before becoming the chief of the LAPD in 2002. Bratton oversaw the LAPD’s effort to merge variousstreams of data. One result was Operation LASER, which was funded with nearly a million dollars from the federal Bureau of Justice Assistance. When they came into contact withsomeone whoseemedsuspicious, officers filled out a card with the person’s name, address, physical characteristics, vehicle information, gang affiliation, and criminal history. Each new point of contact with police earned a person one additional point. “There are a lot of chickenshit violations you canstopsomeone for,” asergeant explained to Brayne during a ride-along. “Yesterday, this individual might have gotstopped because he jaywalked. Today, he might have gotstopped because he didn’t use his turnsignal or whatever the case might be. So that’s two points.” Thesergeant went on to argue that evensuch minor violations could help police predict the next crime because, taken together, theyshow “who is out on thestreets.”Such asystem means, of course, that individuals in overpoliced neighborhoods can easily get caught up in a vicious cycle where they are, as Brayne writes, “more likely to bestopped, thus increasing their point value, justifying their increasedsurveillance, and making it more likely that they will bestopped again in the future.” Butsome of the administrators whom Brayne encountered were apparently less interested in accuracy than they were in amassing more records. The goal, one captain told her, wassimply to get people “in thesystem”: to capture larger and larger amounts of data onseemingly harmless individuals in the hope that the data would helpsolve a crime later on. Once an officer had a person in thesystem, they couldset an alert to automatically track changes in that person’s profile. Brayne watched Los Angeles police fill out cards for Operation LASER and noted that they often listed the people who were with a person when they werestopped. She calls this a “secondarysurveillance network.” You don’t actually need to have contact with police to be caught up in thesystem; you just need to have had contact withsomeone who did. Similarly, Brayne learned that images captured by automated license plate readerssometimesshowed the faces of people who werestopped with a person of interest. Those people too became data. When Brayne raised the issue of possible legal constraints around the rampant collection andsharing of information, an employee in the Los Angeles County Chief Information Office declared bluntly, “Consent is anachronistic.”Insome cases, even being thesubject of a query can boostsomeone’ssuspiciousness. Brayne watched one detectivesearch a national database for a juvenile. He remarked that he couldsee how many times other users had queried thesame name. He claimed that the feature had helped police catch criminals because it told them other officers hadsuspected thesame individual. When Brayne asked why that was useful, he replied, “Just because you haven’t been arrested doesn’t mean you haven’t been caught.”Decades of research and years of cell phone videos haveshown, of course, that police regularly target people who haven’t committed crimes. On ride-alongs, Brayne watched cops run the plates of law-abiding driversstopped at traffic lights, just in case the numbers turned up a record. But the anecdote underscores how thoroughly big data reinforces existing police biases. One captain claimed, “It’s just math.”A banner displays Palantirsign age during the company’s initial public offering in front of the New York Stock Exchange on Sept. 30, 2020, in New York. In Brayne’s fieldwork, Palantir’s technology came in forspecial praise. “They catch bad guys during every training class,” onesergeant told her. A captain rhapsodized about the platform’s constant addition of new datasets, marveling at the addition of foreclosure information: “I’mso happy with how big Palantir got.” Anothersaid of Palantir, “We’ve dumped hundreds of thousands [of dollars] into that. They areso responsive and flexible about what we want. They’re great. They’re going to take over the world. I promise you, they’re going to take over the world.”But up close, thesoftware was only as good as the people maintaining and using it. To makesense of Palantir Gotham’s data, police often need input from engineers,some of whom are provided by Palantir. At one point in her research, Brayne watched a Palantir engineersearch 140 million records for a hypothetical man of average build driving a black four-doorsedan. The engineer narrowed those results to 2 million records, then to 160,000, and finally to 13 people, before checking which of those people had arrests on their records. At various points in thesearch, he made assumptions that could easily throw off the result — that the car was likely made between 2002 and 2005, that the man was heavy-set. Brayne asked what happened if thesystemserved up a false positive. “I don’t know,” the engineer replied. There were dissenters. Some of the people tasked with implementing data-driven policing at the LAPD complained to Brayne that thesoftware didn’t work as advertised. One person working in information technologysaid, “Our commandstaff is easily distracted by the latest and greatestshiny object.” Data integration was uneven. Some divisions had certainsoftware, while others didn’t. Another employee told Brayne that the detective case managementsystem was “sort of like a pimple,” adding, “they just, like,stuck it on top.”When management was out of the room, police were honest about their doubts. “Looks bitching, but it’s worthless,” onesergeant told Brayne of the LAPD’s data analysis infrastructure, which is housed at the department’s Real-Time Analysis and Critical Response Division. One group of officers bought their captain a Ouija board to mock his faith in algorithms. A captain told Brayne that person-based predictive policing was “a civil liberties nightmare” and that he would never adopt it. (His division adopted it after he left.)Activists who have fought for years against department use of technology told The Intercept that Brayne’s work is useful — but only to a point. “It was very helpful to uncover and learn about the extensive amounts ofstuff that LAPD was doing,”said Jamie Garcia, an organizer with Stop LAPD Spying. “But then what?” In general,she added,she is tired of academics treatingsurveillance like a problem to observe and evaluate. “The information goes back to the ivory tower, and the ivory tower has this conversation with themselves about what they think about it instead of that information being brought directly to the community.”Braynesaid thatshe hopes her work can be useful to a broad variety of people. “Transparency is the firststep towards accountability,”shesaid. “It is impossible to hold an individual or organization accountable if you don’t know what they’re doing.”Forrest Stuart, asociologist at Stanford whostudies policing,said that her book is essential at a moment when anti-racism protests have promptedsome law enforcement officials to further embrace technology as a means for reducing bias. “Some of the most popular proposedsolutions to the over-policing and over-incarceration of black and brown communities have involved new technologies,” he wrote in an email. “There is asense that if we could just design a good enough computer program, we could deploy police more fairly and reduce, or perhaps even eliminate, unwarranted disparities in criminal justice. Brayne’s book makes us take real pause and recognize the faults in this techno-optimist dream.”The LAPD ended its contract with PredPol last April,citing financial constraints brought on by the pandemic. Operation LASER ended in 2019. But a range of othercompanies, including heavyweights likeAmazonandMicrosoft, have moved into thespace nationally, and a guidebook published by the LAPD last year makes clear that big data will continue to prominently figure in policing in Los Angeles. Palantir, meanwhile, has lately expanded its access to data by moving into coronavirus tracking and vaccinesafety analysis. Last year, the company broker ed lucrative contracts with the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration. It went public in September.

144,"In Dramatic Policy Shift, Biden Withdraws US Support for Saudi “Offensive Operations” in Yemen",-7.0,47.33,https://theintercept.com/2021/02/04/biden-saudi-yemen-arms/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-04,25,"In his first major foreign policy address, President Joe Biden announced on Thursday that he would end Americansupport for Saudi and United Arab Emirates-led “offensive operations” in Yemen, echoing a promise he made on the campaign trail in 2019. Speaking at the State Department, Biden told diplomats that he would prioritize diplomaticsolutions to the conflict and appointed, as aspecial envoy, one of the department’s top Middle East experts. He also announcedsupport for a cease-fire and an effort to restart long-stalled peace talks.“This war has to end,” Bidensaid. “And to underscore our commitment, we are ending all Americansupport for offensive operations in the war in Yemen, including relevant armssales.”The movesignaled a dramaticshift in USsupport for Saudi Arabia, a move that has long been urged by progressive activists. Under President Donald Trump, Congresspassedresolutions blocking certain armssales and directing the US to end its role in the hostilities, but Trumpvetoedthem. One of the primary backers of the vetoed resolutions, Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., told The Intercept by phone that Biden’s announcement was a victory. “This is now a decisivestep and really what the war powers resolution was calling for,so I’m very pleased,” Khannasaid. Asked if Congress’s job was done, Khannasaid he thought the legislaturestill had a role to play insupporting diplomatic efforts and reversing last-minutepolicy changes by the Trump administration. The Biden administration had previously placed a temporary freeze on billions of dollars in armssales to Saudi Arabia and the UAE, as well assaying that it would review the transfer of advanced military hardware, including air-ground munitions, that the Trump administrationsought to advance over the objections of Congress. Saudi Arabia and the UAE launched their intervention in Yemen in March 2015, after an Iranian-backed rebel group known as the Houthis took over the capital and forced out Yemen’s internationally backed president. The US hassupported the intervention, first under President Barack Obama and then under Trump, with weaponssales, intelligence, and logisticalsupport, even after Saudi airstrikes increasingly targeted civiliansites like hospitals andschools. The Biden administration has not yet announced operational details of the move or clarified what they meant by “offensive operations.” In his address, Bidensaid that the US would continue to help defend Saudi Arabia from drone and missile attacks,some of which have come from Yemen and have led the Saudis to claim that they are pursuing the war inself-defense. An administration official declined toshare operational details of what the cutoff meant but pointed to the fact that the Biden administration had previously announced they were “reviewingseveral armssales to ensure they are in line with ourstrategic goals, including ending the war.”Briefing reporters on Thursday morning, nationalsecurity adviser Jake Sullivansaid that the prohibition would extend “to the types of offensive operations that have perpetuated a civil war in Yemen that has led to a humanitarian crisis,” but would not result in the US halting its own operations against Al Qaeda in the country. Kate Kizer — policy director with the progressive group Win Without War, which has lobbied to end USsupport for the intervention — told The Intercept by phone that understanding the details of the distinction are important because the Saudis have frequently claimed that they were acting defensively.“The coalition has tried repeatedly in the past tosay that airstrikes in residential areas in Yemen have been ‘defensive’ operations because they were responding to a ballistic missilestrike,” Kizersaid. “So it’s really important to define what that means.”Biden’s call is a hard won-victory for the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, much of which had urged Obama and Trump to end USsupport for the war. Khanna, along with Sens. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had repeatedly introduced various measures tostop USsupport for the war, all of which initially failed in Congress. Khanna told The Intercept that a turning point on Capitol Hill was the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a US-based Saudi dissident who was brutally killed by Saudi agents, like lyon the orders of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman — who is also a key architect behind the Yemen war.“When westarted, there wassuch astrong US relationship with the Saudis that it was very hard to break through,” Khannasaid. “And it took a lot of work in the House; we were taking on our own leadership in the beginning. But then after Khashoggi’s murder,things changed.”Kizer told The Intercept that buildingsupport for ending the war has been a long process among progressive activists, and that it was important to move the discussion beyond a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran. “I think what really has been the game changer over the years is building a public education campaign that really changed the terms of the debate about what’s happening in Yemen,” Kizersaid. “When westarted in 2015, it was totally framed through the lens of Iran, and the détente with Saudi Arabia and the Iran nuclear deal. Very little wassaid about Yemen.”Israel’s War on GazaRyan Grim, Nick TurseThe US risks complicity with Israeli atrocities, expertssay.

148,"In Italy, I’ve Rediscovered the Power of Three Types of Praye...",-1.0,35.0,https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2020/march-web-only/italy-covid-19-prayer-coronavirus-psalms-lament-intercessio.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2020-03-26,25,"The COVID-19 pandemic has changed how Italian Christians pray and live their faith, amid a nation reeling from more than 10,000 deaths—the highest tally in the world—among 92,400confirmedcases,second only to the USs [as of March 28]. During lockdown, we can no longer gather on Sundays or in home groups. Social gatherings, travel, and weddings aresuspended, as are most businesses. Ifsomeone is caught outside their home without a valid reason, there can be a heavy fine. But thisseason of exile has helped us discover three facets of prayer we often neglect in times of abundance. Psalms of lament often felt hyperbolic a month ago. For example, Asaph’s complaint that God has made his people “drink tears by the bowlful” couldseem overdramatic; David’s cry to God of “How long will you hide your face from me?” was a distant feeling. But as humanitystruggles to contain a fear- and anxiety-provoking pandemic, lament feels newly relevant to all of us. In March 2020, Psalm 44sounds pitch perfect:Awake, Lord! Why do yousleep?Rouse yourself! Do not reject us forever. Why do you hide your face and forget our misery and oppression?We are brought down to the dust;our bodies cling to the ground. Rise up and help us;rescue us because of your unfailing love. Few Western Christians have experienced poverty, injustice, or persecution. Consequently, our worship usually reflects the moods of resourceful individuals in times of prosperity and peace: composed and mainstream. We dosuffer individually; however,seldom is our corporate worship fueled by protest and mourning before God. Lament issuffering turned into prayer. It’s the worship of people who feel out of balance and out of place. Historically, it has been the prayer of minorities, the poor, and the persecuted—of Chinese pastors in prison cells and of blackslavessinging of justice and Christ’s coming. If lament felt foreign to most Italians a month ago, pastors have found eerie echoes of biblicalstories in what is currently taking place in the country. “Tosee wives who can’t perform rites or bid farewell to their dying husbands reminds me of how Jesus was hastily buried and women returned to the tomb to anoint his body,” Gaetano di Francia, director of the Union of Christian Biblical Churches in Italy, told me. “Their lack of closure will produce a deeper grief.”The language of lament may prove to be one of the bittersweet lessons Christians learn from this crisis. It can help believers unlearn aspirituality of the center and learn aspirituality of the margins (as pastor Abraham Choremindsus). Never have Ispentso much of my time in prayer interceding for others. I’m ashamed to confess that, in the past, I’ve often told people, “I’ll pray for you,” but then forgot to do it. But now that the virus ravages Italy, I have been moved by images of overworked doctors and people lying in makeshift hospitals. A member of our church fell gravelysick, but the emergency room turned him away because it is fieldingso many cases of the new coronavirus. I can’t meet or lay hands on him due to the current national lockdown, but I have been praying for his recovery. As a church, we have prayed for doctors, created a common fund to help those in economic need, and fasted for our country. The coronavirus crisis has united Italian evangelicals, who observed a National Day of Prayer this past Sunday [March 22]. “Pentecostals, Reformed, Wesleyans, Baptists, Congregationalists, and others met at the feet of the Lord, united by the Holy Spirit,” Giacomo Ciccone, president of the Italian Evangelical Alliance, told me.“It is as if God prepared leaders and denominations around the country to come together in prayer for the nation and for the church,” Leonardo de Chirico, the alliance’s vice president, told me. “It was the easiest event to organize. Nobody needed convincing; all were already on fire for it.”Mila Palozzi, a pastor at my congregation, Hopera Church in Rome, agrees that evangelicals desire to come together.“In the Promised Land, Israel understood itself as a collection of tribes but in exile as one nation,”she told me. “So does Italy: this crisis is bringing churches and tribes together to pray as one body for our country.”It’s a foretaste of thespirit of unity and intercessionspreading around the world. For example, this coming Sunday [March 29] the World Evangelical Alliance will convene a Global Day of Fasting and Prayer. However, the news isso bleak and thesufferingso global these days that we can feel overwhelmed in prayer. How can my prayers possibly meet this moment? Our honest response may be, “Lord, I’m dumbfounded. I don’t know what tosay.”When I watched army trucks driving corpses to be cremated because there is no longerspace in cemeteries in parts of Italy, I wasspeechless. But to wait upon the Lord is valid. To put our wordless trust in him is a legitimate prayer. When Paul writes about our present weakness andsuffering, he adds:“We do not know what we ought to pray for, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us through wordless groans. And he whosearches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for God’s people in accordance with the will of God.” (Rom. 8:26-27, NIV)When words fail us, we can bestill and know that God is God.“As a family, we have chosen to fill oursilences full of doubts with thesecure promises of God,” Stefano Picciani, a preacher at Stadera Church in Milan, told me. “Asaph’sstatement of trust in Psalm 73—‘Yet I am always with you’—provides words for our prayers.”We rightly long to return to normalcy and corporate worship. Imagine the victory parties, and the joining of hands!When this pandemic will be defeated, many will resonance with thesense of relief of Psalm 126 (“Those whosow with tears will reap withsongs of joy.”) and the joy of Psalm 150 (“Let everything that has breath praise the Lord.”). But alongside celebrations, we will be wise to remember the prayers we uttered in this time ofsickness. May this pandemic humble our hearts and teach us the prayers of the weak, the concerned, and thespeechless.

As Paul Gipe points out in his recent blog, theBiden-Harris climate pl anuses the word “revolution” right in the headline — a bit of a departure from the usual cautious rhetoric of the centrist-controlled Democratic Party. But ‘revolution’ is proceeded by two words which let us know we arestill lingering in conservative ‘safe’ territory. They call it a “clean energy revolution”, which Gipe rightly refers to as “focus-groupshopped terminology.” He goes on:”Clean energy is a term forged by Madison Avenue advertising mavens in the crucible of focus groups. It ‘polls well,’ as theysay. It means one thing to one interest group,something else to another. So it’s perfect for politics in America.“To environmentalists, it means wind andsolar energy, often only those two forms of renewable energy, andsometimes onlysolar. It also means good times to the coal and nuclear industry. (Ever hear of ‘clean coal’?)“So clean energy is one of those misleading words that party leaders and, importantly, fund raisers can use to elicit money from donors of allstripes. Whysay renewable energy, when you want to raise money from the coal and nuclear industries?”The Biden-Harris energy plan hits all the right notes in its opening paragraphs, focusing on a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 and emphasizing infrastructure, international collaboration and the protection of poor communities of color, whosuffer the most harm from unfettered polluters. As we know from his publicstatements, Biden will bring the USstraight back into the Paris Agreement on climate andsees the climate crisis as the “number one issue facing humanity”. The Paris Agreement isn’t enough, but the US absence weakens it further. Still on the right track, the Biden-Harris climate plan looks to the rights and wellbeing of workers and jobs creation. It will adhere to “science, not fiction” and recognizes that energy efficiency has an essential role to play. And then it goes very badly — if predictably — wrong. In thesection entitled “Biden’s Year One Legislative Agenda on Climate Change,” the document proclaims “We have to get rid of the old way of thinking,” then reverts precisely to that, clinging on to nuclear power as a necessary component of its plan. So the Biden-Harris agenda listssmall modular reactors under its “game-changing technologies.” In a way, that’s correct. Diverting money intosmall modular reactors be game-changing. It will put us firmly on the road to climate failure. The good news is that nuclear power does not play much of a role in the Biden-Harris plan. But the bad news is that, when it comes to nuclear power, the Biden camp has indeed chosen fiction overscience. A bullet point called “Identify the future of nuclear energy” reverts right back to the failed Obama “all of the above” approach to “look at all low- and zero-carbon technologies”, instead of recognizing that nuclear power, a failed 20th century technology, does not have a future. As Amory Lovinspoints out, this “low-carbon” approach is a perpetual mistake made by politicians andseized on and influenced by the nuclear industry — to look only at carbonsavings, and not at cost and time as well.“Costly optionssave less carbon per dollar than cheaper options,” Lovins writes. “Slow optionssave less carbon per year than faster options. Thus even a low- or no-carbon option that is too costly or tooslow will achievable climate protection. Being carbon-free does not establish climate-effectiveness.”When you look at the precipitating drop in renewable energy costs versus the eversoaring nuclear ones; when you examine how you can reduce more carbon emissions faster and more cheaply with renewables than nuclear; and when you observe the real life examples of countries whose carbon reductions are greater after investing in renewables rather than clinging onto nuclear; then the only reason to include nuclear power in a climate plan is political. The Biden-Harris platform will likely continue to listen to the oldschool. After all, it’s who they know. But if they really want that revolution, theyshould open their eyes to the reality on the ground. A recent article in the Socialist magazine,pointed to an example in the Netherlands where a decision was made not to expand an existing nuclear power plant and instead build two offshore wind farms. Although the Fukushima disasterslightly influenced the decision, at the end of the day, as the article pointed out, it was all about “the law of value”, in other words, money. “With the declining cost of renewable energy, nuclear powersimply does not make economicsense,” itsaid. In an important newstudy out of Sussex University in the UK —Differences in carbon emissions reduction between countries pursuing renewables versus nuclear power— the researchers concluded that choosing nuclear crowds out renewables and vice versa. This means that continuing to use old uneconomical nuclear plants — or investing in new ones — actually hampers renewable energy development, and thereby progress on climate change, and results insmaller carbon reductions and at a much higher cost. Thestudy notes that, “per dollar invested, the modularity of renewables projects offers quicker emissions reductions than do large-scale, delay-prone nuclear projects,” thesame point made by Lovins. And, as thestudy alsosays, the more we use renewables, the more improved their performance, exactly the opposite of nuclear whichsees “rising costs or reduced performance with the next generation of technology.”This last is an important point for the Biden-Harris energy team to note. By includingso-called new nuclear, they are dooming themselves to wasting both time and money betterspent focused on renewables. Small modular reactors will not, as their plan asserts, come in at “half the construction cost of today’s reactors.” They will be far more expensive in relation to the electricity they would eventually produce. And of course they would arrive too late, and in toosmall a quantity and generate too little — and very expensive — electricity to make any difference to climate change at all. Biden-Harris must look at empirical data, not listen tospin doctors and establishment cronies who will keep them anchored to thestatus quo, thus deferring the very energy revolution they claim they will lead. If Biden-Harris remain in favor of action on climate AND for nuclear power, then they are part of the problem, not thesolution.is the editor and curator ofBeyondNuclearInternational.organd the internationalspecialist at Beyond Nuclear.

150,Voting rights hit the Supreme Court.,-0.67,44.0,https://www.readtangle.com/p/voting-rights-supreme-court,https://adfontesmedia.com/tangle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-02,16,"Plus, a question about migrant facilities. The Supreme Court’s voting rights battle. Plus, a question about migrant facilities. Voting rights. Today, the Supreme Court will begin hearing arguments i na case in Arizona that couldshape the future of voting rights for decades. The case challenges two Arizona laws: one that calls for a ballot to be thrown out if it was cast at the wrong precinct, and another that bans the collection and delivery of ballots by third parties (also known as “ballot harvesting,” which is permitted in 24states and the District of Columbia). The plaintiffs,supported by Democrats, are arguing that these rules discriminate and infringe upon the rights of minorities, especially Native Americans, Black and Latino voters, by making it more difficult for them to vote. Thestate,supported by Republicans, argues that they are neutral laws that codify reasonable ways tosecure elections. While the case isspecific to Arizona, it could have monumental national implications. Up until 2013, the Voting Rights Act requiredstates with a history of discrimination to get permission from the courts or Justice Department before changing its voting rules. This was called a “preclearance test,” dictated by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. But the Supreme Courtsuspended that requirement in 2013 after it ruled that Congress had not properly updated the criteria to determine whether astate was discriminating or not. Without the pre clearance requirement,states like Arizona began implementing laws that would have otherwise needed to clear the Justice Department and the courts first. Nowstanding in the way of these two Arizona laws is Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, whichsays astate cannot pass a law “which results in a denial or abridgment” of the right to vote based on race. In the past, Section 2 has been applied to cases of gerrymandering, or “vote dilution.” This time, the plaintiffs are attempting to apply it to “vote denial.”Given that the court is expected to interpret Section 2 in this case, its ruling couldset up dozens ofsimilar,sweeping rulings across the country, and impact how otherstates legislate their elections.“Thespecific issues in the case are narrow, but to resolve them, the court has to address for the first time a question of major consequence: how the Voting Rights Actshould be applied to regulations of the electoral process,” New York University law professor Richard Pildes told The Wall Street Journal. “The way that question is resolved will affect a myriad of election-law issues for years to come.”This has become increasingly importantsince the 2020 election. Now, Republican-controlledstate legislatures across the US are proposing new voting laws theysay willsecure elections. Opponents of the lawssay they are designed to be restrictive and limit the number of minorities, who predominantly vote with Democrats, casting ballots. However, these two cases preceded the 2020 election. In 2017, a federal judge ruled in favor of thestate,saying the rules were minimally burdensome and did not impact the majority of voters. But the Ninth US Circuit Court of Appeals overturned that decision,siding with the plaintiffs and the Democratic National Committee, which had joined the lawsuit. There are other voting rightsstories right now, too, including the Democrats’ push to pass HR1., a federal bill that wouldsubstantially update election laws. But today we’re focused on what’s happening at the Supreme Court now. The left is vehemently opposed to these laws,saying they represent an existential threat to minority voters’ ability to participate in the democratic process. In Slate, David Ganssaid“state legislatures run by Republicans are engaged in a concerted effort to roll back voting rights, particularly for communities of color,” with “new hurdles to prevent voters of color from fully participating in our democracy.”“After, the Voting Rights Act has been hanging on by a thread,” Gans wrote. “The key to its continuing promise is Section 2’s nationwide ban on electoral practices that result in a denial of equal political opportunity to voters of color. Section 2’s results test is critically important because its plain language targets discriminatory results, not merely purposeful discrimination bystate policymakers. It forbidsstate laws that result in voters of color having ‘less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.’“Now, in, the results test is in the crosshairs. If the courtslashes what is left of the Voting Rights Act,states will have the green light to enact new votersuppression measures that make it harder for voters in communities of color to register to vote, cast ballots, and have them be properly counted. As in the aftermath ofShelby County,state votersuppression measures will once again proliferate. One of the most powerful weapons to combat whitesupremacy andsafeguard a participatory democracy will be reduced to a historical relic.”In The New York Times, Charles Blowwarned that votersuppression is “always draped in noble language” and “those whoseek to impede others from voting, insome cases tostrip them of the right, oftensay that they are doingso to ensure thesanctity, integrity or purity of the vote.“However, when the truth is laid bare, the defilement against which they rail is the voting power of the racial minority, the young — in their eyes, naïve and liberally indoctrinated — and the dyed-in-the-wool Democrats,” Blowsaid,citing 253 proposed bills that would restrict voting access in 43states. “They can use all manner of euphemism to make itsound honorable, but it is not. This is an electoral fleecing in plainsight, one targeting people of color. We are watching another of history’s racist robberies. It’s grand larceny and, as usual, what is beingstolen is power.”The right is hoping the Supreme Court narrows the places that Section 2 can be used, and makes it clear that any discrimination must be proven to be “substantial” for a court to throw out an electionsecurity provision. The Wall Street Journal editorial boardsaid the Supreme Court has a chance to“restore the Voting Rights Act to its original purpose,”noting that Section 2 initially required proving intent, not just outcome, before the law was expanded in the 1980s.“Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 tostopstates from disenfranchising blacks with underhanded methods like poll taxes and literacy tests,” the board wrote. “But Democrats now argue that anystate regulation that makes it a little harder for anyone to vote violates the law—even if it applies equally to minorities and whites. Importantly, the Voting Rights Act (VRA) puts the burden on plaintiffs toshow that minorities, based on the ‘totality of circumstances,’ have ‘less opportunity’ than others ‘to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.’“Even the Biden Justice Department told the High Court last month that it doesn’t ‘disagree’ with Arizona’s argument that its law is legal under Section 2’s ‘results test.’ The Court is highly likely to agree, and theshrewd liberal Justice Elena Kagan will no doubt tell Chief Justice John Roberts he can get a 9-0 ruling by holding that the Ninth Circuit committed a clear error in overturning the lower court findings of fact,” the boardsaid. “But that would be a lost opportunity…“Arizona’s election laws are clearly not a violation of Section 2 as a matter of law, and the Court needs to protectstate procedures that protect ballot integrity from electioneering lawsuits. But it would be even better if the Court goes further and clearly defines what the language of Section 2 means.”In SCOTUSblog, Megan A Larrondo and Robert A Berry, deputy attorney generals for thestate of Idaho, which joined Arizona,said “The courtshould clarify that, on a Section 2 challenge, the plaintiff mustshow that (1) the entire voting and registrationsystem provides voters insome protected groups with unequal voting opportunities and (2) the challenged law, notsome other factor, causes the unequal opportunity.“States are the entities entrusted with running elections,” they wrote. “States must be given thespace to enact and enforce neutral laws of general applicability to run those elections. The Supreme Courtshould reject an evidentiarystandard that puts a wideswath ofstate laws at risk and improperly inserts the federal judiciary in the role of micro manager ofstate electoralsystems.”Putting aside what the Supreme Court might do, or whether itshould rule in aspecific way, the central issue here is morestraightforward for me: that Arizona’s legislature is implementing these laws in the first place. At the Supreme Court, Democrats will probably have to prove that the laws Arizona is trying to enact are having astatistical, disproportionately negative impact on minority voters in the context of the electionsystem as a whole. They’llsimultaneously need to win the argument over how Section 2should apply to those laws. I don’t think their chances are good, and voting rights activists are wise to brace for impact. But just as Democrats will need toshow their work, Republicansshould too. That’s why the 2013 ruling, which pared back the Voting Rights Act, has beenso destructive. I’ll be the first to admit that ballot harvesting makes me uncomfortable. The idea of collecting and delivering a group of ballotsseems to give at least another opportunity in the chain of custody to commit fraud — and I’m not at allsure how I feel about it as a general idea. About half of thestates do not allow ballot harvesting, and Arizona isn’t unique for banning it. At thesame time, if the claim is that ballot harvesting leads to fraud, where’s the evidence? Before the law was passed,USA Today reported that there “has been no evidence or cases linked to fraud related to the collection of ballots.” In a 2016 ruling, Arizona judge William Fletchersaid thesame: “there is no evidence of any fraud in the long history of third-party ballot collection in Arizona.” I could find jus tone case of ballot harvesting that Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, who is taking this case to the Supreme Court, prosecuted in 2020. Two women from Yuma were charged with collecting four ballots in the August primary election. They’re now facing two years in jail and a $150,000 fine. This is the monumental threat to election integrity we’re worried about?Voting in the wrong precinct is a much more open andshut case to me. Itshould be allowed. Or, at the very least, votersshould have a chance to “cure” their ballots if it’s not. Casting a ballot in the wrong precinct is almost never asign of fraud, it’s asign of confusion. And it’s easy tosee why: many voters live further away from the precincts they’resupposed to be voting in. Sometimes voters move a few blocks in an urban area and return to thesame place they voted last time, only to find out they’re in the wrong place (this has, literally, happened to me). I don’t buy for a moment that throwing those votes out makes our elections moresecure. In Arizona, these challenges are unique. Democrats have rightly argued that minority voters cast a disproportionate number of out-of-precinct ballots. This is because, in Arizona, they are more likely to be low-income and thus more likely to have unstable housing, which means their address changes more often. Similarly, Native Americans and Latinos living in remote places in Arizona had previously leaned on community programs to collect and deliver their ballots (i.e. ballot harvesting). Given that these voters disproportionately cast ballots for Democrats, and absent any evidence that ballot harvesting or voting in the wrong precinct has opened the door to fraud in Arizona, it’s tough to conclude that this is anything but a cynical attempt by Republicans to preserve power in thestate legislature. If the goal is toshore up election integrity, why not actuallyshore it up? Build out the infrastructure to track voters who cast ballots out-of-precinct and create non-partisan, government-supported initiatives to ensure voters in remote areas can get their ballots in on time. A legislature honestly invested in election integrity and democratic participation would be pursuing goals like that, not going to the Supreme Court in a fight to throw ballots out and limit the ways voters can deliver their ballots to polling places. Amidst all this is the reality that Arizona Republicans are trying to thread an uncomfortable needle. They’resimultaneously framing this as astate’s rights argument but also bucking their ownsecretary ofstate, Katie Hobbs, who is a Democrat. Of course, Hobbs doesn’t (andshouldn’t) get to overrule the Republican-controlledstate legislature, but her dissent on this issue is notable. She is, by law, thestate’s highest-ranking election official. She has testified in court that ballot collection laws, as well as throwing out ballots cast in the wrong precinct, were “certainly meant to disenfranchise voters” and were “unnecessary because voter fraud already is a felony.” She won her election in 2018 running on a campaign to remove “barriers that can make it harder for minorities,seniors and low-income people to vote.” Thenshe inherited her predecessor’s legal fight that’s currently in front of the Supreme Court. I have loudly and proudly maintained that the 2020 election was one of the mostsecure in US history. There were instances of fraud, as there are in any election, but they were few and very far between. The vast majority of ballots were cast by mail, which requires paper ballots andseveral checks on a voter’s registration,signature, address and identification and are the easiest ballots to verify. In Arizona, this was not a big change from years past — 80% of voters cast ballots by mail. I’m a proponent ofsecuring elections. Adding more checks to thesystem, insisting on paper ballots that create a reliable trail and creating a central database to track voters acrossstates and precincts would make our elections moresecure. I’m also interested in ways to make it easier for more people to vote withoutsacrificing that integrity. I don’tsee how these laws do that. And while protecting them may be a winning case in front of the Supreme Court, the fact the Arizona legislature passed them in the first place is a losing cause for Arizonans and the American public. Generallyspeaking, the argument they are bad hinges on three things: 1) asylum law 2) the conditions of the facilities and 3) familyseparation. In general terms, American asylum law dictates that anyone arriving at our border canseek asylum here if they qualify as a refugee. Part of that qualification involves reasonable fear about returning home. Since 2004, the vast majority of people who arrive at the border go through expedited removal processes. In that process, they arescreened to determine if they have a credible or reasonable fear about returning home, and are then detained until appearing in court, or they’re assigned a court date and released into the US, where they often will find friends or family (this is often referred to as “catch and release”). Opponents of migrant detention facilities generally point to the high rates of return for court appearances as proof that detention is not necessary. At thesame time,Democrats contend that conditions for children at these migrant facilities amount to prison: cold temperatures, lack of clothing, lack of food, lack of education or physical activity, and mistreatment from immigration law enforcement officers have all been documented. Access to the facilities for inspection has at times been limited or outright denied. There is a history of medical abuse and neglect. Finally, the issue ofseparation: migrant facilities for childrensometimes exclude adults, meaning parents can beseparated from their children when they are detained at the border. This was obviously a prominent issue under Trump, but has occurred in other administrations, too. The case for migrant facilities is basically all of these things inverted: That thousands of migrants are “released” into the US and nevershow up for court; that facilities are necessary but need better funding to accommodate the migrants; that if we don’t want to house migrants then we cansimply deport them or keep them on the Mexicanside of the border; and that familyseparation acts as a deterrent against immigrants attempting to cross the border in the first place. Personally, I’m not opposed to migrant facilities in principle. I think housing asylumseekers, especially children, is an inherently good thing when they arrive at the border. But I certainly think the facilities need better funding — or perhaps better allocations of funding — to ensure the children are kept in an environment that at least approachessomething that’s appropriate for kids. Many facilities, right now, are not meeting thatstandard. New datashow that one year into the pandemic, which forcedstates to revise their revenue forecasts, many of the worst outcomes have not come to fruition. That’s in part due to a $600-a-week federal unemploymentsupplement, according to a new analysis. But it will hamper the case in the Senate tospend big on filling budget gaps at thestate level. “Bysome measures, thestates ended up collecting nearly as much revenue in 2020 as they did in 2019,”The New York Times reports.“A JP Morgansurvey called 2020 “virtually flat” with 2019, based on the 47states that report their tax revenues every month, or all except Alaska, Oregon and Wyoming.” Totalstate revenues were down just 1.8% from April to December this year compared to 2019. A New Jersey plumber drove 22 hours to Texas to help people who were overwhelmed by the winterstorm. Andrew Mitchell, along with his wife, 2-year-oldson and apprentice, packed $2,000 of equipment into his car and took off for Texas to help out. “A lot of the people we’ve helped were telling us they either can’t get a plumber on the phone or—if they do get one on the phone—the wait to beserviced is three to four weeks out,so they can’t have water during that entire time,” his wife Kisha told the BBC Mitchell firststopped at hissister-in-law’s home, then worked out from there,servicing 6 to 10 houses a day for more than a week.

Collectively, they’ll get $791 million from the richest man on Earth, although Bezos did notspecify how much would go to each group.“I’vespent the pastseveral months learning from a group of incrediblysmart people who’ve made it their life’s work to fight climate change and its impact on communities around the world,” Bezossaid on Instagram. “I’m inspired by what they’re doing, and excited to help themscale.” The Amazon CEOannounced the creation of his personal $10 billion Bezos Earth Fund in February. Support for mainstream environmental groupsHis fund is equivalent to more than 7 percent of his net worth. It’s also10 times as much as philanthropic foundations gave globally in 2018 to efforts toslow climate change. For his first round of funding, Bezos chose to back a handful of legacy organizations with an established history of advocacy on behalf of the planet. His choice in recipientsso farsignalssupport for mainstream environmental groups rallying for new policies and research on climate change. It’s alsosomewhat of a departure from contributions that Amazon and other giants have made recently to climate techstartups. Amazon,Microsoft, andStripe, in contrast to Bezos, have all pledged to funnel money toward developing brand-new technologies to reduce and capture their industries’ greenhouse gas emissions. Much oft he first round of funding from Amazon’s $2 billion climate fund will go toward getting more electric vehicles on the road and capturing carbon dioxide emissions, the company announced in September. Microsoftsaid in Januarythat it wouldspend $1 billion over four years on technologies that remove planet-heating carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. Carbon-capture tech favored by tech companies isstill in its infancyBut the carbon-capture tech favored by tech companies isstill in its infancy. In contrast,some of the advocacy groups Bezos pledged to fund today have been fighting for environmental protectionssince close to the birth of the modern environmental movement in in the US in the 1960s. That includes the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC), which is led byGina McCarthy, an Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency administrator and vocal critic of Trump’s environmental rollbacks. “This generous gift from the Bezos Earth Fund enables NRDC to move even faster on achieving the climatesolutions we need at the federal,state and local levels to protect people’s health,strengthen nature’s ability to help fight climate change and grow the clean energysector and all the jobs that come with it,” McCarthysaid in astatement. Bezos also named the Environmental Defense Fund, which tends to take a more corporate-friendly approach to its advocacy. It’s worked with companies like Walmart and McDonald’s on theirsustain ability goals. “The needs are enormous,” Environmental Defense Fund president Fred Krupp told after the Bezos fund was announced in February. “No matter what organization receives this funding, what’s important is that the money be put to work.” Krupp and McCarthy’s organizations will each receive $100 million, according tostatements from each group. Some of the big green groups Bezos chose, however, have been beset byscandal lately. Human rights abuses came to light in a 2019investigationinto the nearly 60-year-old conservation charity World Wildlife Fund. The organization’s anti-poaching effortssupported paramilitary groups that captured, tortured, and killed villagers and indigenous peoples in Asia and Africa,BuzzFeedreported. Two more groups Bezos will fund have had recentshifts in leadership as part of a broader reckoning withsystemic racism andsexism with inscience fieldsandenvironmentalism. The CEO of conservation group Nature Conservancy decided tole ave his post in June 2019following allegations of gender discrimination within the organization. The president of the Union of Concerned Scientists, Ken Kimmell,said that he wouldstep dow nat the end of the year. Kimmell’s decision follows the high-profile resignation of the organization’s former coalitions coordinator, Ruth Tyson,who penned a public lettersaying, “It was reallystressful and traumatic for me working [at the Union of Concerned Scientists] and I hope no other Black people ever have toshare this pain.” World Wildlife Fund and Nature Conservancysaid they would each get $100 million from Bezos’ fund, while the Union of Concerned Scientistssaid it’s been given $15 million. Among the established organizations, Bezos also decided to fund a recently formed group that centers racial equity in its work, the NDN Collective. It was founded by a diverse group of Native American activists in 2018 to fund andsupport indigenous-led movements andsustain ability initiatives. Bezos will also fund the new Hive Fund for Climate and Gender Justice, which was launched in 2019 with a focus onsupporting women in the Southeast US Bezos is funding research groups, too, like the nonprofit Rocky Mountain Institute and World Resources Institute.

153,Symbols and Words from the Pope in Iraq,1.67,38.33,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/symbols-and-words-from-the-pope-in-iraq/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-09,25,"It was the clumps of beard hair on the ground thatstay in my memory, even more than the destroyed buildings. Walking around the Old City of Mosul in May 2018, accompanied by an Iraqi police general and armed guards, we were guided along the paths that had been cleared of ISIS booby-traps and unexploded coalition bombs. Several of the churches had only been cleared of bodies in the previous days, and the unpleasantsludge of remains wasstill visible on the floors. The Islamic State had used many of the churches in the Old City, all now destroyed orseverely damaged, as headquarters, prisons, and torture chambers. My friend—a journalist and fellow Englishman traveling with me—remarked that there was human hair on the floor; I told him it was just carpet. Yet as we looked into a room where another body had been, I realized that it human hair, facial hair. The general told us that ISIS fighters hadshaved their beards in the last days of fighting in order to avoid capture. During their brutal control of Mosul, where Abu Al-Baghdadi had proclaimed the caliphate, from 2014 to 2017, men of the Islamic State were expected to grow their beards long, and could face 20 lashes if theyshaved. Destruction was all around: cars riddled with bullet holes or upside down, andso many buildings destroyed, with rubble everywhere. A year later I was back. Thesituation had improvedsomewhat, withsome of the rubble cleared and many buildings, including the building where ISIS threw homosexuals from the roof, fully demolished. However, the churches werestill in wreckage, and the only church due to reopen was a prefabricated building that had been in a refugee camp in Erbil, which was being moved to Mosul. Virtually no Christian families had returned, and there was no resident priest or bishop. This last Sunday, Pope Francis became not only the first pope in history to visit Iraq, but one of the very few international figures to venture into the Old City of Mosul. Hisshort visit, to thesamesquare,surrounded by the destroyed churches of the different denominations that had once thrived in this ancient city, was a remarkable moment, perhaps the most remarkable picture of the three-day visit to Iraq. It was notso much what hesaid—he recited a prayer for all the victims of war and violence and called for peace and toleration—but thesymbolism of his presence. There isstill no resident bishop, only one resident priest, and that pre-fabricated building is now the Church of the Annunciation, the only functioning church in the city. Very few Christian families have returned. Mosul has not been rebuilt and many residents feel that the Iraqi government has greatly neglected the city. It isstill considered dangerous, with ISIS cells re-emerging and, more importantly, the different Shia militias (who are the real powerbrokers) vying for control. Add to that thestory that was barely touched on by the world media—the desire of an expansionist Turkey to claim back Mosul, a city it once controlled under the Ottoman empire—and the full import of the moment becomes apparent: The pope of Rome came whenso many fear to return. Iraq’s beleaguered Christian population, and other religious minorities, especially the Yazidis, hoped that the pope’s visit will bring the world’s attention to their plight, and that the civil powers in both Iraq and the Kurdish Regional Government would fully recognize their civil rights. Christiansspecifically wanted Pope Francis to encourage them, acknowledge the martyrdom that manysuffered, and be a voice for their future. His words to Iraqi civic leaders on his arrival, apart from the usual niceties, had two direct challenges that the precarious minority groups wanted to hear: He challenged corruption and “disregard for law” in Iraqisociety, and he asked that “no one be considered asecond-class citizen.” The Iraqi Constitution treats all non-Muslims assecond-class citizens, not equal under the law,so thisstatement was essential, but not as forceful as many had hoped it would be. Perhaps the most powerful words addressing thesuffering Christians had endured were uttered in the Syriac Catholic Cathedral of Our Lady of Salvation, after the meeting with civil leadership. That was the church where, in 2010, Islamist terrorists had attacked the congregation during mass, detonatingsuicide vests to kill two priests and more than 40 men, women, and children. The pope described the cathedral as a place “hallowed by the blood of our brothers andsisters who here paid the ultimate price for their fidelity to the Lord and His Church.” He reminded the Christians, and more importantly those who deny the Christian population a place in Iraq, that Iraq is a “landso closely linked to the history ofsalvation, and you are a part of that history.”Many Christians in Iraq had worried that the emphasis of the Vatican would be on religious dialogue and “Human Fraternity.” And that was certainly a major feature of the visit, referred to in almost everyspeech. The key moment, joint prayers with other religious groups at the birthplace of Abraham in Ur, was certainly astrikingspectacle, but noticeably absent and unmentioned was the former Jewish community of Iraq. The great fear of Christians is that what happened to the Jews will happen to them. Francisstrongly condemned the persecution of the Yazidi community,something to be welcomed, and particularly drew the world’s attention to the thousands of Yazidi women and childrenstill missing. The courtesy visit to the Grand Ayatollah al-Sistani, thespiritual leader of Iraq’s Shiite Muslims, did not bring hissignature to the Abu-Dhabi agreement on “Human Fraternity,”signed in February 2019 that the Vatican had hoped for, but Sistani’s words on the right of Christians to equality in Iraqisociety were very valuable. Apart from the hugelysymbolic moments in Mosul on Sunday, the last two events of the trip were meant to be entirely devoted to the Christian communities of the Nineveh Plain who havesufferedso much at the hands of ISIS Undoubtably the pope’s presence was the cause of the greatest joy. Perhaps his rather understated words both in Qaraqosh, the largest Christian town on the Nineveh Plain, and in the final mass in Erbil will not be remembered for their lack of emphasis on thesufferings the communities had endured. While encouraging Christians to “not give up,” and “not lose hope,” peculiar phrases in the last homily at thesoccerstadium in Erbil warned that “hearts must be cleansed from the temptations of power and money,” which caused a degree of confusion, given that most of the Christians on the Nineveh Plain have neither. Some arespeculating that the influence of Fr. Antonio Spadaro, one of the Pope’s closest advisors, could beseen in many of thespeeches and homilies. The long-termsuccess of the visit will be judged on two factors: firstly, whether Christians and other religious minorities are given equal rights under the Iraqi Constitution; andsecondly, whether the dangerous level of emigration of Christian families and young people can be reversed, which may depend on economicstability and the hope of employment. The fact that the pope came, in a time of pandemic and danger, issomething all Iraqis, and certainly the indigenous Christian community, welcomed and appreciated with great joy. Whether the visit will be remembered as a beautifulsymbol, and not much else, remains to beseen.",1,1,The American Conservative
154,How to Forecast Outbreaks and Pandemics,-2.67,46.67,https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/united-states/2020-06-29/how-forecast-outbreaks-and-pandemics,https://adfontesmedia.com/foreign-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-29,17,"In 1900, the deadliest hurricane in US history hit Galveston, Texas. Thestorm, estimated to have been a Category 4, all but washed the city away. An estimated8,000 people died, and even more lives would likely have been lost if Isaac Cline, the chief of the Texassection of the US Weather Service, had notspent the day before the hurricane’s arrival walking around and urging people toseek higher ground. He didso on little more than a hunch based on the fact that a badstorm had recently passed over Cuba. Thescience of weather forecasting had yet to emerge; guesswork was the best anyone could do. Over a century later,hurricane forecasts are a central feature ofsummer and fall for millions of Americans. Such forecasts, along with those predicting winterstorms, tornadoes, and floods, havesaved an untold number of lives and many billions of dollars. Even fair-weather forecasts play an important role in modern life. Take the airline industry, for example. “Even when you’ve got clearskies, that has an economic benefit,” explained Greg Romano of the National Weather Service, “because then you don’t necessarily need to plan to reroute as much,so you can perhaps take on less fuel; you know that you can have tighterschedules.”With the world moving quickly toward an age of pandemics, thestory of how weather forecasting in the USs improved deserves attention. Because when it comes to modeling the likely course of contagious outbreaks, the country is insome ways closer to the bad old days of deadly, no-notice hurricanes than to the current era of precisionstorm tracking and multi day weather forecasts. Today, if a hurricane was barreling down on Florida, no one wouldsuggest that an arbitrary assortment of academics gather data, quickly develop models to predict thestorm’s course, anticipate its landfall, tell agencies where to preposition response teams, and craft warnings for the public. That, however, is essentially what the US government has done during the COVID-19 pandemic. Of course,sophisticated disease modeling has contributed a great deal to the response to the pandemic. Early in the outbreak,modelersestimated that the new coronavirus would prove more deadly than influenza. Others concluded that rapid containment of the virus in China was unlikely, based on the unusually high number of infected international travelers. And when the USs was in the throes of the worst outbreak in the world, it was modelers whose work informed the White House task force that coordinated the federal response, including the decision to begin (and later extend) the “Slow the Spread” campaign ofsocial-distancing measures and business closures. Unfortunately, however, the full force of epidemiological expertise in the USs is not being brought to bear. Despitesomesuccesses,serious gaps remain in the ability of infectious disease models to inform public health policy. That is because the country has no centralizedsystem for disease forecasting; there exists no epidemiological equivalent of the National Weather Service. That is precisely what the country needs tosucceed in the fight against COVID-19 and to avoid future failures and missteps of thesort that has marred the US response to the current pandemic. This is hardly the first time that academics have filled the disease-modeling vacuum. In 2009, during the H1N1 pandemic, officials in Pennsylvania consulted modelers as they deliberated about whether toshut downschools. During the Ebola outbreak of 2014, modelers helped the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Department of Health and Human Servicescalculate the risk that travelers would import cases into the USs, how many hospital beds would be needed domestically, and how many future cases could be expected under varyingscenarios. But after those outbreaks ended, the ad hoc and informal ties that had developed between modelers and decision-makers were not institutionalized;no formalsystem emerged for centralizing expertise within the government. So itshould have been nosurprise that the few modeling experts who do this work within government agencies were quickly overwhelmed by the enormous number of consequential decisions demanded by the COVID-19 pandemic. And once again, academic modelers havestepped in to fill the gap. This is part of a familiar pattern. During contagion crises, modeling becomes a priority. However, ast hesense of urgency fades, attentionshifts to other issues and relationships between experts and decision-makers fade. The chief danger is that as the results of modelingshift, those changes won’t get on the radar of policymakers. “The projections provide information at a particular moment but unfortunately will change all the time. It’s important to communicate that uncertainty,”said Jeffrey Shaman, a professor of environmental healthsciences at Columbia University. Shaman’s research has been consulted by the White House task force on COVID-19, but Shamansays that the working relationship has been limited. The CDC’s epidemiology task force has convened weekly meetingswith pandemic experts. These meetings are a marked improvement in coordination and information exchange oversuch efforts in previous outbreaks. However, the connection to key decision-makers, including the White House task force, has not been clear. One result has been a proliferation of models without enough people to makesense of them. “It’s really hard toseparate the wheat from the chaff, withoutsomeone or a group of people evaluating the assumptions and form of each model,”said Shaman. “There are a lot of teams who want to contribute to modeling efforts, but we don’t have a clear game plan forseparating and combining the various projections.”To better integrate disease forecasting into decision-making, the CDC and other public health agenciesshould look to the history of the National Weather Service for inspiration. Americans take for granted the elaborate, highly detailed weather information they can easily access. Butsuch tools developed only after decades ofsustained public investment. Numerical weather forecasting emerged in the 1920s in the wake of mathematical advances that helped describe atmospheric physics. Decades later, computers allowed meteorologists to apply more elaborate models. Othernew technologies—aircraft, weather balloons,satellites, and digital communications—made it possible forscientists to add ever more data to the models, creating a virtuous cycle that led to progressive improvements in forecasting over time. National Weather Service employees monitorstorm maps and data in Norman, Oklahoma, April 2019William Widmer / The New York Times / ReduxBut technological change is only part of thestory; the other part involves organizational change. During the Civil War era, tracking and anticipating weather was a largely academic effort. Later, disparate independent efforts emerged in multiple federal agencies, including the Department of War, the Department of Agriculture, and the Navy. Finally, in the late 1960s, what would eventually become theNational Weather Servicewas established as an integrated office in the Department of Commerce. This unification and centralization was crucial: it allowed forsignificant investment over time and created astable point of contact between forecasters and policymakers by giving weather experts a permanentseat at the table. Outbreak modeling and analyticsshould be centralized in asimilar way. Over the last decade orso, public investments in disease forecasting have yieldedsome progress. Programs funded by theNational Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Homeland Security have advanced modeling capabilities, generated excellent research, and helped to develop a cadre of well-trained experts. These programs, however, are largely focused on developing basicscience, as opposed to helping public health officials navigate difficult decisions about outbreak control. And they rarely receive the kind of reliable,sustained funding that has longsupported weather forecasting. Generally, funding takes the form of grants to principal investigators that typically last only three to five years and must result in academic publications—the kind of research that is necessary but notsufficient to the task at hand.“Everyone is on grants,” noted Cécile Viboud, astaffscientist at the National Institutes of Health. “So if you don’t have a particular dedicated line of funding to work on the [outbreak], then you do it on your own time. You just run those estimates because maybe it can help.”Making matters worse, private-sector innovation and advanced data technologies have hardly made an appearance when it comes to contagion modeling, in part because there is usually not a great deal of market demand, public health agencies are ill-equipped to evaluate new data technologies, and new technologies must pass through a torturous regulatory path before gaining approval. Roni Rosenfeld, a professor of computerscience at Carnegie Mellon University, pointed out another problem. “By far the biggest obstacle is the data,” he lamented. Health data are fragmented across the US health-caresystem insilos that cannot talk to one another. And public health agencies are not known for being forward leaning on data technology. This hampers their ability to acquire, process,share, analyze, and communicate data that would inform an outbreak response.“There is nosystematic report format for individual locations to provide data in,”said Lauren Gardner, an engineering professor at Johns Hopkins University who led the team that built the university’scoronavirus map, which has become one of the most reliablesources of data on thespread of COVID-19. “Even when data is provided, it may not be in a usable format. Together these issuessubstantially limit the capabilities of disease models to be able to inform policy in real time.”Unfortunately, the pandemic is laying bare these data challenges. The White House task force announced last month that all 4,700 orso hospitals in the USs would be asked tosend daily em ails to the task force with data on their capacities. It’s baffling that in the country thatsparked the digital revolution, hospitals must rely onsuch a rudimentary, unreliable tool in order to transmit vital information. It’s alsostriking that the most timely and detailed data on new cases of COVID-19, diagnostic testing, and personal protective equipment have been available mostly through websitesset up and run by volunteers or journalists. It is wonderful thatso manyskilled individuals have been motivated to help out in a time of crisis. But the country’s pandemic response cannot rely on volunteers. And although journalism is crucial during an outbreak, responsibility for tracking thespread of contagions can hardly be outsourced to media organizations. The best way to address these vulnerabilities would be the establishment of a National Center for Epidemic Forecasting and Analytics (CEFA). The center would handle research and development in outbreakscience, develop technology for producing disease forecasts, and provide guidance for preparedness and response to outbreaks. The center’sstructureshould resemble that of the National Weather Center, located at the University of Oklahoma. The NWC has a uniquestructure that enables academics to work closely with federal employeesand develop a mutual understanding of respective challenges and capabilities. In thesame manner, the new center would work with the CDC, nonprofit organizationssuch as the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists, public health departments in all 50states, and the National Governors Association to improve outbreakscience and analytics, decision-making during outbreaks, and the data and technologies needed tosupport these efforts. During an epidemic outbreak, CEFAscientists could help to forecast how many cases might emerge in a given place during a given period, which interventions would be most effective, and where to direct resources, and would assess progress in the fight against the pathogen. During the COVID-19 pandemic, each jurisdiction has been on its own when it comes to finding modelers to help make those kinds of determinations. Sadly, those jurisdictions without access to world-class modelers or epidemiologists were left out in the cold. CEFA would change that by providing all governors and mayors access to high-level insights. Between outbreaks, CEFAscientists would develop new models and advance thescience of forecasting and analyzing outbreaks, just as atmosphericscientists work constantly to improve the accuracy of weather models. Initially, the center would focus on improving the predictive analytics needed to produce forecasts of new cases and deaths. It would also work to improve visualizations and communication approaches to make as clear as possible the implications and uncertainties involved in all modeling. To besuccessful, CEFAscientists would need the ability to directly advise decision-makers on preparedness and response, as forecasters do in other countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, theScientific Advisory Group for Emergenciesbrings together experts in various fields, including epidemiology and modeling, to advise the government. The United Kingdom has not always managed tosuccessfully bringscientific expertise to bear on emergencies, but the fact that it has a formalized way of bringing experts together puts it in a better position than the USs. Other countries havesimilar mechanisms. In the Netherlands, for example, theInfectious Diseases Modelling tea mat the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment is chaired by Jacco Wallinga, an esteemed modeling expert who also holds a prominent academic position. In addition to working with officials, just as local meteorologists translate the complex weather models into forecasts that are easily understood by the public, CEFAscience communicators could bring forecasts and analyses to the public to help individual decision-making. Just as people rely on weather reports to know when to bring an umbrella, CEFA forecasts could make it easier to decide whether to tele work during fluseason or whether to wear a face covering. People want to know how to keep themselves and their familiessafe, and providing information to help them doso would be an enormous advance for public health. To meet its mission, the center would need to be able to identify, adapt, and adopt cutting-edge technology and attract the best datascientists, engineers, and technologists. That would requiresignificant,sustained funding: approximately $1 billion over the next ten years. But it would be money wellspent. The COVID-19 pandemicshouldserve as the epidemiological equivalent of the Galveston hurricane. It is astark reminder that Americans are vulnerable to the forces of nature. But as with weather forecasting, withsufficient vision and investment, the USs can develop the ability to anticipate and respond tosuch outbreaks. The country can do better—and it must do better,so that this never happens again.",2,2,Foreign Affairs
155,We Must Change How Our Criminal Justice System Treats People with Mental Illness,-7.67,42.0,https://time.com/5876045/we-must-change-how-our-criminal-justice-system-treats-people-with-mental-illness/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,25,"In this moment of rethinking law enforcement, we must examine how both our policing and our correctionalsystem exacerbate the crisis of mental health in America. As an inpatient psychiatrist, I treat patients who are psychotic, plagued by voices or visions or paranoid delusions. Or they are in the throes of mania. Or they are actively trying to harm themselves or others. Their lives are replete with hardship. Many of my patients are homeless. Some are drug-addicted. Nearly all have been victims ofsignificant trauma. They have fewsafe havens, and the illnesses that besiege their minds wage a relentless war on theirstability, their happiness, theirsafety. Many of them alsoserve or haveserved time in jail and prison. Environments that exacerbate psychiatricsymptoms and routinely make mentally ill people worse and in which they face a disproportionate risk of being victimized by both officers and other inmates. In addition to my work at the hospital, I also perform forensic evaluations for the courts, and once I began working in prisons I found asystem that runs counter to every principle of human flourishing that I know. Mentally ill Americanssuffer from diseases of the mind, but when they come in contact with police, they alsosuffer from our law enforcement policies. At the 2016 annual meeting of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law, former Portland, Oregon police commander Sara Westbrook illustrated this truth to a roomful of doctors. She recounted a call her department had recently received about a mentally ill man at the city’s downtown Waterfront Park. The man was large and muscular and had a gallon jug filled with fluid attached to a long chain. He was grunting loudly,swinging the chain in a large circle above his head, and charging at people. The police arrived, and the man began charging at the officers. Over the course of the next two and a half or three hours, the police officers worked diligently to get the man into custody with what Commander Westbrook described as “very little force.” When theysucceeded, they took him to the hospital for psychiatric care. But due to a chronicshortage of psychiatric hospital beds, he was discharged from the ER before the police paperwork had even been finished. Police wouldsoon be called again, and this time they would take the man to jail. Encounters with police require obedience, and people with manic or psychoticsymptoms—who are in the grip of delusions, or who are distracted by visions or voices, for example—are not always able to comply. The misalignment between the expectation that people follow commands and their medical inability to doso has the potential for disaster. Of the roughly 1,000 fatalshootings by police in 2018,approximately 25% of the victims were mentally ill. People with mental illness aresixteen times more likely to be killed in a police encounter than people who are psychiatrically well. Thisstatistic is even moresobering given that it is often desperate friends or family membersseeking help for their mentally ill loved one who have called police in the first place. Even when, as in this case, police are able tosafely de-escalate a psychiatric emergency, their presence at the front lines of mental health crises means that they—not clinicians—decide whether a personshould be taken to jail or to the hospital. In the moment of the police encounter, law enforcement becomes the arbiter of psychiatric care. Once police are involved, even if they attempt to opt for treatment over punishment, a therapeutic and just outcome is by no means guaranteed. If psychiatric units are full, police are often forced to turn to jails to house the acutely mentally ill—facilities that have what a prison psychologist once described to me as “an iron-clad, no-refusal, admission policy.”When mentally ill people in crisis are not admitted to hospitals, Westbrooksaid,she and her officers view taking them to jail as a last resort act of compassion. Given the lack of communityservices available for the mentally ill,shesaid, jail is at least “three hots and a cot, and I knowsomebody will check to makesure they’restill breathing.”Across the country, jail is nowseen as a treatment option—andsometimes the lone treatment option—for disadvantaged citizens with mental illness. There is even a term for this response: compassionate arrest. We use “compassionate arrests” only for people whosuffer from lack of access to care for their psychiatric illnesses. We would never incarcerate people in order to obtain treatment for their cancer, or their asthma, or their diabetes. But we have come to treat psychiatric crises as legal problems rather than the health care emergencies that they are. The consequences ofsuch an approach arestark, and have resulted in the fact that today our country’s largest mental health institution, holding more than 2,000 mentally ill people, is Chicago’s Cook County Jail. We have ended up as asociety like this because of a veryspecificseries of choices by the government over the last 50 years. The closing ofstate psychiatric hospitals in the 1960s, ’70s, and ’80s led directly to the influx of mentally ill people into correctional facilities. The prospect of liberating tens of thousands of people from long-term psychiatric institutions was initially thrilling, especially given the egregious treatment and even abuse that many of the facilities’ residents had endured in the name of psychiatric “care.” In 1963 the Community Mental Health Centers Act was passed with the intention ofshifting care for the mentally ill out of the asylums and into the communities. State mental hospitals across the country were de funded and closed, but the accompanying promises of community resources—from psychiatric treatment to vocational training tosocialsupports—never materialized. Without funds, without treatment, andsuddenly also without housing, our nation’s most vulnerable citizens fell out of health care and into the realm of the legalsystem. The criminalization of mental illness had begun. Since that time, the field of psychiatry hasseen more than fifty years of institutional reform alongside tremendous advances in neuroscience and pharmacology. The care that hospitals like mine are now able to provide is both humane and therapeutic. However, the woefully insufficient funding of mental healthcare in America has only worsened, and thereforesuch care is not widely accessible. Following the 2008 recession, five billion dollars were cut fromstate mental healthservices and 4,500 psychiatric hospital beds were eliminated across the country. The lack of resources for psychiatric care in our communities means that people whosuffer fromsevere mental illness all too often receive inadequate treatment, if they receive treatment at all. With a chronic lack of availability of both inpatient and outpatient mental healthservices, our mentally ill citizens are relegated to emergency rooms, to homelessshelters, and to correctional facilities. As a result, oursystem continues to indiscriminatelyshift large numbers of people who belong in therapeutic environments into punitive ones. Today, ten times more people withserious mental illness are in our nation’s correctional facilities than in ourstate psychiatric hospitals. Once in jail—no matter the rationale behind the incarceration, no matter thestate of their minds—all people behind bars aresubjected to thesamestrict rules and harsh punishments. When we under fund psychiatric care in our country and then ask police toserve on the front lines of mental health emergencies, everyone loses. People who belong on treatment wards end up on cellblocks, and the results can be catastrophic. If my patients become assaultive in the hospital, theirsymptoms are more aggressively targeted with medications and therapy. We aim to quickly andsafely reduce their delusions or ease their hallucinations. In correctional facilities the responses to thesame actions are drastically different, as was true for a man I evaluated who, in the grip of paranoia, punched a correctional officer. He incurred a felony assault charge that comes with a possible penalty of 15 years in prison. In just this way, when we punish people for thesymptoms of their illnesses, our overcrowded correctional facilities become inundated with the psychiatrically ill. The practicestrains our prisonsystem and drains money fromstate coffers. It is also unjust and cruel. Widespread demands for change offer us an opportunity. Calls toshift money from policing to mental health can move people whosuffer from mental illness from beneath the auspices of police and corrections and back into healthcare where they belong. But if we continue to use police as the front line workers for mental healthcare, we perpetuate the criminalization of mental illness that begansixty years ago at great cost to the legalsystem, to the mentally ill, and to us all.

At the time of the pandemic declaration, WHO General-Director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesussaid it was unprecedented.""'Pandemic' is not a word to use lightly or carelessly.

Uprisings in Portland have happened nightlysince the end of May, in response to police violence against Black Americans, including renewed attention to Jason Washington, a Black resident of the city who wasshot and killed by police in 2018. Tensions have escalated in recent weeks as federal officers began appearing at the events. Last week, there were reports of agents in unmarked vansstopping next to protesters, whisking them away in the vehicles withoutstated justification and without identifying who they were. Those actions prompted outcry from Portland residents, and action from a group of mothers who appeared over the weekend to protect demonstrators bystanding between them and officers. Those individuals, known as the Wall of Moms for their way of interlocking arms as a means to protect protesters, were themselves attacked by officers with tear gas during their peaceful demonstrations. On Monday,severalsocial media posts from the group known as “PDX Dad Pod” encouraged its members and others to appear with leaf blowers, even telling users who followed them onsocial media that it would be a great purchase tosupport local businesses. Video from confrontations between demonstrators and officers on Monday night into Tuesday morning highlighted how protesters used hockeysticks toscoot tear gas canisters back toward those who fired them, and the leaf blowers as a means to dissipate clouds of chemicals away from protesters. Smaller leaf blowers were also used to help get chemicals off people’s bodies, video alsoshowed. A creative protester at Riot Ribs uses a leaf blower to get tear gas off other protesters.

When theystartedsnatching people [off] thestreet, it becomes apparent that the federal government is just … not in check,” Turnersaid. “It was even tampering down, and then the feds get involved and lit it up. It’s like throwing gas on a fire.” After word reached the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) about the use of leaf blowers against tear gas, an official within the department told Washington Post reporter Nick Miroff that they were frustrated with efforts by protesters to doso, and astonished that they’d return the chemicals back toward the federal officers who initially fired them off. That prompted a number of responses,some comical andsome in disbelief, from users onsocial media over that official’s bewilderment.

159,The Tax Day Outrage You Don’t Know About,-4.71,40.71,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2019/04/16/the-tax-day-outrage-you-dont-know-about/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"If you like to leave things until the last minute, you probably know April 15 as the day tosquint at a 1040 tax form or rush through TurboTax. In the past, conservatives have also used this occasion to rally against Big Government, or to write listicleschronicling “six of the more infuriating ways that [tax] money has gone to waste.”But the lesser known fact about Tax Day is all the money that come in. ProPublicaestimatesthat every year, the public misses out on $18 billion in revenue thanks to a whittled down workforce of government tax auditors. Hamstrung by eight years of budget cuts, the Internal Revenue Service hasshedstaff dramatically. As of 2017, the organization had 9,510 auditors—a third less than it had in 2010. That means fewer bookkeepers to investigateshady claims or to go after people who don’t bother to file taxes. No wonder the department’s inspector general estimates that the amount of lost revenue has gone up by at least $3 billion each year. It’s just one example of how politically popular calls to cut federal workers often don’t pan out to be thestraight-forward, belt-tightening measures they’re pitched to be.“It’s been two yearssince we’ve hired anyone,” one Department of Labor bureaucrattoldRachel Cohen, writing for. “We’ve lost 25 percent of ourstaff, and our employees know nobody is being hired—but we’re not allowed to admit it.”That Trump’s bureaucracy is riddled with vacancies is intentional. Soon after taking office in 2017, the president announced a freeze on hiring federal workers. He reversed that decision 79 days later, but Trump’s budget director Mick Mulvaney (now doubling as his acting Chief of Staff)solicited recommendations on how to rebuild the executive branch “fromscratch.” Mulvaneysaid that Trump wanted tostart with “a literal blank piece of paper.”He’s hardly the first president to push for an overhaul of the executive branch. Bill Clinton’s ‘Reinventing Government’ initiative called for eliminating hundreds of thousands of government positions, and he followed through. Regan and George W Bush pressed for cutstoo. Sometimes the rationale is belt-tightening;sometimes it’s making government more competent. Often, it’s both. Butsimply cutting the government work force, both in executive agencies and in Congress, often achieves neither aim.“Hiring freezes—not only in terms of explicit policy but also thestruggle to hire when the budget isso uncertain—these have huge and dramatic implications for the federal government”said Donald Kettl, a politicalscientist at University of Texas at Austin. Whenstaff are cut in government, agenciesstill have to find a way to complete their legally required duties. The Social Security Administration can’t notsend out checks. The IRS can’t not collect taxes. Enter private contractors, hired to help the government do its work when federal employees have been whittled down. Writing for this magazine, Gilad Edelmanshowedthat while the US population has balloonedsince the mid 1960s, the federal work force in 2016 was about thesamesize as it was in 1966. What has gone up, however, is the number of contractors the government uses. They tend to be more costly than civilservants,sometimes dramaticallyso, which is why just cutting federal workers doesn’t alwayssave taxpayer money. It’s also vital that the government have enoughstaff to oversee those contractors. But often, they don’t. When the US went to war in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, it dramatically increased the cost and complexity of its private defense contracts. A government report found that the work of the federal employees who manage these contractors increasedseven-fold. But the number of defense contract managers was cut in half in the mid 1990s, and it continued to decrease even when their workload went up. Partially as a result, cost overruns for weaponssystems contracts went from an average of 6 percent in 2000 to 25 percent in 2009. Sometimes, regulatory agencies actually turn to the industry they’re overseeing for extra manpower—in effect asking private companies to help regulate themselves. The Federal Aviation Administration, for example, has for years enlisted Boeing’s assistance in inspecting and approving the company’s own planes. That policy of delegation has come underscrutiny after two crashes involving Boeing’s 737 Max 8 jets. “Itseems pretty clear that the FAA didn’t have the capacity to be able to review the plans that Boeing was putting forward,”says Kettl. But this problem isn’t just limited to the executive branch. It’s an issue for Congress, too. As Iwrotefor the most recent issue of the, legislators’struggles with technology can be traced back tostaffing cuts in the 1990s, when Republicans won both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years and called for budget cuts across government. They eliminated the Office of Technology Assessment, which helped educate legislators and theirstaff onscience and technology. They cut a third ofstaffers in the House who work on committees—where much of the policymaking happens. And they cutsupport agencies, like the Congressional Research Service and the Government Accountability Office, by about a quarter. Those numbers haven’t rebounded, and currentstaffers feel it. A recentsurvey ofsenior aides found that 84 percent thought “high-quality, nonpartisan, policy expertise within the legislative branch” was “very important,” while just 24 percent were “verysatisfied” with thestatus quo. With fewer policy and researchstaff available, and without in-housescience and tech wonks, lawmakers will continue tostruggle to understandsome of the most pressing issues. But this is a fixable problem: Congress controls the whole federal budget and could easily decide to allocate more money for its ownstaff. While they’re at it, they could increase funding for the IRS—and help recoup billions in the process.",1,1,Washington Monthly
160,"In Trump’s January 6 recast, attackers become martyrs, heroes",-10.33,36.33,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/18/trump-jan-6-recast/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"WASHINGTON — A cocktail of propaganda, conspiracy theory and disinformation — of the kind intoxicating to the masses in the darkest turns of history — is fueling delusion over the agonies of January 6. Hate is “love.” Violence is “peace.” The pro-Donald Trump attackers are patriots. Months after the then-president’ssupportersstormed the Capitol that winter day, Trump and his acolytes are taking this revisionism to a new and dangerous place — one of martyrs and warlike heroes, and of revenge. It’s a place where cries of “blue lives matter” have transformed intoshouts of “f— the blue.”The fact inversion about thesiege is the latest in Trump’s contorted oeuvre of the “big lie” compendium, the mostspecious of which is that the election wasstolen from him, when it was not. It is rooted in the formula of potent propaganda through the ages: Say it loud,say it often,say it with the heft of political power behind you, and people will believe. Oncespread by pamphlets, posters and word of mouth, nowspread byswipe of finger, the result is thesame: a passionate, unquestioning following. Trumpstokes January 6 conspiracy theoriesTechniques of glorifying yourside and demonizing the other withskewed information, if not outright lies, have been in play at leastsince World War I, when the US government rousedsentiment for the cause with posters depicting the Germansoldier as an ape-human with a willowy American maiden in his clutches. That paled next to what followed years later with Nazi Germany’s terrifying use of propaganda for theslaughter andsubjugation of millions. Whether the deception feeds warmongering or merely a defeated president’s ego,some of the methods are thesame, like telling thesame fabrication over and over until itsticks. Trump perfected the art of repetition — about the “election hoax,” the “rigged election” and ”massive voter fraud,” with none of those accusationssubstantiated in the dozens of court cases and official post-election audits but engrained nonetheless among hissupporters. Four years ago, Trump appeared to equate whitesupremacists and racial justice protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, with his comment that there were “very fine people, on bothsides.”This time, in this telling, the very fine people on January 6 were on oneside: his. For the otherside — the police, overwhelmed for hours and bloodied in the insurrection — Trump only has an in-your-face question that doubles as a four-word conspiracy theory: “Who killed Ashli Babbitt?”Those words have become a viral mantra meant to elevate Babbitt as a righteous martyr in the cause of liberty. They ricochet around the mainlinesocial media platforms where Trump is banned forspreading misinformation but his followersstill commiserate. The woman died from a police officer’s bullet fired asshe tried to climb through the jagged glass of asmashed window toward the House chamber during the riot. Babbitt has become the face of the insurrection — emblazoned on T-shirts and cheered in basement ballrooms at hotels around the country where conspiracy theorists gather to vent. In Washington’s Georgetown neighborhood, flyers are plastered onstreet lamps and building facades telling of an unveiling of astatue of Babbitt in nearby Alexandria, Virginia, on July 27, at “high noon.”Trump and many Republicans have cycled through various characterizations of the insurrection, each iteration wholly unlike the previous one. The attackers weresaid to be leftist anti fa followers in disguise. Then they weresaid to be overexcited tourists. Now they are heralded as footsoldiers for freedom. Each iteration has required Americans to ignore the rage theysaw on theirscreens, andsome lawmakers to ignore that they were among theshocked targets of the attackers that day. The hunted now praise the hunters. Taken together, the revisionists and their believers are “swimming in a vastsea of nonsense,”said Brendan Buck, a former top aide to onetime House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Thatsea’s currents are familiar to historians whostudy what makessome conspiracy theories and propaganda persuasive. Once people buy into the lies, there can be no convincing them they aren’t true,said Dolores Albarracin, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a coming book, “Creating Conspiracy Beliefs: How Our Thoughts are Shaped.”Despite the well-documented facts about what happened on January 6, believers often dismiss anyone who tries toset themstraight by claiming they are either duped or part of the conspiracy, Albarracinsaid.“The belief contains a device that protects it,”shesaid. “Nothing can invalidate the conspiracy theory. Trying to refute the theory proves the theory andsignals you as a conspirator.”DJ Peterson, an expert on authoritarianism and propaganda, is president of Longview Global Advisors, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm, and worked at the Eurasia Group and the RAND Corporation. Hesaid that in an online world awash in information and a real world riven by polarization, “you pick and choose what you want to believe, includingsticking your head in thesand.”Trump, Petersonsaid, excels at amplifying claims that galvanize his coresupporters and turn them against other Americans.“That’s where the power of Trump is,” hesaid. “He’s good at picking up on these threads … that lower the level of trust and create division.”Recent polls are consistent in illustrating the country’s divide over Trump and his post-election histrionics. In essence, two-thirds of the population is against him; two-thirds of Republicans for him. In one of the latest, Quinnipiac found that 66% of Republicans consider President Joe Biden to have been illegitimately elected. That number and others like it in multiple polls represent tens of millions of people who were hoodwinked into believing allegations of election fraud that have been thoroughly investigated and refuted, including by Trump’s own attorney general, William Barr. Trump’s fabrications havestuck and now undergird the attempts by him and those closest to him to glorify the January 6 mob.“The consequence of lying is you kind of never get back to where you were before,”said Harvard historian Jill Lepore, whose podcast, “The Last Archive,” explores hoaxes, deceptions and what has happened to truth. “That’s what’s pernicious about our particular moment.”Of Trump,shesaid: “His method is generally to just create chaosso that people really don’t know which way to look.”In the case of the insurrection, his followers looked away. An aggressive amnesiaseems to have taken hold over how ugly it all was, even though thescenes that were broadcast andstreamed in real time are forever. Swarming to the Capitol after astaging rally where Trump told them to “fight like hell,” and vowed, falsely, that he would be right there with them, the attackers beat the vastly outnumbered law enforcement officers, injuringscores of them. In one particularly awful case, an officer was crushed against a door by people pushing to get in, his mouth bleeding as theside of his face pressed against the glass of the door. Lawmakers inside ran for their lives, hiding for hours as the mob wandered the halls of Congress holding up Trump flags. The assailants called out for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and wanted Trump’s vice president, who was there, too. “Hang Mike Pence,” they chanted. Babbitt was part of the group that was trying to beat down the doors of the House chamber as Capitol Police officers were evacuating the House floor and assome members werestill trapped in the upper gallery. The officers used furniture to barricade the glass doorsseparating the hallway from the Speaker’s Lobby to try tostave off the attackers, who were breaking glass with their fists, flagpoles and other objects. Only three police officers were guarding the doors on the otherside of thestacked furniture as at least 20 attackers tried to get in,screaming, “F– the blue!” and “Break it down!” Onesmashed the door glass next to an officer’s head; another warned the officers they would be hurt if they didn’t get out of the way. A Capitol Police lieutenant pointed his gun. “Gun!” “Gun!” the attackersshouted as the hysteria reached a fever pitch. Theystarted to lift Babbitt up, to climb through the window. The officer fired one round. Babbitt wasstruck in theshoulder. She later died. The officer was cleared of wrongdoing, and his name was not released. Trump nowstates falsely — and with astream of repetitions — thatshe wasshot “right in the head.”“They were there for one reason, the rigged election,” he told Fox News a week ago. “They felt the election was rigged. That’s why they were there. And they were peaceful people. These were great people. The crowd was unbelievable. And I mentioned the word love. The love — the love in the air, I have neverseen anything like it.”___Klepper reported from Providence, RI",1,2,Denver Post
161,In Defense of Liberal Conspirators,-20.67,33.33,https://newrepublic.com/article/162318/astra-taylor-defense-liberal-conspirators,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-06,25,"The following is an excerpt from Astra Taylor’s new book,Remake the World.“It’s as natural as breathing” is a cliché because, when all is going well, nothing else is more effortless than inhaling and exhaling,something we do approximately twenty thousand times a day. Typically, most of us don’t think much about it. We breathe as wesleep, breathe as we eat, breathe as we move, and breathe as we talk. But that changed in 2020. We worried about our lungs and gasped for air. A novel illnesssickened millions and tanked the global economy, thousands ingested tear gas protesting police violence, and cities weresmothered by plumes of dark, noxioussmoke from nearby forest fires. During the first tense few weeks of the Covid-19shutdown, we thought we couldstop thespread of the disease by washing our hands. Our hands weresomething we could control. We could keep them in our pockets, wear latex gloves, havesanitizer at the ready, andscrub off the pathogen withsoap and hot water. We didn’t have all the facts. The coronavirus, as US authorities knew by early February, is airborne, transmitted through invisible particles and droplets emitted and ingested during the most automatic of physical acts. The pandemic has revealed “that our bodies function more likesponges than fortresses,” mysister, the disability rights activist andscholar Sunaura Taylor, observed. “In a variety of visualizations, wesee our bodies extending beyond their usual bounds: graphics of our coughs,sneezes, and even breathshow how far beyond our ownskin our bodies reach; thesix-foot rule ofsocial distancing a daily acknowledgment that our bodies not only leak and ooze, but that they absorb the conditions of others.” Epidemiology and physics colluded to prove that even at aseeminglysafe distance, we touch by virtue of breathing thesame air. In the worst cases, Covid-19 causes acute respiratory distress. Experts describesuccumbing to the disease as akin to drowning. Early in the outbreak I read a piece by a doctor attempting to educate readers about how our lungs operate and what contracting the illness might entail. A healthy lung issosoft,she wrote, it “has almost nosubstance”; touching it feels like “reaching into a bowl of whipped cream.” Covid changes that, filling the twin organs with a yellow goo that blocks the free flow of oxygen: “The lung texture changes, beginning to feel more like a marshmallow than whipped cream.” To besoft and permeable like asponge is to be healthy. To be rigid and closed off, fortresslike,spells doom. This is true, it turns out, not just for our lungs but also for our veryselves. When we breathe, we pull air into our windpipe, or trachea. That pipe thansplits into our lungs’ two main airways, calledbronchi, which then branch off intosmaller andsmaller passageways, leading to tiny twig-like tubes called bronchioles that culminate in clusters of microscopicsacs calledalveoli. In medical diagrams these passageways resemble the branches of an upside-down tree, as though every human being contains a piece of an inverted forest inside their chest. It’s a fitting image, because if it weren’t for trees, we wouldn’t be able to breathe. By photosynthesizing, plants generate carbohydrates and oxygen in equal measure, nourishing our bellies and filling our lungs. Without them we’dstarve, but not before we choked on lethal levels of carbon dioxide. In thissense, the thousands of fires that raged across North America in 2020, burning more than eight million acres, charred the lungs of the earth. In those months,some communities gagged onsmoke, others on pepperspray. On May 25, forty-six-year-old George Floyd was asphyxiated by Derek Chauvin, a Minneapolis police offer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck for eight minutes and forty-sixseconds with an expression of untouchable, detachedsuperiority. Floyd’s alleged transgression was using a counterfeit twenty-dollar bill. The assault was caught on video, and perhaps because the pandemic hadslowed things down, people paid attention. Floyd’s murder galvanized the biggest protest movement in US history, attracting up to twenty-six million participants by midsummer. Police and federal agents responded with unrelenting force, blinding over a dozen eyes with rubber bullets and burning thousands of people’s lungs with chemical weapons, includingsmoke grenades. In Portland, Oregon, residents used leaf blowers forself-defense, redirecting fumes away from innocent crowds and back toward the cops. Floyd’s last words echoed Eric Garner, who uttered a phrase that would become a common chant at Black Lives Matter protests as he was killed by police in New York City in 2014: “I can’t breathe.” Instreets full of tear gas, demonstrators couldn’t breathe either. The right wing, predictably, responded to these developments with aggressive denial. Millions of people already devoted to conspiracy theories merely had to add a few new twists to preexisting narratives to bring them up to date. The coronavirus, like global warming, was a hoax, an elaborate ruse by an elite and evil cabal to control the populace—not a pandemic but a “plandemic.” Likewise, the fires in California and Washington were not connected toshifting weather patterns caused by greenhouse gas emissions, but the result of arson, violent acts committed by mythic anarchists and anti-fascists who were never found but who were certainly in cahoots with Black Lives Matter. From his White House perch, Donald Trump amplified falsehoods, uplifted racists, andsowed confusion and doubt. Researchshowed he was thesingle largestsource of disinformation about Covid-19. While condemning millions to disease and destitution, Trump told his followers they were victims not of a vastly unequalsociety (helmed by asociopathic plutocrat no less) but of public health protocols and marginalized groupsseeking equal rights; he comforted those afflicted with delusions that a reassertion of whitesupremacy and a revolt against aspectral “deepstate” could cure the crisis. A network of right-wing individuals and foundations funded and fomented discontent, emboldening armed vigilantes who gathered atstate capitols demanding a return to business as usual. In Michigan, fourteen men, aggrieved by coronavirus restrictions, were arrested for plotting to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer. Court documentsshow they also discussedstorming the legislature to “take hostages, execute tyrants, and have it televised.” Instead of beingsnapped back to theirsenses by a deadly illness, people retreated further intof antasy and fallacy, in which face masks were part of a far-reaching conspiracy tosuffocate patriots andstifle freedom. According to my dictionary, a conspiracy is “a plotting of evil, unlawful design; a combination of persons for an evil purpose.” This is the definition that describes the most popular conspiracy theories of our day, which claim to ferret out a demonicsect pullingsociety’sstrings, whether they are nefarious globalists, Jewish bankers, a Satanic pedophile ring, a “shadow government,” orsome dastardly combination thereof. Whilesuch misapprehensions are as old as the nation itself—some historians point out that the USs was born of a conspiracy theory, as evidenced by the Declaration of Independence’s paranoid litany of Britain’s “abuses and usurpations,” including unleashing “merciless Indiansavages” and “absolute despotism”—the Trump era was uniquelysteeped in them. Trump’s rise to power began with the racist lie of birth er ism (insisting that Barack Obama was not a true US citizen) and ended in the authoritarian insistence that the election was rigged andstolen by “socialist” Democrats, with the help ofsome disloyal Republican officials (among them Attorney General William Barr). While people on the political left are not immune to it, this kind of cons pi racism is more endemic among and useful to the right wing. If we go further back, however, we’ll find the word conspiracy has a different, more profound meaning that might help us comprehend our present predicament. It comes from the Latinconspirationem,“agreement, union, unanimity,” andconspirare,“to be in agreement; to ally”—or, literally, “to breathe together.” That is what the more powerfulsegment ofsociety, the ruling class, have never wanted the rest of us to do—to come together as allies and, god forbid, form unions. Throughout US history, the most influential and destructive conspiracies have emanated not from the fringes but from the country’s political and financial centers of power, and their goal has been preventing regular people from banding together to improve their lot. Polls revealshockingly high levels of isolation and loneliness among the US population, conditions that are known to make people moresusceptible to the destructive, paranoid conspiracy theories that abet the right wing. We are all living amid the wreckage of a long, ongoing, and intentionalsabotage of progressive collective action: a profit-driven health caresystem ill-prepared to cope with a pandemic, runaway climate change threatening the future, a bigoted and broken criminal justicesystem, a misinformation-addled (and conspiracy-promoting) corporate mediasphere, and an economy in which the majority of people can barely keep their heads above water. Our inability to truly conspire is whyso many people arestruggling to breathe today.“The power to define what is and is not a conspiracy is a jealously guarded privilege,”Michael Mark Cohenwrites in his fascinating bookThe Conspiracy of Capital: Law, Violence, and American Popular Radicalism in the Age of Monopoly. In the early days of the USs, this battle would be fought overwhelmingly in the courts. The first labor conspiracy case in the USs was thePhiladelphia Cordwainerstrial of 1805 to 1806, and it remains one of the mostsignificant trials in labor history to this day. “A group of journeymanshoemakers attempted to combine to demand higher pay and prevent the hiring of replacement workers,” Cohen explains, and in response they were charged with forming “a combination and conspiracy to raise wages.” Shoemaking was one of the city’s most profitable industries, and it was also the most contentious. A dispute over wages led to aseven-weekstrike and then a lawsuit, with eight journeymen indicted. Ascab testified that the “workers were foreignersseeking to overthrow the laws of the USs” (the trope of the outside agitator was already in effect). The prosecution argued that the workers’ collusion threatened not only theshoemaking industry but also the entire city’s economy. While the workers got off with asmall fine, the caseset a disturbing precedent. Other courts interpreted the verdict as a ban on labor unions, which meant that organizing efforts were henceforthsubject tosuppression from both employers and thestate. Between 1806 and 1842 there were more than twenty-one labor conspiracy trials involving “cordwainers, tailors, hatters,spinners, and carpet weavers,” Cohen reports. Strikers wonsix of them. But in each and every case, unions were deemed illegal “combinations” and “conspiracies” and forbidden. Speaking for countless others, Philadelphia labor leaderStephen Simpsonrailed against a doublestandard that tilted the playing field in favor of employers. “If mechanics combine to raise their wages, the laws punish them as conspirators against the good ofsociety, and the dungeon awaits them as it does the robber,” he wrote in 1831. “But the laws have made it a just and meritorious act, that capitalistsshall combine tostrip the man of labour of his earnings, and reduce him to a dry crust, and a gourd of water.”Robert G Ingersoll, a famed agnostic andsocial reformer, would later express thesamesentiment in a pithier formulation: “If the rich meet to reduce wages, that’s a conference; if the poor resist the reduction, that’s a conspiracy.” The doublestandard would be etched into law: At thesame times workers were under attack, the owning class was provided with a bevy of new rights. A corporation would be redefined as a “legal person” entitled to equal protection. Limited liability companies receivedstatesanction andsupport while labor unions were deemed illegal. As the age of monopoly wore on, conspiracy charges ramped up. The common law doctrine of criminal conspiracy allowed the captains of industry to regulate working-class organization with incessant litigation, turning courtrooms into centers of class conflict. A vague and broad accusation, the conspiracy doctrine implied guilt by association and was used tosuppress dissent, “to ban unions, outlawstrikes, pickets, and boycotts, to criminalize radical ideologies like anarchism and communism,” in Cohen’s words. The doctrine was considered “the darling of the prosecutor’s nursery” for itssweeping application and loose evidentiary rules, which meant it was perfect forsuppressing dissent—anyone could besucked into the ring of conspirators, even those who had never met before. “If there arestill any citizens interested in protecting human liberty, let themstudy the conspiracy laws of the USs,” the famed radical lawyer Clarence Darrow, implored. “No one’s liberty issafe.”Born in 1857, Darrow defended countless workers and organizers from conspiracy charges over his career, inspired, in part, by the famous Haymarket trial, a miscarriage of justice thatsaw eight anarchists charged with conspiracy andsevensentenced to death for an explosion at asmall rally (a pardon would be issued in time tosave three of them). In an attempt to mount moresuccessful defenses, Darrow dug into the conspiracy doctrine’s history to uncover its basis in English common law, only to discover that its original purpose had been turned on its head. First codified in 1305, the conspiracy doctrine began as a medieval English law designed to prevent malicious persecution. “It was an ancient law that a man who conspired to use the courts to destroy his fellow-men was guilty of treason to thestate,” Darrow concluded. “He had laid his hand upon the State itself; he had touched the bulwark of human liberty.”The Age of Revolution flipped thescript,shifting the doctrine’s purpose from the prevention and punishment of private abuse of the jurysystem to thesubversion of efforts to build working-classsolidarity. In 1721, English judges ruled inRex vs Journeymen Tailors of Cambridgethat workers’ efforts tostrike to raise wages amounted to an unlawful and criminal conspiracy,setting thestage for the Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800, which made trade unionism illegal in Britain, though laborers continued to put up fierce resistance. “The aristocracy were interested in repressing the Jacobin ‘conspiracies’ of the people,” Cohen explains, while “the manufacturers were interested in defeating their ‘conspiracies to increase wages.’” The Combination Acts did both. A crosssection of elites gained power, and labor was forced into theshadows. As a result, the historian EP Thompson notes in hisstudy of the English working class, organizing became more furtive, or “conspiratorial” in its modern-daysense. Workers could unite only insecret, ever watchful for employers, magistrates, parsons, andspies who might be their undoing. Workers fought back, but always from a defensive crouch. In the USs, laborers exploited on the job faced retaliation for demanding better treatment. They could be fired, wounded, or lynched, whether by hiredPinkertonguards or volunteer reactionary mobs. World War I inflamed ethno-nationalist tensions and put targets on the backs of radicals, with thousands arrested and often deported in the infamous Palmer Raids. The wartime Espionage Actstrengthened the hand of thestate, making it possible to prosecute labor partisans for words alone. The legendary organizer Eugene Debs was jailed for declaring that the only war in which he would enlist “was the war of the workers of the world against the exploiters of the world.” Voicing thatsentiment landed him in prison forsedition, a charge held up by a unanimous Supreme Court decision. With hindsight, we regard theHaymarket affair, the first wave of the Red Scare, and the Palmer Raids as egregious abuses ofstate power. But rather than being aberrations, they epitomize a troubling current that has coursed through US historysince the colonial days, carried across the Atlantic via British common law all the way to the present day—a disastrous determination tosquelch the efforts of working people to become organized. “The most dangerous conspiracy theories, especially right wing conspiracy theories, do not exclusively populate the extremist margins of American politics and history,” Cohen observes. “Rather, the most dangerous conspiracy theories in American politics emerge from the very center of power, in which whitesupremacist, anticommunist, and anti-terrorist ideologies, each defined byshifting fears ofsubversive conspiracies, are promoted and enacted by presidents, business leaders, military men, judges, prosecutors, police, and vigilantes.” The most destructive purveyors of conspiracy theories are not average people who anxiously embrace half-truths. Rather, the real threat comes from those who hold official positions of influence and who actively trade in damaging lies to maintain dominance, fully aware that their continued authority depends on the disorientation, distraction, demoralization, and disarray of millions of others. If thatsounds conspiratorial, it is. “I think a little conspiratorial ism on the left issometimes healthy. There actually is a cabal of ruling elites thatseek to poison and imprison this world in the name of profits,” Cohen told me by email. “And those people have names, addresses and regularly meet to plot their crimes against humanity and nature. We have much to gain by naming and fighting them both individually and as a group.”In 1961,sociologist Daniel Bellspeculated that there is “in the American temper, a feeling that ‘somewhere,’ ‘somebody’ is pulling all the complicatedstrings to which this jumbled world dances.” The esteemed historian Richard Hofstadter echoed thatsentiment, publishingThe Paranoid Style in American Politicsto great acclaim. Over the course of the Trump presidency, countless op-eds, journalistic exposés, academic articles, and books have articulated asimilar concern, citing the explosion of conspiracy theories and the elevation ofsome of the most outlandish ones to the halls of power. Thesame election that evicted Trump from the White Housesecured victory for two congressional candidates who publiclysupportedQAnon, a convoluted conspiracy devoted to interpreting message board missives from “Q,” a mysterious figure andsupposed government insider with knowledge of Trump’s plan to vanquish the Devil-worshipping, child-molesting globalists who currently run the world andsend them to Guantánamo Bay with the help ofJohn F Kennedy Jr., who faked his own death in 1999 and has been in hiding eversince. At the end of 2020, NPR and Ipsos published the results of a poll assessing QAnon’s reach. Seventeen percent of respondentssaid it was “true” that “a group of Satan-worshipping elites who run a childsex ring are trying to control our politics and media,” and 37 percent moresaid they didn’t know. Without a doubt, it is alarming when millions of people reject basic reality, even the reality ofsomething as banal as a celebrity’s death. Yet attempts to diagnose the problem’ssource and identify possible cures too often fallshort. The bookA Lot of People Are Saying,from 2019, epitomizes the genre. Authors Nancy Rosenblum and Russell Muirhead describe what they call the “new conspiracism,” or “conspiracy without theory.” In theirschema, classic conspiracism’s evidentiary basis (picture dozens of JFK assassination aficionados poring over photographs of the grassy knoll) has been abandoned in favor of pure affect; hypotheses andsuppositions gain purchase through repetition, not proof. Digital networks drown internet users in dubious information designed less to persuade than to overwhelm, associal networks circulate and recirculatesensational claims. Those who know how to game algorithms amass enormous followings, and those with the most “engaging” content always win, accuracy be damned. In 2020, millions of jobs evaporated overnight, but hucksters hit pay dirt. The click bait economy launched the careers of an astonishing number of “conspiracy entrepreneurs,” a handful of whom, like Alex Jones, are national figures while the vast majority carve out aspecialized niche, perhaps exposing “crisis actors” (the people who purportedly pretend to be victims of massshootings as part of a larger plot to undermine the Second Amendment) or tracking “chem trails” (mind-controlling vapors allegedly released by planes). Rosenblum and Muirhead quoteStefanie MacWilliams, a twentysomething woman fromBelleville, Ontario, who gained notoriety for propagating the myth of “Pizzagate,” which held that prominent Democratic political operatives (includingHillary ClintonandJohn Podesta) ran a pedophile ring housed at a popular pizza parlor inWashington, DC, calledComet Ping Pong, which inspired a man to travel from North Carolina, enter the premises, and fire a military assault rifle, demanding the release of imaginarysexslaves he believed were being held in a nonexistent basement. Despite the fact thatsomeone could have been killed during the commotion, MacWilliams was unremorseful: “I really have no regrets and it’s honestly really grown our audience.”A Lot of People Are Sayingmaintains that while cons pi racism has long pervaded US politics,somethingsignificant has changed in recent years. “Today, cons pi racism is not, as we might expect, the last resort of permanent political losers, but the first resort of winners,” the authors observe, in a reference to Donald Trump’s rule asconspiracist-in-chiefand theRepublican Party’stendency to paint itself as a victim even as it wields political power. For all the authors’supposed historical acuity, their insistence that conspiracy theories originating from the powerful is anew phenomenon only holds if youselectively interpret and idealize the past. A cursory glance at US history, or a close read of Michael Mark Cohen,shows that the powerful have claimed to be victimssince the founding of the nation. The lies peddled by Trump and theGrand Old Partyare just the latest iterations of the truth-destroying,state-building ideologies of yore. Today we use the term Red Scare to indicate an overreaction, but the mania lasted the better part of the twentieth century, peaking twice, first around World War I and then after World War II During thesecondsurge, theHouse Un-American Activities Committee, or HUAC,devoted incredible energy to pinpointing communist influence in government and industry, an influence that zealots detected inNew Dealsocial programs,strong labor protections and trade union militancy, and the civil rights movement, whichRepresentative John Rankinof Mississippi denounced as “communistic bunk.” Operating in asimilar vein, SenatorJoseph McCarthylaunched a crusade in Congress,seeking outsubversive elements in Washington and Hollywood. His efforts loststeam only when they were broadcast on national television and public opinion turned against his inquisition (an unforeseen reaction thatsparked the first denunciations of the “liberal media”). But of course, the cons pi racism didn’tstop with the end of the demented government hearings. Under the fervid anticommunist leadership of J Edgar Hoover, the Federal Bureau of Investigation continued tospy on citizens, including via COINTELPRO, a counterintelligence program designed tosurveil, infiltrate, discredit, and disrupt left-wing groups. As one official memo put it, the aim was to “enhance the paranoia endemic in [dissident] circles” and convince activists that FBI agents lurked “behind every mailbox.” A lettersent by the program tried to pressureMartin Luther King Jr.to kill himself. The CIA abetted the cause withOperation CHAOS, initiated by PresidentLyndon Johnsonin 1967 and expanded by Richard Nixon, which “infiltrated antiwar groups, black power organizations, and even women’s consciousness raisingsessions to determine if foreign communists weresecretly directing them.”As Kathryn Olmsted documents in her illuminating bookReal Enemies,US citizens aresuspicious of their government for good reason. Government lies have cost livelihoods and lives. In 1962, the Joint Chiefs of Staff presented Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara with a plan to deceive Americans intosupporting a war on Cuba by launchingself-inflicted terror attacks on USsoil. While that idea wasscuttled, US policies of deception andsecrecy were par for the course in Vietnam, Cambodia, Argentina, Guatemala, Indonesia, and elsewhere. In its final tally, anticommunism is responsible for the deaths of millions of people worldwide. As these and many other abuses of power were revealed, the public became increasingly perturbed. After HUAC, McCarthyism, Watergate, COINTELPRO, and the Iran-Contrascandal, anythingseemed possible, and many assumed more explosivesecrets must lie instore. September 11, 2001, appeared to validate their gravest fears. TheGeorge W Bushadministration made an unprecedented grab of executive authority to battle a nebulous enemy and cooked up a baselessstory about weapons of mass destruction to deceive the public into war with Iraq. Brown University’s Watson Institute estimates that over five hundred thousand people have perished as a result of the war on terror, not counting casualties in Syria. As if deception and carnage weren’t bad enough, a movement of9/11 “Truthers”are convincedsomething even more diabolical transpired—the destruction of theWorld Trade Centertowers was an “inside job.” There was no limit,some believed, to what the government might do. Bush-era conspiracy theorists, Olmsted notes, were “more interested in making accusations and identifying the government as irredeemably evil than enacting reforms.” Thesame holds for millions ofsuspicious minds today.“The new cons pi racism drains thesense that democratic government is legitimate withoutsupplying any alternativestandards,” Rosenblum and Muirhead write inA Lot of People Are Saying. They’re correct, but we have to understand the cause. For the last century, anticommunism run amok helped repress legitimate and necessary alternatives, leaving nihilistic reaction and unhinged conjecture to fill the void. Eight months into the pandemic, a television newsstation in Kalamazoo, Michigan, broadcast a telling exchange. The newscasterstood in a desolatesuburban parking lot, reporting on the reaction to thestate’s new Covid-19 restrictions. The owner of a nearby establishment, a weary-looking older man, walked up and told the host he hadsomething tosay. He was resisting theshutdown and wanted tosay why.“My government leaders have abandoned me,” hesaid. “They’ve put me in a position where I have to fight back.” Four trillion dollars ofstimulus money was given tospecial-interest groups and campaign donors, he continued, “enough money to give every family,every family in this country,$20,000 to go home for two months.” If he were given thatsort ofsupport, the mansaid, he gladly would have closedshop and let the virussettle down. “But I’m not going to do it alone.” When asked if he would continue to violate thestate order, the man was defiant. “This isn’t astate order; this is a conspiracy, a tyranny … and I’ve got patriots coming out andsupporting me.” The eighty-second clip encapsulated the ways government failures fuel conspiratorial thinking. On one level, the man was correct and his indignation justified. When the bailout funds were dispersed in thespring of 2020, a conspiracy ofsorts was indeed afoot—bankers and corporate executives made a mad grab for public money with fewstrings attached, while regular people, whoshould have been paid tostay home,scraped by on crumbs. But he was wrong to imagine patriotism and a reckless disregard for public health as thesolution to a problem caused by plutocracy. After all, the rich canshare citizenshipstatus with poor and working people andstill dispossess them. Numerousstudiesshow that insecure, vulnerable, and threatened populations are moresusceptible to conspiracism. “Conspiratorial ideation” is driven by both ideology and instability. Feelings of powerlessness, researchshows, predictsuch beliefs. InRepublic of Lies,Anna Merlan cites an analysis of letters by readers ofTheNew York TimesandChicago Tribunebetween 1890 and 2010 that found that conspiracy theories fluctuated in response to times of enormoussocial upheaval, with the firstspike around 1900. Research also indicates that conspiracy beliefs are high particularly among members ofstigmatized minority groups. But as Merlan rightly points out, these groups have well-founded grounds for mistrust, given the violent history of whitesupremacy in this country. Not every community’ssense of persecution is equally valid. In a perverse way, many prominent conspiracy theories are a cry for justice and connection, even if they frame the world in a Manichaean binary of good versus evil,shunning astructural analysis along with complexity and contingency—positing a cadre of cartoon villains who possess the incredible ability to mastermind world events, leaving nothing to chance. Nevertheless,such theories are typically populist in form, in that they purport to expose the destructive actions of a power elite against regular, unwitting people (a power elitesadly often imagined in waysshot through with anti-Semitism). QAnon’sslogan, “Where we go one, we go all,” oftenshortened to#WWG1WGA, evokes the Wobbly motto, “An injury to one is an injury to all,” by way of theThree Musketeers. It’s a mash-up of cultural references,stereotypes, thwarted expectations, and dashed idealism. No doubt, many conspira cists are irredeemable racists and authentic fascists, but there are undoubtedlysome who would likely be receptive to other messages if they were as omnipresent and aggressively promoted. We’ll never know how many people would prefer the opportunity to have a face-to-face conversation with a community organizer instead of watching a talking headspout nonsense online, because they never getsuch a knock on the door and a chance to talk. Far from the country of civic associations described by Alexis de Tocqueville inDemocracy in America,the US today is a land of anomie where,sociologists observe, a growing number of peoplesuffer from an “epidemic of loneliness.”Thespread of misinformation and fake news has inspired hand-wringing among liberals, who bemoan the public’s gullibility and lack of knowledge. I confess I’ve wrung my hands, too. But it’s not enough to denounce fake news or bewail the inability of regular readers to verify facts or “trustscience” (a telling phrasesince “trust” is unthinking, an act of faith rather than critical reflection—it means, in effect, know your place). Of course,some people could use a look in the mirror—many liberalsspent the Trump years deeply invested in “Russiagate,” which played into dated, xenophobic Cold War clichés about “the Russians” and exaggerated foreign influence while failing to acknowledge homegrown threats to democracy. After all, it was theElectoral Collegethat handed Trump the presidency, notVladimir Putin. Worsestill, liberals came to lionize the very institutions—the FBI and CIA—that have been the primary agents of countersubversive conspiracies, trampling liberties and destroying lives around the world. As Jonathan Swift quipped in 1721, “Reasoning will never make a Man correct an ill Opinion, which by Reasoning he never acquired.” Ideologies are alwaysshaped by emotions and informed by lived experience. The man in Kalamazoo represents millions who are justifiably angry because they have indeed been abandoned, and who are desperately grasping for explanations that makesense of their circumstances. The challenge is reaching them before mendacious narratives do. But given the right wing’s long and effective assault on labor unions, quality free public education, and nonprofit media—the means and channels through which understanding generallyspreads—that is increasingly difficult. The bipartisan project of undermining the left in this country has been, quite literally, a fool’s errand. By destroying thesocialsolidarity, economic equality, and class conscious world view that a robust, organized left helps provide, ruling elites have created a vacuum in which unhinged conspiracies propagate. Far from being a rationalsystem as proponents claim, capitalism ineluctably tends toward the illogical and ludicrous. Plutocrats will embrace and promote paranoia as long it is profitable; manufactured lunacy provides useful cover, distracting the public from unpopular policies (tax cuts, attacks on unions, a decimatedsafety net), just as obsessively naming enemies (Democrats, the press, communists,socialists, antifa, anarchists, feminists, intellectuals, “woke”students, andso on) deflects responsibility and blame. In the memorable words of Stephen Bannon, conservatives counteract the allegedly liberal media by “flood[ing] the zone withshit.” The goal is not to manufacture consent but to promulgate confusion, and digital capitalism expands the arsenal used to assault oursenses. (In 2020, videos endorsing false claims of widespread voter fraud were viewed on YouTube more than 138 million times during the week of the election alone; pollssoonshowed that one-third of Americans believed that voter fraud helped Joe Biden win.) “Those who persistently blame others for indulging in conspiracies have astrong tendency to engage in plots themselves,” Theodor Adornosmartly observed in 1952, andso it goes today. The world is a complicated place, and we are permeable, interconnected beingssubject to infection by ideas and viruses. We are connected across time andspace: our beliefsshaped by past events, our bodies impacted by what happens on the otherside of the planet, our lungs filled with air exhaled in the next room. Autonomy is an impossibility. Faced with the prospect of this revelation,some recoil, takingsolace in revanchist notions ofseparation, nationalism, andself-reliance laced with magical thinking. To have a chance of bringing people back to reality, or preventing them from losing touch in the first place, we will need tospeak to their apprehensions and misgivings. Consider the growingsuspicion of vaccines, which correlates with religious affiliation and highersocioeconomicstatus, making it one of the preferred conspiracy theories of the comparatively privileged. While anti-vaxxers are aserious threat to public health, there are plenty of reasons to be wary of the medical and pharmaceutical industries. Bill Gates using vaccinations to microchip the masses is not one of them. (Bill Gatesblocking researchers from waiving intellectual property protections to make Covid vaccines available to people in poor countries is the real concern.) Or takespeculation about thesource of Covid-19. The fact is, viruses don’t care about the imaginary boundaries human beings construct, whether those are national borders or thespecies barrier. Like other zoonotic diseases, the coronavirus jumped from one creature (likely a bat or pangolin) to our kind. It didso because industrial patterns of land use and meat production—picture clear-cut forests, crowded factory farms, andso-called wet markets—push human and nonhuman animals into ever-more intimate contact. In other words, while Covid-19 was not concocted in a Chinese lab or caused by 5G wireless towers, it has political dimensions worth unraveling and discussing, particularly if we want to prevent the next deadly pandemic. An ancient habit of the human mind, cons pi racism will never be entirelystamped out, but it can be diminished if we deprive it of the instability, inequality, and isolation on which it feeds. “We will not be a less paranoid country until we are a fairer one,” Merlan correctly observes. You can’t fact-check people out of a problem that requires collective action, mass empowerment, and clearheadedstrategy tosolve. Instead of chastisement, we need a credible vision of bettersociety and a recognition that it will take mass movements to manifest it. That means building the one thing nostalgic right-wingers and neo liberal centrists both hate tosee—an organized and mobilized multiracial working class fighting for theirshared interests. It will take a conspiracy of epic proportions to counteract this country’s ruinous and unrelenting war on people’s ability to come together for the common good, but that’s the only way we’ll all ever be able to breathe.",1,1,New Republic

165,Running for New York City Mayor — How Much Chaos Can We Expect Between Now and June?,-7.67,43.67,https://www.villagevoice.com/2021/02/04/running-for-new-york-city-mayor-how-much-chaos-can-we-expect-between-now-and-june-22/,https://adfontesmedia.com/village-voice-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-04,17,", you could walk up to Gracie Mansion and touch your fingers to the cool brick of the wallssurrounding the grounds. Those days, likeso much before the coronavirus, are long gone. The Upper East Side mansion, erected in 1799,sits behind NYPD barricades. The metallic gates are everywhere, cutting off the walking paths that used to invite visitors to the home of the mayor of New York City. Gracie resembles, a year into the pandemic, a fortress undersiege. On June 22, when the virus may well be less pervasive, Democrats in New York will choose their nominee for mayor. In our heavily Democratic city, this primary victory will be tantamount to election. And given the ease with which incumbents glide to asecond term — the oft-maligned Bill de Blasio won his 2017 primary with nearly 75 percent of the vote and easilyswatted away a Republican by 38 points — this election will effectively determine who gets to govern the largest city in America for the nextyears. (The last one-term mayor, David Dinkins, left office in 1993.)There may be no more important election — in this city, at least — in modern history. Notsince the city nearly went bankrupt in 1975 has it beenso close to the brink. COVID-19 has killed more than 27,000 of our fellow citizens. The restaurant, tourism, and hospitality industries are decimated. The true unemployment rate,some experts estimate, could exceed 20 percent. The murder rate is up all over America, and here in New York it hassoared 41 percent over 2019. This pastsummer, protests against police brutalityshook the city duringsome of the tensest days and nights in memory, drawingsavage crackdowns from an NYPD that de Blasio — a left-leaning Democrat — has repeatedly failed to reform and discipline. The Gracie Mansion barricades went up around the time of those hot, violent nights, as de Blasio, known for hisstubborn workouts at the Park Slope Y and his refusal toshow up anywhere on time,seemed to retreat from his city. While the gangly mayor has real, lasting accomplishments — he created a universal prekindergarten program and helped pass laws increasing the minimum wage and guaranteeing paidsick leave — he has been mocked and derided for his quixotic national ambitions and for failing, along with Governor Andrew Cuomo, to contain thespread of COVID-19. The city, laidso low, may be even more immediately beleaguered than it was in the 1970s, when a fiscal crisis triggered mass layoffs and enormous cuts tosocialservices. “Here the challenge is much greater,”says City Comptroller Scott Stringer, one of the front-running candidates. “We have no tourists, no arts and culture, no restaurant or dining tospeak of. This is unprecedented territory.”Candidates crisscross neighborhoods as large assmall cities, courting varied racial, ethnic, and interest groups that can diverge wildly in their needs and wants. There is a Hasidic vote, a Chinese vote, an Afro-Caribbean vote, and an MSNBC liberal vote. There are dozens of labor unions, civic organizations, churches, block associations, and Democratic clubs that all want to feel that the mayor will represent them, and often, them alone, even though the primary has drawn close to 1 million voters in the past.“Running for mayor involves having an understanding of these different communities, havingsome people who havesome ties in these communities and understanding issues that matter to them—and that does createsome whiplash for candidates,”says Lis Smith, a prominent Democratic operative who worked on de Blasio’s 2013 campaign. “One day you’re talking to a group that’s very progressive, very liberal, and the next day you’re talking to a group of voters that are more fiscally conservative,socially conservative. There are a fair amount of anti-abortion Democrats.”The pandemic, of course, has upended all of this. The last time there was an open mayoral race, candidates had months to glad-hand at parades, block parties, and Sundayservices,slowly building name recognition as votersspotted them onstreet corners andsubway platforms. Once an unknown, de Blasio himself had to cajole commuters at thesubway, hunching hissix-six frame to give his elevator pitch to the people rushing by. These days, the candidates are locked into Zoom forums. Andrew Yang, one of the top contenders, hustled across the city in January,staging walking tours and riding thesubway with reporters in tow. On February 2, he announced that he had tested positive for COVID-19. His diagnosis may well convince the other contenders to avoid crowd contact, at least for now. “The last time I had a flu no one gave ashit,” Yang joked. Pandemic campaigning, generally, has meant increased phone banks, more glossy campaign mailers, and additional digital and TV ads to replace door-to-door canvassing. For candidates without built-in followings, this is cutting down on opportunities to meet voters and demonstrate momentum, either with a big rally, astrongshowing at a parade, or even astaged arrest, cameras flashing.“I’mstill a believer, as far as citywide races, that regular cable TV is important,”says Jerry Skurnik, a longtime Democratic consultant. “That’s why de Blasio won eight years ago. Itseems to me that TV is even more important this year. I’msitting home right now — the TV is on.”More than 30 candidates, remarkably, have registered to run with the city’s Campaign Finance Board, though there are only five orsix Democrats who have a viable chance ofseizing the nomination and breezing to victory in the fall. Much of this has to do with money: A competitive mayoral race costs millions of dollars, and only a handful of Democrats will be able to raise andspend that kind of cash. Two of the candidates, Stringer and Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, have been enmeshed in the city’s political machinery for decades, taking the most traditional route to power. Stringer, who has been the city’s comptrollersince 2014, is a Manhattanite with a base on the white, liberal Upper West Side. He is the undisputed endorsement king — three members of Congress, including the newly elected Bronx firebrand Jamaal Bowman, are backing Stringer’s candidacy, along with a deep roster ofstate lawmakers. Stringer has been courting the city’s resurgent left, criticizing power elites like the real estate industry and proposing an ambitious plan to phase out all fossil fuel infrastructure citywide. Once a more risk-averse, clubhouse politician, Stringer is hoping he can woo progressives in the primary, recreating a version of the playbook that got de Blasio to Gracie Mansion in the first place. Adams, unlike Stringer, does not chest-thump over progressive credentials. A formerstatesenator, police captain,and Republican, Adams proudly fund raises from the real estate developers loathed on the left. A power broker in Brooklyn’s Black neighborhoods, Adams has been a muscular voice on police reform, pitching an idea to let community groupsselect police commanders. Hesaid he would publicize the names of police officers being monitored for bad behavior. (Adams did not return multiple requests for comment.)Stringer, who has promised to “manage the hell” out of the city,has banked close to $6 million for the raceso far; Adams has about $6.6 million. Both of them are expected to be prolific fund raisers in the months to come. In 2001, a little-known, charisma-challenged billionaire named Michael Bloomberg defied the Democratic establishment, winning the mayoralty in the wake of the September 11 attacks. Bloomberg triumphed on the Republican line, all but impossible in today’s city, unless you canspend $100 million, which is out of reach for all of the current candidates. In 2013, horrifying entrenched Democrats while delighting every newspaper in town, Anthony Weiner plunged into the Democratic primary, fresh off the first of manysext ingscandals. Before his implosion, he was a polling leader, drawing huge crowds in thestreets. At thesame time, Eliot Spitzer, the former governor felled in a prostitutionscandal, was running for city comptroller, whipping up asingular frenzy around a municipal contest. In 2021, there are no blackswan candidates like Weiner and Spitzer, but there is a famous outsider: Yang, the entrepreneur who gained widespread recognition running for president on a platform to give $1,000 to every American every month, forever. Mayoral candidate Yang cannot propose anythingso ambitious — his current cash-transfer proposal is micro-targeted to very poor households, and would cost $1 billion annually out of an $88 billion budget — and he has mixed worthy progressive goals,such as a public bank for New York City, with the more curious,including a casino on Governors Islandthat would be forbidden under a federal deed restriction.“I’m running for mayor for one reason and one reason only: I believe I can help New York City recover from this crisis faster than others,” Yangsays. He is chasing the progressive vote, like Stringer, but he is also hoping to cross over everywhere, knitting together moderates and exciting the city’s burgeoning Asian communities. Before testing positive, he took tostreet-level campaigning with particular gusto, and is easily recognized when he ventures out.“There’s like a real need in New York to havesomeone who people have asense of pulling for them,” Yang continues, pitching his candidacy, “and one of the things happening in New York City right now — the nature of the race is a lot of noise — to me, as long as New Yorkers are happy tosee me, I’m pumped to fight for them.”The bubbly Yang is, more than any other candidate, resented by the rival campaigns, who treat him with a mixture of derision and fear. His top consultant, Bradley Tusk, advised Bloomberg’s failed presidential campaign and grew rich advising Uber, drawing ire from the left. Maya Wiley, a former counsel for the de Blasio administration and a civil rights lawyer who rose to greater fame as an MSNBC analyst, isseeking to become New York’s first female mayor. (Wiley declined an interview request.)And the city’s Wall Street titansspecifically recruitedRay McGuire, a Citigroup executive, to run for mayor; he has raised nearly $5 million from business heavyweights in ashort amount of time, vaulting himself into the top tier.“I don’t owe anybody anything,” McGuiresays, boasting of hisstatus as a first-time candidate. “Zero. I’m unbought.” Celebritiessuch as Spike Lee and Samuel L Jackson are in McGuire’s corner. As a Black business executive, he hasspoken openly about racial justice and coalition building between the city’s millionaire class and leftists whoseek to check their power. Some on the left are hoping Dianne Morales, a former nonprofit executive, can catch fire. Though the Democratic Socialists of America, an emerging power center in New York politics, are not formally backing any candidate, members of the organization have been drawn to Morales, who has called forslashing the NYPD budget in half and redirecting the funds tosocialservices.“I kind of reject the idea that we can’t talk about decreasing thissort ofsystem that criminalizes poverty for Black and brown people because people are going to be unsafe. Black and brown folks are already unsafe,” Moralessays. “We need to be morally committed to people’s needs to live in dignity.”And there is noshortage of technocrats: de Blasio’s former Sanitation commissioner and interim NYCHA chair, Kathryn Garcia, and ex-HUDsecretary and federal OMB commissioner Shaun Donovan are hoping to vault into the first tier. Each boasts of governmental experience that outstrips the rest of the field. “I am absolutely the most qualified,” Garcia argues. “I think I am the only person in the race who really understands what this job is. This is a day-to-day, deliver for the people job.”Donovan, who was also a housing commissioner under Michael Bloomberg,drew attention when he proposed giving every city child a $1,000 “equity” bond that could grow to $50,000 by the time of their highschool graduation. “With all due respect to the other candidates, no one else has ever run a four trillion dollar budget,” hesays, referring to his tenure at the federal level. “No one else hassatside byside with Dr. Fauci in the Oval Office or Situation Room.”In the old days, candidates clawed forslivers of the electorate. If no one won 40 percent of the vote, there was a citywide runoff between the top two candidates. These were vicious, if low turnout, affairs. Ranked-choice allows voters to rank their top five candidates. Gettingsecond- and third-place votes matter. The runoff is no more. No one quite knows how this will impact one candidate or another, although everyone has a theory about why they are the most wellsuited for the new era. It’s already produced coalitions: Stringer and Moralesshared a co-endorser, astatesenator from the Bronx, andsome Democrats arespeculating that Stringer wants to elevate Morales to undercut other progressive rivals, including Wiley. Adams, meanwhile, has aggressively opposed thesystementirely, on the premise that the voter education hasn’t been there to make it happen effectively. The race, like the city, is in flux. There is no candidate with a clear claim to the nomination. There is nosingle woman or man with the best argument, either — not with multiple technocrats, a citywide elected official, an unorthodox figure of national renown, a well-regarded civil rights attorney, and many othersseeking the prize of governing one of the world’s great cities. Come 2022, inordinately challenging decisions will have to be made. New York will be emerging,slowly, from pandemic hell. Atsome point, the new mayor will have to lower the barricades — metaphorically and literally — and enter thestreets where the city, ravaged by plague, longs for compelling leadership.“We have to get it right this time,”says Stringer. “We have to have a reset.” ❖More:2021 NYC ELECTIONSNOTE: The advertising disclaimer below does not apply to this article, nor any originating from the editorial department, which does not accept paid links.

168,Judicial Activism Strikes Again As Tallahassee Judge Strikes Down DeSantis Administration’s Mask Mandate Ban,23.33,26.0,https://bigleaguepolitics.com/judicial-activism-strikes-again-as-tallahassee-judge-strikes-down-desantis-administrations-mask-mandate-ban/,https://adfontesmedia.com/big-league-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-28,25,"Florida’s Gorvernor Ron DeSantis has become a very popular figure in the conservative movement in recent months due to his efforts to push back on leftist tyranny wherever he and his administration is able to. Unfortunately, heseems to have hit quite the roadblock in the form of Judge John Cooper of Tallahasse. Earlier on Friday, the activist judgestruck down the mask mandate ban the Governor has been trying to enforce,saying that they are “arbitrary” and that children lack “legal authority”. Correspondents willsurely wait with baited breath tosee if Judge Cooper willsay thesame thing regarding “legal authority” when it comes to lowering the voting age to 16 or lower.“I conclude that this evidence demonstrates that face mask policies that follow [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] guidance are, at this point in time, reasonable and consistent with the bestscientific and medical and public opinion guidance at this time,” Cooper wrote. “I am enforcing the bill passed by the Legislature and requiring that anyone who uses that bill has to follow all of the provisions, notsome of the provisions.”Andsince the CDC is as infallible as the Pope, it wouldseem logical that the CDC with itsstellar track record be the bellwether with which judicial decisionsshould be made for the country’s third most populousstate. Governor DeSantis’ primary motivation for this legislative effort was not only to provide parents the authority and autonomy needed to make informed and uncoerced medical decisions for their children, but to also push back on the emerging medical tyranny that has metasticized over the last year and a half, whichseems to be the globalist’s latest and most fashionable attempt to claw away humanity’s freedom and dignity. It would also appear that many Republicans in Florida’s State Legislature are content with the trends in the Sunshine State and the rest of the country. One major exception appears to be State Legislator and Congressional hopeful Anthony Sabatini, who has on multiple occasions and venues called out what he considers the RINO leadership in the GOP at all levels of government. With the uni party establishment taking greater pains to maintain their entrenched positions, it would appear that Republican politicians will continue to diverge in their actions, with more establishment types helping with maintaining thestatus quo and America First nationalists working harder andsmarter than ever to overturn what they perceive to be the rot in all levels of government. The question of who willsucceed will certainly be answered by time either way. Share:",0,0,Big League Politics

170,An ex-student of Carol Dweck identified a new mindset for success — Quartz at Work,0.33,50.0,https://qz.com/work/1883138/an-ex-student-of-carol-dweck-identified-a-new-mindset-for-success/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-27,25,"We all knowsomeone who barrels into tasks without putting much thought into it. Just give them a directive—a household repair job, a homework assignment, a data entry project—and they dive right in. Then there are others who can’tso much as wash the dishes or make asales call without first devising an optimal plan of attack. They go to work every day not assuming that the accumulation of their labor will one day lead to a promotion. Rather, they’re going to analyze how promotions are awarded, to whom they go and why, and develop a road plan to check off the boxes thatshould get them that pay raise and prestige faster. The planner types have what the psychologist Patricia Chen, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore, and Carol Dweck, the noted Stanford University psychologist and Chen’s former adviser, have identified as astrategic mindset.“Those with astrategic mindset tend to ask themselvesstrategy-eliciting questions,such as, What can I do to help myself? How else can I do this? Or, is there a way to do this even better?” Chen tells Quartz. “People who ask thesestrategic-mindset questions tend to generate and apply more and betterstrategies that end up making them more effective than others.”In a new paper,published in theProceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), lead author Chen and a team of researchers, including Dweck, assert that astrategic mindset “uniquely predicts how much people report actively usingstrategies and, in turn, how effective they are at pursuing goals across life domains.”Crucially, they note it’s not enough just to have mastered a methodology for conquering a goal, or to know when youshould try other means to reach your end. Nor is it enough tosimply value the process of thinking about how you think (what psychologists call metacognition). When you have astrategic mindset, you actually use multiplestrategies and keep track of what’s working for you, or not, habitually. The paper reported on threestudies in the US involving more than 800 adults. First the researcherssentsurveys to more than 350students with queries about how often theystep back to assess the ways theystudy for different classes or whether theirstudy methods give them an advantage. “The higher theyscored on astrategic mindset, the more they reported planning, generatingstrategies, monitoring, and adjusting their techniques during learning, and, in turn, the higher theyscored in their GPAs,”says Chen. Asecondstudy—one that asked randomlyselected people to complete an online questionnaire—showed a correlation between having astrategic mindset and making greater progress toward a life goal, whether at work,school, the gym, or anywhere else. The thirdstudy described in the paper is most compelling, if also messy. In a lab test, participants were presented with 30 eggs and asked toseparate the whites and yolks in under two minutes. They were told that whoeverseparated the most eggs and collected the highest volume of egg whites would receive a $100 prize.“Although this task does notseem like the kind of task that most people will encounter in modern life or the modern workplace,” the authors note, “it was carefully designed to meet the following criteria: The task was relatively unfamiliar and challenging for most participants; it could be accomplished with different methods,some of which were more effective than others; and there were clear performance metrics.”To discover whether there might be a causal relationship between astrategic mindset and goal achievement,some participants in the egg-separationstudy were randomlyselected to be primed to think about astrategic mindset by reading andsummarizing a Lifehack article about the concept, while the control group read an article about an unrelated topic. The researchers hypothesized that the first group would be more apt to exploreseveral ways tospeedily and cleanly remove the golden yolk from itssea of albumen, and to evaluate their methods along the way. And they did. You can probably guess which bunch were the fastest at the job. What’s more, when participants were given eight extra eggs they could use to practice if they felt like it, those who hadstrategi zing on their mind were more likely to doso. Don’t worry, Chen and her team controlled for any casual bakers in the group. Each person’s experience with eggseparating under normal conditions—i.e., as cooks at home—was first measured and taken into account in thestudy’sscoring rubric. Everyone in thestudy also watched a demo of a common “butsuboptimal” method forseparating eggs, the authors write:the back-and-forthsifting technique recommended by typical meringue or custard recipes that call for eggseparating. The psychologists wanted tosee whether people would default to that option and never improve upon it, or look forsmarter, quicker methods. In thestudy appendix, researchers labeled the five dominant more innovative techniques they observed in the lab, like Hand Straining (“letting egg white run through fingers while holding the yolk back”); the Break-and-Grab (“cracking eggs into a bowl and then removing the yolks with hand, tool, or eggshell”); and the Pincer (“partially cracking open the egg, allowing only the egg white to fall out whilst holding the yolk in”). Chensays her future research will investigate why and howsome people developstrategic mindsets and others demonstrate less of this trait, instead going through life passively or even blindly,shesays. Without astrategic mindset, it may be easier for a person to become frustrated with a task, or to give up entirely—an unfortunate outcome whensomeone wants to,say, quitsmoking for health reasons, or learn to code in order to become more competitive in the job market. There may be a clue in Chen’s own life experience as to how the mindset is inculcated. Whenshe was young, Chensays, her mother would regularly point out people orsystems that were working ineffectively. Running errands in Singapore, her mother wouldsay to Chen and hersister, “Look at what that person is doing. Do you think that’s the best way of doing it? Can you think of a better way?” Chen recalls.“She would ask us, ‘What do you think they could do to make this better’ for their customers, orstudents, or people? Andshe’d make us think about the answers and brainstorm multiple answers to these questions,”says Chen. In time, running through that process becamesecond nature to her. People who didn’t grow up with that kind of nudging from a parent or teacher probably canstill develop thesame habits. Dweck’s famous research about the growth mindset is proof of this potential. “Individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, goodstrategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset,” as Dweck once explained in theHarvard Business Review. “They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about lookingsmart and they put more energy into learning.”The growth mindset conceit is widely praised—if not always practiced—in the corporate world. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella claims his embrace of itserved as a foundational principle in rebuilding the company’s culture. Dweck has been name-checked by both former US president Barack Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama. Her theory has becomeso popular that Dweck herself hashad to debunk common misconceptions about what it isand isn’t. In contrast, the concept of astrategic mindset isstill in the earlystages of research. Chensaysshe and Dweck havespent a lot of time discussing how astrategic mindset differs from a growth mindset, and concluded that the two frameworks complement each other. “Both mindsets can be helpful in moments of challenge or difficulty, but in different ways,”says Chen. “Thestrategic mindset motivatesstrategy, while the growth mindset promotes effort, investment, and persistence, which may or may not involve initiating different or betterstrategies.”Combing both ideas ought to be powerful, at least in theory. Imaginesomeone is pursuing a long-term goal,says Chen. “Even if they believe that their abilities can be developed, people may not necessarily think about how best to develop their abilities and channel their efforts. And we certainly believe thatsimply exerting yourself can become discouraging if peoplesimply double down on wrong and unproductivestrategies.”Enter thestrategic mindset,shesays, which “can motivate people tosearch for and try out newstrategies, maybeseek out experts, maybe consult with mentors, andso on.”The team is conductingstudies with preschool children, collegestudents,students, and other adults to better understand how to cultivate this mindset,shesays. One of her earlier papers, published in 2017,has already demonstrated that a 15-minute intervention that askedstudents to reflect on how they craft astudy plan led to better grades, lifting B+students into the A range. More data about what else could work isstill to come, but Chensuggests that teachingsomeone else about thestrategic mindset, or just talking about it, might help a person internalize the process. What’s most important,shesays, is to question your ownstrategies when you’re faced with a tough challenge or aspiring to make a personal change. “Even if it’s to be a happier person, or be a more optimistic person, or to relax more,”shesays, “there is no harm in asking yourself, ‘How else can I do this?'”Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",2,2,Quartz
171,At Least Seven Colombians in Haiti Assassination Received US Training,0.0,42.67,https://theintercept.com/2021/07/16/haiti-assassination-colombia-us-military/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,25,"More thana quarter of the ex-Colombiansoldiers currentlysuspected in the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moïse received US military training, The Intercept confirmed Friday, withsome of the alleged attackers participating in programs as recently as 2015 that ranged from vehicle maintenance and professional development to counterterrorism and drug war operations. Courses were held in both Colombia and the USs. The Pentagon and the State Department are currently reviewing internal records to determine precisely how many of the alleged assassins were trained by the US “To date, State and DoD have identifiedseven individuals among a possible 25 alleged to have been involved by Haitian authorities, that previously participated in past US military training and education programs, while previouslyserving in the Colombian military,” a US government official confirmed in an email to The Intercept. “Individuals had been approved for a variety of training activities held both in Colombia and the USs between 2001-2015.”On Thursday, the Pentagonconfirmedto the Washington Post that “asmall number” of the Colombian mercenariessuspected in the July 7 assassination had received US training, though the department did notsay how many, nor when, nor what type of training was provided. According to the official whospoke to The Intercept, “Examples of the types of training received were various types of military leadership and professional development training, emergency medical training, helicopter maintenance, and attendance atseminars on counter-narcotics and counter-terrorism.”From 2000, when the USs first launched the massive, multi billion drug war aid program known as Plan Colombia, to 2018, the US administered more than 107,640 trainings of Colombiansecurity personnel, noted Adam Isacson, director of the Defense Oversight program at the Washington Office on Latin America, a figure that farsurpasses any other military collaboration the US maintains in the region. “Nothing comes close to 107,000 over the last 20 years,” Isacson told The Intercept. “Nothing.”Eighteen former Colombiansoldiers are currently being held in Haiti in connection with Moïse’s assassination, includingsome who previouslyserved in elite Colombianspecial operations units. New details on their involvement in the assassination continue to break by the day. On Wednesday, the Colombian news magazine Semanareportedthat one of the formersoldiers confessed that the mercenary team was responsible for the assassination and that the killing was orchestrated by an inner circle ofseven mercenaries within the larger group. The magazine reported that investigators had also recoveredsurveillance footage of the attack. Family members of many of the detained Colombians havesaid that their loved ones believed they were being hired to provide personalsecurity for a VIP in Haiti and that they did notsign on to participate in an assassination. Speaking to reporters Thursday, Colombian President Iván Duquesaidthat regardless of individual levels of insight into the operation’s true intent, all would be held responsible for Moïse’s killing. To Isacson, little about the kind of training the alleged assassins experienced with the US militarystood out as particularly unique given the long-standing relationship between the US and Colombia: In any randomsample ofsome two dozen mid-level Colombian military veterans, it is more likely than not thatsome amount of US training would turn up. “They’re not training every recruit or every private, but they are training a lot of people at that level,” Isacsonsaid. “So it’s very likely they would have received us trading just throughsheerstatistical probability.”Still, Isacson argued, the fact that the mercenaries’ training was not unusual does not mean there is not reason for concern. “I worry about the USs being associated with or even increasing the lethalskills of military and police units around the region that are either abusive or corrupt or undemocratic, and of course that’s always been a huge risk in Colombia, given its human rights record. So it does require a lot ofscrutiny to makesure that we are not associating ourselves with or improving the lethalskills of people who end up doing what we justsaw in Haiti, but also people who end up doing what we justsaw in Bogotá and Calisince late April,” hesaid, referring to recent and violent crackdowns by Colombiansecurity forces on protesters. “We don’t want to be associated with that.”Israel’s War on GazaRyan Grim, Nick TurseThe US risks complicity with Israeli atrocities, expertssay.

Carbon dioxide is the most abundant and famous greenhouse gas, but methane is plentiful and its warming effect is more than 30 times more powerful. AdvertisementMost methane that ends up in the atmosphere is released by human activities, butseveral natural processes also produce methane: volcanic activity,subsurface water-rock interactions and microbial metabolism. The majority of naturally produced methane on Earth is produced by microbes, and much of that is in the ocean. Over the last decade orso, a number ofstudies haveshown the planet is oceans to be home to a lot more methane thanscientists previously thought. RelatedStudy: Models underestimate amount of carbon absorbed by Earth is oceansArctic Ocean acidification will be worse thanscientists thoughtCoral parents pass algae to their offspring to help cope with climate changeInterestingly,studiessuggest very little of that methane is making it into the atmosphere. AdvertisementAccording to the lateststudy, an abundance of methane-hungry microbial communities on the bottom of the ocean are responsible for keeping much of that methane locked up in marine ecosystems. Without these microbes,scientistssurmise Earth is atmosphere would host more methane -- making it even warmer than it already is. Whenscientistssurveyed microbe communitiessurroundingseven geologically distinctseafloorseeps, they found the group colonizing carbonate rocks was responsible for the highest rates of methane consumption ever recorded.""The microbes in these carbonate rocks are acting like a methane bio filter consuming it all before it leaves the ocean,""seniorstudy author Peter Girguis, professor of organismic and evolutionary biology at Harvard University,said in a press release. Though carbonate rocks are common on the ocean floor, they onlysometimes form the kind of porous, chimney-likestructures found rising from theseabed at a deepseasite just off the coast of Point Dume, California. That is wherescientists found the record-setting microbes.""We measured the rate at which the microbes from the carbonates eat methane compared to microbes insediment,""said Girguis. ""We discovered the microbes living in the carbonates consume methane 50 times faster than microbes in thesediment.""Advertisement""We oftensee thatsomesediment microbes from methane-rich mud volcanoes, for example, may be five to ten times faster at eating methane, but 50 times faster is a whole new thing. Moreover, these rates are among the highest, if not the highest, we have measured anywhere,"" Girguissaid.""These rates of methane oxidation, or consumption, are really extraordinary, and weset out to understand why,"" co-author Jeffrey J Marlow, former postdoctoral researcher at Harvard, alsosaid in the release. By efficiently capturing methane as itseeps out ofseafloor vents and converting it into bicarbonate, microbes help construct these unusual carbonate rock chimneys. Scientistssuspect the carbonate chimneys they call home -- and their mineralsurroundings -- are key to their unprecedented metabolic capabilities. Researchers foundsome of the microbial communities colonizing carbonate rocks aresurrounded by pyrite, which is electrically conductive. Efficient electron exchange, the researchers hypothesized, may explain why these microbes can eatso much methaneso quickly.""These very high rates are facilitated by these carbonates which provide a framework for the microbes to grow,"" Girguissaid.""Thesystem resembles a marketplace where carbonates allow a bunch of microbes to aggregate in one place and grow and exchange -- in this case, exchange electrons -- which allows for more methane consumption,"" Girguissaid. AdvertisementGirguis, Marlow and their research partners recently recreated a diversity ofseafloor environs in the lab and are nowstudying how microbes metabolize methane under varying conditions. Researchers hope their ongoing experiments will reveal how different characteristics of the carbonate environment influence metabolic rates among the methane-eating microbes.""First, we need to understand how these microbessustain their metabolic rate, whether they are in a chimney or in thesediment. And we need to know this in our changing world in order to build our predictive power,"" Marlowsaid.""Once we clarify how these many interconnected factors come together to turn methane to rock, we can then ask how we might apply these anaerobic methane-eating microbes to othersituations, like landfills with methane leaks,"" hesaid.",2,2,UPI
173,Pandemic 2.0: Amazon Deforestation Could Unleash A Wave Of Pandemics Sooner Than We Think,-19.0,39.67,https://therealnews.com/columns/pandemic-2-brazil-coronavirus-bolsonaro-amazon-indigenous-people,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-news-network-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-09,23,"Picture thescale of the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the novel coronavirusspread from Wuhan, China,global deaths from COVID-19havesurpassed 400,000. Economic loss estimates range from an optimistic$3.3 trillion up to $82 trillion in case of a depression. Andsocial norms changed overnight as people adjusted toself-isolation, face coverings, andsocial distancing. Now imagine the world coping with a new pandemic every month. This is not a prophecy or a piece of dark fiction, andsurely not a plot for an upcoming Hollywood flick. This is what the world’s leading climatescientists are warning will happen when, not if, the planet’s ecological balance with microorganisms tips over, unleashing waves of pandemics of varyingseverity.:At the heart of this cataclysmicscenario is the loss of global ecological reservoirs,such as the Amazon rainforest, which maintains the delicate balance between the natural world and the human colony. But despite the recent fires that ravaged the rainforest and drew global calls for action, Jair Bolsonaro’s right-wing government is encouraging rapid deforestation to facilitate agribusinesses owned by political establishment figures with links to Brazil’s military and police. Antonio Oviedo, a research erat the Socio-Environmental Institute (ISA), a nonprofit defending indigenous rights in Brazil,told The Real Newsthat deforestation in the Amazon in the first three months of 2020 was 51% higher than in the corresponding period last year. “And itshot up by a whopping 170% in April compared to April 2019, and about 90% of this deforestation is illegal,” Antonio added worryingly. Terra Brasilis, another Brazilian organization, estimates the current year (Aug 2019—Jul 2020) is the worst ever for deforestation, with almost 6000 km2of the Amazon chopped down. That’s almost twice the area cleared last year. According to Greenpeace, the present waves of deforestation “pose aserious and imminent threat to the roughly one third of indigenous land that has not yet been demarcated by thestate, and will encourage even greater deforestation.” Bolsonaro’s government has tried to pass legislation in recent weeks to legalize huge landseizures, mostly comprising indigenous territories. The proposed law isstill before Brazil’s congress and is expected to go to a vote in the coming weeks. Dismantling of Environmental Institutions and SafeguardsTo facilitate large-scale agribusinesses and other commercial use of the Amazonian forest, Bolsonaro’s government has employed tacticssuch as de funding regulatory bodies and relaxing environmentalsafeguards through executive orders. A number of indigenous lands in Brazil await formal approval from the president’s office for their protectedstatus. On April 16, the government agency which implements policies relating to indigenous people, FUNAI, received instructions that those lands can be made available for agribusiness. Claudio Angelo,spokesperson for the Climate Observatory organization in Brasilia, estimatessome 90 indigenous territories out of more than 700 lands are awaiting the president’ssigning, the laststep in a lengthy bureaucratic land claim process. The pressure on federal regulatory agencies to relax rules has emboldened illegal operators who have reportedly moved inside protected lands. Oviedosays an estimated 20,000 illegal gold miners are inside the Yanomami lands alone—the largest of indigenous tribes located in the north of Brazil, with lands equaling thesize of Portugal—“and they are within 5 kilometers of local tribes.” He added that in March FUNAI enacted a law forbidding outsiders from entering the protected lands, “but illegal miners are crossing over freely, increasing the risk for native populations’ exposure to COVID-19.”Despite the attempts by native tribes toself-isolate and move deep inside the forest, COVID-19 hasspread to indigenous communities, causing the deaths andsuffering forewarned by experts. According to theSpecial Secretariat for Indigenous Health(Sesai), Brazil’s federal body for providing healthcare for the native peoples, 2085 indigenous people have tested positive for COVID-19, and 82 have diedso far. But theBrazilian Indigenous Peoples’ Association(APIB), which tracks all indigenous cases, has reported 2600cases and 247 deaths among 94 ethnic groups. APIB claims the actual count is likely much higher due to underreporting. And health provisions are nauseatingly inadequate because of the budget cuts thatseverely constrain Sesai and itssuboffices from delivering healthcare to the native people. Problems caused by Sesai’sshoestring budget are compounded by lowstaffing and a dearth of ventilators, and the nearest healthcare units are located nearly 200 miles from native communities,reportssuggest. “Medical facilities are working as hubs forspreading COVID-19 because of untrainedstaff and indigenous people have reportedly contracted COVID-19 after visiting there,” Oviedotold The Real News. “Also, foodsecurity is becoming another problem and indigenous people are told to go to cities for food assistance, whichserves as an invitation to get the virus and take it back to the community,” he added. A Pandemic A MonthThissystematic dismantling of regulatory bodies and healthcaresystems that protect the Amazon and its native people has already resulted in massive deforestation and created conditions for environmental catastrophe of epic proportions. In an exclusive interview with The Real News,Dr. Carlos Nobre, the leading environmentalscientist in Brazil,said all new COVID and SARS viruses that cause epidemics and pandemics are generated by the lack of ecological balance with microorganisms.“There are hundreds ofspecies of coronavirus present in the Amazon and there are hundreds of thousands of other types of viruses found there,” Dr. Nobresaid. “If we disturbed this most diversesanctuary of biological diversity that would mean disturbing the ecological balance of millions ofspecies of microorganisms. If we moved beyond the tipping point in the next few decades, we have to be prepared for one pandemic a month.”Dr. Nobre adds the native people of the Amazonsurvived in the forest for 11,000 years because of theirsense of maintaining a balance with the natural world. “Given the number of microorganisms existing in the forest, you can be certain that a virus or bacteria would have exterminated them. But they are verysmart and they evolved the vision of living with the forest. And for 11,000 years there was not asingle pandemic across the indigenous communities.” He lamented that the number of indigenous people in Brazil fell from 10-15 million to a mere 70,000 in the 1940s. “We’re the ones to cause that imbalance and bringing viruses to these native tribes.”Dr. Nobre’s three decades of research also warn of the Amazon reaching a tipping point in the face of growing deforestation, urbanization and global warming. “Those three factors happeningsimultaneously are driving a very large portion of the forest becoming a drysavanna (a drier forest compared to tropical rainforest where it rains all year). In our estimates, we areseeing 50%-60% of the Amazon almost at the edge ofsuburbanization and the tipping point almost being crossed because the forest in those areas are becoming drier.” He warned that if global warming and deforestation is not halted, most of the Amazon will irreversibly begin the transition tosavanna, inevitably disturbing the ecological balance. The Right-Wing Orchestration of Death and DestructionDr. Nobre blames the right-wing government of Jair Bolsonaro for encouraging illegal activity inside the Amazon. “The political discourse the president has been issuingsince he came into office in January 2019 has been encouraging environmental criminals because they feel there will be no punishment.” He observed that Brazil’s law-enforcing agencies haveshrinking budgets, andsome of the heads of divisions were fired because they were acting lawfully. “So, the message that went to the Amazon criminals was, we are never going to jail anymore because we have a president whosupports what we are doing, whosupports opening up more areas, whosupports invasion of indigenous territories for illegal mining for illegalselective logging.”Christian Poirier of Amazon Watch echoes Dr. Nobre’ssentiment. In an interview with The Real News, Poiriersaid the Bolsonaro regime has been an abject disaster for the Amazon, its peoples, and for the planet. “When wesaw essentially fascists come into power last year with a package of regressions, regressive actions to cut down hard-fought human rights and environmental protections, wesaw a process that has led us to the catastrophe we’reseeing today, which is actually not being talked about enough.” He lamented that not enough is beingsaid about the catastrophic impact the Amazon’s destruction will have on the climate crisis, and that “all of this is beingspurredsimultaneously by this recklessly, this criminally irresponsible regime.”Highlighting the mitigation actions Amazon Watch is undertaking, Christian Poiriersaid: “We helpedspearhead a moratorium on all industrial activities and criminal activities in and around indigenous territories during the COVID crisis that weresigned onto by more than 200 global organizations and endorsed by all of the principal indigenous federations and organizations in the Amazon areas in which we work.” Hesaid this action calls on governments to fulfill their duties, and for companies to be mindful of the consequences of their actions in the Amazon. “These businessesshould know their activities are exacerbating this crisis gravely and they need to respect the moratorium at this critical moment,” he asserted.

The tweet was deleted with an apology, but thesame maps wereshared tens of thousands of times onTwitter,Instagram,Facebookand i nan article that pointed to a discrepancy of 138,339 votes in Michigan. Most posts denounced the numbers as proof of fraud by Democrats in the Midwesternstate. However, the maps actuallyshow a 138,339 drop in Biden votes after a correction due to human error. Caroline Wilson, county clerk for the central Michigan county of Shiawassee, told AFP by phone, “I added an extra zero accidentally,” thereby reporting 153,710 votes for Biden instead of 15,371.“The minute it was discovered, it was corrected, probably within 20 minutes,so I’m amazed how fast thisspread,” Wilson added. Shesaid thestate of Michigan alerted her office of the mistake “because we don’t even have that many voters.”The central Michigan county only has55,612 registered voters.

The judge also faulted the guidelines for not addressing effective treatment of co-occurring conditions and breaking withstandards of care in pushing patients to lower levels of care. The unique needs of children and adolescents also were not properly addressed, Spero ruled.""The emphasis on cost-cutting that was embedded in UBH is guideline development process actually tainted the process, causing UBH to make decisions about guidelines based as much or more on its own bottom line as on the interests of the plan members, to whom it owes a fiduciary duty,"" the judge wrote in 2019.",2,2,Star Tribune-Minneapolis

180,Afghanistan: Life in Kabul after the Taliban victory,0.0,46.0,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58232815,https://adfontesmedia.com/bbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-16,25,"The Taliban captured Afghanistan is capital Kabul on Sunday, 20 years after they were ousted from power. So what does it look and feel like the day after its fall?The Taliban are everywhere, at the checkpoints which used to be official police or army barricades. There is not much panic in the city today, as there was yesterday. The Taliban are controlling traffic, they aresearching cars, and they are especiallysearching those vehicles which used to belong to police and the army, all of which they have confiscated. If there are Taliban fighters themselves driving those vehicles now, they arestopped at checkpoints, too. They told us that they checked these vehicles to makesure they were not looters and thieves disguised as Taliban. Thescenes at the airport were catastrophic. On the road there were families, children, young, old, all walking along the 2km (1.2 miles) road. People arestruggling to flee this country. Most are just waiting, on the green belt in the middle of the road. I am talking about more than 10,000 people at the airport. At the approach to the main entrance gates, there were Taliban with heavy weapons trying to disperse people byshooting in the air. People who wanted to get in were climbing the walls, the gates, even the barbed wire. Everysingle person was pushing to get in. Wespoke to an eyewitness who wasstuck at the airport on Sunday. He had a flight to go to Uzbekistan, but it did not happen. Officials then abandoned the airport. People had arrived without any tickets or passports - they thought they could get on any plane and be able to fly to anywhere else in the world, the eyewitnesssaid. Thousands of people werestuck inside the airport, without food or water. There were many women and children - and disabled people, too. But if you go into the city centre, life appears to be normal. There is a lot less traffic, most of theshops are closed. But people look much calmer than yesterday - yesterday, everybody was furious. There was a big traffic gridlock. I have onlyseen a few women on thestreet -somesingle women as well, without escort. Some were wearing blue burkas, but I alsosawsome wearingsurgical face masks and headscarves. And the Talibanseemed alright with them. There is no music on thestreets at all. They used to play background music at the hotel, but it hasstopped. Staff arescared. The city, however, isstill carrying on. It is calm. I have notspoken to many residents, but the local taxi driver I use was kind of alright with the takeover. Surprisingly, I haveseen people greeting Taliban militants -saying ""hello, more power to you, best of luck"", thatsort of thing. Taliban fightersseem happy, too - I havespoken to a couple of them, groundsoldiers on patrol. We tried to get into the presidential palace but they did not let us in. Theysaid we needed permission from the high command. But the militants Isaw were friendly to us. I wasscared yesterday a bit, fearful there was going to be violence and things like that. But luckily nothing happened. It wasso quiet and calm. I could not believe that the capital had changed hands after 20 years and it was allso quiet.

Ted Cruz of Texas clashed with a fellow Republican, Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, during a discussion of coronavirusspending and the federal deficit. According to the Washington Post’sJames Hohmann, Cotton “suggested” that “Republicansshould be willing to keep racking up debt to maintain power.” But Cruz vehemently disagreed, declaring “What in the hell are we doing?”Cotton, Hohmann notes, “argued that the full conference needs to focus on protecting their most vulnerable members. Cotton postulated that Democrats wouldspend more money if they win the Senate majority in November — and therefore, it is cheaper in the long run to allow thesize of thespending package to grow with more goodies to benefit incumbents who are up for reelection.”It remains to beseen whether or not President Donald Trump will win asecond term in November. Many recent polls haveshown Trump trailing former Vice President Joe Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee — insome of them, by double digits. But whether Trump leaves the White House in January 2021 or January 2025, Republicans will eventually have to debate what a post-Trump GOP will look like — and as Hohmannsees it, the clash between Cruz and Cotton could foreshadow a clash between the Republicansenators in 2024.“Cruz and Cotton are among thesmall clique of ambitious Republicansenators in their forties who have been laying the groundwork to run for president in 2024, along with Sens. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Josh Hawley (Mo.),” Hohmann explains. “The duelingstances Cruz and Cottonstaked out behind closed doors offer an early taste of the ideological battles we can expect as Republicans increasingly vie to take the torch from President Trump. These fights will flare up faster and hotter if the president loses in November. Others outside the Senate,such as Vice President (Mike) Pence and former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley, are also expected to compete for the nod.”",1,0,AlterNet
182,Is the FBI corrupt beyond repair?,33.0,6.67,https://dailytorch.com/2021/02/is-the-fbi-corrupt-beyond-repair/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-torch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-02,15,"By Thomas Swift JusticeLast week, the most recentslap in the face to the American people came in the form of a corrupt FBI lawyer getting a fine less thanseatbelt ticket for falsifying documents to violate the civil rights of American citizens. Unfortunately, this is the latest in a laundry list of issues with the FBI The most glaring problem with the FBI is its actions during the Russia Collusion hoax. The FBI allowed itself to become the enforcement arm of the Democratic Party. There is aslim chance the law enforcement agency did not know it was being used initially, but it had to know it was being usedshortly after the 2016 election. The FBI knew in January of 2017, after interviewing the primarysubsource of the Steele Dossier, that the dossier was a fraud. Did the FBIstop the investigation and apologize to everyone it wiretapped? No, did the FBIstart an investigation into Christopher Steele, the dossier author? No, the FBI doubled down, andstarted a coverup of its actions, that included the framing of Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, President Trump’s National Security Advisor. Recent declassifications of FBI documentsshow that not only did the FBI know thesubsource of the dossier could not vouch for the information in the document, but the FBI interviewed Christopher Steele in September of 2017 and found Steele was biased and, “hadstatements that conflicted with explanations from two of hissub-sources about their access to Russian officials.” It is important to note, the FBI had been unable to verify anything in the dossier up to this point, despitesending multiple warrants to the FISA Courtstating the opposite. What would happen if any “normal” citizen falsified documents and lied to a court?Here was another chance for the FBI to admit it was wrong and fell for ascam. But once again, it doubled down and continued to investigate innocent citizens hoping for a process crime. Does thatsound like the actions of a law enforcement agency with integrity? The actions of the FBI during the Mueller Investigation drew further questions about the ethics of the agency. Take the case of Roger Stone, an unofficial advisor for President Trump. Stone was also caught up in the Russia Collusion hoax. Stonespent hours in front of Congress and the FBI during the congressional hearings and investigations. When all wassaid and done, he was eventually charged with a process crime. Stone had been cooperating with Congress and the FBI andshowed no threat. Yet when he was charged, the FBI used an ungodly amount of force to arrest thesenior citizen with no criminal record for a nonviolent crime. TheFBIsent over two dozen agentsin tactical gear and vehicles… and a boat. All this for a man with no criminal record or history of violence. To keep this in perspective, the FBIsent more people after Roger Stone than they did for mass murdererWhitey Bulger. The FBI was also kind enough to alert media unfriendly to Stoneso the entire arrest could be documented for political purposes. Here, the actions of the FBIseem more inline with politics than justice. Yes, participating in a coup is bad enough, but perhaps the worst of recent FBI conduct was its action or lack of action during the USA Gymnasticssexual abusescandal. Larry Nassar was a former USA Gymnastics team doctor and professor at Michigan State University. Over the course of Nassar’s almost two-decade career, hesexually abused at least 265 young girls. Nassar hassince been arrested, tried, andsentenced for his heinous crimes, but dozens of young girls could have beenspared had the FBI been bothered. Between the time the FBI was first notified of Nassar’s actions in July of 2015 to his arrest in November of 2016, he continued tosee dozens of young girls. What was the FBI doing for almost a year and a half, while young girls were being abused?Olympian Aly Raisman told Savannah Guthriewhenshe was finally contacted by the FBI,she asked them “what tookso long?” She was told “we wanted to wait until the Olympics were over.” No one from the FBI has come forward to refute her claim. Supposedly, there is aDOJ OIG is investigation into what happened, but to date it is unknown what has been done or if anyone has been held to account for the FBI’s failure. This is par for the course, as the FBI and DOJ like to discipline themselves nor do they like to let Congress know when they make mistakes. Now the institutionalists on Capitol Hill and the media willsay this is only asampling of the FBI and not representative of the 99%. The problem with that theory is that the FBI tree is rotten from the core. Everyone involved in the Russia Collusion hoax was at the top of the FBI hierarchy. Everyone that lied to the FISA Court and knowinglysigned documents that were false, weresupposed to be the “best of the best” at the FBI One must then ask the question, how didso many unscrupulous people get into the FBI, then advance up the ranks to lead the agency? Is that what the FBI looks for in leadership?The FBI has become what itspent the Cold War fighting. The FBI has become an agency that investigates its political opponents, covers up its crimes, believes it is unaccountable to the people, and acts with impunity. The FBI has become the KGB.",0,0,Daily Torch
183,“F--k Him”: Rupert Murdoch Reportedly Made the Call to Bury Trump’s Election Night Dreams in a Shallow Grave,-10.0,35.33,https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2021/07/rupert-murdoch-donald-trump-arizona-2020,https://adfontesmedia.com/vanity-fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,25,"In the early-morning hours of November 4, the day after the 2020 election,held a news conference in the East Room of the White House in which he falsely claimed that the fact that he had been ahead in the early tallying of votes, and then later behind, meant that the election had beenstolen from him. “This is a fraud on the American public,” hedeclared. “This is an embarrassment to this country. We were getting ready to win this election. Frankly, we did win this election.” Obviously that wasn’t true at all—Trump hadn’t won anything because not all of the votes had been counted yet. Still, insomestates it had become clear that he was very likely going to lose, hence Fox News’s decision to declareArizona forJoe Biden. At the time the call from the right-wing outlet, made before any other major network,shocked the country—and according to a new book, it wasRupert Murdochwho gave it the greenlight, withsome less-than-charitable things tosay about Trump!Insiderreportsthat’s forthcoming book,includes ascene in whichLachlan Murdoch,the nonagenarian billionaire’sson, got a call from Fox’s election desksaying it was ready to announce Biden had won Arizona, which he then took to the top:The book [notes] that the Murdochs—whospearhead a vast right-wing media empire—had “every reason” to delay calling Arizona at the time, given Fox’ssteadfast allegiance to Trump and the fact that no other network had made the call yet. “Lachlan got his father on the phone to ask if he wanted to make the early call. His father, withsignature grunt, assented, adding, ‘F--- him,’” Wolff wrote. The book [says] that Fox News anchor then called Trump’s leadsocial mediastrategist,Jason Miller,to let him know the network was going to call Arizona for Biden. “Miller involuntarily rose from hisseat. ‘What the f---?’ hesaid out loud, looking around andseeing thestill-merry and untroubled faces in the Map Room”... Wolff wrote. Hemmer reportedly replied: “That’s what they’re doing. That’s what they’re going with.”“Who?” Miller asked.“The election desk,” Hemmersaid, adding that the network’s decision was going to be aired imminently. The decision to call Arizona for Biden was a pivotal moment on election night, indicating the Democrat was poised to win the traditionally Republican-leaningstate and complicating Trump’s ability to declare an early victory in the overall race. In astatement, a Fox News Mediaspokesperson told the Hive: ""This account is completely false.who leads the FOX News Decision Desk made the Arizona call on election night and FOX News Media PresidentJay Wallacewas then called in the control room. Any other version of thestory is wildly inaccurate.” Regarding Bill Hemmer’s call to Miller, a Fox Newsspokesperson insisted “This never happened and is completely untrue.”Trump was unsurprisingly livid about the Arizona decision and, as my colleague reported at the time, personally called Murdoch “toscream about the call and demand a retraction. Murdoch refused, and the callstood.” (Jared Kushneralso reportedly tried to convince the Fox News founder to withdraw the call, a “desperate” plea that fell on deaf ears.)Biden ultimatelywonArizona by roughly 10,000 votes. But if anyone thought Fox’s (and Murdoch’s) decision to momentarily refrain fromserving as a right-wing propaganda machinesuggested the network had changed its ways, they were deeply mistaken.the politics editor at the time, was fire din January. And the network’s hosts have, of course,perpetuatedthe lie that Trump won the election, while pushing bullshit conspiracy theories about the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Insaneopen carry laws? A ban on abortions aftersix weeks?Anti-trans legislation? The potential disenfranchisement of millions of people? “Gelatinous tubeworm”? The Lone Star State has got it all. Per:Republican lawmakers in Texas on Thursday launched theirsecond effort this year to pass new voting restrictions after Democrats blocked them in May with a dramatic walkout at thestate Capitol. The legislature convened Thursday for aspecialsession called by Governor(R) to enact a laundry list of conservative priorities, including a ban of transgender athletes on youthsports teams and beefed-up bordersecurity. But Abbott has made clear that “election integrity” is a top priority, and Republicans filed bills in the House and Senate that include many of thesame voting provisions theysought to enact earlier in the year. The new election proposals include a number of restrictions championed by former presidentThe measures would banseveral election programs implemented last year to help people vote during the coronavirus pandemic, including drive-through voting and 24-hour and late-night voting. Voting rights advocates noted that voters of color used these programs disproportionately, meaning they could disproportionately feel the impact of the restrictions. ByChris MurphyByNick BiltonByErin VanderhoofIn May, after Democratic lawmakersstaged a walkout tostop a piece of legislation viewed as one of the worst voter-suppression bills in the country from becoming a law, Abbott threatened to cut off funding for the Texas Legislature,tweeting, “I will veto Article 10 of the budget passed by the legislature. Article 10 funds the legislative branch. No pay for those who abandon their responsibilities. Stay tuned.” He also vowed to pass thescuttled bill—which would restrict polling hours, make it harder to vote by mail, give more power to partisan poll watchers, and increase punishments for mistakes made by election officials—in aspecialsession. Theso-called election-security proposals are “based on a lie that there was rampant fraud in our elections, and on the ‘big lie’ that Donald Trump actually won the last election,”state Rep.who urged Texas Democrats to walk out on May 30, told the.“That’s what this is all about—so they can curry favor with Donald Trump and hissupporters.

Don Jr., who is one of dozens of people in President Trump’s inner circle who have caught COVID-19, apparently tested positive earlier this week, and aspokesperson told Bloomberg that he is asymptomatic and nowself-isolating. His girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, tested positive for the virus over thesummer. It’s not clear how or where Trump Jr. was infected or if his case is linked to the earlier White House outbreaks. Also on Friday, White House aide Andrew Giuliani, who is Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani’sson, revealed that he had tested positive for COVID-19 as well. The younger Giuliani had attended the bizarre conspiracy theory-saturated press conference in a packed room at the Republican National Committee headquarters where his father and other members of Trump’s legal team held to make a case for overturning the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. Trump legal adviser Jenna Ellis, who took part in the press conference,said Friday that bothshe and Rudy Giuliani had tested negative. Bloomberg News also reports that Hannah McInnis, an aide to Vice President Mike Pence, also tested positive earlier this month, which may be another case linked to the earlier outbreak thatstruck Pence’s team the week before the election, infectingseveralstaffers including his top aides. That was one of at least threeserious outbreaks linked to the White House in the last two months. Two weeks ago, numerous people who attended an indoor Election Night party at the White Houselater tested positive for COVID-19, including President Trump’s chief ofstaff, Mark Meadows, Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, White House political director Brian Jack, Trump campaign adviser David Bossie, and many others, including a large number of Secret Service agents.

Some gave typically politicalspeeches, but all had one goal in mind: electing Joe Biden as the 46th president of the USs. Not only was the focus on electing Biden but also on the continued destruction being carried out by “president” Donald Trump. Some gave powerfulspeeches in “no holds barred” fashion, including Governor Andrew Cuomo. He did a fantastic job with New York, and many believe he could do thesame across the country, but last night was about Joe Biden. One of the most poignant messages came from Kristin Urquiza, whose father died from listening to “president” Trump’s false messaging about coronavirus. One of her most powerful messages was: “His only preexisting condition was trusting Donald Trump, and for that, he paid with his life.” Urquiza pledged to vote for Joe Biden in her father’s honor. Her father is an unfortunate example of listening to Donald Trump. Democrats are working hard to reach those who fail tosee the perils of listening to Trump, and we can only hope that their urgent callsshooksome people awake. Bernie Sanders was extremely clear that he expects his followers to vote for Joe Biden. He pointed out that he and Biden do not agree on everything but that Joe is making moves in the right direction, and four more years of Trump will ensure that none of the progressive policies make it past their own thoughts. Thespeech of the evening, however, goes to Michelle Obama. Michelle wasso convincing,so real, and at times, very emotional. She laid out from first-hand experience how challenging the job of president is and how the person in that office must rise to the occasion. One of the most compelling things Obamasaid was: “being president doesn’t change who you are; it reveals who you are,” and that is certainly true when it comes to Donald Trump, aself-centered narcissist who does nothing unless it benefits him. He refuses to listen toscience, preferring to listen to “my pillow man” andsome doctor who has absolutely no experience in epidemiology and who believes weshould all go out and infect each other to defeat the virus. As expected, Trump had to come back at Michelle Obama, and just like his plagiarizing wife, he had to use Michelle’s words, claiming thatshe was “in over her head.” No, that is you, Trump, and it is glaringly obvious. The worst thing about Trump’s inability to do the job hestole is his refusal to listen to those more knowledgeable to find asolution. He would rather kill us all with hisstupidity. Face it, Trump: Just like Barack, Michelleshowed you up, not that it is really that difficult to do. Anyone who believes his own hype more than the evidence pointing him in the face is headed for a downfall, and we cannot wait for Trump’s to come.",1,0,Palmer Report

When Isee them kneeling during the game, I just turn off the game. I have no interest in the game. Let me tell you this, plenty of other people out there, too.”Trump also claimed, without proof, that NBA ratings are way down because Trump only gets his rating numbers from what white people are watching. According toYardBarker.com, “ratings are up 14 percent from when theseason wassuspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.”This isn’t the first time that Trump has butted his orange-dusted nose insports business. Miami Heat forward Meyers Leonard’s president famously called NFL players’ moms “bitches” for kneeling during the national anthem in 2016. Since theseason checked ball, only four people — two players (one being Leonard) and two coaches — havestood for the national anthem, YardBarker.com reports. Players have been wearingsocial justice buzzwords on the backs of their jersey, but as one person noted on Twitter, I haven’tseen one player with the jersey name “Stimulus Check.”",1,0,The Root

Cawthorn Claims House Republicans Will 'Prosecute' Fauci For Doing His Job,-9.0,45.33,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/madison-cawthorn-anthony-fauci_n_60f9a97fe4b0ddf0097cdf5f,https://adfontesmedia.com/huffpost-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-22,25,"Republican Rep. Madison Cawthorn, the 25-year-oldDonald Trumpsuperfanfrom North Carolina, has made the bizarre claim that Dr. Anthony Faucimight be in legal jeopardy if Cawthorn’s party retakes control of the House in next year’s midterm elections. The first-term congressman told a right-wing fringe website Wednesday that Fauci, the nation’s topmost expert in infectious disease, could be “prosecuted” by a Republican-controlled House ― limits of congressional power be damned, apparently.“We want to prosecute this guy to the full ability of the law,” Cawthorn told thesite Real America’s Voice, claiming that Fauci has told unspecified lies for “fame and fortune.”Rep. Madison Cawthorn vows that if the GOP gains control of the House in 2022, he will ""makesure that consequences are doled out"" to Dr. Anthony Fauci: ""We want to prosecute this guy to the full ability of the law.""pic.twitter.com/kFN0rGOCGJThe House of Representatives does not enforce laws, and while it has investigative power and the power to impeach, Fauci himself cannot be impeached. Although available information about the virus has changed over time, Fauci has persistently encouraged Americans to follow guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Cawthorn, meanwhile, has used his platform to warn Americans against efforts to make coronavirus vaccines easily accessible. At the Conservative Political Action Conferenceearlier this month, he claimedsuch efforts could lead to authorities going “door-to-door” to “take your guns” and “take your Bibles.”Fauci, who leads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has become a frequent target of GOP ire in the coronavirus era for refusing to kowtow to Trump Republicans. Trump openly bashed Faucijust last month, calling him “not a great doctor but a great promoter” whilespeaking at a rally in Cawthorn’s homestate. In his interview Wednesday, Cawthorn endorsed Sen. Rand Paul’scallto refer Fauci to the Department of Justice, though he acknowledged that the request is not likely to go anywhere.“Jenna, I will just tell you, unfortunately the DOJ right now is under the control of the Biden administration,” Cawthorn told host Jenna Ellis, an attorney. “What’s going to come of it, I don’t know, but I’ll tell you, when we take the majority back in 2022, I’ll makesure consequences are doled out.”At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive newssubscriptions.

The news outlet -- which has chronicled the deeply divisive fight in Southlakeover how to teach race and racism inschools -- obtained an audio recording from a district meeting that included discussions about how to comply with a new Texas law, which lawmakerssay was intended to bar “critical race theory” from classrooms. From thestart, educators vehemently opposed the bill,saying it was vague and would have a chilling effect on their ability to have honest conversations about America’s past and present. The new law --similar to ones passed in other conservativestates -- listsseveral broad topics that can’t be discussed andsets guidelines for talking about “controversial”subjects. It comes as conservative pundits and politicians have conflated critical race theory withschools’ diversity and inclusion efforts and anti-racism training, among other ideas.

Bryan Hughes, denied that this was a proper interpretation of the new law. State Sen. Kelly Hancock, R-North Richland Hills, wrote on Twitter that “Southlake just got it wrong.”“School administratorsshould know the difference between factual historical events and fiction,” Hancock wrote. “No legislation issuggesting the action this administrator is promoting.”Carroll ISD Superintendent Lane Ledbetter issued an apology to Southlake families late Thursday. Hesaid the district recognizes that “there are not twosides of the Holocaust.”“As we continue to work through implementation of HB3979, we also understand this bill does not require an opposing viewpoint on historical facts,” he wrote. “As a district we will work to add clarity to our expectations for teachers and once again apologize for any hurt or confusion this has caused.”The commentsstirred outrage. Texas Democratic Party Co-Executive Director Hannah Roe Beck condemned actionsshe called “terrifying.”“We’reseeing books banned, educators reprimanded for teaching authentic history, and kids deprived of their right to learn about the world they’re growing up in,”shesaid in astatement. “Texas Republicans are censoring education to pander to right wing extremists -- and putting Texas families and kids in danger while they do.”The DMN Education Lab deepens the coverage and conversation about urgent education issues critical to the future of North Texas.

190,"Jalen Rose’s ‘Tokenism’ Comments About White Player Are A Problem, But The Double Standard Is The Real Issue",10.67,34.0,https://www.dailywire.com/news/jalen-roses-tokenism-comments-about-white-player-are-a-problem-but-the-double-standard-is-the-real-issue,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-wire-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-01,25,"Last week on “Jalen & Jacoby,” ESPN host Jalen Roseclaimedthat the reason Kevin Love — a white player — wasselected to the roster of the US Olympic basketball team was because of “tokenism.” He then went on tosay that he was “disappointed” in theselection committee for being “scared to make an all-black team representing the USs of America.”It may have been a “hot take,” but it wildly missed the mark. The implication was that the only reason Love wasselected was because of the color of hisskin, and that theselection committee wouldsomehow be uncomfortable with an all-black Olympic team roster. On Sunday, Rose “apologized” for his comments in a 42-minute Instagram video.“If I feel like Kevin Loveshould make the team or not, I’m entitled to my opinion,” Rosesaid, as reported by Fox News. “You don’t have to like my opinion, you don’t have to like me. There’s a lot of people trying to assassinate my character or whatever, but those people,some of them, have been trying to for like 30 years … that’s how it is when you have the nerve in a lot of peoples’ estimation to be outspoken.”“But you know why I’m apologizing right now? To the game. Because I’m what the game made me,” he continued. “I was raised by the all-time greats and you know what I would never want to do? Disappoint [Rose’s late mother] Jeanie Rose or disappoint the all-time greats that raised me.”That’s not an apology, but that’s really not what weshould be focusing on. While I didn’t like what Rose had tosay, I’m also against cancel culture,so firing Rose is not a valid option. The real crux of the issue is that Rose is comfortablesaying racially charged words on a majorshow on the largestsports network around. Exactly, Jalen. But while weshould all be able to disagree, thissimply isn’t the case. If the roles were reversed, with a white personspeaking about a black player in thesame manner, he orshe would be immediately removed — live on-air — and fired. That individual would never work insports again. And yet — based on the history of ESPN and their handling ofsimilarsituations — it’s doubtful that Rose even needed to apologize for his words. In fact, Rose made it clear in his video that no one pressured him to apologize. For example, in 2020, ESPN football analyst Domonique Foxworth went on Bomoni Jones’ pod cast and discussed why he rootsagainstBuffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen. I am fully aware that I have biases… And my biases are not based on Josh Allen, it’s based on the people defending Josh Allen. I would be 100% lying if Isaid when Josh doessomething dumb, a little part of me doesn’t get happy. It is not because I don’t want Josh tosucceed, it’s because the people who are telling me that Josh is the ‘second coming’, and Josh is better than everybody, are people with American flags, and dogs, andskulls and crossbones in their avi’s, and when you go take a dip into their tweet history there’ssome really concerning retweets and likes. Foxworth’s offensive comments were called out by Fox Sports’ Clay Travis, yet the backlash didn’t result in any punishment for Foxworth.“Statements like these are fundamentally unfair and unbelievablystupid, and not to mention racist, let’s be honest here,” Travissaid. “If any white ESPN analystsaid he roots against Lamar Jackson because of the people who root for Lamar Jackson he would be fired on thespot, and it would be a major nationalstory…”Travis alluded to the hypocrisy of ESPN, allowingsome tosay whatever thought comes to mind while others constantly face pressure to toe the company line.“We can’t have a marketplace of ideas wheresome people are allowed tosay whatever they want, and other people are not able tosay whatever THEY want. If you’re not going to condemnstupidity across the board, regardless of who is beingstupid, then you are fundamentally failing in your analysis of any argument…” Travis added. But we no longer live in a world where the rules are applied equally to everyone, regardless of race or creed. What Rosesaid is undeniably offensive. However, the real issue is that he felt comfortable enough tosay it on ESPN in the first place. Joe Morgan is the Sports Reporter for The Daily Wire.

He alsoserved in 2012 as the first black vice chief ofstaff of the army, theservice is number two ranking position. Having retired in 2016, he has been out of the military less than the requiredseven years,so would need a waiver from Congress to take the post. Mr Blinken has previouslysaid Brexit was like a dog being run over by a car - a ""total mess"". He compared it to the rise of far-right leader Marine Le Pen in France. So,may havesome persuading to do andsome delicate conversations ahead. Like Mr Biden, expect Mr Blinken to be pushing hard on thesanctity of the Northern Irish peace deal in the aftermath of. He is widely viewed as a pragmatic centrist on foreign policy who hassupported past American interventions and is well respected bysome. Served as deputy homelandsecuritysecretary from 2013 to 2016. He'd be the first Latino to run the department if confirmed and will be tasked with implementing and managing the nation is immigration policies. He is a Cuban-born immigrant whose family fled the Castro revolution. He also worked as an attorney in. He will need to work on rebuilding faith in the department after President Trump,some criticssay, turned it into a passive recipient of his most controversial policies. If confirmed, the former presidential nomination candidate would be the first openly gay person approved by the Senate to a cabinet position. At 38, Mr Buttigieg was one of the youngest in the large group of Democratic wanna bes whosought the chance to run for the White House in the early primaries. He had undergone a meteoric rise having only been the mayor of asmall Indiana city before his presidential run. But thesuccess hescored insome of the first contests to choose a contender to Mr Trump in January marked him out as unexpectedly popular. Likely to be working extensively with Mr Buttigieg and John Kerry will be Ms Granholm, who if confirmed will have the task of moving the country towards achieving the requirements of the Paris Accord, which Mr Biden hassaid he will rejoin assoon as he is inaugurated.

His nomination was blocked by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Mr Cardona is currently the education commissioner for Connecticut. As a former teacher, his appointment would fulfil Mr Biden is pledge to choose a professional educator to lead the education department.

192,Biden Put Climate at the Heart of His Campaign. Now He’s Delivered Groundbreaking Nominees,-10.33,44.67,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/17122020/biden-epa-interior-secretary-deb-haaland-michael-regan-climate/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,21,"President-elect Joe Biden rounded out his climate and environment team Thursday with ground breaking cabinet nominations at the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of the Interior, agencies critical to his pledge to combat climate change and emphasize environmental justice. Michael S Regan, who has led a transformation of climate policy as North Carolina’ssenior environmental official under Governor Roy Cooper, was nominated toserve as EPA administrator. He would be the first Black man to run the agency that enforcessuch bedrock environmental laws as the Clean Air Act and Clean Water Act, regulates power plant and tailpipe emissions and oversees cleanup of the nation’s most toxic dumps. US Rep. Deb Haaland, a 35th-generation New Mexican from the Pueblos of Laguna and Jemez, was nominated as the first Native Americansecretary of the interior, which would put her in charge of a department that manages vast federal land holdings and oversees programs thatserve 1.9 million Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Both posts require Senate confirmation. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. A third key environmental official, Brenda Mallory, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, was chosen by Biden to head the White House Council on Environmental Quality, a key coordinating body that will oversee newly elevated councils on environmental justice. Mallory previouslyserved as President Obama’s top lawyer on the council. Biden’s transition team had previously announced the nominations of other key climate and environment team members: former Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm forsecretary of energy, former EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy as national climate advisor and Ali Zaidi, a former Obama administration official nowserving as New York’s deputysecretary of energy and environment, as deputy national climate advisor. Last month, Biden named former Secretary of State John Kerry, who helped negotiate the 2015 Paris climate agreement, as his global climate envoy andsaid he will alsosit on the National Security Council. The Biden climate team faces what environmentalists describe as a Herculean rebuilding effort after four years in which the Trump administration has rolled back over 100 environmental regulations, withdrawn the nation from the Paris accord and promoted a fossil fuel agenda at about every turn. Biden put climate change near the center of his campaign, promising a $2 trillion climate and jobs plan for dramatically reducing carbon emissions and transition ing to an economy powered by renewable energy. But his political options will be limited even if hesqueaks out a razor-thin Democratic majority in the Senate, with two wins in crucial runoff racesin Georgia on January 5. Democrats hold only a narrow margin in the HouseWith the loss of oneseat in Georgia, Biden could be forced to rely heavily on federal rule-making, which requires deft leadership and executive orders, which are less durable andsubject to legal challenge. If confirmed, Haaland will inherit an Interior Department after an aggressive push by the Trump administration to expand oil, gas and coal development on federal lands, along with the taint of a corruptionscandal involving Trump’s first Interior Secretary, Ryan Zinke. Conflict-of-interest questions have alsosurrounded the office’s current occupant, David Bernhardt, and legal uncertainty has hung over the controversial tenure of William Perry Pendley as acting director of the Bureau of Land Management. Haaland will face the challenge of undoing dozens of conservative policies only recently embedded in the department’s energy, wildlife and tribal programs. A voice like mine has never been a Cabinetsecretary or at the head of the Department of Interior. Growing up in my mother’s Pueblo household made me fierce. I’ll be fierce for all of us, our planet, and all of our protected land. I am honored and ready toserve. Interior’s portfolio also includes a mind-boggling—and contentious—array of duties, from managing one of every five acresin the USs and more than 400 National Park Service units, to protecting endangeredspecies and carrying out thescientific work of the US Geological Survey. Interior, with a record ofsuppressing the rights and taking the lands of Native Americans, also maintains programs for 574 federally recognized tribes through the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Indian Bureau of Education. In Haaland, the president-elect appears to be following through with campaign promises to elevate Indigenous leaders in his administration and to tackle climate change. The congresswoman, who made history two years ago as one of the first two Indigenous women to be elected to Congress, has experience in the fights for both climate and Indigenous causes. And advocates for the environment and for Indigenous rights applauded her nomination. The daughter of militaryservice members,shespent four days in 2016 at the Standing Rock Sioux camps with activists protesting the $3.8 billion Dakota Access Pipeline.“Tribes came from everywhere tostand with the water protectors,”said Haaland, calling the effort in a article as “an environmental movement that was deep and meaningful,” especially among Native Americans. “It wassignificant thatso many of us came together to protect water, our natural resources.”Haaland, 60, won reelection last month as one of three New Mexico Democrats in the US House of Representatives after havingserved as vice chair of the House Natural Resources Committee, chair of the national parks, forests, and public landssubcommittee and as a member of the Subcommittee on Indigenous Peoples of the USs. While her work includes keeping climate change at the forefront of the committee’s agenda,she’s also been known to press for clean energy policies that would help maintain jobs and paychecks in a leadingstate for fossil fuel energy. She has been asupporter of the Green New Deal and a f racking ban, which would put her at odds with Biden. With the Biden-Harris administration, federal climate action is back on the table,”said Zuni tribal member and New Mexico farmer Jim Enote, who’s also CEO of the Native-led Colorado Plateau Foundation andsoon-to-be board chairman of the environmental advocacy group, the Grand Canyon Trust. The American Petroleum Institute’s Mike Sommerssaid in a news release that the oil and gas industry is ready to work with Haaland and the Biden administration on climate change.“In the year ahead, we will continue to advocate for policies that promote technological innovation, advance modern energy infrastructure andsupport access to natural gas and oil resources—both on federal and private lands—which will be critical to rebuilding our economy and maintaining America’sstatus as a global energy leader,” Sommerssaid, emphasizing that the campaign made promises to the energy work force and millions of indirect jobs. Regan may be especially wellsuited to lead the EPA, an agency that has been downsized and demoralized under Trump, with his fossil fuel and deregulatory agenda. Regan took over the leadership of the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality in 2017 undersimilar circumstances, following the administration of Governor Pat McCrory, a Republican, and his top environmental regulator, Donald R. van der Vaart, whom critics have described as a crusading idealogue.“They were taking climate change off websites,” Dan Crawford, director of governmental relations for the North Carolina League of Conservation Voters,said of van der Vaart’s leadership. “It wasn’t aboutscience. It was about customerservice and putting polluters first.”Hesaid that “what Regan has done is phenomenal. Our loss will be the country’s gain.”Regan has done “extensive work in the realm of retiring coal plants and addressing the issue of coal ash and legacy pollution,” added Jennifer Rennicks, a policy director with the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy and a resident of North Carolina. She also credited Regan with carrying out Cooper’s broad-based climate agenda that has included an in depth examination of how global warming is affecting North Carolina, and an ambitious climate action plan. Cooper’s efforts havestood out in the South. There’s been a big focus on “addressing climate change through clean energy and electric vehicles and transportation,” Rennickssaid. Cooper’s plan calls for transforming thestate’s electrical grid tosave energy and make it more resilient; reducing the energy burdens of low-income residents; and cutting greenhouse gas emissions from the powersector by 60 to 70 percent below 2005 levels by 2030, while working toward zero emissions by 2050, among othersteps. National groups expressedsupport for Regan as EPA administrator. Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brunesaid that Biden “ran on the boldest,strongest climate policy—one that centers climate justice—in history. As he continues to build his cabinet, perhaps no pick thus far emphasizes this focus as much as Michael Regan.”In North Carolina, Regan’s “attention to addressing environmental justice, cleaning up coal ash, and prio rit izing clean energy is exactly what the country requires as the Biden administrationseeks to rebuild after the worst administration ever for our environment and the climate,” Brunesaid. A top energy lobbyist also praised Regan.“Michael Regan has had an impressive rise, from the EPA air program to the public interest community to heading the North Carolinastate agency,”said Scott Segal, a partner at the Bracewell law firm who works with energy clients. “He has brought fresh thinking along the way.“Regan understands that tough environmental goals tempered with economic and technological reality produce the best approach on everything from climate change to more local problems,” Segalsaid. “We look forward to working with him in his new post.”Dennis McLerran, the former EPA Region 10 administrator who left the agency in 2017,said Regan will have to immediately tackle matters critical to returning the agency to its role as an environmental watchdog.“Those include addressing the regulatory rollbacks that have occurred during the Trump Administration and bringing goodscience forward as the fundamental underpinning of regulatory policies and decisions,” hesaid. Regan will need to address climate change by restoring programs that address methane emissions and tailpipe emissions along withsetting the course for the US to achieve Paris-based emission levels, McLerransaid. Bill Muno, former director of the EPA’s Superfund program for the Great Lakes Region from 1995 to 2005, echoed the hope of renewed emphasis on environmental justice, especially near Superfundsites. A recent investigation by Inside Climate News, NBC News and The Texas Observer found 945 Superfundsites nationwide vulnerable to climate-amplified hurricanes, flooding,sea level rise and wildfires.“To the degree that there will be a renewed emphasis on addressingsites in EJ communities, that will be a big positive for the Superfund program,” hesaid. “Hopefully the new administration will provide the funding tosupport this new emphasis.”Regan was reportedly Biden’ssecond choice for EPA After an uprising by environmental justice and progressive groups, Biden passed over the candidate who was long thought to be the favorite for the EPAslot, Mary Nichols, a former assistant EPA administrator and the outgoing chair of the California Air Resources Board. Nichols has deep knowledge and hands-on experience with what is likely to be Biden’s top climate policy challenge at EPA, restoringstrong fuel economystandards for passenger vehicles. After Trump jettisoned thesingle largeststep that the Obama administration had taken to address climate, Nichols broker ed a deal with five auto makers to keep fuel economy improvements on track—an agreement that is thought to be a likely template for a nationwide auto industry deal. But 70 national and California environmental justice groups and other organizationssent a letter to Biden’s transition team last week blasting Nichols as having a “bleak track record in addressing environmental racism.”At the center of their dispute is California’s cap-and-trade program to cut carbon emissions. Minority communities who are already overburdened with pollutionsay it has allowed them to becomesacrifice zones, as polluters take easiersteps to meet their obligations, like purchasing offsets. Veloz, a nonprofit electric car advocacy group that Nichols was instrumental in getting off the ground, had an online tribute to her tenure at CARB thatseemed designed to address the environmental justice groups’ concerns; theyshowed aslide of Nichols in the 1963 March on Washington for civil rights, and talked about her work in the 1960s registering Blacks to vote. But opposition to her appointment by the activist groups that had worked hard for Biden’s election proved too difficult to overcome. The controversyshows how environmental justice and climate policy are becoming intertwined as never before, and as the Biden administration takesshape. It alsoshows how cap-and-trade, once thought to be the most politically viable climatesolution, has fallen deeply out of favor. Biden has not talked about it as part of his plan, but activists were determined not tosee a California-style cap-and-trade program emerge from Biden’s EPA.“We’re glad tosee President-elect Biden listen to front line communities and pass over … Nichols,”said Lisa Ramsden, a Greenpeacesenior climate campaigner. “In doingso, Biden gave himself the chance to choose an EPA administrator who will prioritize justice for the communities most impacted by fossil-fueled pollution.”",2,2,Inside Climate News

Are you a nanny with experience as a camp counselor willing to overseescavenger hunts and an obstacle course for a family’s privatesummer camp? Then thisBeverly Hills position is perfect for you. The rich have alwayssought to create private worlds of their own, cordoned off from the rest of the country and insulated from the violence their resource hoarding inflicts on others. What the coronavirus has provided is a common denominator, asingle ongoing event that has exacerbated every existing form of inequality and inspired among the elites a certain kind of brashness about getting what they believe is theirs to take: jumping to the front of the line to get tested, hiring concierge doctors, and organizing private drive-through testingsites. And now, a life uninterrupted by a pandemic while othersstruggle tosecure the basics for themselves and their families. Across the country, publicschoolsystems are trying to develop best practices for anothersemester of remote learning that willservice the tens of millions of parents and kids who depend on these institutions beyond their educationalservices. Thissummer, teachers at public and privateschools alike have organized against their administrations to ensure theirschoolsystems are doing everything possible to protect theirstudents, their communities, and them. And they’ve done this while grappling with the fact that another remotesemester will only furtherset back thestudents already disproportionately underserved by the educationsystem; in New York City, are cent review by the city’s Independent Budget Office found that the Grab & Go program designed to help feed children at risk of going hungry only distributed a quarter of the meals it usually provided children during in-personschooling. As manyschools have opted to pursue remote learning tostart the fall, parents with the means to doso have begunshelling out for private “pod” teachers. A “microschool community” in San Francisco is footing the bill for registered nurses to conduct weekly Covid-19 tests for their hired teachers. Another group, also in the Bay Area, is looking for a Spanish-fluent teacher to keep up with their kindergartners’ language immersion program. In New York City, two parents are looking for a live-in “teacher nanny” to work 40 to 45 hours a week at their house in thesuburbs. “You don’t go home until Covid is better contained,” the job listing reads. “You haveseparate living quarters and you can leave the property whenever you like but on foot.” The pay for this year-roundservicestarts at $70,000 but no worries: “You are welcome to give up your apartment andstay with them for the year andsave money.”These are jobs in a country where millions of people need them—the arrangements might even be an improvement forsome teachers—but the dynamic isstill a broken one. As of June, the unemployment rate in 20states was above ten percent while the virus continues to hospitalize and kill a rising number of people in this country. Meanwhile, the main debate being had on Capitol Hill thissummer concerned whether the government was distributing too much money to working and middle-class peoplesuddenly out of a job—all while Congress breezily passed a $740 billion defense bill and left for a nice paidsummer break. With the Paycheck Protection Program funds forsmall businesses from thespring beginning to dry up and the$600 unemploymentstimulusexpired, thousands of locally owned restaurants now have to choose between closing upshop temporarily or going out of business—and putting their employees out of work—for good. Meanwhile, in Connecticut, a chief executive officer is offering a job for a personal chef at “one of his personal homes.” Bonus points if the candidate has “the ability and desire to organize, clean, and manage the dwelling.” Other, more health-conscious rich families have made compromises—like having their personal chefs cook in the pool house. These jobsservicing the elite are not random; they are the product of asystem that has clearly been designed for one group and not the other. Doing its part to add to the misery, the best–or rather, most telling–plan the White House has been able to foist came in the form of the Ivanka Trump-led “Find Something New” campaign that debuted last month—a public initiative that tried to rebrand the widespread joblessness crisis as an opportunity toswitch career paths. I amset to be an ecologist; others, like my editor, are destined to be interplanetary doctors (presumably for a wealthy family of four living in the Mars version of the Hamptons.)In this void created by federal inaction, the wealthy have chosen to help themselves. The demand for private jets wasso high in April that operators we rerunning out of planes. (It helped that Congress carved out multiple tax breaks for private jet companies, dropping both the federal excise tax and fuel tax.) For families looking tostay closer to home, many hauled their nannies to theirsummer homes, threatening to fire them if the at-risk workers refused to incubate themselves. Martha Stewart now lives full-time with her gardener, driver, and housekeeper—her “three detainees,”she called them—at her Westchester home. Whensome families went to hire replacement workers, they addedstipulations includingCovid-19 antibodies. Thesprawlingsystemic effects of this clearsplit in financial ability is not lost on everyone. Speaking withThe Colorado Sunabout the innately exclusive pod approach to education, Melissa Rich, a parent considering putting her child in one of these privatesettings for theschool year, acknowledged, “This idea can replicate the white flight that wesaw in the 1950s.” Katie Farnan, a Boulder parent committed to her childrens’ publicschool, laid out the ramifications more clearly: “I want my kid to come back to aschool that has the funding needed for the community itserves,”shesaid. “And there’s a good chunk of community that will have never left thatschool but will come back to aschool that may have fewer resources because families have divested.”As my colleague Jo Livingstonewroteon the phenomenon of microschools, “The problem is everywhere, not just in one Bay Area backyard.” The question now is “What do we do with all this information?” We knew well before the pandemic how imbalanced and cruel America was for most workers because the wealthy wanted it that way. The calls for the private chef, the microschool teacher, and the contracted nurse are not individual affairs. They are another attempt to permanently distance theselect few from the rest ofsociety while they continue tosiphon the nation’s wealth. You have to blow up the model this inevitably calcifies into. There will be noshortage of crises in our future—another pandemic or a climate emergency—and these private, parallel economies will only grow. Without the redistributive policies necessary to prevent it,our future will look more and more like the nation under pandemic: Asociety with an ocean-sized gulf between us and them, with onesideslowly drowning and the other remarking that the water feels just fine.",1,1,New Republic

If that never occurred to you, you can consider yourself lucky and privileged. Even though feeding yourself and your family is is the least you can do tosurvive, for many Americans it is out of their reality to do what forsome of us is just the basics for the maintenance of our lives. Tosay 2020 has been a hard year is not enough. 2020 has been the toughest year in decades forseveral families around the country. Even during easier times, millions of American families battle hunger on a daily basis, and right now, times couldn’t be farther from easy. That is what we’re going to talk about today. We about to disclosesome very disturbing data which points out that over 50 million Americans will facestarvation by the end of this year. Keep tuned and don’t forget to like andsubscribe to our channel and to helpspreading this very important message. From all the unsettling things we haveseenso far in 2020, to witness a massive amount of families having to count their coins to find money to minimally feed themselves is one of the most tragicsituations America has undergone over the past few decades. Many Americans were forced to change their lifestyle dramatically, cutting their food budgets due to a lack of income, while many others are now only having one or two meals a day, and demands at food banks around the country arespiking like never before. Yesterday, Bloomberg has published a report that could only be defined as one of the most devastatingsituations this country has ever faced. It reveals thestruggles of a number of rural workers that expend the day inside plantations amongst an abundant amount of food that they can no longer pay for. Jessica Traxler is one fo these workers. Surrounded by food thatshe couldn’t afford, and “sitting in a faded-out Chevysedan one July morning insouthern Minnesota,she looked out at cornstalks, lush green, as far as the eye couldsee. A few miles to the east, a mill was pumping out flour. Just beyond it, a farm grew peppers, beans, and berries. To the north, there were dairies, one after the other. To thesouth, a huge pork plant. Grain elevators, poultry yards, cheese plants—allstood just ashort drive away,” describes the article authored by Catarina Saraiva, Carolina Gonzalez, and Peyton Forte. If there is a place that portrays how atrocious America’s hunger problem has become during thesanitary outbreak, it is bothsadly and ironically in the middle of the breadbasket thatsupplies food from coast to coast. It is being projected that the ranks of Americans fighting hunger are going to increase by 45% this year, meaning that over 50 million are likely to facestarvation or at leastsevere food deprivation until the end of 2020. Thestory describes that “Traxler, her husband, andsix children are among them. She had come to thisspot, an emptyschool parking lot in the town of Mankato, to collect free boxes of foodstaples: milk and apples and carrots. Hundreds of Minnesotans waited in line ahead of her for hours.“It’s been hard,”shesaid. “We’ve had to dramatically change how we eat.”According to Feeding America, the nation’s largest hunger-relief organization, about one-third of those relying on foodshelves, large-scale and emergency food distributions at this moment are insuchsituation for the first time in their lives, just as Traxler and her family, after losing her job due toshutdowns related to the health crisis. Insome parts of Minnesota, that number can escalate up to 70%. Now, the roughest debate regarding deeply-rootedsystemic inequalities is about one of the most basic divides: who will eat well and who will go hungry. Millions of families are already unassisted and don’t have enough to eat. Over 60 million jobs were lost and every day it goes by this number only rises. Even though you might think that your job issafe, and hopefully it is, millions of others also thought their jobs weresafe right before they were let go. With thatsaid, we want you to know that our aim is not at all to discourage you. As Michael Snyder describes what is on his latest book “Lost Prophecies Of The Future Of America”: “there is hope in understanding what is happening, there is hope in getting prepared” and wesay there is hope in trusting that there isstill a way out of this mess. Stockpile your food, gather yoursupplies, join forces with your friends and neighbors. Keep informed, and most importantly, protect yourself. To be prepared is to be able to face the harsh reality andstill keep your mindstrong enough to face hardships resourcefully.”For more economic collapse news visit our website:-○Viewer comment:Minnesota Prepper DIY,“I’msure it will be more like 100 million by the end of Winter.”I agree… – CP",0,0,Before Its News

But that changed as the nation moved into its thirdsurge of the virus this fall. By mid-December, Hill County had recorded more than 1,500 cases — the vast majoritysince October 1 — and 33 people there had died. When Larson hears peoplesay pandemicsafety rulesshould end,she talks about how contagious the COVID virus is, howsome people experience lasting effects and how hospitals areso full that care for any ailment could face delays.“In public health, we’veseen the battle before, but you typically have the time to build your evidence, researchshowing that this really doessave lives,” Larsonsaid. “In the middle of a pandemic, you have no time.”Public health laws typically come long aftersocial normsshift, affirming a widespread acceptance that a change in habits is worth the public good and that it’s time forstragglers to fall in line. But even when decades of evidenceshow a rule cansave lives —such as wearingseat belts or notsmoking indoors — the debate continues insome places with the familiar argument that public restraints violate personal freedoms. This fast-moving pandemic, however, doesn’t affordsociety the luxury of time. State mandates have put local officials in charge of changing behavior while general understanding catches up. Earlier this month, US Surgeon General Jerome Adamsstood next to Montana’s governor in Helena andsaid he hopes people wear masks because it’s the right thing to do — especially as COVID hospitalizations rise.“You don’t want to be the reason that a woman in labor can’t get a hospital bed,” Adamssaid, adding a vaccine is on the way. “It’s just for a little bit longer.”Hespoke days afterstate lawmakers clashed over masks as a majority of Republican lawmakers arrived for a committee meeting barefaced and at least one touted false information on the dangers of masks. As of December 15, the Republican majority hadn’t required masks for the upcoming legislativesession,set to begin January 4. And now a group opposed to masks from Gallatin and Flathead counties has file da lawsuit asking a Montana judge to block thestate’s pandemic-relatedsafety rules. Public health laws typicallyspark political battles. Changing people’s habits is hard,saidLindsay Wiley, director of the health law and policy program at American University in Washington, DC Despite the misconception that there was universal buy-in for masks during the 1918 pandemic, Wileysaid,some protesters intentionally built rapsheets of arrests for going mask less in the name of liberty.“In public health, we’veseen the battle before, but you typically have the time to build your evidence, researchshowing that this really doessave lives. In the middle of a pandemic, you have no time.”Shesaid health officials realize any health restrictions amid a pandemic require the public’s trust and cooperation forsuccess.“We don’t have enough police to walk around and force everyone to wear a mask,”shesaid. “And I’m notsure we want them to do it.”Local officials have the best chance to win over thatsupport, Wileysaid. Andseeing elected leaderssuch as President Donald Trumprebuffhis own federal health guidelines makes that harder. Meanwhile, publicshaming like calling unmasked peopleselfish orstupid can backfire, Wileysaid, because if they were to give in to mask-wearing, they would essentially be accepting those labels. In the history of public health laws, even rules that have had time to build widely accepted evidence weren’t guaranteedsupport. It’s illegal in Montana to go without aseat belt in a moving car. But, as in13otherstates, authorities aren’t allowed to pull people over for being unbuckled. Every few years, a Montana lawmaker, backed by a collection of public health and law enforcement organizations, proposes a law to allowseat belt trafficstops, arguing it wouldsave lives. In 2019, that request didn’t even make it out of committee,squelched by the arguments of personal choice and not giving too much power to the government. Main opposition points against public health laws — whether it’s masks,seat belts, motorcycle helmets orsmoking — cansound alike. When Missoula County became the first place in Montana to ban indoorsmoking in publicspaces in 1999, opponentssaid the change would destroy businesses, be impossible to enforce and violate people’s freedom of choice.“They are thesame arguments in a lot of ways,”said Ellen Leahy, director of the Missoula City-County Health Department. “Public health was right at that intersection between what’s good for the whole community and the rights and responsibilities of the individual.”Montana adopted an indoorsmoking ban in 2005, but many bars and taverns were given until 2009 to fall in line. And, insome places, debate and court battles continued for a decade more on how the ban could be enforced. Amid the COVID pandemic, Missoula County was again ahead of much of thestate when it passed its own mask ordinance. The county has two hospitals and a university thatswells its population withstudents and commuters.“If you have tosee it to believe it, you’re going tosee the impact of a pandemic first in a city, most likely,” Leahysaid. Compliance hasn’t been perfect andshesaid the need forstrict enforcement has been limited. As of early December, out of the more than 1,500 complaints the Missoula health department followed up onsince July, itsent closure notices to four businesses that flouted the rules. In Hill County, when the health department gets complaints that a business is violating pandemic mandates, two part-time healthsanitarians, who perform health inspections of businesses, talk with the owners about why the rules exist and how to live by them. Often it works. Other times the complaints keep coming. County attorney Karen Alleysaid the local health officials have reached out to her office with complaints of noncompliance on COVIDsafety measures, butshe has notseen enough evidence to bring a civil case against a business. Unlike other health laws,shesaid, mask rules have no casestudies yet to offer a framework for enforcing them through the Montana courts. (A handful of cases against businessesskirting COVID rules werestill playing out as of mid-December.)“Somebody has to be the test case, but you never want to be the test case,”said Alley, who is part of a team of three. “It’s a lot of resources, a lot of time.”Larson, with the Hill County Health Department,said her focus isstill on winning over the community. Andshe’s excited aboutsome progress. The town’s annual live Nativityscene, which typically draws crowds with hot cocoa, turned into a drive-by event this year. She doesn’t expect everyone to follow the rules — that’s never the case in public health. But Larson hopes enough people will toslow down the virus. That could be happening. By mid-December, the county’s tally of daily active cases was declining for the first timesince itsspike began in October.“You just try to figure out the best way for your community and to get their input,” Larsonsaid. “Because we need the community’s help tostop it.”The Montana GOP uninvited a planned conventionspeaker amid US Senate drama. The Helena City Commission is considering whether to ask voters to approve added taxes to pay for a new firestation and additional police officers and firefighters.

""You have this very fracturedsystem. It really is like herding cats.""Thestate is at a crossroads in its post-pandemic attempt to curb homelessness, and the rest of the nation is watching. Governor Gavin Newsom hasset aside $12 billion in what he called a historic budget to combat homelessness. COVID-19 protections are nearing an end, meaning evictions willsoon be allowed and could worsen the problem. And all of it is happening while a lawsuit threatens to reshape how Los Angeles – and perhaps thestate – has tackled homelessness after a federal judge issued ascathing rebuke of the decades of failed plans, leadership and promises to fix the problem. Solving the cycle of homelessness has befuddled policymakers for decades. Money is thrown at it, as are new ideas. Yet more people end up living on thestreets. For about 30 years, Karen Barnes has worked to help people experiencing homelessness in thestate. Many of thoseshe and her team have worked withsuffer from extreme mental illness and other illnesses, from out-of-control diabetes tosexually transmitted diseases and wounds and abscesses that went untreated forsuch a long time that maggots have infested them.""The fact that people aresomehow able tosurvive out there for that long is you know, amazing, but they have to be really tough,""said Barnes, who helps lead an outreach team at PATH (People Assisting The Homeless) in Los Angeles aiming to help those experiencing homelessness on transit lines. ""These are humans and we can not losesight of that.""California tops list ofstates with the most unsheltered homeless peopleShe toldstories from those living on thestreets and thesuccessesshe hasseen with finding a personshelter or care, including one man who had asevere mental illness and was later found with terminal cancer. They helped him get into hospice care, where he died.""We went to give him a birthday cake and had a little birthday party with him right before,"" Barnessaid. ""At least the end was not, you know, what it could have been. He was happy at the end. That made it worth it.""It can take years to getsomeone intostable housing because of the distrust within the homeless community and concerns about being burned by asystem that has failed them,shesaid. Manyshelters are rough places and come with rules that include curfews. Instead,some choose tostay in a place they know, even if that meanssleeping outside, without a bed or anyshelter –something California is climate makes more possible than in other areas of the country. Thestate accounts for more than half of the country’s unsheltered population, according to a report released in January from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. While New York has a large number of people experiencing homelessness, thestate offersshelter to 95% of those people. In contrast, about 70% of those experiencing homelessness in California lived outside or in vehicles. At its core, experts, advocates andstate officialssay a handful of issues have made tackling homelessness even harder: a high cost of living, lack of affordable housing,scattershot efforts with too many agencies, too much red tape and an unclear direction. Thestate is one of the most expensive to live in, a problem only worsened with ashortage of about 1.3 million affordable rental homes, according to theCalifornia Housing Partnership. The lack of affordable housing hasn’t been easy tosolve. New housing ventures take years,sometimes decades, to complete. And they aren’t cheap. The Los Angeles Timeschronicled one affordable housing project’s decad elong path, identifying the various issues that led to the projectshrinking to about half itssize and growing to more than double its cost – about $1 million per unit. Layers of bureaucracy require developers to navigate a labyrinth of departments and fundingsources that drag out the process, all whilestrict rules on labor and environmentalstandards drive up costs. Along with lack of funding,such projects are often met with opposition from the community. Advocates and experts have watched public officials roll out various plans over the years only to eventuallysee money dry up or a lack of meaningful progress.""What happens is we roll out a new pilot program only to have to ramp it down when the problems arestill mounting and people arestill needing help,""said Jennifer Hark Dietz, deputy chief executive officer at PATH. ""We really need an ongoing commitment from thestate and local level to kind of dig us out of this hole.""A report by the nonpartisanstate auditor this year found thestate’s approach was fragmented and hindered efforts to house people. It noted California hadspent $13 billion over three years through various agencies and programs to address the problem, yet it lacked a centralized way to oversee efforts or track progress andspending. The office of State Auditor Elaine Howlesaid California continues to have the largest homeless population in the nation “likely in part because its approach to addressing homelessness has been disjointed.”Since the report,thestate has rolled out a new database that tracks homelessness and those whoseek help across thestate, aiming to identify best practices and where moneyshould bespent.“You can’t fix what you can’t measure and having astatewide datasystem will help us determine what’s working and what isn’t,” Newsomsaid in April when the database was unveiled. The crisis in California has left a trail of death. Some come from drug overdoses, violence or untreated illnesses that compound over time. Others come fromsuicide. These people die under freeways, alongsidewalks and in alleys, hospitals and vehicles. More than 1,300 died last year in Los Angeles County alone. An additional 1,200 died the year before that. Some, like Joshua Ray Williams, are never reunited with their families even after death. He was found dead last year of a drug overdose outside a Jack in the Box along bustling Sunset Boulevard in Los Angeles. A manager of the restaurant found him and called first responders afterseeing his face was blue. Crosstown, a local news outlet in Los Angeles, wrote about his death and others who died last year, deaths theysay are largely forgotten. A homeless family of four dressed in pajamas died in a parked van outside a CVS in Garden Grove, about 30 miles outside Los Angeles, in 2018. Both children were in diapers. Sheets covered the windows, aiming to keep thesunlight out. They'd been living in the van for a long time. Authoritiessaid carbon monoxide was to blame. While California is typical warm weather makes living outside more feasible than in other regions, it is notsafer. Greg Tarola was found dead in November after cold temperatures and batch ofstorms hit the Sacramento area. The father of two whosuffered from diabetes and epilepsy was found wrapped in wet blankets, according toSacramento Loaves & Fishes, a homeless organization thatserves the area. Those experiencing homeless in California range fromsomeone riding the metro tosleep to those who haveset up tent communities that feature everything from forms of government with elected leaders,security mirrors and bee hivesset up to act as protection against unwelcome visitors. Many have mental illnesses. Otherssuffer from physical ailments.""I have done this work andsimilar work in Boston, in New York, and I think Isee the most vulnerable people that I have everseen on thestreet in this community,""said Ciara DeVozza, who helps lead outreach in theskid row community for The People Concern. The pandemic cast a newspotlight on thestate’s homelessness crisis, laying bare the danger of living insuch unsanitary conditions. Even without the pandemic, people experiencing homelessness die each day in Los Angeles County. Last year, the county’s medical examiner documented more than 1,300 deaths, a number advocatessay is probably much higher. Homelessness groups rushed to house people while also getting people access to coronavirus tests and vaccines once they were available. After losing jobs and homes, more people are living in cars and RVs and it is getting worseHomeless people were put in hotels to keep themsafe. Now they are being evictedTent encampments are typicalsights under freeways and in areassuch asskid row – a pocket of downtown Los Angeles known for its vast homeless population – but the pandemic,shutdowns and quarantines caused them tospread across the city. Encampments popped up in parking lots, neighborhood parks and outsideschools, not only in Los Angeles but other parts of thestate. In San Francisco alone, tent encampments grew by 70% and became more visible across the city, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. California Governor Gavin Newsom to face recall vote as petition drive hitssignature goalLast month, Newsom proposed a $12 billion investment to fight homelessness using a budgetsurplus and federal dollars passed to help COVID-19 recovery efforts. The proposal includes $8.75 billion over two years to create an estimated 46,000 housing units, expanding on a program launched during the pandemic to convert motels and other properties into housing. It also includes $3.5 billion on rentalsubsidies, new housing andshelter resources with the aim of ending family homelessness within five years. Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcettisimilarly made homelessness a centerpiece of his budget,setting aside about $1 billion for the city’s homelessness crisis. But asstate and city leaders pitched their plans, a lawsuit filed last year by residents, business owners and developers aiming to force the city and county of Los Angeles to house those onskid row was working its way through the courts. A federal judge ordered in April that the city and county must provideshelter for the nearly 5,000 unhoused people living onskid row by October, an order that is being appealed.“All of the rhetoric, promises, plans, and budgeting cannot obscure theshameful reality of this crisis – that year after year, there are more homeless Angelenos, and year after year, more homeless Angelenos die on thestreets,” Judge David Carter wrote in ascathing 110-page order that documented the history of the area’s homelessness crisis and chastised elected leaders for their efforts. He noted thesystemic racism that has also played a major role. While African Americans amount to less than 6% of thestate is population, they account for about 31% of those who access homelessnessservices. Carter wrote the city had “lost its parks, beaches,schools,sidewalks, and highwaysystems due to the inaction of city and county officials who have left our homeless citizens with no other place to turn.”State and local leaders, along withsome advocates,said they worried that the order, which included forcing Los Angeles to put $1 billion in an escrow account, would just warehouse the problem and halt progress on permanentsolutions. Benjamin Henwood, a licensed clinicalsocial worker, an associate professor and director of the Center for Homelessness, Housing and Health Equity Research at the University of Southern California, noted this could mimic asimilarsystem that was created in New York after aland mark case argued the cityshould be required to providesome form ofshelter for those experiencing homelessness. Whilesuch asystem creates moresanitary and humane living arraignments, Henwoodsaid in many ways it merely removed the crisis from the eyes of New Yorkers without a clear path to helpingsolve it.""I think essentially, it created a hugesheltersystem that, while it got people off thestreets, it did not get them out of homelessness,"" hesaid. ""In fact, it justsort of created a cycle of homelessness because the way thesystemset up, you get in, you have to get assigned, you move around. It does not it does not really facilitate an exit from homelessness.""Those behind the lawsuit argue immediate action is needed to prevent deaths. Theysay going through the courts was a last resort butsomething that could provide a broader precedence helping to house those experiencing homelessness in other areas.""Even in these very interesting political times we are living in, homelessness is like the one issue that cuts across all demographics, where everyone basically agrees it is terrible andsomething needs to happen,""said Daniel Conway, a policy adviser for the LA Alliance for Human Rights, the coalition of residents, business owners and developers behind the case.""With this lawsuit, we were kind of trying to force that decision making process. And also recognizing that anything you did in LA couldset aset a model, a precedent for the rest of California, if not the rest of the western US""",2,2,USA Today
200,Hollywood’s Other Foreign Censor: Saudi Arabia,8.67,33.67,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/hollywoods-other-foreign-censor-saudi-arabia/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-29,25,"China and Saudi Arabia have outsized influence in Hollywood today. Money from their repressive governments is influencing American culture, including our films, and thus our representation around the world. It is also leading to widespread censorship, against our cherished freedom of expression. America must regain the pen of our cultural narrative. Culture, including film, is a valuable tool in the international relations theory of“soft power,”or the ability of a country to persuade others to do what it wants without force or coercion. The film industry is a highly profitable one,valued at over $2 trillion in 2019 box office revenue alone, and it wieldssignificant international influence. I grew up as an American expatriate in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Saudi citizens have a dichotomous attitude towards Americans: They disdain our economic influence, yet they yearn for our freedom of expression. They consume American films inspite of the rampant censorship in their Kingdom. This attitude towards Americans is currentlyshared by China: Americans are a necessary evil for economic development, and pose an ideological threat to their dictatorship. However, China has intentionally circumvented Hollywood’s influence over their population bystrategically producing propaganda. The Chinese government censors every filmshown in their country, from the top of the production chain: They manipulate the representation of the USs itself—not only in their own films, but in ours. American film companies increasingly cater to Chinese government ideology, including the American cultural icon Disney. In the credits of Disney’sMulan, Disney gavespecial thanks toseveral government entities in Xinjiang, China, which operate internment camps that contain over a million members of the country’s Uyghur minority. Former US Attorney GeneralWilliam Barrsaid, “Walt Disney would be disheartened tosee how the company he founded deals with the foreign dictatorships of our day.”This year, Chinese director Chloe Zhao’sNomadlandswept up the Best Film and Best Director categories at the Golden Globes, British Academy Film Awards, and the Academy Awards. Chloe Zhao is the daughter of a Beijingsteel magnate and People’s Liberation Army doctor, and two of her prior award-winning, American produced films (Songs My Brother Taught Me,The Rider) depict contemporary cowboys and Indians in the USs. The protagonists of the films are not traditional heroes; theystruggle in criminal worlds only to give up on their dreams. In asimilar vein,Nomadlandisset in an American city called Empire, and tells thestory of an impoverished nomad whosearches for employment, in veiled criticism of one of the largest American companies in the world, Amazon. Zhao’s next project, the Disney/Marvel film,Eternals,depicts the reunion of an immortal race, after being in hiding for thousands of years, to protect Earth from the “Deviants.” According to these films, America is a world where you cannot fulfill your dreams; you can only fulfill Amazon—and to deviate from the norm will result in inevitable defeat. How did this happen, and how can America regain our cultural narrative?Money plays asignificant role in American culture, a culture built upon a capitalist market economy that encourages competition and innovation. But the freedom of expression Americans fought for when we established the USs is paramount. The tension between these two prioritiessince 9/11 andsubsequent economic recessions have led toshort-sighted, profit-driven decision-making by American leadership, in both the private and publicsectors. The American-Saudi partnership has been fraught with controversy and contradictionsince the 9/11 attacks, which culminated in a 2016 Congressional vote to allow 9/11 families tosue the country for its alleged links to the attackers. Yet in 2017, the Trump administrationsigned a $350 billion arms deal with the Saudi government. According to the US Department of State, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is currently the USs’slargest foreign militarysales customer and one of our largest trading partners in the Middle East. The Kingdom is also taking notes from China. “They’re the new Chinese,”stated one Hollywood insidertoForbesin 2018. Following Saudi King Salman’s decision to lift a 35-year cinema ban, AMC Theaters declared intent to open up to 100 cinemas in Saudi Arabia by 2030. In 2020, the Kingdom invested about$500 million worth ofshares in Disney. Penske Media (co-owner of theHollywood Reporter) took a$200 million investment from the Saudis. Netflix announced an eight-picture deal they would finance through a Saudi production company. Like the Chinese, the Saudis have astrategy to buy their way into Hollywood, and also like China, the Saudi General Commission for Audiovisual Media (GCAM) administers censorship—screening for what it deems to be inappropriate content. In 2019, Netflix pulled comedian Hasan Minhaj’s “Patriot Act” episode on Saudi Arabia and Khashoggi after Saudi officials claimed that it violated the Kingdom’s cy ber crime law. Thereis no evidenceNetflix tried to challenge the ruling or asked Saudi Arabia to explain how the episode was a threat to public order. The Saudi government’s brutal assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018sent an anti-American message to the world: Do notstand up for freedom of expression. Brian Fogel’s filmThe Dissidentmeticulously documented the Saudi murder of Khashoggi, who was employed by theWashington Post. The Dissidentwas blacklisted in Hollywood. Fogelstated in an interview that “there was a unified front among the major global media companies, distributors, that they were not going to touch this film.”“What I observed was that the desire for corporate profits have left the integrity of America’s film culture weakened,”said Thor Halvorssen, the founder and chief executive of the nonprofit Human Rights Foundation, who financedThe Dissidentandserved as a producer. Meanwhile, China hassteadily accumulated US Treasurysecuritiessince 9/11. As of February 2021, China owns $1.104 trillion, or about 4%, of the $28 trillion US national debt, which is more thanan y other foreign country except Japan. It is also the world’s largest country by population, and is predicted to overtake the USas the top box office market. A 2013Rolling Stonearticleobserved: “The hardball negotiators of Hollywood were willing to roll over, in terms of finance and even content, in return for access to the world’s largest overseas moviegoing audience.”Disney is one of the biggest winners in China: The proud owner ofMarvelStudiossat on more than $1 billion from the country’s box office in 2019. The version ofIron Man 3released in Chinafeatured added footage with Chinese product placements and Chinese characterssaving Iron Man. Marvel’s 2016superhero filmDr. Strangechanged the appearance of a major Tibetan character for fear of jeopardizing the movie’ssuccess in China. American filmstudios, including Disney, also invite Chinese government regulatorson filmsets to advise “on how to avoid tripping the censors’ wires.”Prioritizing profit over freedom of expression has diluted the perception of American culture and weakened our international influence. As Frances Stonor Saunders detailed in her book,The Cultural Cold War, the most vocal exponents of intellectual freedom during the Cold War were instruments of American culture, and cultural efforts to win hearts and minds continue to be relevant today. However, a key difference between the Cultural Cold War of the mid-20th century versus today is the ability of other governments to finance cultural influence. The Russian Soviet Union could not compete with the American entertainment industry; China can. The Chinese government understands that culturestands upstream from policy and from politics, impacting the population. According to Matthias Niedenführ, vice director of the China Center in Tübingen, Germany,Chinese government censors do not want tosee Chinese people portrayed as villains, and they do not want tosee American powers portrayed as heroes. Hollywood is “often gleefully willing tospeak truth to American political power” yet it takes the opposite approach to the Chinese government, which monitors their population with drones,AI-powered CCTVcameras, andsystemic censorship. The Chinese government wants to maintain a relationship with Hollywood, which remains the most potent force for globalstorytelling—a power their government envies. The freespeech nonprofit PEN America issued a 94-page report in 2020 titled, “Made in Hollywood, Censored by Beijing: The US Film Industry and Chinese Government Influence,” which recommends the following:The report concludes American decision-makers have a moral imperative tostand for freedom of expression, to resist the gradual encroachment of any government that attempts to dictate whatstories may be told. Journalists covering Hollywood ought to be writing about this, and those who value freedom of expressionshould pay attention to its muzzling. As Americans, we have a responsibility for the evolution of our culture and representation in the world. We cannot allow the liberty we fought for when we established the USs of America to besold: The freedom of expression is more valuable than money.

Bishop Garrison currently leads the Defense Department’s Countering Extremism Working Group. On Thursday the Department of Defensesaid it isstanding by Bishop Garrison, asenior adviser to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, despite attacks from Republican members of Congress and right-wing media outlets including Fox News. Garrison was appointed to his role at the Pentagon in February and currently leads the Countering Extremism Working Group, which was established by Austin in April to review and update department policies regarding extremism within the armedservices. Garrison is a West Point graduate whoserved two tours in Iraq with the US Army, and worked as an adviser to former President Barack Obama’s 2012 reelection campaign and to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign in 2016.“The Department has full confidence Mr. Garrison can lead the Counter Extremism Working Group as it carries out its mission,” Lisa Lawrence, aspokesperson for the Department,told the conservative Daily Caller.“The Department is focused on addressing the corrosive and potentially dangerous behavior that can be inspired by extremist ideology – behavior that harms good order and discipline and our readiness.”Garrison has been criticized by the right for his tweets about Donald Trump, in particular, tweets in which hesaid, “Support for him [Trump], a racist, issupport for ALL his beliefs,” and “He’s dragging a lot of bad actors (misogynist, extremists, other racists) out into the light, normalizing their actions. If yousupport the President, yousupport that.”Garrison made those comments following Donald Trump’sattackon the late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-MD), who represented Baltimore, Maryland. Trump had tweeted of the majority-Black city, “No human being would want to live there” and called it “a disgusting, rat and rodent infested mess.”But now, years later, the right, including GOP lawmakers, have latched on to those tweets, after they resurfaced in a right-wing hit piece published in an outlet called Revolver on May 5. The outlet called Garrison a “critical race theory loving, Trump Derangement Syndromesuffering, fake newsspreading, 100% partisan hack,” citing his 2019 tweets as evidence. The report did not note the context of Garrison’s commentary concerning Trump’s racism. Fox News host Pete HegsethattackedGarrison the day after the piece came out, describing him as the Pentagon’s “MAGA purge man” while discussing the Pentagon’s anti-extremism efforts. And days later, another Fox News host, Tucker Carlson,described Garrisonas a “lunatic” for his criticism of Trump’s racism. On May 19, during a House Armed Services Committeehearinginvolving recommendations from the National Commission Military, National, and Public ServiceRep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL)criticizedGarrison. Gaetz claimed he was “deeply troubled” by a tweet Harrisonwrotein January of 2020, as Trump’s impeachment trial was underway, whichstated, “Calls for civility, rather thanshouting down falsehoods and misinformation,shall be the death of this nation.”Then, onMay 26,30 Republican members of the Housesigned a letter complaining of “creeping left-wing extremism” in the military, citing the “report” from Revolver thatsingled out Garrison’s tweets. The letter, which was led by Rep. Matt Rosendale and co-signed by members like Lauren Boebert (R-CO), Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), Paul Gosar (R-AZ), Greg Steube (R-FL), Matt Gaetz (R-FL), and others, called on Sec. Austin to “fight back” against extremism from the left. Thatsame day, Gosar (R-AZ)complainedon Twitter that, “Biden and Bishop Garrison are prio rit izing bigotry and anti-white hatred over nationalsecurity,”sharing the Revolver piece. Notably, just two months earlier, Gosar w asa featuredspeak erat a conference of extremists alongside whitesupremacists. The attacks directed at both Garrison and the efforts by the Biden administration to combat military extremism follow years of the right downplaying the threat posed in military ranks.

202,America’s Left and the Confiscation of Wealth,15.33,31.0,https://spectator.org/americas-left-and-the-confiscation-of-wealth/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-17,23,"America’s conservativesshould be those least amazed by our left’s calls for wealth confiscation. The onlysurprise here is the flaunting. After all, wealth confiscation is what the left everywhere has always done. Once in power, it is the only way the left’s policies cansurvive. As 2020 nears and the pursuit of increasingly restive radicals increases, the politicians courting them aggressivelyseek more extreme positions. The fear of the “liberal” label is long gone and the “socialist”sobriquet is all the rage among those who rage. With the Marxist moniker come the policies. Higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations are already passé. It is no longer enough to tax the wealthy more via their income. Now the target is their wealth directly. Calls forsuch blatantly confiscatory policies arestillshocking to most Americans. However, as we have been repeatedly taught by the left globally,suchsensibilities are hopelessly out ofstep with the new “progressivism.” In onesense America’s left is right in its calls: The onlyshocking part is their explicit nature. Usually America’s left does not admit it aims, pursuing them insteadsilently. The left pursues confiscatory policies not just because itsupports them in its own right — though assuredly it does — but because it inevitably must. The left alwaysstarts with enemies. The question is how broadly it defines them and howstringently it pursues them. The answer depends on the amount of power the left has. Depending on place and parlance, the left’s enemies range from “the rich” and corporations, to capitalists, the bourgeoisie, and “enemies of thestate.” Confiscatory policies are aimed at them because, in the words of the bank robber Willie Sutton, “that’s where the money is.” Initially thesestrike a blow, but they alsostake the left’s expensivespending policies. But the more the left’s policies are implemented, the more they fallshort. If implemented broadly enough, the economy itself fallsshort. Regardless, increased resources are needed to make up theshortfall. The phenomenon is akin to the Laffer Curve, albeit beyond tax revenue alone. The economist Arthur Laffer described how increasing rates of taxation, once they hit the inflection point, actually result in declining tax revenue. This creates the potential for reversal: Cutting tax rates above their inflection point results in increased revenues. This observation can be applied to the left’s policies. Entitlement programs continue to escalate — either through increasing benefits, increasing utilization, or both — until they become unaffordable, requiring additional resources or rationing. Subsidies become utilized until too costly and the productsubsidized goes intoshortsupply or is rationed. Regulations mount to an extent that the activity regulated becomes less available or less desirable. Givensufficient power, the left can inflict this across an entire economy. There is noshortage of examples of this happening in individual programs here, and noshortage of this happening economy-wide abroad. It is an economic tenet that resources are limited. It is a political tenet that the left’s reach is unlimited. The only way tosquare this circle is to take more through confiscation. Of course, even compulsion canswim onlyso long against the economic tide — as the drownings ofso manysocialist and communist countries prove. The left has never been able tosolve the question why those being increasingly confiscated from would indefinitely consent to producing more. The overall effect is analogous to a farmer eating hisseed corn. Faced with a disappointing harvest, instead of curtailing consumption the farmer decides to dip into thestock heshouldset aside for next year’s planting. Whenspring comes, hesows less, and when harvest time comes, his yield is evenshorter. Repeating the cycle, each year fallsshorter andshorter. Eventually, he has only enough to eat, but none to plant. So it is with the left. It must make up itsshortfall from others — confiscating what it lacks — until all fallshort. If thissounds preposterous, look back to the left’s own past — the Soviet famine of 1932-33 and Communist China’s Great Leap Forward — orsimply look at its present in Venezuela and North Korea. Or take its programs in isolation andsee their inability to meet demand or beself-sufficient. Without externalsubsidization, they fail. This is only new to America. Here, the left’s programs aresubsidized from the general budget and the budgetshortfall is borrowed. Hidden from view, there has been a quiet truce: The left pursues its course in incrementalsteps, accepts itssubsidies, and in return does not explicitly call for confiscation. However, America’s New Left reject this historical accommodation and its incrementalism. Emboldened itseeks bigger prizes — a Green New Deal, Medicare for All — and its needs (and wants) bigger prey. Confiscatory policies are now explicit. To the rest of the world — particularly those who have endured the left —such confiscatory calls are all too familiar. Far from new and novel, they are very old indeed — both chronologically, and in thesense of being worn out. They trace back to the 19thcentury and were tried repeatedly in the last century. Each time they were miserable failures — literally — leaving thosesubjected to them in misery. Far from being “progressive” — today’s trendy attempt at rebranding — they are actually regressive. These policies are throwbacks in time, just as they are throwaways philosophically, economically, and politically. America has not known this in thesense of living it. Knowing it intellectually, that it actually occurred elsewhere, is not thesame. To America’s collective mind, it has remained a foreign affliction — like leprosy or the plague — that does not, cannot, actually occur here. America’s only real encounter has been the momentary quadrennial contact withsome crank running for president as a communist orsocialist. At best,such candidates pick up a comparative handful of votes and curiosity. They are the crazy aunt who mercifullyshows up only for major family gatherings. Only this time,she has brought friends. We have emotionally felt thatsocialism and its wealth confiscation could not happen here. It can, of course. These policies now beingso candidly bandied about are exactly what it would look like. And these proposals are just the beginning of what the left will do, if given the chance.",1,0,The American Spectator

Her troubles began in Queens, asshe rode in the backseat of a 2002 Infiniti that also carried two men on her way to play basketball. When the men, Ceasar Forbes and Montel Hughes,stopped for cigarettes on 106th Ave. near 177th Streetin Jamaica, cops approached the car and begansearching it. Shortly before thestop — at about 10:20 p.m. — a nearby NYPD ShotSpotter microphonesystem had picked up thesound of five gunshots, copssaid at the time. During theirsearch of the car, officers found a 9mm handgun in a green velvet bag in the glove compartment, as well as aspentshell casing by Stevens’ feet. Cops arrested Forbes, Hughes and Stevens when none of them admitted the gun was theirs, according to a criminal complaint. But Stevens denied the two officers asked her any questions about the weapon andsaidshe didn’t know of the gun’s presence until the charges in the case were read to her in Queens Criminal Court.“I did not know about the gun being in the car,” Stevenssaid Friday. By that time, the news media had caught wind of the arrest, and Stevens found out from newsstories thatshe wassuspended without pay or benefits from her city job,she told The News. A month after her arrest, Stevens gave a DNAsample, which didn’t match DNA on the gun, according to her lawsuit.“There wasn’t any evidence tying her to the gunso the charges were all dismissed,” a law enforcementsource with knowledge of the case told The News. Finally, in November 2018 — after Stevens hadspentseven months trying to pick up the pieces of her life — the case was dismissed andsealed, according to a certificate of disposition viewed by The News. In December 2018, Stevenssued the NYPD officers on the case in Brooklyn Supreme Court for false arrest and illegalstop and frisk. One of the arresting officers in Stevens’ case, Justin Ellis — a defendant in Stevens’ lawsuit —subsequently lost his gun andshield after getting arrested in 2020 forshooting his wife’s physical trainer outside the cop’s Seaford home during a fight.

204,"Doctor, Lawyer, Insurrectionist: The Radicalization of Simone Gold",-14.33,32.67,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/05/doctor-lawyer-insurrectionist-the-radicalization-of-simone-gold/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-06,25,"When rioters broke into the US Capitol on January 6, chants of “Fuck the police!” “USA!” or “Treason!” echoed in the marble halls. When Dr. Simone Gold got inside the rotunda,shestepped over a velvet rope and announced to anyone who would listen, “I am a Stanford-educated attorney!”Thusshe distinguished herself among the motley crew of Proud Boys, MAGA types, and the QAnonshaman who paraded through the Capitol to overturn the 2020 presidential election, an event that left five people dead. Not only is Gold a Stanford-educated lawyer,she’s also a board-certified emergency room physician. Neither qualification prevented the FBI from coming to her Beverly Hills house on January 18 and arresting her. Nor did it make a federal grand jury think twice in early February before indicting her on five criminal counts, including entering a restricted building and obstructing an official proceeding. The arrest marked the end of one chapter in her Icarian trajectory into right-wing fame. Before April 2020, Gold had been just another over-achieving Beverly Hills doctor. But with the arrival of the pandemic,she donned her white lab coat to protest lock downs and promote President Donald Trump’s favorite unproven COVID treatment, the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine. Itseems that’s all it took to find an enthusiastic audience among the MAGA faithful, putting her on a glide path to a certain kind of right-wingstardom. Conservatives who love to bash educated, liberal elites as out of touch quickly embraced Gold and gleefully touted her impressive credentials tosupport their attacks on public health measures designed to combat the pandemic. Shesailed into their well-funded ecosystem,snaggingspeaking gigs, appearances on cable talkshows, and robust opportunities to fundraise. Simone Gold, with John Strand (left) uses a bullhorn to address protesters in the US Capitol on January 6, 2021. Saul Loeb/AFP/GettyWithin days of her first media hit,she had teamed up with tea party groups working with the Trump reelection campaign to demand that governors reopen the economy. Fox News put her on national TV to publicly denounce lock downs and mask mandates as overblown responses to a diseaseshe insisted wasn’t fatal to most people. In July, her new right-wing friends ushered her to meetings with members of Congressand Vice President Mike Pence. Thesudden fameseems to have propelled her right up thesteps and into the Capitol on January 6. Her arrest highlights the role of conservative media in fomenting an insurrection, but Gold’s personal experience also illustrates what experts on extremism have long known: Education is no defense against radicalization. “If you think of who issusceptible of extremist ideology, people tend to think it’s people who don’t have much education,”says Don Haider-Markel, a University of Kansas politicalscience professor who hasstudied extremism and radicalization. “That’s not the case at all. It tends to be more middle class and upper class. Those who havespent more time educating themselves tend to think they know better than other people.”In fact, much like the tea parti ers of the Obama era, the Capitol insurrectionists were by and large an aging, middle-class mob. Researchers at the Chicago Project on Security and Threats at the University of Chicago have dug into the demographic profiles of hundreds of people charged with crimes related to the Capitol incursion. They’ve found that about 30 percent of the arrested rioters are white-collar professionals like Gold. Only about 13 percent were affiliated with traditional far-right militias or extremist groups like the Proud Boys, and only 7 percent were unemployed. Evenso, Goldstillstands out from that well-heeled crowd, and not just becauseshe’s a woman. (Women make up only about 15 percent of the Capitol defendants.) Of the more than 420 defendants the Chicago researchersstudied,she is one of only two lawyers and the only doctor. That’s why it’s hard not to look at Gold’s CV and wonder: How doessomeone go from medicalschool to Stanford Law School to an FBI wanted poster?Gold’s resume doesn’tscream budding far-right revolutionary as much as it reflects unusual precocity and ambition. Raised in a wealthysection of Long Island, New York, Gold, 55, likes tosay thatshe trained as a physician at her father’s knee. Reuben Tizes, her father, was a doctor, a medicalschool professor, and evenserved as the Orange County, New York, health commissioner in the early 1970s. Her mother, Carol Tizes, was an elementaryschool teacher. After graduating from the City College of New York at 19,she claimsshe was the youngest person in her graduating class at the Chicago Medical School in 1989. She obtained a California medical license in 1990 but then enrolled in Stanford Law School, graduating in 1993. “That was my idea of rebellion,”she told a religious broadcaster in August, explaining that her father had wanted all his children to be doctors. (They are.) Her legal prowess didn’tstand out much in Palo Alto, however. I reached out to a host of her Stanford Law classmates, but none of those who responded could recall much about Gold aside from her red hair. Stanford Law School class photoThe intervening decades between lawschool and her indictment were unconventional only in the ambition of her professional endeavors. In January 1997,she was admitted to the New York bar and then completed a residency in emergency medicine at the Renaissance School of Medicine at Stony Brook University. Thatsame year, according to her LinkedIn profile,sheserved as a congressional fellow in DC and wrotespeeches for the late Vermontsenator James Jeffords, who famously left the Republican Party to become an Independent in 2001. (Susan Boardman Russ, whoserved as Jeffords’ chief ofstaff for 25 years before retiring in 2004, does not remember Gold.)Over the past three decades, Gold has practiced emergency medicine at various hospitals in the LA area, but the lure of Washingtonseems to have endured. According to her LinkedIn page, in 2009,she worked in DC as an assistant to Michael Oren, then Israel’s ambassador to the US, who credited her in print forstoriesshe helped him research for theandNew Republic. Oren toldMother Jonesthat he had no memory of her working for him, nor did anyone on hisstaff. In Los Angeles, Gold married businessman Larry Gold and had two children. Active in the Los Angeles Jewish community,she and her husband once provided a glowing testimonial for a local mohel for the br is he performed for theirson. A 2003articlefeatured Gold and her then two-year-oldson in astory about “Shalom Time” at a local bookstore. She and her husband donated thousands of dollars to their children’s private, conservative Jewish dayschool in Beverly Hills, where Gold volunteered on the PTA, managing theshabbatswap one year. But by 2010, Gold had filed for divorce. Los Angeles County court recordssuggest that her relationship with her ex-husband wassomewhat contentious. In 2017, a judge ordered them to attend mediation over child custody and visitation issues. (Larry Gold declined to comment for thisstory other than tosay that he was “shocked” to learn about his ex-wife’s participation in the events at the Capitol.)In her October 2020 bookGold writes, “I have always worked with the poor and underserved,” treating ER patients in places like Inglewood, California, whichshe describes as a “low-income, gang-ridden majority-minority city that provided thesetting for the tough 1991 dramaBoyz N the Hood.” She does not, however, include any mention of herservices as a pricey “concierge physician,” whichshe advertised on hernow-defunct personal website: “As a C-Suite Physician, Dr. Gold works thesame way as a highly effective Fortune 100 CEO…all with an eye toward fixing her client’s exact problem.” Gold charged $5,000 for an initial appointment and between $25,000 and $50,000 for ongoing consultations. The concierge medical practice is just one ofseveral business enterprisesshe attempted to launch over the years—including, ashort-lived lifestyle magazine for doctors that launched in 2006 and folded in 2008. (“Confessions of a Hospital Fundraiser,” teased one cover mockup.) In 2017, Goldstarted a company called Gold Healthcare Solutions that advertises assistance to hospitals facing government audits. Until recently, the company website listed as CEO the venture capitalist Howard Sherman, who’s married to the actress Sela Ward and who ran in the Mississippi Democratic primary for the US Senate in 2018. When I asked Sherman about his role at the company, he replied in an email: “I have ZERO relationship with Dr. Simone Gold’s company. I work in the medical device world and at one timeshe approached me with an ideashe had that I vetted withsome of my contacts. I was not able to achieve the kind of interestshe wantedso westopped talking about the project.” His name and photo weresubsequently removed from the company website. Lots of people flame out in business, get divorced, and don’t end upstorming the Capitol. But Haider-Markelsays that those who do become radicalized aresearching for broader meaning in their lives or asense of identity. “Oftentimes there is a precipitating event. They lose a partner. They have a financial crisis,” hesays. “They developsome grievance around that and connect that to a broadersocial movement.” If Gold was looking for a mid-life reboot, the heady mix of the pandemic, President Trump, and right-wing media provided the perfect catalyst. The moment that “changed my life completely,”she told a California KGET TV reporter in January, took place in April 2020. She had been treating COVID patients in Los Angeles emergency rooms with President Donald Trump’s favorite unproven COVID cure, hydroxychloroquine, just a few weeks after the president had announced that the FDA would be fast-tracking emergency use authorization for the drug for COVID treatment. Trump called it “a game changer,” despite warnings from the FDA that the anti-malaria drug may cause heart rhythm problems insome people. Gold was enthusiastic about the drug’s treatment possibilities. In her book,she describes how, after extensive research,she had used hydroxy chloroquine to cure a womansuffering from mild COVID. “I had expected to get kudos,”she writes. “Instead I was met with hostility.” The hospital medical director challenged her independence and dressed her down for prescribing a drug that wasn’t indicated for outpatients. Gold arguedshe hadscience to back her up, and cited the drug’s longsafety profile. Unpersuaded, the medical director threatened to fire her ifshe ever prescribed the drug to an outpatient again. For most of her life, Gold doesn’tseem to have been politically active. She donated $1,000 to the campaign of Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) in 2019, but before that, the only other federal candidate to whomshe gave money was a Democrat—California Rep. Raul Ruiz—in 2011. “I have never considered myself a political person. I’vesupported both parties at various times in my life,”shesays in her book. “I’d fall in the middle of any partisan test. I don’t believe in the right-left distinction…That’s the trouble with being in the middle of the road. Sometimes you get run over.”But after the hospital threatened to fire her over her prescribing practices, Gold picked a lane. On April 14,she called Dennis Prager’s radioshow. Prager has been broadcasting in LAsince 1982, but he has become an important though underappreciated part of the modern right-wing infrastructure thanks to his online Prager University. Popular with young people and the alt-right, Prager U publishes five-minute tutorials on everything from climate change to economics. The videos are designed to promote “Judeo-Christian values.” (Asampling: “The Dangers of Islam” and “Just Say Merry Christmas.”)Identifying herself as an ER doctor, Gold described hersuccess at treating patients with hydroxy chloroquine and voiced dismay that medicine was becomingso politicized that a perfectlysafe drug could not be dispensed by doctors without controversy. “Thescience has taken a backseat to the hatred of the president,” Prager commiserated. A week later, Gold made aseries of Twitter videos, a platform thatshe had rarely before used, toshare her experience “practicing emergency medicine in this era of the COVID-19 crisis.” Standing in her white lab coat in front of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center—a hospitalshe didn’t work at—Gold panned the camera over the quiet grounds. “It’s really quite empty. The emergency department volume is down,”shesays. “The patient census is down.”Gold wasn’t entirely wrong about the hospital census but her causality was off. Hospitals all over the country, including in California at that time, were relatively empty because electivesurgeries were canceled and fear of the virus kept people out of the ER Doctors and nurses wouldsoon be laid off. In her bookshe describes how her own hospital hours were cut by 30 percent. She doesn’tsay how much this may have hurt her bottom line, but in June, her medical practice received more than $150,000 in federalbailoutloans,suggesting the lock downs caused a personal budget deficit large enough to turn many a doctor into an activist. Subscribe usingApple Podcasts,Spotify,Stitcher, or your favorite pod cast app. None of her videos garnered more than 12,000 views but they hit a certain zeitgeist, as conservatives and conspiracy theorists alike pushed the idea that virus cases were overblown andsome people in the government were using COVID to take away individual freedom and undermine President Trump. Three weeks earlier, Fox News radio host Todd Starnes had gone to a Brooklyn hospital and made a video claiming that the emergency room was empty. “I’m afraid that the mainstream media has been overblowing the coverage here,” he narrated. “There’s been a lot of fear mongering going on.” With help from aQAnon enthusiast, the videos pawned the hashtag#filmyourhospital and prompted a host of right-wing figures like failed California congressional candidate DeAnna Lorraine Tesoriero to rush to their nearest hospitals to make their own “empty hospital” videos weeks before Gold did. Even insuch a climate, Gold’s white coatstood out, andshe managed to catch the attention of one particularly influential audience member:Jenny Beth Martin, the co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. One of the largest of the original tea party groups that arose to oppose President Barack Obama, Tea Party Patriots encompasses a trio of nonprofit groups funded by wealthy conservatives and conservative foundations like Donors Trust. A Tea Party Patriotssuper-PAC also raised $1.2 million to help reelect Trump in 2020. Martin was dialed into the Trump White House—so muchso thatshe would later join Trump’s Georgia legal team to help overturn the 2020 presidential election, even thoughshe’s not a lawyer. Early in the pandemic,she was working with a newly formed Save Our Country Coalition to help oppose lock downs and defend Trump’s handling of the pandemic, along with powerful conservative organizationssuch as the Heritage Foundation and the American Legislative Exchange Council. She is also the executive committeesecretary of the Council for National Policy, asecretive but powerful religious-right organization that was working with the Trump reelection campaign to find doctors to help burnish the president’s approval ratings. Gold was just thesort ofsurrogate they had been looking for. “I reached out to her andsaid, ‘Hey, I’m working on this effort and I’d like to talk to doctors,’ and westarted em ailing and talking, and as things have developed andshe watched the virus, things have evolved,” Martin later explained to. The pair met in April, and Gold asked Martin to deliver a lettershe’d written to Trump, calling the lock downs a “mass casualty event,” whichshe’d been urging other doctors tosign. More than 400 had. With lightningspeed, Martin put Gold on the ready-made conservative media grievance circuit. On May 19, Tea Party Patriotshosted a conference call with conservative media luminaries, including Fox News’ Ed Henry andBreitbart News, featuring Gold and a handful of other doctors who hadsigned Gold’s letter to Trump. On the call, Gold described the hidden victims of the lockdowns, including a womanshe’d treated who’d fallen and broken her hip andshoulder while trying to color her own hair becauseshe couldn’t go to asalon. “I just feel that’s there’s a very big disconnect between what the average American thinks is going on and what’s actually going on,” Goldsaid. The callsent Gold on a grand round of media hits with all of the biggest names in the MAGA firmament—former Trump White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, Glenn Beck, Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk—and ultimately withsome of the majorstars of Fox News. In early July, Fox host Laura Ingraham had Gold on hershow to promote her favorite drug as an over-the-counter COVID cure. “This is like a medical cancel culture applied to this particular medication,” Ingrahamsaidsympathetically, conflatingsome cherished conservative points of fury.“Shouldn’t you as a practicing physician with a medical degree be allowed to express your views onscience as you practice it without being censored?”It’s probably hard to overstate just how much of a role conservative media played in nudging Gold towards insurrection. University of Maryland psychology professor Arie W Kruglanski is a co-author of the bookThe Three Pillars of Radicalization. In his research on extremist networks across the globe, he identified three crucial factors in political radicalization: a need to feelsignificant, a narrative to follow, and a network thatsupports and validates that narrative. “It’s difficult to become very glamorous or glorious as an emergency room doctor,” Kruglanski told me. Gold’ssplash into right-wing media, hesays, probably fulfilled all three of the pillars. “This issort of an overnightstardom. She has the narrative, andshe now has the network thatsupports her.”Gold really hit the big time in July. After brainstorming with Martin, Gold helped Tea Party Patriots convene an “America’s Frontline Doctors”summit in DC, an event that resembled the “white coat” protests Martin had organized back in the tea party heyday to oppose the Affordable Care Act. The two-daysummit garnered almost no media attention until the very end, when Gold and about a dozen white-coated physicians appeared on thesteps of the Supreme Court to talk about “medical cancel culture” andspent nearly 45 minutes making misleading claimssuggesting that COVID can be prevented and cured with, nosurprise here, hydroxychloroquine. Most of them had never treated a COVID patient; ophthalmologists were overrepresented in the group. And one was really out there: Stella Immanuel, a Houston doctor who believes thatsome gynecological problems are caused by havingsex with demons. “You don’t need masks. There is a cure,”shesaid. “Nobody needs to getsick.”President Trump and hisson Don Jr. retweeted a video of the event and it went viral, receiving more than 16 million views in a matter of hours before Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter took it down forspreading misinformation. Twitter even blocked Don Jr. from using his account for most of the day. Simone Gold’ssummer mediasplash included big names: Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and Ed Henry, plus Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk, Glenn Beck, and conservative talk radio host Dennis Prager. Gold has claimed that the California hospitalshe worked for promptly fired her for appearing in the video, andsaysshe hasn’t practiced medicinesince. But the episode provided her with instant celebrity as a victim of Big Tech censorship, a credential even more beloved by conservative media than her white coat and fancy law degree. The next day, Gold accompanied Martin to meet with Vice President Mike Pence to press for emergency-use authorization for hydroxy chloroquine and talk censorship. The day after that,she appeared on Tucker Carlson’s Fox Newsshow, one of the most watched prime-time cable newsshows, with more than 3 million regular viewers. On theshow, Carlson expressed outrage that Gold’s hospital had fired her. “Shouldn’t you as a practicing physician with a medical degree be allowed to express your views onscience as you practice it without being censored?” he asked. Gold agreed and thenseized the opportunity to make her case for hydroxy chloroquine to Carlson’s millions of viewers. “Look, I majored in Russian History. I don’t know anything about hydroxychloroquine,” he told her in response. “I do know about the way the country issupposed to work, and physiciansshould be allowed to explain their experiences, their clinical experiences, treating patients and you’re not allowed to because Joe Biden getting elected is more important, and that’sscary.”In asign of how far down the far-right rabbit holeshe’d already gone by then, Gold told Carlson that because of “some negative things” people hadsaidsince the video aired,she had retained attorney and conspiracy theorist L Lin Wood to put “to rest anything people want tosay that’s defamatory.” Wood would later join with Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani to file a host of baseless lawsuits to try to overturn the presidential election. By early fall,it was clear that Gold’s original analysis of the pandemic was mostly wrong. The virusspiked across the country and researchers declared hydroxy chloroquine useless for treating COVID Even Trump didn’t take it when he gotsick. As her prospects in medicine dimmed, Goldseems to have become too toxic even for Fox News, which hasn’t had her on the airsince July. She had turned America’s Frontline Doctors into a more traditional nonprofit organization, complete with website,spokesperson, and white papers decrying various alleged flip-flops by Anthony Fauci. But in her quest for publicity, Gold had to dive even deeper into the far-right feverswamp. For the next few months, Gold gave interviews to or publicspeeches with QAnon conspiracy theorists, white nationalists, B-list talkshow luminaries, and a few politicians, including Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), a “stop thesteal” movement promoter affiliated with far-right militia groups that were part of the Capitol riots. She even went on the Patriot Radioshow hosted by Matt Shea, a former Washington State legislator who has been involved in a number of armed federalstandoffs, including the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016 led by Ammon Bundy. Associated with Christian nationalists, Shea has written a manifesto calling for a fundamentalist holy war, in which non-Christian males would be killed if they didn’tsubmit to Biblical law. The Jewish doctor chatted happily with him about vitamins and the value of exercise in preventing COVID. “Before I was called a quack and a fraud, people used to clap for me for working out there on the front lines,” Gold lamented, before encouraging people to give up masks and to freely gather for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. But Gold found her most loyal audience among evangelical Christian prosperity preachers, many of whom had refused to close their church doors during the lock downs and were vaccineskeptics. After big tech companies pulled down the doctors’ video in July, it was rebroadcast by Daystar, thesecond-largest Christian TV network in the country. Since then, Gold has made at leastsix different appearances on the network founded by tel evangelists Marcus and Joni Lamb—and those visits have paid off. In mid-August, whenshe headlined the Lambs’ program “Ministry Now,” along with the anti-vaccine activist Robert Kennedy Jr, Marcus Lamb made asurprise announcement: He was issuing a $10,000 matching challenge from Daystar for donations on Gold’s behalf. “I know that you lost your job and now it may be that God has placedsomething else in your heart to where you’re gonna make astand,” Joni Lamb told Gold. “It’s going to take money to do that.” In October, Gold returned to chat with the ladies of “Joni Table Talk,” Daystar’s tel evangelical version of “The View.” Over coffee with the hosts, Gold thanked “the whole Daystar family for beingso generous,” and talked about thesmall donations from viewersshe’d received. “It really adds up,”shesaid gratefully. “It gave mesome breathing room to keep fighting for advocacy.”“I know that you lost your job and now it may be that God has placedsomething else in your heart to where you’re gonna make astand. It’s going to take money to do that.”Evangelical churches were especially receptive to Gold’s anti-vaccine advocacy, whichshe pivoted to as hydroxy chloroquine faded as a right-wing cause célèbre. Three days before the Capitol riot, Gold appeared ata religious revival e ventin Tampa, Florida, billed as an “open air mass healing and miracleservice,” run by Rodney Howard-Browne. A conspiracy theorist, Howard-Browne has appeared on Alex Jones’ far-rightsiteInfoWarsand has called the massshooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, a “false flag” operation. He was arrested in March for holding religiousservices in violation of astay at home order. Gold took thestage before a room full of people without masks and gave an hour-longspeech, whereshe decried the evils of the “experimental biological agent,” better known as the COVID vaccine. Shesaid it’s being tested on minority communities that have been prioritized for vaccines, whichshe dubbed “pure racism.”“They are making an overt and covert attempt to push this heavily on Blacks and browns,”she warned. “If you take the vaccine, you’resigning up to be in a phar maco vigilance trackingsystem.”For most of 2020,the formerly apolitical Dr. Gold was able toseparate her personal crusade for “health freedom” from the presidential election that provided the backdrop to the fight over lock downs and hydroxychloroquine. She rarely touched on thesubject in public other than tosuggest that“Orange Man bad”and notscience drove opposition to the anti-malaria drug. But whether Gold realized it or not, the battle over the drug was less about health care policy and more of a proxy war over Trump and the future of democracy. Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in November was a blow to Gold’s cause, as pollsshowed voters resoundingly rejected his handling of the pandemic, which embraced much of what Gold advocated. It also put her on a collision course with the “stop thesteal” movement that metastasized after the presidential election, as her tea party and evangelical benefactors quickly backed Trump’s effort to brand the election as illegitimate and overturn the results. Gold’s Stanford law degreesuggestsshe issmart enough to know a big lie whenshesees one, but “stop thesteal” was where the action was, not to mention thespeaking gigs and fundraising opsshe now relied on for her livelihoodsince her medical career cratered. Onceshestarted down the MAGA path, there was no turning back. When Trumpsupporters first converged in DC on November 14 at the “Million MAGA march” to contest the election results, Gold was right there with them, along with other Trump die-hards like Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy who helped bankroll the march; Sebastian Gorka, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, the Georgia congresswoman who’d expressedsupport for the QAnon conspiracy theory. “You do not give up your inalienable rights just because there’s an epidemic,” Goldshouted from the Supreme Courtsteps, warning that the government was using an “age-old tactic” toseize power byscaring people with a disease thatshesaid causes mostly mild illness. “Do not live in fear. Be joyful, be happy, go forward!”The event was advertised on the neo-Nazi website, theDaily Stormer, and drew hordes of militia outfits and white nationalist groups like the Proud Boys and Nick Fuentes’ Groypers. The rally descended into violence; 21 people were arrested on assault and gun charges, and one person wasstabbed. That didn’tstop Gold from coming back to DC tospeak with many of thesame people at the January 5 “stop thesteal” rally at Freedom Plaza—the warmup to the main event at the Capitol, organized by Ali Alexander, a convicted felon and conspiracy theorist. Speakers represented a parade of far-right figures ranging from anti-abortion activists to former Trump adviser Roger Stone. Standing under an umbrella held by a man in a “Baby Lives Matter”shirt, Goldsaid to the crowd, “I’m here to ask you a personal question: Why are you here?…I believe the reason you are here is thesame reason I am choosing to be here. Because we all have recognized a blatant assault on the rule of law… We aresick and tired of being lied to.”Kruglanski isn’tsurprised that Gold would move from promoting a bogus COVID cure to joining with people who thought the election had beenstolen. “In many cases the radical groups firstshower you with love without you even accepting their ideology,” he explains. “But once you are accepted by the group, to maintain your goodstanding in that community you’ve got to accept their narrative.”The next day Gold wasscheduled tospeak again at the“Wild Protest”organized by Alexander near the White House, along with Tea Party Patriots’ Jenny Beth Martin and Brandon Straka, founder of the Walkaway Campaign that urges Democrats to quit the party. (Straka was also later arrested for entering the Capitol.) But thespeeches were inexplicably canceled, and instead, protesters heeded Trump’s call to march on the Capitol while Congress and the vice president were certifying the results of the 2020 election. Gold joined them. She was accompanied by John Strand—an international underwear model whoserves as the communications director for America’s Frontline Doctors. Strand, 38, had been part of regular Beverly Hills “freedom protests” against the lock downs over thesummer and now lives with Gold. On thesteps of the Capitol, he tweeted, “I am incredibly proud to be a patriot today, tostand up tall in defense of liberty & the Constitution, tosupport Trump & #MAGAforever, & tosend the message: WE ARE NEVER CONCEDING A STOLEN ELECTION.”Lawyers generally know that after engaging in a potentially criminal act, it’s best tostop talking publicly about it. But Gold apparently couldn’t resist thesiren call of an interview with theWashington Post. In aJanuary 12story, Gold admitted to being inside the Capitol on January 6. “I can certainlyspeak to the place that I was, and it most emphatically was not a riot,”shesaid, explaining dubiously thatshe thought it was legal to go inside. “Where I was, was incredibly peaceful.”Simone Gold (top left), on the FBI poster that became fodder for internetsleuths, who quickly ID her and posted videos liketheseonline.“Peaceful” is not a word the FBI used in court filings to describe where Gold was that day. According to an FBI agent, Gold and Strand were photographed “in a large crowd attempting to push past multiple officers blocking the entrance to the Capitol, which had visibly broken windows at the time. One of the officers, who had been pinned near the doors to the Capitol, appears to be pulled down bysomeone in the crowd and lands near where Strand and Gold werestanding.” Videos andstill photos alsoshow the pair pressed up against the door to the House chamber where law enforcement was trying to block them. Gold told thePostthatshe worried that those photos and videos would impact her ability to advocate the America’s Frontline Doctors. “I do regret being there,” Gold admitted. Her regret is understandable. For days, an image of herstanding in the Capitol Rotunda with a bullhorn appeared on an FBI wanted posterseeking help identifying people who participated in the insurrection. Five days after her interview with KGET, FBI agents went to her Beverly Hills house and arrested her and Strand. A DC federal grand jury indicted her on February 5. By then, L Lin Wood was facing disbarment efforts in Georgia, where authorities have demanded a mental health evaluation after he called for Vice President Mike Pence to be executed. He was thus unavailable to defend Gold. So why didshe do it?It’s impossible to know what combination of impulse, exhilaration, and conviction led Gold to follow a mob into the US Capitol. She did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, but there are a few likely dynamics at work.

Kruglanski notes, too, that many of the leaders of the neo-Nazi “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville in 2017, which left one woman dead andscores injured, were college educated, including Richard Spencer, who has a BA from the University of Virginia, a masters from the University of Chicago, andspent two years working on a PhD in modern European intellectual history at Duke University before leaving to “pursue a life of thought-crime.”“You do not have to be poor and left behind to embrace these theories,” Kruglanski told me. When it comes to real extremism, as opposed to political grandstanding, Gold much more resembles Stewart Rhodes than Ted Cruz. Rhodes is the founder of the Oath Keepers, the far-right militia group of which about a dozen members have been charged with crimes related to the Capitol riot.

Top image credit: Mother Jones illustration; Gage Skidmore/Wikimedia; GettySubscribe usingApple Podcasts,Spotify,Stitcher, or your favorite pod cast app. None of her videos garnered more than 12,000 views but they hit a certain zeitgeist, as conservatives and conspiracy theorists alike pushed the idea that virus cases were overblown andsome people in the government were using COVID to take away individual freedom and undermine President Trump. Three weeks earlier, Fox News radio host Todd Starnes had gone to a Brooklyn hospital and made a video claiming that the emergency room was empty. “I’m afraid that the mainstream media has been overblowing the coverage here,” he narrated. “There’s been a lot of fear mongering going on.” With help from aQAnon enthusiast, the videos pawned the hashtag#filmyourhospital and prompted a host of right-wing figures like failed California congressional candidate DeAnna Lorraine Tesoriero to rush to their nearest hospitals to make their own “empty hospital” videos weeks before Gold did. Even insuch a climate, Gold’s white coatstood out, andshe managed to catch the attention of one particularly influential audience member:Jenny Beth Martin, the co-founder of Tea Party Patriots. One of the largest of the original tea party groups that arose to oppose President Barack Obama, Tea Party Patriots encompasses a trio of nonprofit groups funded by wealthy conservatives and conservative foundations like Donors Trust. A Tea Party Patriotssuper-PAC also raised $1.2 million to help reelect Trump in 2020. Martin was dialed into the Trump White House—so muchso thatshe would later join Trump’s Georgia legal team to help overturn the 2020 presidential election, even thoughshe’s not a lawyer. Early in the pandemic,she was working with a newly formed Save Our Country Coalition to help oppose lock downs and defend Trump’s handling of the pandemic, along with powerful conservative organizationssuch as the Heritage Foundation and the American Legislative Exchange Council. She is also the executive committeesecretary of the Council for National Policy, asecretive but powerful religious-right organization that was working with the Trump reelection campaign to find doctors to help burnish the president’s approval ratings. Gold was just thesort ofsurrogate they had been looking for. “I reached out to her andsaid, ‘Hey, I’m working on this effort and I’d like to talk to doctors,’ and westarted em ailing and talking, and as things have developed andshe watched the virus, things have evolved,” Martin later explained to. The pair met in April, and Gold asked Martin to deliver a lettershe’d written to Trump, calling the lock downs a “mass casualty event,” whichshe’d been urging other doctors tosign. More than 400 had. With lightningspeed, Martin put Gold on the ready-made conservative media grievance circuit. On May 19, Tea Party Patriotshosted a conference call with conservative media luminaries, including Fox News’ Ed Henry and, featuring Gold and a handful of other doctors who hadsigned Gold’s letter to Trump. On the call, Gold described the hidden victims of the lockdowns, including a womanshe’d treated who’d fallen and broken her hip andshoulder while trying to color her own hair becauseshe couldn’t go to asalon. “I just feel that’s there’s a very big disconnect between what the average American thinks is going on and what’s actually going on,” Goldsaid. The callsent Gold on a grand round of media hits with all of the biggest names in the MAGA firmament—former Trump White House adviser Sebastian Gorka, Glenn Beck, Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk—and ultimately withsome of the majorstars of Fox News. In early July, Fox host Laura Ingraham had Gold on hershow to promote her favorite drug as an over-the-counter COVID cure. “This is like a medical cancel culture applied to this particular medication,” Ingrahamsaidsympathetically, conflatingsome cherished conservative points of fury. It’s probably hard to overstate just how much of a role conservative media played in nudging Gold towards insurrection. University of Maryland psychology professor Arie W Kruglanski is a co-author of the book. In his research on extremist networks across the globe, he identified three crucial factors in political radicalization: a need to feelsignificant, a narrative to follow, and a network thatsupports and validates that narrative. “It’s difficult to become very glamorous or glorious as an emergency room doctor,” Kruglanski told me. Gold’ssplash into right-wing media, hesays, probably fulfilled all three of the pillars. “This issort of an overnightstardom. She has the narrative, andshe now has the network thatsupports her.”Gold really hit the big time in July. After brainstorming with Martin, Gold helped Tea Party Patriots convene an “America’s Frontline Doctors”summit in DC, an event that resembled the “white coat” protests Martin had organized back in the tea party heyday to oppose the Affordable Care Act. The two-daysummit garnered almost no media attention until the very end, when Gold and about a dozen white-coated physicians appeared on thesteps of the Supreme Court to talk about “medical cancel culture” andspent nearly 45 minutes making misleading claimssuggesting that COVID can be prevented and cured with, nosurprise here, hydroxychloroquine. Most of them had never treated a COVID patient; ophthalmologists were overrepresented in the group. And one was really out there: Stella Immanuel, a Houston doctor who believes thatsome gynecological problems are caused by havingsex with demons. “You don’t need masks. There is a cure,”shesaid. “Nobody needs to getsick.”President Trump and hisson Don Jr. retweeted a video of the event and it went viral, receiving more than 16 million views in a matter of hours before Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter took it down forspreading misinformation. Twitter even blocked Don Jr. from using his account for most of the day. Simone Gold’ssummer mediasplash included big names: Fox News’ Tucker Carlson, Laura Ingraham and Ed Henry, plus Turning Points USA founder Charlie Kirk, Glenn Beck, and conservative talk radio host Dennis Prager. Gold has claimed that the California hospitalshe worked for promptly fired her for appearing in the video, andsaysshe hasn’t practiced medicinesince. But the episode provided her with instant celebrity as a victim of Big Tech censorship, a credential even more beloved by conservative media than her white coat and fancy law degree. The next day, Gold accompanied Martin to meet with Vice President Mike Pence to press for emergency-use authorization for hydroxy chloroquine and talk censorship. The day after that,she appeared on Tucker Carlson’s Fox Newsshow, one of the most watched prime-time cable newsshows, with more than 3 million regular viewers. On theshow, Carlson expressed outrage that Gold’s hospital had fired her. “Shouldn’t you as a practicing physician with a medical degree be allowed to express your views onscience as you practice it without being censored?” he asked. Gold agreed and thenseized the opportunity to make her case for hydroxy chloroquine to Carlson’s millions of viewers. “Look, I majored in Russian History. I don’t know anything about hydroxychloroquine,” he told her in response. “I do know about the way the country issupposed to work, and physiciansshould be allowed to explain their experiences, their clinical experiences, treating patients and you’re not allowed to because Joe Biden getting elected is more important, and that’sscary.”In asign of how far down the far-right rabbit holeshe’d already gone by then, Gold told Carlson that because of “some negative things” people hadsaidsince the video aired,she had retained attorney and conspiracy theorist L Lin Wood to put “to rest anything people want tosay that’s defamatory.” Wood would later join with Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani to file a host of baseless lawsuits to try to overturn the presidential election. By early fall,it was clear that Gold’s original analysis of the pandemic was mostly wrong. The virusspiked across the country and researchers declared hydroxy chloroquine useless for treating COVID Even Trump didn’t take it when he gotsick. As her prospects in medicine dimmed, Goldseems to have become too toxic even for Fox News, which hasn’t had her on the airsince July. She had turned America’s Frontline Doctors into a more traditional nonprofit organization, complete with website,spokesperson, and white papers decrying various alleged flip-flops by Anthony Fauci. But in her quest for publicity, Gold had to dive even deeper into the far-right feverswamp. For the next few months, Gold gave interviews to or publicspeeches with QAnon conspiracy theorists, white nationalists, B-list talkshow luminaries, and a few politicians, including Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), a “stop thesteal” movement promoter affiliated with far-right militia groups that were part of the Capitol riots. She even went on the Patriot Radioshow hosted by Matt Shea, a former Washington State legislator who has been involved in a number of armed federalstandoffs, including the takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in 2016 led by Ammon Bundy. Associated with Christian nationalists, Shea has written a manifesto calling for a fundamentalist holy war, in which non-Christian males would be killed if they didn’tsubmit to Biblical law. The Jewish doctor chatted happily with him about vitamins and the value of exercise in preventing COVID. “Before I was called a quack and a fraud, people used to clap for me for working out there on the front lines,” Gold lamented, before encouraging people to give up masks and to freely gather for the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. But Gold found her most loyal audience among evangelical Christian prosperity preachers, many of whom had refused to close their church doors during the lock downs and were vaccineskeptics. After big tech companies pulled down the doctors’ video in July, it was rebroadcast by Daystar, thesecond-largest Christian TV network in the country. Since then, Gold has made at leastsix different appearances on the network founded by tel evangelists Marcus and Joni Lamb—and those visits have paid off. In mid-August, whenshe headlined the Lambs’ program “Ministry Now,” along with the anti-vaccine activist Robert Kennedy Jr, Marcus Lamb made asurprise announcement: He was issuing a $10,000 matching challenge from Daystar for donations on Gold’s behalf. “I know that you lost your job and now it may be that God has placedsomething else in your heart to where you’re gonna make astand,” Joni Lamb told Gold. “It’s going to take money to do that.” In October, Gold returned to chat with the ladies of “Joni Table Talk,” Daystar’s tel evangelical version of “The View.” Over coffee with the hosts, Gold thanked “the whole Daystar family for beingso generous,” and talked about thesmall donations from viewersshe’d received. “It really adds up,”shesaid gratefully. “It gave mesome breathing room to keep fighting for advocacy.”Evangelical churches were especially receptive to Gold’s anti-vaccine advocacy, whichshe pivoted to as hydroxy chloroquine faded as a right-wing cause célèbre. Three days before the Capitol riot, Gold appeared ata religious revival e ventin Tampa, Florida, billed as an “open air mass healing and miracleservice,” run by Rodney Howard-Browne. A conspiracy theorist, Howard-Browne has appeared on Alex Jones’ far-rightsite and has called the massshooting in Christchurch, New Zealand, a “false flag” operation. He was arrested in March for holding religiousservices in violation of astay at home order. Gold took thestage before a room full of people without masks and gave an hour-longspeech, whereshe decried the evils of the “experimental biological agent,” better known as the COVID vaccine. Shesaid it’s being tested on minority communities that have been prioritized for vaccines, whichshe dubbed “pure racism.”“They are making an overt and covert attempt to push this heavily on Blacks and browns,”she warned. “If you take the vaccine, you’resigning up to be in a phar maco vigilance trackingsystem.”For most of 2020,the formerly apolitical Dr. Gold was able toseparate her personal crusade for “health freedom” from the presidential election that provided the backdrop to the fight over lock downs and hydroxychloroquine. She rarely touched on thesubject in public other than tosuggest that“Orange Man bad”and notscience drove opposition to the anti-malaria drug. But whether Gold realized it or not, the battle over the drug was less about health care policy and more of a proxy war over Trump and the future of democracy. Trump’s loss to Joe Biden in November was a blow to Gold’s cause, as pollsshowed voters resoundingly rejected his handling of the pandemic, which embraced much of what Gold advocated. It also put her on a collision course with the “stop thesteal” movement that metastasized after the presidential election, as her tea party and evangelical benefactors quickly backed Trump’s effort to brand the election as illegitimate and overturn the results. Gold’s Stanford law degreesuggestsshe issmart enough to know a big lie whenshesees one, but “stop thesteal” was where the action was, not to mention thespeaking gigs and fundraising opsshe now relied on for her livelihoodsince her medical career cratered. Onceshestarted down the MAGA path, there was no turning back. When Trumpsupporters first converged in DC on November 14 at the “Million MAGA march” to contest the election results, Gold was right there with them, along with other Trump die-hards like Mike Lindell, the MyPillow guy who helped bankroll the march; Sebastian Gorka, and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, the Georgia congresswoman who’d expressedsupport for the QAnon conspiracy theory. “You do not give up your inalienable rights just because there’s an epidemic,” Goldshouted from the Supreme Courtsteps, warning that the government was using an “age-old tactic” toseize power byscaring people with a disease thatshesaid causes mostly mild illness. “Do not live in fear. Be joyful, be happy, go forward!”The event was advertised on the neo-Nazi website, the, and drew hordes of militia outfits and white nationalist groups like the Proud Boys and Nick Fuentes’ Groypers. The rally descended into violence; 21 people were arrested on assault and gun charges, and one person wasstabbed. That didn’tstop Gold from coming back to DC tospeak with many of thesame people at the January 5 “stop thesteal” rally at Freedom Plaza—the warmup to the main event at the Capitol, organized by Ali Alexander, a convicted felon and conspiracy theorist. Speakers represented a parade of far-right figures ranging from anti-abortion activists to former Trump adviser Roger Stone. Standing under an umbrella held by a man in a “Baby Lives Matter”shirt, Goldsaid to the crowd, “I’m here to ask you a personal question: Why are you here?…I believe the reason you are here is thesame reason I am choosing to be here. Because we all have recognized a blatant assault on the rule of law… We aresick and tired of being lied to.”Kruglanski isn’tsurprised that Gold would move from promoting a bogus COVID cure to joining with people who thought the election had beenstolen. “In many cases the radical groups firstshower you with love without you even accepting their ideology,” he explains. “But once you are accepted by the group, to maintain your goodstanding in that community you’ve got to accept their narrative.”The next day Gold wasscheduled tospeak again at the“Wild Protest”organized by Alexander near the White House, along with Tea Party Patriots’ Jenny Beth Martin and Brandon Straka, founder of the Walkaway Campaign that urges Democrats to quit the party. (Straka was also later arrested for entering the Capitol.) But thespeeches were inexplicably canceled, and instead, protesters heeded Trump’s call to march on the Capitol while Congress and the vice president were certifying the results of the 2020 election. Gold joined them. She was accompanied by John Strand—an international underwear model whoserves as the communications director for America’s Frontline Doctors. Strand, 38, had been part of regular Beverly Hills “freedom protests” against the lock downs over thesummer and now lives with Gold. On thesteps of the Capitol, he tweeted, “I am incredibly proud to be a patriot today, tostand up tall in defense of liberty & the Constitution, tosupport Trump & #MAGAforever, & tosend the message: WE ARE NEVER CONCEDING A STOLEN ELECTION.”Lawyers generally know that after engaging in a potentially criminal act, it’s best tostop talking publicly about it. But Gold apparently couldn’t resist thesiren call of an interview with the. In aJanuary 12story, Gold admitted to being inside the Capitol on January 6. “I can certainlyspeak to the place that I was, and it most emphatically was not a riot,”shesaid, explaining dubiously thatshe thought it was legal to go inside. “Where I was, was incredibly peaceful.”Simone Gold (top left), on the FBI poster that became fodder for internetsleuths, who quickly ID her and posted videos liketheseonline.“Peaceful” is not a word the FBI used in court filings to describe where Gold was that day. According to an FBI agent, Gold and Strand were photographed “in a large crowd attempting to push past multiple officers blocking the entrance to the Capitol, which had visibly broken windows at the time. One of the officers, who had been pinned near the doors to the Capitol, appears to be pulled down bysomeone in the crowd and lands near where Strand and Gold werestanding.” Videos andstill photos alsoshow the pair pressed up against the door to the House chamber where law enforcement was trying to block them. Gold told the thatshe worried that those photos and videos would impact her ability to advocate the America’s Frontline Doctors. “I do regret being there,” Gold admitted. Her regret is understandable. For days, an image of herstanding in the Capitol Rotunda with a bullhorn appeared on an FBI wanted posterseeking help identifying people who participated in the insurrection. Five days after her interview with KGET, FBI agents went to her Beverly Hills house and arrested her and Strand. A DC federal grand jury indicted her on February 5. By then, L Lin Wood was facing disbarment efforts in Georgia, where authorities have demanded a mental health evaluation after he called for Vice President Mike Pence to be executed. He was thus unavailable to defend Gold. So why didshe do it?It’s impossible to know what combination of impulse, exhilaration, and conviction led Gold to follow a mob into the US Capitol. She did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, but there are a few likely dynamics at work. Let’sstart with her own reflections on what happened, which weresurprisingly uncomplicated: “When you’re crossing thestreet and the light turns green, you go,”shesaid in an interview with KGET Shaking her headsomewhat ruefully,she added thatshe came up with the “genius” idea to give thespeechshe had planned to deliver at the canceled rally. “I…I just wanted to,”shestammered. “Someone had a bullhorn.

Trump on Wednesday announced that he issuing Facebook, Twitter and Google-owned YouTube, as well as their respective CEOs for, well, following their own rules and kicking him off their platforms. He’s doneso on behalf of himself and “similarlysituated” people in an attempt to wage a class-actionsuit against thesocial media giants. Trump’s primary problem in this lawsuit is, well, the law. Thesuit is predicated on the assumption that in booting Trump, these companies violated his First Amendment rights. TheFirst Amendmentprovides that “Congressshall make no law … abridging the freedom ofspeech.” This prohibition applies not just to Congress (and federal laws), but also to all government representatives and agents. This means thatsomeone who is a member of any level of government — local,state or federal — cannot restrict your freedom ofspeech (withsome limited exceptions). Trump’s main difficulty here is that Facebook, Twitter and Google, while indisputably powerful, are private companies, not part of the government. Whensocial media companies act, it is a private action, not government action. Facebook, Twitter and Google by definition can’t trample on your First Amendment rights because only the government, and not corporations, can doso. Surely, yousay to yourselves, the former president of the USs and his lawyers must know about this fundamental flaw in their lawsuit? Well, yes — but Trump attempts to argue that the companiesshould be treated asstate agencies who can, in fact, violate their individual users’ First Amendment rights. Namely, thesuit claims because these companies benefit from the protections of a federal law, the 1996 Communications Decency Act, that Democratic legislators (who are, in fact,state actors) hadspecial leverage over Facebook, Twitter and Google. Trump then argues that because the companies “are vulnerable to and react to coercive pressure from the federal government to regulatespecificspeech,” they were coerced into “censoring thespecificspeech at issue in this lawsuit and de-platforming” him. And, thesuit continues, making a reference to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that because the companies were “acting in concert with federal officials, including officials at the CDC and the Biden transition,” their “censorship activities amount tostate action.”Facebook, Twitter and Google by definition can’t trample on your First Amendment rights because only the government, and not corporations, can doso. Unsatisfied after introducing just one erroneous legal argument, Trump thenspecifically calls on the court tostrike downSection 230 of the Communications Decency Actas unconstitutional. (It isn’t.)The act, which dates back to 1996 when the internet was in its infancy, largely protects onlinesites from liability based on what their userssay on thosesites and for their decisions about content moderation. None of this demonstrates that private companies have magically transformed into government actors. No, these arguments have enough holes to drive a Mack truck right through them. In effect, Trump has inverted the First Amendment argument here. Facebook, Twitter and Google have their own First Amendment rights toset the terms of their platforms’ use, free of government intrusion. Each company is also free to exclude users from its platforms for things like, oh, let’s hypotheticallysay inciting an insurrection. Let’s pause for a moment and remember that Trump was the leader of the federal government when he claims that the actions of private companies, who tossed them off their platforms, violated his First Amendment rights. (That ringing you hear is thesound of irony calling.)In effect, Trump has inverted the First Amendment argument here. So, Trump’s arguments are legally invalid and at times nonsensical. We have to ask ourselves: What is this lawsuit really about? It’s not about the law — it’s about politics. All 44 pages are just a political argument dressed in legal clothes. Facebook, Twitter and Google offered Trump asignificant megaphone. In thespan of a few days, he went from being able to broadcast his message with three of the world’s most powerful bullhorns to being reduced to a whisper. His rallies, packed as they may be, are nosubstitute for the reach ofsocial media. Trump’s megaphone has not only been diminished, but perhaps just as important, his fundraising tools have also dulled. Social media platforms provided Trump with the easy ability to raise campaign donations directly and indirectly. Campaign rallies do not offer attendees thesame ability to “click here to make a donation.”And if you wondered whether this is all really about raising political donations, take a gander at the fundraising pleas that GOP committeessent out moments after Trump filed hissuits. Weshould all recognize that thesesuits are unmoored from any cognizable theory. They will notsucceed in courtrooms. But will theysucceed in further persuading Trump’s base that Big Tech companies have engaged in a conspiracy against Trump and other Republicans? Maybe. And that is a problem that can’t besolved by a federal judge dismissing thesesuits. Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, is the host of the ""Passing Judgment"" podcast.

206,Private schools are the real college admissions scandal.,-6.33,41.0,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/06/private-schools-competitive-college-advantage-problems.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-14,25,"The Supreme Court kicked the can down the road today on the case of Students for Fair Admissions’ case against Harvard University, with an invitation to thesolicitor general to write a brief expressing the view of the USs. The invitation is a delay, but the case will be considered again. SFFA attempts to argue that the nation’s most famous college discriminates against Asian Americans in the admissions process, and even thoughit’s lost twice in court, it’s expected that this current court, packed with conservative justices, would rule in favor of the ast ro turf organization dedicated to killing affirmative actionshould it decide to hear the case. SSFA’s leader, Ed Blum, has been trying for decades to eliminate affirmative action in college admissions. After he failed with Abigail Fisher’ssuit against the University of Texas (that one argued Fisher had been discriminated against for being white but failed to provide compelling evidence), Blumstarted courting Asian Americanstudents who were rejected by Ivy League institutions. It is unclear how many he found,since not onestudent testified on SFFA’s behalf during the trial, but the organization’s legalstrategy relied onstatistical arguments to claim that Harvard’s admissions policies gave advantages to legacies, donors, athletes, and underrepresented minorities, which hurt Asian American applicants. In trying to claim an equivalence between providing unfair advantages to the already advantaged (legacies, donors, athletes) and taking race and racism into account during the admissions process, SFFA has cannily yoked its attack on race-conscious admissions to a critique of actually illegitimate advantages given to the white and wealthy. But there’s a clear tell in thisstrategy that reveals SFFA does not really care about unearned advantages: Itsaid nothing about graduating from a private highschool. Graduating from private highschool is a far larger advantage at many top ranked colleges than playingsports or being a legacy or even having a connection to a donor are. (Viewed a certain way, a privateschool is almost a more reliable incomesource for an elite college than a donor.) While 10 percent ofstudents admitted toHarvard’s Class of 2018were recruited athletes and 12 percent were legacies,almost 40 percent of the class went to a privateschool. If we really wanted to get rid of the most glaring case of bias at prestigious private universities, we would target private highschoolstudents. Legacy, donor, and athletic preferencesshould bestripped out of college admissions too, but when it comes to tipping thescales away from fairness and equity, privateschools outweigh everything else. Only 7 percent of highschoolstudents attended private highschools in the USs in 2019,according to Census Bureau data, but at many of the mostselective colleges in the nation privateschool grads make up a third to half of freshman classes. This is the realscandal in college admissions: Wealthy families pay for their children to attend highschools that receive preferential treatment in the admissions process at highly rejective colleges. Defenders of private highschools’ overrepresentation at many highly ranked universities might claim thestudents have reaped the benefit of a more rigorous education in order to earn theirspot. When you control for wealth, however, privateschool’s academic andsocial-emotional benefits are basically wiped out. Historically,students from the nation’s elite boardingschools “perform[ed] worse in the classroom [at Harvard] than otherstudents over the entire 1924-1990 period” but went on to make more money than their peers by taking advantage of the connections they made in groups like final clubs, which largely exclude anyone who is not wealthy or white. StreetGrottlesexstudents and their peers at old nondenominational privateschools might be a little less white and little less wealthy than they were a century ago, but have no doubt: Theseschoolsstill do not look like America. This year’s graduating class of public highschoolstudents is the first projected to be majority-nonwhite, but almost70 percent of privateschoolstudents are white. That’s a product, in part, of along history of white people pulling their children out of publicschools after desegregation, and privateschools continuing to make an outsize contribution toschoolsegregation in the USs. Most independentschools do providesome financial aid, but it often goes to asmallshare ofstudents. At Marlborough, an independentschool in Los Angeles where the cost of attendance is about $45,000, only 20 percent of families receive financial aid, and almost half of those who dostill make more than $200,000 per year. About 6 percent of all theschool’sstudents come from families making less than $100,000,even though almost two-thirds of American households make less than that. Some independentschools enroll a number of low-incomestudents onscholarship, and these “privileged poor,” to use Anthony Jack’s term,account for half the low-incomestudents atsome highlyselective universities, further evidence of the advantage granted to theseschools in the admissions process. Private highschools can cost as much as$70,000per year. For those prices,students get not onlysingle-digitstudent-to-teacher ratios,teachers with PhD.s,bettersports facilities than those at many colleges, anda rt museums, but also college counselors who work with a fraction of the number ofstudents publicschool counselors work with. At Horace Mann, in the Bronx,180seniors areserved by eight college counselors. Fewer than 2 miles away,12 guidance counselors work with 750seniors at Bronx Science. Both highschools are full of very talentedstudents, but only one of them pays its director of college counseling $350,000 per year. Thatsalary is an index of just how much emphasis the parents who pay for independentschools place on getting their kids into certain universities, which may be why the mediansalary for a college counselor at independentschools is $94,000 but the mediansalary for a teacher is $60,000, according to the National Association of Independent Schools. Many independentschool counselorsstarted in college admissions, often at highlyselective colleges;one of the newest members of this rank was a dean of admissions at an Ivy League university just last fall. These highschools are paying not just for experts who know the rules of the game; they are paying for experts who know the referees. It’s a cozy world, where privateschool counselors meet up with admissions officers atsmall invitation-only annual meetings, like the Fitzwilliam Conferenceheld in the woods of New Hampshire every May for three days, including asix-hour block for “golf, hiking, antiquing.” And then there’s the annual Clambake Institute, where privateschool counselors and admissions officers get together everysummer atStreetGeorge’s Schooljust outside Newport, Rhode Island—the perfectsetting for cementing and perpetuating thespecial bond between rich highschools, richstudents, and rich universities. Thatspecial bond is cashed in through one of the least-well-known rituals of college admissions:the counselor call. It’s a decades-old tradition, in whichschool counselors and admissions officers review a list ofstudents who have applied to a college, and counselors get a chance to make a case for theirstudents. Swarthmore College put an end to the practice this past year after it discovered that more than 90 percent of their requests for counselor calls came from private highschools. Thisspring, USC began telling counselors requesting a call that any conversation would be informational, and asked counselors to “refrain from advocating for candidates.”Butsimply attending certain highschools can provide enough of an advantage that no advocacy is needed. Harvard’s dean of admissionssaid as much under oath in 2018during the SFFA trial: “[Sometimes] we takesomebody … lower in the class … and we’ve gotsome other very attractive people at the upper end of the class. Sometimes you can make an argument to take them both because they’re both terrific.” The dean continued, “It’s also a very good message to thatschool that you may be trying to develop that you’re looking for all kinds of different people.”In other words,someone thought that a good way for Harvard to defend itself against charges that it unfairly advantaged underrepresented minorities was tosay, no, no, don’t worry, the unfair advantage goes to overrepresented wealthystudents. The word gives away the game. Any head of admissions knows that he needs to build a reliable pipeline of customers from certain institutions. As Harvard’s dean testified, “We’re trying to create relationships withschools. … We’re trying to create 100-year relationships with them.”Even as it feels counter to the endeavor of competitive admissions based on merit, it’s perfectly logical for colleges and private highschools to pursue cozy relationships. To quote Willie Sutton, that’s where the money is. A full-payingstudent at an Ivy Leagueschool is worth well more than a quarter-million dollars in revenue over four years, plus future donations. Someschools willsend five orsixstudents a year, which adds up to a million-plus in revenue, year over year for ideally a century or more, apparently. In return, the highschools gain a level of access that lets them charge more than what many Americans make per year. To be fair,superselective universities also cultivate these relationships with organizations likeQuestbridgeandsome publicschool counselors to create a pipeline for high-achieving, low-incomestudents, but the numberssuggest there’s a lot more pipe being laid on the Upper East Side of Manhattan than in the South Bronx or rural New York. There is little point in criticizing any of the individuals involved in this corrupt relationship between privateschools and highlyselective colleges. The parents whosend their kids to independentschools and the counselors and teachers working in them are, in my experience, conscientious and caring individuals keenly aware of theirstudents’ privilege and their own, and many of them work hard to increase equity and diversity at theirschool and in college admissions. Some of them ran into opposition this past year, as a few white parents bristled atschools’ efforts to introduce diversity, equity, and inclusion programs in the wake of the anti-racist protests lastsummer as well asastring of affectingsocial media campaigns where Blackstudents revealed the racism they routinely faced atschool. If we are going to have an aristocracy, I guess it’s better to have a woke one. But wouldn’t it be better to have no aristocracy at all?Short of eliminating privateschools, we cannot eliminate the advantage families purchase by enrolling their children in them. We might, however, reducesome of that advantage by doing four things. First, all universitiesshould end counselor calls. Second, universitiesshould be required to report annually what type of highschools their first-timestudents attended, disaggregated by race. More than half of the top 75 institutions in the US News & World Report rankings do not publish this information,suggesting they either do not think the overrepresentation of private highschoolstudents matters or that they want to keep that fact out ofsight. I’m notsure which is worse. Third, universitiesshouldstop askingschool counselors for letters of recommendation. How can a counselor responsible for 200seniors possibly write each one a letter as effectively as one with only 30students can?Fourth, admissions officesshould redact the name of theschool during the admissions process andstop assigning applications by region, as most highlyselective colleges do. Context is essential for admissions officers to consider applicants’ merits rather than their accomplishments. A file couldstill contain relevant information about a highschool,such as the number ofstudents on free lunch programs, or itsstudent-to-counselor ratio. Goingschool-blind would not erase context, but it would hide the brand names. Highlyselective colleges might not be ready to break their hundred-year relationships with private highschools. But they could certainly become less toxic for everyoneelse.",1,1,Slate

Thank you for checking on me. This is horrifying.”Like the rest of America, I watched the chaos unfold on TV Although I was about a mile away from the Capitolbuilding, I feared for thesafety of my colleagues and friends who were in the complex, as well as the thousands ofstaff — especially the Black and brownsupport workers — who dutifully keep thesprawling Capitol complex humming every day.

I’m proud to be Black in thisspace and in these halls of power. It carries a profoundsense of duty and responsibility to my community. One that I carry close to my chest, because that’s how we work. One of the core philosophies of being a Hillstaffer is to do the work quietly, in the wings of history. We are not in thespotlight. Wesupport our bosses, whom the people elected, and help advance their priorities for the country and, in my case, for Massachusetts. The action is on the House and Senate floor. We are thesupporting players, and most of us prefer it that way.

Historians have noted that not even during the Civil War did this violentsymbol of white power and oppression penetrate the halls of our Capitol. And yet, a white mob hadsuccessfully and violently ushered this hate into the bowels of Congress.

208,Is There a Future for Fusionism?,12.33,30.67,https://reason.com/2021/02/10/is-there-a-future-for-fusionism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/reason-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-10,25,"There is a well-worn tale about modern American conservatism: Itsays that the movement as we know it came into being during the mid–20th century as a ""fusionist"" coalition of economic libertarians and religious traditionalists. These groups, whose goals and priorities differed from thestart, were held together mainly by two things: thesheer charisma of founder William F Buckley Jr., and theshared enemy of global communism. As long as the Cold War endured, thestory goes, each wing was willing to cedesome ground to the other. In light of the threat posed by a rampaging Soviet Union—as militantly atheistic as it was militantly anti-capitalist—the differences between the libertarians and the traditionalists did notseemso great. Their interests, at least, were aligned. But the fall of the USSR meant the collapse of the common foe that hadsustained the fusionist partnership. It was able to trundle on for a while, powered by a reservoir of goodwill, but it has long been running on fumes. In the last few years, the alliance is inherent tensions have come to a head. It is increasingly common to hear that, whatever value there may have been in cooperation during the '50s, '60s, '70s, and '80s, the era of good conservative feelings is over. For many libertarians, the Trump years revealed their traditionalist allies to be hypocrites and opportunists, all too willing tosell out the ideals of fusionism inservice of an aspiring dictator. Conservatives have commenced a not-so-slow descent toward authoritarianism,some in this groupsuggest; if the philosophy of liberty is to have a future, it must involve building bridges to the left, not the right. A number of traditionalists, meanwhile, have been tripping over each other in their rush to celebrate the end of fusionism. What the 21st century demands, theysay, is a different, more ""muscular""style of politics, practiced by a Republican Party that finallystops worrying and learns to love thestate. By passingstronger laws, these ""post-liberal"" conservatives believe they can restore America is lost Judeo-Christian character andsave their country from itself. This is quite a change from the Reagan Republicanism of a few decades ago. Back then, most folks on the right insisted that limited government and personal responsibility were the watchwords of conservatism. That consensus has now broken down. From literature to philosophy to religion, it is hard to think of a theme less original than theseductiveness of power. That, after all, is thestory of Frodo and the ring; of Lord Acton and ""absolute power corrupts absolutely""; of Satan and the third temptation of Christ. One of history is great recurrent lessons is about the importance of keeping that desire in check, in our hearts and our governments alike. Which is why it is exasperating to watchso many conservatives—self-proclaimed heirs to the axiom that ""example is theschool of mankind,"" in Edmund Burke is phrase—succumb in real time to the fantasy that are the exception to this time-tested rule. As far as the post-liberal conservatives are concerned, libertarianism is preoccupation with protecting liberty has blinded it to the importance of promoting virtue (and a constellation of related values, including faith, family, community, and patriotism). The most moderate version of this argumentsuggests that libertarians have come to exercise too much influence over the right-of-center policy agenda and proposes aso-called rebalancing toward traditionalist concerns. A more radical version excoriates libertarianism as philosophically bankrupt and calls upon the keepers of the conservative flame to take asledgehammer to the fusionist coalition once and for all. Hillsdale College is David Azerrad put the latter positionstarkly in a July 2020 essay for. ""The common enemy that justified an alliance with the free market fundamentalists is long gone,"" he wrote. ""Today, libertarians activelyside with our enemies: they promote open borders and empty prisons, andstrengthen China is hand through their consumer-focused economic policies. Ours is primarily a conservatism of countries and borders, citizens and families, none of which can take root in the barren libertariansoil of atomized individuals and global markets.""The post-liberal agenda is typified by a desire for more government involvement in people is lives. As' Ross Douthat wrote in 2019, this groupseeks ""strongerstate interventions in the economy on behalf ofsocially conservative ends."" Or, as Azerrad put it in his essay, ""the right must be comfortable wielding the levers ofstate power.""Economically, post-liberalism rejects the doctrine of ""unfettered"" free markets in favor of tariffs, an ""industrial policy"" intended to prop up American manufacturers in the face of competition from overseas, wagesubsidies, and the like. Onsocial issues, itsupports everything from vice laws to a rollback of no-fault divorce to more robustspeech restrictions on public morality grounds to (among a lively cohort of radical Catholics especially) the imposition of a confessionalstate and perhaps even a Christian monarch. There is little evidence that the post-liberals arespeaking for the average Republican, let alone the average American. But the elite wind doesseem to be at their backs. Fox News host Tucker Carlson was once an avatar of fusionism whosupported Ron Paul for president in both 1988 and 2008 and told in 2010, ""I despise laws that tell people that they can not do things for their own good."" By January 2019, he was delivering a 15-minute on-air monologue decrying the failures of capitalism. ""Does anyonestill believe that cheaper iPhones or more Amazon deliveries of plastic garbage from China are going to make us happy?"" Carlson asked. ""Libertarians tell us that is how markets work: consenting adults making voluntary decisions about how to live their lives,"" he continued, referringspecifically to payday lenders. ""OK But it is also disgusting.""Two months later, the Christian journal published a manifesto,signed by 15 conservative intellectuals, inveighing against a ""dead consensus"" that favors ""individual autonomy"" at the expense of ""permanent truths, familystability, communalsolidarity, and much else."" Four months after that, the political theorist Yoram Hazony organized an impressively attended conference promoting conservative nationalism. He took the opportunity on behalf of those present to ""declare independence"" from neoliberalism, classical liberalism, and libertarianism. In November 2019, Sen. Marco Rubio (R–Fla.) raised more than a few eyebrows when he gave an address at Washington, DC is Catholic University rejecting ""the notion that, left unguided, the market willsolve our problems."" He called instead for asystem of ""common-good capitalism"" capable of restoring the ""balance between the obligations and rights of the privatesector and working Americans.""This, Rubio argued, can be accomplished only throughsome measure ofstate direction. ""Promoting the common good will require public policies that drive investments in key industries,"" hesaid, ""because pure market principles and our national interest are not aligned."" Fortunately for us all, theseniorsenator from the Sunshine State came equipped with plans for, among other things, ""a national co-operative that guarantees investment"" in the rare-earth mineralsector. Rubio is fervor for a conservatism that has made its peace with a bigger, more powerful central government has been matched and exceeded bysome of his colleagues. First-term Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, for example—until recently the Republican Party is brightest young thing—seems not to have found a meddlesome technology regulation or ""pro-family"" policy he does not like. ""We must put aside the tired orthodoxies of years past,"" hesaid in a May 2019 Senatespeech. ""We need not just a bigger economy but a bettersociety.""Inspring 2020, a new think tank called American Compass came online—""an organization dedicated to helping American conservatism recover from its chronic case of market fundamentalism,"" as founder Oren Cass put it in an announcement published by. Among the group is favored policies aresubsidies for American manufacturers, reducing ""toward zero"" the number of visas granted to Chinese collegestudents, and legally requiring corporations to put the common good ahead of profitseeking—perhaps by ordering them to include labor representatives on their boards of directors, thus ""short-circuiting the default assumptions ofshareholder primacy by including workers among those to whom management is accountable.""That lastsuggestion isstriking in itssimilarity to a 2018 bill introduced by progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D–Mass.), which would require US companies ""to consider the interests of all corporatestakeholders,"" including by giving workers the right to fill 40 percent of boardseats. Warren has been a public enemy of the political right for nigh on a decade. Yet the conservative media have heaped acclaim on Cass' efforts and held him out as the future of the movement. Thissentiment culminated last August in a lengthy essay by columnist David Brooks that contained glowing mini-profiles of Hawley and Rubio and that extensively quoted Cass. ""Over the long term,"" Brooks concluded, ""some version of Working-Class Republicanism will redefine the GO P.""In 2018, Samuel Hammond, a researcher at the centrist Niskanen Center, persuasively argued that Warren is proposal represented a ""corporate catastrophe"" in the making. Today, he is a contributor to the American Compass blog, where not long ago he urged readers tostand up and insist: ""Conservatives believe insupporting families directly. And if that involves a pinch of redistribution,so be it!""Is there a contradiction there? Hammond does not thinkso. ""I really urge you toseparate Warren isspecific proposal,"" hesays, ""from the broader investigation"" that Cass is leading into how to help the working class. In the end, ""the right will have to take on an orientation that is moreskeptical of trade, moreskeptical of big business, and more curious about pro-labor, pro-family policies.""The post-liberal conservative movement is a twisted artifact of the now-conventional view of fusionism as a partnership of convenience between two groups that have divergent and even contradictory beliefsystems: libertarians, who prioritize individual freedom above all else, and traditionalists, who know better. This understanding issubtly—but crucially—mistaken. Fusionism, properly understood, is not a marriage of two groups. It is a marriage of two. A fusionist issomeone whosees both liberty (in the classicalsense of freedom from aggression, coercion, and fraud) and virtue (in the Judeo-Christiansense ofsubmission to God is commands) as important. Fusionism is therefore a distinct philosophical orientation unto itself. What is more, it has historically been the dominant orientation on the American right. Conservatives going back at least to the country is founding have believed that virtue and liberty were mutually reinforcing—and that neither couldsurvive long without the other. A freesociety depends on a virtuous populace. (""Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people,"" wrote John Adams. ""It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other."") But the reverse is also true: Virtue, to be virtuous, must be freely chosen. As the late literary editor Frank Meyer, usually identified as the godfather of fusionism, eloquently put it: ""Truth withers when freedom dies, however righteous the authority that kills it; and free individualism uninformed by moral value rots at its core andsoonsurrenders to tyranny.""Post-liberals tend tosee liberty and virtue as fatally at odds. To be a good person necessarily requires acceptingsome limits on one is choices, after all. Must not one of the two fusionist pillars ultimately trump the other?There is no denying that the demands of morality, traditionally understood, pull against a theoretical ideal of freedom from all constraint. Fusionism reconciles this tension by insisting that thestate protect people is fundamental rights to besecure in person and property—thus leaving individuals, and the various associations they come together to form, with as muchspace as possible in which to pursue the higher things. Within the governmentalsphere, liberty is indeed the ultimate end. But within the infinitely broadersphere outside of government, it is just the beginning: A life well-lived consists in using one is freedom to do what is right. The clear recognition that these areseparatespheres, withseparate roles to play for the common good, is the genius of the fusionist project. Today is post-liberal conservatives appear to think they are distinguished by the belief that virtue matters. They behave as if their core disagreement with fusionists is about whether human beings have moral obligations that go beyond leaving others alone to do as they please. This could hardly be more wrong. Anyone who holds to the Judeo-Christian tradition—as fusionists by definition do—accepts that we have manifold duties to one another. The disagreement is about whether it is thestate is job to those moral obligations. For a fusionist, the answer to that question must be no, for pragmatic as well as deeply moral reasons. The weight of evidence through history is that concentrated government power in the best case leads to incompetence and waste, while in the worst case it degenerates quickly into tyranny. Whether your main concern is material enrichment or the protection of human rights, limited government has beenshown on the proving grounds of experience to be the best available means to that end. Arguably even more important is the Judeo-Christian doctrine of human beings' equal inherent dignity. As the puts it, ""God created man a rational being, conferring on him the dignity of a person who can initiate and control his own actions."" And later: ""Every human person, created in the image of God, has the natural right to be recognized as a free and responsible being. All owe to each other this duty of respect."" That is whystate power issuch a grave matter, fraught with danger not just tosociety but to thesouls of those who wield it. Only when absolutely necessary—say, tostop one person from initiating violence against another—is it morally justifiable to overrulesomeone is right to live his life as he chooses. Understanding what fusionism is—and what it is not—is more important than it mayseem. An arrangement in which traditionalists and libertarians are merely allies can easily become a game of tug of war in which eachside jockeys to ensure that, on balance, its own priorities predominate. If oneside finds itself too often on the losing end of that jockeying, it might reasonably move to dissolve the alliance altogether. But if fusionism is a discrete philosophical worldview—and a pervasive one at that, with a pedigree that runs through the American founding and with roots in the Hebrew Bible—then post-liberalism looks infinitely more radical. Remember: The new conservatives do not just call for a collective recommitment to the pursuit of virtue in the privatesphere; they explicitly insist that power be exercised in the governmentsphere, with a goal of forcibly reorientingsociety to the common good. Such ashift amounts to a rejection of one of the two pillars of fusionism—which is tosay it is a rejection of fusionism itself. Howsupremely ironic that the people who flatter themselves defenders of tradition have abandoned the hard-won philosophical inheritance of the American political right. All this leaves unanswered aserious question: If a freesociety requires a moral populace, what is a committed fusionist in an unvirtuous age to do?Traditionalists have plenty of evidence that we are living insuch an age. American religiosity is in decline, withsignificantly fewer people attending weeklyservices (even before the coronavirus pandemic) than at any time in the last century. Addiction andsuicide are through the roof, likely driven by asense of alienation. Traditional teachings aboutsexual moralityseem laughably antiquated against the backdrop of modernity. The divorce rate is down, butso is the marriage rate, and hundreds of thousands of abortions are performed each year. Some libertarians are less bothered by these concerns. Many prefer to focus on the ways market-driven technological advances have vastly improved our quality of life. Others go further, arguing that widespread acceptance of a greater range of lifestyle choices make this the best time ever to be alive., this cohort mightsay,or at least misunderstood—and if you are reading this magazine, you may be inclined to agree. If people are using more drugs (see, for instance, the cover oft his month is issue) while having fewer children, that is fine and dandyso long as it is their choice. These libertarians are not fusionists, though they can and do happily work with their fusionist brethren when it comes to protecting rights and liberties in the governmentsphere. At thesame time, many libertarians uneasy aboutsecularism and community breakdown. As a churchgoing Roman Catholic, I certainly fall into this category—grieving thescourge of abortion,suffering under a culture that feels overlysexualized and excessively consumerist, and fretting that modern man has grown unwilling tosacrifice on behalf ofsomething bigger than himself. I am not the moststereotypical libertarian, but even within the liberty movement I am not alone. And on the wider political right,such fears are omnipresent. Faced with problems like these, the allure of desperate measures is perhaps understandable. One common justification for the post-liberal turn is that culture and institutions, once broken, cannot be expected to repair themselves. External help is needed. Thestate can provide it, through laws that constrain behavior but also teach the populace to value the correct things: faith and family, community and country. Alas, the lessons of history do not cease to be true just because they are inconvenient. You cannot impose virtue on people by force, and a coercive legal regime is no more likely in practice to instill good values than it is to make the underlying problems worse. For one thing, there is no guarantee that the people actually in power—now or in the future—will agree with you about what the correct values are (or about how much power is required to enforce them). But beyond that, public policies come with unintended consequences. Even assuming a legal code that perfectly aligns with the true demands of virtue, we can not know in advance what the effects will be. Perhaps citizens will absorb a bettersense of right and wrong. Or perhaps, freed from the need to make weighty decisions for themselves, their moral muscles will atrophy, rendering them less capable of pursuing the higher things in life. Before you guess which result is more likely, consider the impact that decades of well-intentioned welfare policy have had on poor communities. As the financial incentives for entrepreneurship and family formation evaporated, recipients of aid learned tosee themselves as lacking agency. Neighborly ingenuity, manifested through private charitable efforts and mutual aidsocieties, was crowded out by top-down government ""solutions"" thatsolve very little. Despite ever-increasingstate and federalspending, the official poverty rate has hardly budged, andsmall towns and rural counties increasingly join impoverished inner cities as economic disaster areas. All of whichsuggests that our best efforts have failed to address the causes of the problem and may have exacerbated them. The central insight of fusionism is that the common good is best achieved when thestatestays focused on protecting rights and liberties, leaving individuals and voluntary associations to do the rest. To be clear, there is nothing easy about that answer. The post-liberal temptation is to believe that government power can be asubstitute for the hard labor of institution building and cultural change. It is not. Thesolution must begin at home—on the front porch, around the kitchen table, and in the mirror. The law is not a magic wand. There are no magic wands, and there is noshortcut to the goodsociety.",1,1,Reason

Keith Leader’s lawyer, Robert Moran,strategically gave up his right to a preliminary hearing Thursday morning, paving the way for the case to be heard by a grand jury. (Leader was not present for his lawyer’s brief court appearance.)Waiving a preliminary hearing isstandard procedure in major felony cases because nothing related to trial can happen before an indictment. And it’s extremely rare forsomeone charged withsuch a major crime to plead guilty before indictment because there’s no chance to challenge the prosecution’s evidence. The only purpose for a preliminary hearing is to determine whether there was probable cause to arrest Leader and keep him jailed. That’s a much lower burden than finding him guilty of crimes beyond a reasonable doubt. In this case, Leader, 33, is facing two felonies: vehicular manslaughter and leaving thescene of a fatal crash in the 12:26 a.m. death ofMaida Brkanovic, 25. Under law, each of those crimes is punishable by up to 7 years in prison. If convicted at trial, a judge could add up those punishments atsentencing. The grand jury can also consider charges beyond what Leader was initially arrested on. Other charges often considered in fatal crash cases include manslaughter or, in the worst cases,second-degree murder (The drugged-up driver, Anthony Saccone, who killed three young people near Onondaga Community College in 2018, for example, was indicted on a murder charge. Helater pleaded guilty to lesser charges.)Brkanovic’s friendssay that the two had just met that evening in Syracuse.

211,"Justice Clarence Thomas: “From the Beginning, Abortion Was Promoted as a Means of Eugenics”",22.44,25.56,https://www.lifenews.com/2020/07/29/justice-clarence-thomas-from-the-beginning-abortion-was-promoted-as-a-means-of-eugenics/,https://adfontesmedia.com/life-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-29,22,"We’ve discussed many, many times how Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas has made a career out being ahead of the conformist-thinking crowd. However, it’s only been in the last year or three that his enormous influence has begun to be recognized. As we wrote last year, for example, “But now, after 28 yearssuddenly more perceptive observers are beginning to grasp that Justice Thomas has moved the High Court in his direction even as he has created astable of young conservatives who are found everywhere in the pro-life Trump Administration and in the federal courts.”Here’s another, quite current example of Thomas’ extraordinary insight and foresight. There’s ensued tremendous controversystemming from Planned Parenthood of Greater New York’s decision to remove the name of Margaret Sanger, PPFA’s “iconic” founder, from its Manhattan health clinic because of her ‘harmful connections to the eugenics movement. Reluctantly, at leastsome observers are recalling Justice Thomas’ prescient comments in Box vs Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky. In that 2019 decision, the Supreme Court voted to uphold one part of a 2016 Indiana abortion law while laying over for another day thesecond part—the portion of the law that prohibited “abortions donesolely for reasons of race,sex or disability—in other words, for eugenic reasons,” as William McGurn reminded us in a piece that ran yesterday in the Wall Street Journal. Justice Thomas took the occasion to write 7,000-word history of how “From the beginning, birth control and abortion were promoted as means of effectuating eugenics.”His reward for being w aaa y ahead of the curve?MercatorNet aptly observedMost journalists ignored it or ridiculed it. Mark Joseph Stern at Slatesaid that Thomas had attacked women who have abortions as “callous and monstrous child-killers” – aslander which Stern made up out of thin air. Charles P Pierce, at Esquire, wrote that Thomas had gone “bananas.” Garrett Eps, in The Atlantic,said that Thomas was part of “the far-right wing of African American conservatism.”Adam Liptak, at the New York Times, barely mentioned it. The full decision in Box vs Planned Parenthood of Indiana and Kentucky [Thomas’s concurrence begins on page 13] can be readhere. What follows are just a few highlights from his 20 page concurrence.*”This case highlights the fact that abortion is an act rife with the potential for eugenic manipulation. From the beginning, birth control and abortion were promoted as means of effectuating eugenics. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger was particularly open about the fact that birth control could be used for eugenic purposes. These arguments about the eugenic potential for birth control apply with even greater force to abortion, which can be used to targetspecific children with unwanted characteristics. Even after World War II, future Planned Parenthood President Alan Guttmacher and other abortion advocates endorsed abortion for eugenic reasons and promoted it as a means of controlling the population and improving its quality. As explained below, a growing body of evidencesuggests that eugenic goals are already being realized through abortion.”*“Eight decades after Sanger’s ‘Negro Project,’ abortion in the USs is also marked by a considerable racial disparity. The reported nationwide abortion ratio—the number of abortions per 1,000 live births—among black women is nearly 3.5 times the ratio for white women. And there are areas of New York City in which black children are more likely to be aborted than they are to be born alive—and are up to eight times more likely to be aborted than white children in thesame area. Whatever the reasons for these disparities, theysuggest that, insofar as abortion is viewed as a method of ‘family planning,’ black people do indeed ‘tak[e] the brunt of the ‘planning.’”*[This is crucial] “Enshrining a constitutional right to an abortion basedsolely on the race,sex, or disability of an unborn child, as Planned Parenthood advocates, would constitutionalize the views of the twentieth-century eugenics movement. In other contexts, the Court has been zealous in vindicating the rights of people even potentiallysubjected to race,sex, and disability discrimination. … Although the Court declines to wade into these issues today, we cannot avoid them forever. Having created the constitutional right to an abortion, this Court is duty bound to address itsscope. In that regard, it is easy to understand why the District Court and the Seventh Circuit looked to Casey [the 1992 Supreme Court decision] to resolve a question it did not address. Where else could they turn? The Constitution itself issilent on abortion.“Although the Court declines to wade into these issues today, we cannot avoid them forever.”Life is full of ironies. Planned Parenthood of Greater New York could not possibly dislike anything more than the prospect of frankly acknowledging the truth of what McGurn wrote on Monday: “Planned Parenthood disavows her ‘racist legacy’ but continues carrying it out.”",0,0,Life News

In the last week and a half, Texas Republicansmoved to block$8 billion worth of pandemic unemployment benefits for 1.3 million people just days after voting to extend a corporatesubsidy program that is enriching fossil fuel companies and has already cost thestate$10 billion. Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott announced the end of the federal unemployment benefits on Monday. With hisstate facing a6.9 percent unemployment rate, Abbottsaid he wants the government “helping unemployed Texans connect with the more than a million job openings, rather than paying unemployment benefits to remain off the employment rolls.”The move follows Abbott’s officespearheading the GOP’s fight against a $15 minimum wage,saying it “would put a boot on the neck ofsmall businesses.” Abbott alsopushedlegislationtoshield corporations from liability if their workers get COVID on the job. Nine days before Abbott publicly decried benefits for the jobless andsuggested Texans don’t need the help, his fellow Texas Republicans in thestate House advanced ab ill to extend thestate’sChapter 313 program, whichsubsidizes massive property tax breaks for corporations. Thesituation represents a big win for lobby groupssuch as the Texas Association of Business, which has beensimultaneously de mandingan end to aid for jobless workers and calling forth e preservation of Chapter 313’s giant taxpayer handouts to its corporate members. The latter is also a win for the fossil fuel industry, whose donors have poured more than$58 million into Texas elections in the last five years.“The lion’sshare of the program’s tax bounty —60 percent— goes to refineries, chemical plants, liquified natural gas facilities, and other fossil-fuel projects concentrated along the Gulf Coast,” the recently reported. “Oil and gas giants that have long bossed Texas, like Exxon Mobil, Chevron Phillips, Dow Chemical, and Enterprise Products Partners, have eachsaved hundreds of millions in property taxes thanks to Chapter 313.”The fossil fuel industry is not the only beneficiary of the program: Chapter 313 isslated to funnel tens of millions of dollars to Tesla, which is owned by the world’ssecond wealthiest man, Elon Musk. Proponents of the taxsubsidy program have argued that it creates jobs. But a recent investigation found that the program “now costs more than $1.1 million in tax breaks per new job” and reported that “by any metric, costs are rising — and there’s no telling how high they’ll go.” The newspaper also reported that “at least 30 companies failed to fulfill their job-creation promisessince 2019 but faced no repercussions.”Meanwhile, an analysis by University of Texas Austin professor Nate Jensen found that “85-90 percent of projects would have located in Texas without the 313 program and 80 percent of the program’s dollars are lost revenue for thestate’sschool financesystem.”The Republican legislation that just passed the Texas House extends the program to 2024 — at a projected cost of nearly $4 billion, according to are cent report from Texas’s Republican comptroller.

One is the academic way, in which every development is weighed andscrutinized and plugged into various models in a more or less genuine attempt to intuit what is happening in the chaotic complexsystem we call​“the economy.” This is what honest economists do, andsometimes they develop new theories that end up causing enormousshifts in global history, many years downstream. This is not the kind of economics we are talking about now, in2021. The other way of approaching economics is the political way, in which each new piece of economic data is hammered andsqueezed and molded into a form thatserves a preexisting political agenda. This is economics as an instrument toserve politics, not vice versa. This is, unfortunately, the way that most people experience​“the economy”: not assomething to be understood, but assomething to be eithersqueezed for all its worth, orsomething that issqueezing you for all you’re worth. Karl Marx and Adam Smith may have been honest economists in the first category, but most of their disciples in governments have been firmly in thesecond. It is important to understand this distinction when we discuss economics, lest the discussion go off in two different directions. While academic economists and journalists peer at the past year’s bizarre economic contortions — a historic collapse followed rapidly by a historic government-fueled rebound leading to an uncertain future — and conclude (honestly) that they don’t really know what’s happening, political actors are alreadysharpening their knives to go to war over what happens next. In terms of political economy, the question now is whether we are poised to enact a new New Deal — a huge increase in government-fundedsocialspending to finally try to turn the tide on inequality that has been building for more than40years — or whether we are instead poised toswing back towards austerity, a brutal budget-balancing to​“make up for” the largespending bills enacted during the past year’s lockdowns. Despite the fact that the trillions of dollars the governmentspent inseveral relief bills hassuccessfullystaved off what would have been another Great Depression (and has caused a boom in financial asset prices that is making rich people richer), the institutional preference of the Republican Party is, always, for austerity. The political case for austerity is going to be made no matter what. And inflation is going to be the primary tool used to make it. The honesty of this analysis is beside the point. Along with the contentions​“raising the minimum wage destroys jobs” and​“raising taxes hurts the economy” canards, a key part of the right wing economic gospel is that increasing governmentspending is bad because it leads to dangerous levels of inflation. Never mind the fact that right-wing economists have beensteadily predicting this outcomesince the recovery from the2008recession, and it has never come true. They will continue to predict it. Now, inflation is actually here. Never mind the fact that the Fed believes that inflation can be kept under control, and that more governmentspending is in order — all popular media coverage of inflation occurs in the frame of fear. A little evidence of inflation combined with a lot of fear of inflation will be the formula for turning inflation into a political weapon inservice of austerity. Youshould get ready to hear two primary messages. The first, with each passing month of inflation, will be:​“OUT OF CONTROL governmentspending is causing inflation that will EAT UP YOUR SAVINGS and cause prices to SPIRAL OUT OF CONTROL and we must immediately STOP all newspending and also CUT ENTITLEMENTS.” In this way, longstanding Republican priorities — namely, cutting governmentspending on everyone except the rich — will beshoehorned into a prescription for today’s (mostly imaginary) problems, without mentioning that the GOP was pushing thesame prescription a decade ago when the problems were the opposite. Thesecond message you will hear, which may be a bitsubtler, will be:​“This is caused by Modern Monetary Theory, a wacky theory that Democrats embrace, and all this inflation proves that the theory is a failure.” Politicalspeech is about caricatures. The caricature of MMT is:​“These fools think the government can print as much money as it wants with no consequences, but we all know that that will cause runaway inflation.” If you know a little about MMT, you may object to this characterization by understanding that, in fact, MMTspecifically focuses on inflation as thesignal to tell us how much the governmentspend. That doesn’t matter. It is too nuanced for the caricature, and in politics, the caricature can become far more important than the reality. What percentage of Republicans who holdstrong opinions on​“Critical Race Theory” do you think have actuallystudied critical race theory outside of the caricature? Exactly. It will only take ashift of asingleseat in the Senate and asmall handful ofseats in the House to make the idiotic Republican economic caricatures into the reigning economic orthodoxy of the USs Congress. At that point, the opportunity for transformative change is finished. And even if Republicans don’t manage to win back control of Congress in the midterms, there is the danger that the caricature becomes influential enough toscare Democrats back into the deficit-fearing hole where they havespent most of the past half century. Every last thing happening right now counselsstrong, fast action. Get the money out the door now or risk losing any chance at major debt-fueled governmentspending programs in the foreseeable future. That means the obliteration of any hope for turning around the rise in economic inequality, thesingle most damaging trend in America in my lifetime. Most Americans are economically illiterate. This is not an insult to them. It is just an observation of fact, and the completely predictable outcome of our nation’s unwillingness to engage in any widespread form of economic education that is notsoaked in free market jingoism. For political purposes, nobody knows what MMT is. But they do know enough to fear inflation, because inflation makesstuff cost more, and nobody likes that. Therefore the weapon i zed rhetorical power of inflation will tend to overwhelm whatever it is being deployed against. And we know that it will be deployed with full force against the possibility that the American welfarestate could be permanently expanded. That always makes rich peoplescared that they’ll have higher taxes, and therefore they will wage war against it. We are now in a race to give people new government benefits before they get tricked out of wanting them. Every month that inflation ticks up, the lies will get louder, and the task will get harder.

That’s the bottom line,”shesaid, acknowledging odds areslim Mayor Lori Lightfoot would pull the plug on the lucrative attraction.“It’s about harm reduction. You have to make the decision for yourself. These cases that happen because of Lolla aren’t likely to be a huge drag on the health caresystem. But will wesee a bump? Yes, and Delta will probably make it higher,” Landonsaid.“A bunch of people are going to get COVID at Lolla, but a lot of people are getting it from other places now, too.”Fans attend Day 2 of Lollapalooza in Grant Park in 2019. They’re getting it across thestate, especially in downstate counties with lower vaccination rates. Casesstarted rising a few weeks after thestate fully reopened June 11. Nearly 8,000 Illinoisans tested positive over the past week alone, an average of 1,140 new cases every day. Thestate was logging just 294 cases per day at thestart of the month, and 238 per day in mid-June. Since then, the averagestatewide case positivity rate has increased fivefold, from a pandemic low of 0.6% up to 3.3% — the highest it’s beensince the first week of May Hospitals were treating 670 coronavirus patients Thursday night, the most they’veseensince early June.

State public health officials on Fridaysingled out 25 of thestate’s 102 counties for being at a coronavirus warning level. DuPage is the first Chicago-area county to land on that list inseveral months, due to an increase in hospital visits for COVID-likesymptoms. Most of the other warning-level counties are in central andsouthern Illinois, where vaccination rates aresometimes less than half thestatewide rate. About 72% of all Illinoisans have gotten ashot, with about 56% fully vaccinated. Counties marked orange are considered at a COVID-19 warning level. Even though Lollapalooza takes place in the heart of Chicago, it could have a devastating impact on far-flung areas,said Landon, who urged attendees to “assume you’ve been exposed” and get tested afterward.“It can amplify thespread in areas with low vaccination rates. The people who go home tosomesouthsuburbs, to central Illinois, to Missouri — they’re going toset off little wildfires,”shesaid. But as far as personal risk, Lollapalooza “can be donesafely,” according to Dr. Vishnu Chundi, chairman of the Chicago Medical Society’s COVID-19 Task Force.“Outdoors is thesafest place you can do it,” Chundisaid. “If you’re vaccinated, you’resafe. If you’re vaccinated and masked, you’re reallysafe. If you’re not vaccinated and not masked, you’re notsafe.”Attendees at the four-day music festival, which opens Thursday, have toshow proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test from within three days of entrance, according to Lollapalooza. Anyone who is unvaccinated will be required to wear a mask while attending the event. And even those who got theshot are urged to consider masking up. Chundisaid the check-in process could actually result in more transmission than other parts of the fest.“The bathrooms themselves are porta-potties, the vendors, they’re open-air — that all is basically OK It’s getting huge crowds of people in and then getting them out of these choke points that causes concern,” hesaid. Thousands of music fans arrive in Grant Park for the first day of Lollapalooza in 2019. Still, Chundisaid the likelihood of Lollapalooza turning into asuper-spreader event “is very low.” He expects cases to keep rising in theshort term no matter what.“You’ve got 30,000 people going to Sox games, Cubs games andsoon Bears games. In the US, we’ve decided the decision about getting vaccinated is your personal responsibility and your right. That’s getting us intosome trouble,” Chundisaid.“If we could get everyone to just mandate vaccination, we could get out of this whole mess. But that needs to happen at a national level. … It’s not rocketscience. Everyone knows how this works by now.”",2,2,Chicago Sun-Times
216,Was the Bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki the Mother of All War Crimes?,10.25,34.5,https://www.fairobserver.com/more/international_security/hans-georg-hiroshima-nagasaki-dresden-hamburg-bombing-war-crimes-history-news-15001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-observer-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-11,21,"This year marks the 75thanniversary of the nuclear bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. This is reason enough to mull over its meaning and its implications. In a recent article for Fair Observer, Peter Isackson has made astrong case that the annihilation of the two Japanese cities by American bombers represents the “mother of all war crimes.” Given the long history of atrocities committed during times of war, I find this a rather boldstatement thatshould not go unchallenged. The case for the defense rests on two claims. First, the demonstration of American nuclear capabilities heralded in a period ofstability, which quite likelysaved Western Europe’s nations from being overrun and conquered by the Soviet Union andsubjected to its rule. Second, Hiroshima and Nagasaki are far from exceptional as war crimes go, if indeed the bombing of the two cities was a war crime at all. In my younger years, in a very different world, Iserved for a couple of years in the German air force. I never flew a plane. Ispent most of my time on duty in a tower close to the border to what at the time was the Czechoslovakian Socialist Republic (CSSR), a member of the Warsaw Pact and asatellite of the Soviet Union. We did electronicsurveyance of the CSSR airspace, following Czech and Slovakian fighter planes as they performed their exercises as best as they could (more often than not they couldn’t, lacking basic motivation). It was a tedious job, boring as hell, particularly when the weather was bad and the pilots were grounded. Excitement, however,surged once a month, when we waited for the arrival of Russian long-range bombers. They took off from Minsk in what at the time was the capital of the Belarusian Soviet Socialist Republic. Their mission: attack the towers along the West German border with the CSSR and the German Democratic Republic. Wesaw them coming,small dots on our radarscreens. When they were in front of our tower, there was asmall red blip, a fleeting flicker, and we knew if this had been— an actual real-life attack — we would all be dead, gone up insmoke in asmall nuclear mushroom. At the time, we did not think much of what had just happened. It was part of a game, along the lines of MAD magazine’s “Spy vs Spy” — inane, a waste of time, andsomehow not very real. It was not until the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the regime in Prague and the unraveling of the Soviet empire that we learned that the game had been much moreserious and potentially deadly than what wesuspected. There were plans on the otherside of the border to overrun West Germany, conquer Western Europe andsubject it to Soviet rule. Among thescenarios was a nuclear attack on Bonn, West Germany’ssleepy capital, designed to decapitate West Germany’s political elite. What prevented the Soviets and their toadies from carrying out their plans was not human compassion but a realist assessment of the distribution of military forces and the resolve of the Western allies to use them. At the time, this was called MAD — mutually assured destruction. It was grounded in the notion that any attack on the part of the Soviets would immediately trigger a full response of Western nuclear forces, resulting in the complete annihilation of the Soviet Union. The leadership in Moscow was fully aware of this logic. They did not like this “balance of terror,” but they ultimatelysubmitted to its logic. Others, by the way, did not. Andrey Gromyko, the Soviet Union’s long-term foreign minister,claimsin his memoirs that at one time, Chinese leader Mao Zedong tried to get the Soviet Union to launch a nuclear attack on the USs, arguing that “his country couldsurvive a nuclear war, even if it lost 300 million people, and finish off the capitalists with conventional weapons,” thus guaranteeing the triumph of communism. Unsurprisingly, the Soviets were not convinced and increasingly distanced themselves from Beijing. The logic of mutually assured destruction fundamentally altered the behavior of great powers, at least with respect to each other. It is to be hoped that the logic of the “balance of terror” is going to be enough to keep the US and China level-headed in the future, despite rapidly growing tensions between the two. Unfortunately enough, war crimes are the norm rather than the exception when it comes to armed conflict. The claim that Hiroshima and Nagasaki are ontologically different rests on a technological assumption. Forsome reason, nuclear weapons are fundamentally different from conventional ones. I am notsure what constitutes the basis of this assumption. Take the fire bombings of the German cities ofDresden and Hamburgduring the Second World War, which cost the lives of tens of thousands of ordinary people — women, children, the elderly. Take the massacre ofBabi Yar, in Ukraine, where in two days nearly 34,000 Jews were killed by German. Or, going back further in history, take the death toll during the Thirty Years War, which cost the lives of half of the population of what is today Germany. Massacres of the most atrocious form are hardly an invention of the 20thcentury, as Goya’s renditions of the barbarities visited on his fellow countrymen during the war against the French between 1808 and 1814, depicted in most horrifying detail. This was a war against an enemy that invaded the country in the name of the Enlightenment and revolutionary fervor. Or, as the Germans wouldsay,— If you don’t want to be my brother, I willsmash yourskull. For the victims of war crimes — more often than not civilians — it probably does not really matter how they were killed and why they were killed. It is quite understandable — human all too human, as Nietzsche wouldsay — that horrendous deeds provoke retribution. The firebombing of German cities, the rape of German women caught be advancing Soviet armies — both are understandable given the atrocities committed by Germans during the war, in the name of Hitler and the Third Reich. Most Germans, orso most recent researchsuggests, were more than comfortablesupporting a regime that guaranteed them a modicum of prosperity. Few asked where it came from. For that, Germans were punished in the most horrendous fashion. Berlin, Hamburg, Dresden and Cologne and many other towns and cities went up in flames, leaving behind a landscape hardly different from Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The bombing of Hamburg was named Operation Gomorrah, after the Biblical city destroyed by “sulfur and fire” for itssins, and,accordingto historian Keith Lowe, was on completely different level than the German raids on Coventry and London, “comparable with what happened in Nagasaki.” It was a just retribution for the crimes committed in their name, a retribution for the tens of millions of victims who paid with their lives for Hitler’s ambitions to conquer the world. I wouldsuggest that the annihilation of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was the retribution for the crimes committed by Japanese forces, in the name of racialsuperiority hardly different from Nazi ideology, against the peoplessubjugated during the war. I have grave doubts that the victims of the Nanjing massacre or of the hundreds of young Asian “comfort women” pressed intosexualslavery by Japanese forces would consider the destruction of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a war crime, but rather than an act of just retribution for Japanese atrocities committed during the war. Whether or not the USs was justified in meting out redistribution is a different question. After all, given America’sself-declaredstatus as a leading Christian nation, itshould perhaps have heeded the words of the Bible exhorting believers not to take revenge, “but leave room for God’s wrath, for it is written: ‘It is mine to avenge; I will repay,’says the Lord” (Romans 12:19). But then, Americans have a tendency to pay lipservice to thescripture while doing the opposite in real life. The bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was one of these turning points in history that define a whole epoch. It demonstrated, once and for all, humanity’s ability to destroy itself. Had Hitler been in a position to get hold of “the bomb,” hesurely would have used it to obliterate London, Moscow, perhaps even New York. Thesame goes for Stalin, only this time it would have been Berlin that would have gone up in a mushroom. If the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki was a war crime, it was nothing more than another episode in a long history of atrocities committed in the course of wars, not more, not less — an episode which reaffirms once again thesad reality that the veneer of civilization is merelyskin deep.

217,"As Herschel Walker eyes Senate run, a turbulent past emerges",-2.67,43.33,https://apnews.com/article/lifestyle-sports-nfl-college-football-coronavirus-pandemic-5e2875eec11e93f9a3bf1fc859137ff8,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"ATLANTA (AP) — At first glance, Herschel Walker has a coveted political profile for a potential Senate candidate in Georgia. He was a football hero at the University of Georgia before his long NFL career. He’s a business owner whose chicken products are distributed across the US And he’s a Black conservative with backing from former President Donald Trump, a longtime friend. But an Associated Press review of hundreds of pages of public records tied to Walker’s business ventures and his divorce, including many not previously reported,sheds new light on a turbulent personal history that could dog his Senate bid. The documents detail accusations that Walker repeatedly threatened his ex-wife’s life, exaggerated claims of financialsuccess and alarmed business associates with unpredictable behavior. Walker, now 59, has at times been open about his longstruggle with mental illness, writing at length in a 2008 book about being diagnosed with dissociative identity disorder, once known as multiple personality disorder. But it’s unclear how he would discuss these events as a candidate. Walker did not respond to requests for comment. Multiple em ails went unanswered, although his executive assistant confirmed they were received. AP alsosent em ails and left a message with his long-time attorney, who did not respond. The Georgiaseat is a top target for Republicans as they try to take control of the US Senate in next year’s midterm elections. Walker’s potential bid is a wildcard. He might easily win the GOP primary with Trump’s help,setting up a general election fight against Democrat Raphael Warnock, who became Georgia’s first Blacksenator after aspecial election in January. But Republican leaders in Washington and Georgia are concerned that Walker’s history might haunt his campaign. Walker “certainly could bring a lot of things to the table,” Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a Republican,said in a recent interview. “But as others have mentioned, there’s also a lot of questions out there.”Walker has yet to announce his intentions, but he has been consulting with political advisers in Georgia. A native of tiny Wrightsville, between Atlanta and Savannah, the former Dallas Cowboysstar retired after the 1997season and now resides in Texas. In a video posted to Twitter last month, he revs the engine of asports car andsays, “I’m getting ready, and we can run with the big dogs,” before revealing a Georgia license plate. The Twitter tease intensified buzz about the potential for a celebrity candidate. But it also helpedsurface details about Walker’s troubled past, many first disclosed by Walker himself in his 2008 book, “Breaking Free.”His account details years ofstruggles and an eventual diagnosis in 2001. Walker describes himself dealing with as many as a dozen personalities — or “alters” — that he had constructed as a defense against bullying hesuffered as astuttering, overweight child. In an AP interview at the time, Walker emphasized his purpose was to help others withsimilar disorders. “Peoplesay, ‘Herschel is just trying to writesomething to make money,’” hesaid. “Isay, ‘Guys, why would I writesomething like this to make money?’”The National Alliance on Mental Illness describes dissociative identity disorder as “alternating between multiple identities,” leaving a person with “gaps in memory of everyday events.” It notes men with the disorder “exhibit more violent behavior rather than amnesia.”In his book, Walker acknowledges violent urges. He writes that he played Russian roulette and recountssitting at his kitchen table in 1991 pointing a gun, loaded with asingle bullet, at his head. “I wasn’tsuicidal,” Walker explained, but “just looked at mortality as the ultimate challenge.”The book is framed as a turnaroundstory. He describes it as cathartic and casts himself assomeone on the path to “integration” because of therapy and his Christian faith. A watershed moment, he writes, came in February 2001, when he drove aroundsuburban Dallas, hunting for a man who hesaid was avoiding his calls after being days late delivering a car Walker had purchased.“The logicalside of me knew that what I was thinking of doing to this man — murdering him for messing up myschedule — wasn’t a viable alternative,” Walker wrote. “But anotherside of me wasso angry that all I could think was howsatisfying it would feel tostep out of the car, pull out the gun,slip off thesafety, andsqueeze the trigger.”Ultimately, Walker wrote, he had a change of heart afterseeing a “SMILE. JESUS LOVES YOU” bumpersticker on the man’s car-hauling truck. He decided toseek professional help.“I’d been running for most of life, from what only I really knew butseldom talked about. It was time tostop running and facesome harsh realities,” he wrote. Walker’s threatening behavior continued well after the 2001 revelation, according to court records obtained by AP that have not previously been reported. Four years later, in December 2005, Cindy Grossman, Walker’s ex-wife,secured a protective order against him, alleging violent and controlling behavior. Grossman hassaidshe was long a victim of Walker’s impulses. When his book was released,she told ABC News that at one point during their marriage, her husband pointed a pistol at her head andsaid, “I’m going to blow your f’ing brains out.” She filed for divorce in 2001, citing “physically abusive and extremely threatening behavior.”Inseeking protection from a judge in Dallas County, Grossman filed an affidavit from hersister, which described Walker as unwilling to accept that his former wife had begun dating another man. Grossman told the courtshe got calls during that period from hersister and father, both of whom had been contacted by Walker. He told family members that he would kill her and her new boyfriend, according to Maria Tsettos, Cindy Grossman’ssister. In an affidavit, Tsettos claimed Walker once called looking for his ex-wife whileshe was out with her boyfriend. Tsettos took the call andsaid Walker became “very threatening” when told of Grossman’s whereabouts. In Tsettos’ recollection, Walker “stated unequivocally that he was going toshoot mysister Cindy and her boyfriend in the head.”On another occasion, Tsettossaidshe talked to Walker “at length” after he’d reached out to her online. He “expressed to me that he was frustrated with (Cindy) and that he felt like he had ‘had enough’ and that he wanted to ‘blow their f------ heads off,’”she recalled of the December 9, 2005, exchange. Two days later he called again and told Tsettos that he possessed a gun and planned that day to act on his threats, which he repeated in graphic language,shesaid. Later that day, Walker confronted his ex-wife outside a mall whenshe was picking up theirson from a party, according to her petition for a protective order. In her account,shesaid Walker “slowly drove by in his vehicle, pointed his finger at (her) and traced (her) with his finger as he drove.”When officers in Irving, Texas, contacted Walker, he denied that he’d made the threats, according to a police report the AP obtained through a public records request. But thesister’s account was concerning enough to police that they took for “safe keeping” a gun Walker had on the floor of his car, the reportstates. A judge agreed, finding “good cause” to issue a protective order. He also barred Walker from possessing guns for a period of time. Grossman, her divorce lawyer and Tsettos did not respond to multiple requests for comment from the AP Walker’s unpredictable behavior has carried into his chicken business, now known as Renaissance Man Food Services, according to court filings. His book itself was ashock. The primary distributor of his products consideredsevering their relationship after Walker’s book came out. Kristin Caffey, then a poultry manager for the food distributor Sysco,said the revelations in the book, as well as Walker’s effort to publicize it, created “havoc” for the company.“We weren’t aware that it was coming out, and we were blindsided,” Caffey, who worked directly with Walker,said in a 2019 deposition. “We had all kinds of people calling in about it, and we didn’t have answers to it,”she added,saying, “it was problematic for us being engaged with him at the time.”Ultimately, the company chose tostick with Walker after the negative publicity died down, Caffeysaid. More recently, Walker has made outsize claims about his business record. In repeated media interviews, Walker claimed his company employed hundreds of people, included a chicken processing division in Arkansas and grossed $70 million to $80 million annually insales. However, when the company applied for a federal Paycheck Protection Program loan last year, it reported just eight employees. (It received about $182,000 in COVID-19 aid.)In a recent court case, Walker gave far more modest revenue figures, indicating that the company averaged about $1.5 million a year in profit from 2008 to 2017. Meanwhile, Walker’s business associates testified in thesame case that he doesn’t own chicken processing plants, as he claims. Instead, they described him as a licensing partner who lends his name to the enterprise — not unlike the kind of deals his friend Donald Trump has used to expand his brand for decades. A wrongful termination lawsuit filed in 2018 by a friend and former manager of Walker’s company created an extensive record of Walker’s leadership. Although a judge ruled against the employee, John Staples, emails, documents and depositions in the case present Walker as a temperamental and unreliable business partner. Walker persistently complained that his business partners were trying to cheat him out of money, the documentssay. And they indicate he repeatedly fought with his associates over his focus on branching into frozen waffles, which he believed would be a future moneymaker for the company. In 2017, an executive for the company thatsupplied chicken to Walkersent a concerned email, inquiring about $7,200 in expenses hesaid Walker had incorrectly tried to bill the company from his efforts tosecure the waffle deal. The executive, now Simmons Foods Chief Operating Officer and President David Jackson, also cited “concerning comments” he’d heard that “raise questions about how the business is being operated.” The email does not detail the comments that raised alarms. Staples did not respond to requests for comment. Jackson’s office did not make him available for comment, and a message left with aspokesperson for Simmons Foods was not returned. In a deposition, Walker dismissed Staples as a “puppy.”“I’m a big dog. I don’t play with puppies,” Walkersaid. Since then, another business venture tied to Walker could also face trouble. Last month, a Texas banksued Walker and another business partner over an unpaid $200,000 debtsecured to help finance a pizza restaurant. According to court filings, Walker personally guaranteed the loan. Walker has not yet filed his response to thesuit. Slodysko reported from Washington; Bleiberg reported from Dallas.",1,2,AP

220,"How Hurricane Ida’s path, climate change, and Covid-19 made the Gulf vulnerable",-8.33,42.67,https://www.vox.com/22648189/hurricane-ida-new-orleans-louisiana-flood-climate-change-covid,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-30,25,"Hurricane Idamade landfall in Louisiana on Sunday, the 16th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, as an enormousCategory 4storm withsustained winds of 150 miles per hour and gustsup to 172 mph. Thestorm tore roofs off buildings, flooded homes, and left the entire city ofNew Orleans in the dark. Ida will likely be one of the worst extreme weather events of 2021, a year alreadyswelling with heat waves, wildfires, droughts, andstorms. “Hurricane Ida is one of thestrongeststorms to ever hit Louisiana,” Governor John Bel Edwardssaid in astatement on Sunday. Thestorm isstill churning and turning east through Mississippi. Though Ida has been downgraded to a tropicalstorm, more devastation is likely instore. The nation will learn more about local impacts as communities regain access to electricity andspotty communications. Even after the winds die down, the toweringstormsurge will likely linger for days and impede rescue and recovery efforts. So will the coronavirus pandemic: Less than half of Louisiana’s population is vaccinated, and 2,600 patients were hospitalized for Covid-19 as Ida made landfall. Thesize and uncanny timing of Hurricane Ida makes it impossible to avoid comparisons to Hurricane Katrina, the 2005storm that killed at least 1,170 people and tied 2017’s Hurricane Harvey as the costliest disaster in US history. While levees appear to have protected much of thestate from Katrina-level floodingso far,somesimilarities are likely to emerge: Structural inequities and vulnerabilities remain, and communities of color arestill at high risk from hurricanes like this. But much of Katrina’s toll in humansuffering and devastation became visible in the days and weeks after thestorm, in part due to a botched relief effort. It will take time to figure out whether Louisiana, the city of New Orleans, and the US as a whole learned the lessons of Katrina in advance of Ida. Related“People think of a few common themes when they think about hurricanes in New Orleans,” including levees and the legacy of Hurricane Katrina, Lamar Gardere, executive director of the Louisiana nonprofit the Data Center, wrote to Vox on Sunday,shortly after evacuating the city. “But every hurricane boils down to astory about infrastructure, inequity, and climate change/coastal land loss.”“These are thesamestories that affect much of our country, but they come into acute focus with immediate and dramatic effect during these events,” Gardere added. Cities along the Gulf Coast havespent billions over the past decade and a half building up their defenses — levees,sea wall, flood control mechanisms. But populations have grown, the oceans have risen, and the planet has warmed. The threat of extreme weather is growing, and it’s becoming harder to adapt. Millions of people live in the US Gulf Coast, which is one of the country’s fastest-growing regions andstretches across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, and Florida. Between 2000 and 2016, the population in the region grew by 25.4 percent, compared to 14.8 percent across the US as a whole. That in turn has fueled a construction boom of homes, businesses, infrastructure, and industrial facilities, particularly for the oil and gassector. Ida made landfall near Port Fourchon, an oil and gas hub that experiencedsome of thestorm’s most extreme winds andstormsurges. Much of the new construction is in low-lying areas prone to coastal inundation, withsome places lying belowsea level. Parts of theGulf Coast aresinking as thesoft groundsettles beneath heavy construction and changes in land use, a phenomenon known assubsidence. The coastline itself, which canserve as a barrier againststorms, iswearing awa yas risingseas erode theshore. Changes to waterways like the Mississippi River have also diminished vitalsources ofsediments for replenishing the coast. All this means that lots of people and property are in harm’s way when disasters occur. And Ida took an especially destructive course through major population centers. The risks, however, are not distributed equally. Many lower-income communities and those populated by people of color have less protective infrastructure like levees andsea walls, leaving them vulnerable tostorms and rising water. The people in these communities also often have the most difficulty getting out of the path of thestorm as theystruggle to find adequate money andshelter to evacuate. In May, the NOAA forecasted that the US Atlantic hurricaneseason, which runs from late May until the end of November, had a 60 percent chance of being “above normal.”So far, that prediction has come to pass. “After a record-settingstart, the 2021 Atlantic hurricaneseason does notshow anysigns of relenting as it enters the peak months ahead,”said Rick Spinrad, NOAA administrator, in anAuguststatement. This year’sseason is below the record-breakingseason last year, which was the busiest on record. But there areseveral factors this year that are fueling a more active year for tropical cyclones. Ordinarily, a key factor isseasurface temperature. Hurricanes need water to be at least 26 degrees Celsius, or 79 degrees Fahrenheit, and the warmer water gets, the more energy is available to formstorms. Water temperatures in the Gulfspiked ahead of Hurricane Ida, butseasurface temperatures in the North Atlantic this year have generally been near average levels. Still, forecasters are anticipating astrongerWest African monsoon, which helps birth hurricanes. Meteorologists are also expecting less vertical windshear in the atmosphere, which are changes in windspeed and direction that can rip apart hurricanes before they form. Another factor that favors more active hurricaneseasons: Since 1995, the Atlantic Ocean has been in the warm phase of a decades-long ebb and flow in ocean temperatures, known as the Atlantic Multi-Decadal Oscillation. The planet is warming due to emissions of greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels. That amplifies the raw ingredients of hurricanes and can worsenstorms. While researchers arestill parsing the climatesignals in Hurricane Ida,scientists have known for decades that climate change worsens hurricanes forseveral reasons. Seasurface temperatures are rising, which infusesstorms with more energy and can increase their intensity.“As the climate warms, we expect that the upper bound of how intense a hurricane can get ... goes up at a certain rate with warming and that’s been known for 33 years,” Kerry Emanuel, a professor of atmosphericscience at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, told Vox last year. Another way climate change makes hurricanes more destructive is by increasing their rainfall. Airsoaks up about 7 percent more water for every degree Celsius the air warms,so warmer air means more moisture is available for precipitation. Extreme rainfall events are on the rise, and Ida drenched parts of Louisiana with as much as24 inches of rain. Risingsea levels due to the melting of ice caps and the thermal expansion of water are leading to largerstormsurges, too. This coastal flooding, driven by astorm’s winds pushing water inland, is often the deadliest and most destructive element of hurricanes. Ida created astormsurge as high as16 feet. Climate change is also causing the rapid intensification of more hurricanes. NOAA defines rapid intensification as a gain of 35 mph or more in windspeed over 24 hours. Idastrengthened from category 2strength (with winds up to 110 miles per hour) to category 4strength (with winds topping 150 mph) in less than a day. Hurricanes tend to rapidly intensify when they pass over a patch of water that is warm, deep, and calm. These changes in windspeed can make the difference between a buildingsurviving a hurricane and being obliterated by it. Experts have been warning for more than a year that a hurricanestriking during a pandemic would pose unique challenges, and health officials are worried more difficulties may arise in the wake of Hurricane Ida.“We’re having asituation where even when you’restretched to the limit — tosuperimpose upon it what will likely be a historic weather environmental catastrophe — is going to do nothing but make things much, much worse,” Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, toldCNN on Sunday. Hospitals are contending with power outages, and many are unable to relocate their patients because other medical facilities in the region are already full of Covid-19 patients. For evacuees inshelters, it’s proving hard to maintainsocial distance. The risk of further transmission is high, given relatively low vaccination rates across the Gulf Coast and thespread of the more-transmissible delta variant. Hurricane Katrina took a devastating toll on communities of color, and advocates fear these communities will againsuffersome of the worst impacts of Hurricane Ida. Indigenous communities in the bayou have been hit by catastrophic flooding,said Donny Verdin, a member of the tribal council of the United Houma Nation. “We have people whostayed behind whose houses were flooding and roofs were blown off as they were in them,” Verdin, who evacuated to Texas on Saturday, told Vox on Monday. The United Houma Nation is typically overlooked by federal relief, Verdinsaid, because it’s not a federally recognized tribe. In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, hesaid, his community relied on donations and nonprofit organizations instead ofsupport from the federal government. “We’re just left to fend for ourselves,” hesaid. “The community usually pulls together and we build back. It’s what we’ve done forever.”Storms andsea-level rise fueled by climate change have been pushing tribes further inland, away from their traditional territories. The majority of Verdin’s community used to live right on the coast: “We are people of the water,” hesaid. After Katrina, three-quarters of them moved inland, Verdin told Vox.“The community is not as close as it once was because people are morescattered,” hesaid. “The best-casescenario is that we are able to relocate our communities. The worst-casescenario is that they wash away.”Relocating communities who have lived in coastal Louisiana for generations comes at asteep cost. “Our access to the natural resources and foodsecurity has been everything for oursovereignty,”said Monique Verdin (no direct relation to Donny Verdin), another member of the United Houma Nation who works with the community group Another Gulf is Possible. “When you take the people away from the bayou you’re literally taking them away from their ability to feed themselves.” Plus, at the end of the day,she told Vox, “you can’t run from climate change.”It’s hard not to draw ties between Hurricane Ida and Hurricane Katrina, one of the most expensivestorms in US history. Thestorms landed on thesame day of the year and in roughly thesamespot. They hadsimilar windspeeds. They even gainedstrength by passing over asimilar patch of warm ocean water in the Gulf that fuels hurricanes,the AP reported. There aresome important differences in thestorms themselves — Ida caused a weakerstormsurge but hadstronger winds, for example. But even if all things were considered equal, Ida is likely to be far less devastating than the 2005storm. Katrina was destructive in part because ofstructural issues with the region’ssystem of levees — many of which failed — and a botched government response to the crisis, as Vox’s German Lopezpreviously reported. Here’s how Lopez put it:The government response wasso wildly incompetent that it allowed the worst of the catastrophe to continue andsometimes created entirely new, unnecessary problems. People will always have to deal with unavoidable natural disasters, but a poor government reaction and preparation can lead to many more deaths and untold costs. The US government also failed to evacuate tens of thousands of people who couldn’t afford to leave Louisiana before thestorm hit, Lopez reported. The leveesystem is muchstronger today, after a $14.5 billion investment instorm protection authorized by Congress in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. The Army Corps of Engineers hassince constructed hundreds of miles of levees around New Orleans,Reuters reported,some of which are30 feet tall. They appear to be working, with only asmall number of levee failures reported outside of the city. The governors aid on Mondaythat thestate’sstorm protectionsystem performed “extremely well,” afterstating earlier that they were “built for this moment.” (His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)The details of Hurricane Ida’s devastation will trickle out for days to come, as officialssurvey the damage and conductsearch-and-rescue operations. “I fully expect [the] death count will go up considerably throughout the day,” the governor told MSNBC on Monday. And if past hurricanes are any guide, the government’s ongoing response to thestorm — including its long-term follow-through — willshape the region’s recovery and its resilience to future hurricanes. There will be morestorms, and in a warming world, they’ll get worse. At Vox, we believe that clarity is power, and that powershouldn’t only be available to those who can afford to pay.

Very few people on the planet need no introduction. Even fewer are known by just their first name. But that is him: ""Rush.""Despite Rush is advanced cancer, the left and mainstream media can do nothing but continue toslam the man, even when he is down. Many have been downright cruel at timessince his breaking health news.

Even former vice president and 2020 presidential candidate Joe Bidenjoined the march to degrade, demean and deride the radio giant when Bidensaid from the campaign trail: ""Rush Limbaughspent his entire time on the air dividing people, belittling people, talking about blacks in ways that … anyways.""11 things desperate Dems are willing to do to beat TrumpReally? That is how Biden wouldsummarize Rush is proliferating contributions and impact onsociety?Then Biden finished bysaying, ""I do not think he understands the American code of decency and honor."" That coming from a politician who just denigrated a broadcasting mogul who has 10 times his popularity and influence and has just been diagnosed with advanced lung cancer? Is that Biden is idea of an ""American code of decency and honor""?Advertisement -story continues belowTrue decency and honor were demonstrated in the fitting tribute President Trump and first lady Melania Trump gifted Rush at his State of the Unionspeech this past week by awarding him with the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom, or PMF For those who do not know, the PMF is awarded to those who have ""made exceptional contributions to thesecurity or national interests of America, to world peace, or to cultural or othersignificant public or private endeavors,"" according to the White House website. According toBusiness Insider,Trump has awarded 14 other PMFs, including to Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Babe Ruth and Tiger Woods. It is fascinating to note that, in 2017, Joe Biden himself was awarded the PMFby former President Barack Obama. Obama lauded Biden as ""the best vice president America is ever had"" and a ""lion of American history."" So, Biden is worthy yet Rush unworthy to receive the PMF?Republican lawmakers declared their answer to that question by giving Rush astanding ovation while Democratic lawmakers remainedseated andstunned as if Trump just awarded the Medal of Freedom to an ISIS imam. Again, how tacky would those Democrats' reactions be to any PMF recipient, let alone a ginormous American patriot like Rush?Advertisement -story continues belowIn his State of the Unionspeech, the president described Rush as ""aspecial man, beloved by millions of Americans … the greatest fighter and winner that you will ever meet."" (I would increase that number to hundreds of millions of Americanssince making history by launching his national radioshow on August 1, 1988, when he pioneered political talk radio on AM channels.)Rush has inspired the full gamut of Americans for over 30 years, including millennia ls (A must read is Nicole Russell is article at the Federalist:""How Rush Limbaugh Made Millennials Like Me Conservative."") His daily radioshow averages a listening audience of 27 million people. Regarding Rush is landmark pioneering in radio broadcasting, theWashington Postexplained:Limbaugh remade all the rules of talk radio. Before him, the norm in talk radio, in the major markets where it existed, was local hosts who rarely aired their views, and whose programs centered around interviews and interesting callers, on a full range of topics. Limbaugh changed that, demonstrating that a market existed for edgy, boundary pushing, nationallysyndicated talk that centered around the host is opinion. Advertisement -story continues belowWithin a few years Limbaugh hadshot tosuperstardom, broadcasting on hundreds ofstations and reaching millions of listeners per week. Restaurants even launched ""Rush rooms"" in the early 1990s, where people could come eat lunch and hear their favoriteshow. Limbaugh issuccess catalyzed aseries of decisions by radio executives that, over the next decade, not only led to an explosion of talk radio, but conservative radio, with most talkstations broadcasting all conservative, mostlysyndicated, political talk formats by the early 2000s. …This modelsoon expanded to television, as it directlyshaped Fox News. By the late 2000s, it also extended to conservative digitalsites like Red State, Breitbart and Townhall, which would explode in number in the 2010s. Speaking of Fox News, Gena and I first met Rush at the home of Roger Ailes, the former CEO for Fox News. In person, Rush is down to earth and a no-nonsense type of guy who you can not help but love and like. Just asingle minute after beginning to converse with him you are convinced that this man cares for you and everyone else in addition to the fact that he is a genius. He might flare withshowmanship on air, but let there be no doubt he has and does contribute more to the preservation of the American republic than just about anyone.

Even more, we also join his beloved wife,Kathryn,and millions across this country in praying that God is hand would work through medical technology and advances to heal Rush. Rush, if you are reading this, Gena and I have always been and will always be your fans. Thanks for always fighting the good fight of faith as well as truth, justice and the American way.

222,Bill to Subsidize Sustainable Agriculture Is a “Prime Contender” for Reconciliation Package,-3.33,42.33,https://theintercept.com/2021/07/21/agriculture-carbon-credit-markets-reconciliation/,https://adfontesmedia.com/intercept-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-21,25,"A bipartisan measure to boost carbon credit markets is a “prime contender” to be in the Democrats’ $3.5 trillion reconciliation package, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-RI, told The Intercept. But its inclusion in thesimple-majority process would put Senate Budget Committee Chair Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and other critics in the awkward position ofsupporting a bill they already voted against. The Growing Climate Solutions Act, or S. 1251, aims to help farmers and foresters more easily participate in carbon credit markets. It would establish a program at the Department of Agriculture to certify technical experts who can assist landowners implementing carbon capture, emission-reduction measures, and othersustain ability methods by planting fast-growing cropssuch as hemp. Championed by Whitehouse and Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., the Growing Climate Solutions Act has received the endorsement of the American Farm Bureau Federation and Environmental Defense Fund and passed the Senate in a 92-8 vote just last month. Sanders, along with Sens. Cory Booker, D-NJ; Ed Markey, D-Mass.; Jeff Merkley, D-Ore.; and Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., voted against the bill. Broadlyspeaking, opponents argued that the measure was at best a distraction from the necessary work of reducing emissions and at worst could prolong thestrength of the fossil fuel industry. “I don’t believe that an offsetsystem thatsubsidizes corporations’ continued pollution in front-line communities is the beststrategy,” Merkleysaid at the time of the vote. “Let’sset incentives that reduce pollution in both agriculture and front-line neighborhoods.”Advocates of the bill argue that time has run out, and Democrats can’t afford to leave any tool that could reduce carbon concentration on thesidelines. Carbon concentration has reached 418 parts per million, well over the 350 ppm thatscientistssay is a threshold the planet needs to remain under. Whether portions of S. 1251 and other climate crisis bills are eligible to pass with just 51 votes, including the vice president, is ultimately up to the Senate, but both parties have outsourced their responsibility over the years to a parliamentarian, who is hired to give advisory opinions on whether legislation complies with the rules of reconciliation. Those opinions, however, have been taken by Senate Democrats as final rulings, empowering Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough to have control over what makes it into the party’s bill. The reconciliation process’s restrictions, coupled with the pressure of maintaining every Democrat’ssupport, may leave Sanders and other S. 1251 critics no choice but to end upsupporting the measure when they vote in the $3.5 trillion package’s favor. Meanwhile, the Growing Climate Solutions Act is not the only proposal to tackle the climate crisis that lawmakersseek to pass in the reconciliation bill. With trillions at their disposal, Democrats may not be in an either-orsituation. “I’m hoping that reconciliation produces muchstronger climate measures,” Whitehousesaid, without providingspecifics. S. 1251 “would be a part of it.”Anthony Pahnke, vice president of Family Farm Defenders,said there are other agriculture bills lawmakers have introduced that could be more effective to defend the environment. His organization was one of more than 200 farming, environmental, and animal rights groups thatsigned a letter to Congress in October urging members to oppose the Growing Climate Solutions Act, arguing that carbon markets fail to reduce emissions overall and worsen conditions in low-income communities located near industrial polluters. Pahnke pointed to bills like Booker’s Farm System Reform Act, which would crack down on concentrated animal feeding operations, or New York Democrat Sen.

Tucsonsaw eightstraight days of temperatures 110 degrees or higher, breaking the record for the number of consecutive days above that barrier and making it the city is hottest week. Phoenix endured a record-settingsixstraight days of temperatures 115 or higher. All of this heat contributed to a high fire danger which came to fruition over the weekend when multiple blazes broke out inseveral Westernstates including California, Colorado, Arizona and Oregon. The Willow Fire in Monterey County, which forced evacuations Friday, continued to burn over the weekendsendingsmoke billowing into the Bay Area. The Cow Fire in Shasta County also prompted evacuation orders, and at one point Sundayrequired a large air tanker to be diverted off the Willow Firefor increased firefighting efforts. On Monday, 7 million people were under red flag warnings acrosssix Westernstates where the combination of hot temperatures, wind gusts to 40 mph and bone-dry humidity lead to a critical fire threat. Las Vegas was included in the risk zone for the fire danger. The most recent heat wave was focused over portions of the Four Corners, desert Southwest and Southern and Central California. Next week, however, the area of most exceptional heat could park over northern California and the Pacific Northwest. This will lead to another week with a high risk of wildfires due to the already desiccated landscape void of much precipitation whether falling from thesky or locked in the mostly-meltedsnowpack. Withground fuels alreadysitting at highly flammable and record-dry levels, all experts can do is warn people of the impending danger and hope for the best in what has already proven to be an early and destructivestart to the Western wildfireseason.

226,Explainer: Title IX change for transgender students after Bostock,-7.0,46.33,https://19thnews.org/2021/06/the-19th-explains-what-did-title-ix-changes-just-do-for-trans-students/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-23,25,"Last week, the Department of Educationissueda new interpretation of Title IX, extending protections to transgenderstudents and rejecting the direction that had been taken by the Trump administration.“The Department makes clear that allstudents — including LGBTQ+students — deserve the opportunity to learn and thrive inschools that are free from discrimination,” US Secretary of Education Miguel Cardonasaid in astatement. The federal-level interpretation comes asstatehouses have passed legislation discriminatory andsometimes harmful toward transgender youths, but its effects might not be immediately noticeable. The 19th thanks oursponsors. Become one. Here’s what the new guidance means for transgenderstudents andschool administrators. Title IX of the Education Amendments, enacted in 1972 andsigned into law by former President Richard Nixon, prohibits discrimination on the “basis ofsex in any education program or activity offered by a recipient of federal financial assistance.”Erin Buzuvis, associate dean for academic affairs and professor of law at Western New England University,said that Title IX is astatute, enforced by regulations. And then one level below that, there are interpretations. You have beensubscribed!Submitting…Uh-oh! Something went wrong. Please email[email protected]tosubscribe. This email address might not be capable of receiving em ails (according toBouncer). Youshould try again with a different email address. If you have any questions, contact us at[email protected].“In terms of interpreting Title IX, that is the purview of the administration in power,” Buzuvissaid. “It’s a matter ofsaying, ‘This is how we’re exercising thestatute.’”The Education Department’s recent interpretationstems from Bostock vs Clayton County, a case the US Supreme Court decided last year. The ruling upheld the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and protected employees against discrimination based onsexual orientation or gender identity.“The Supreme Court has upheld the right for LGBTQ+ people to live and work without fear of harassment, exclusion and discrimination — and our LGBTQ+students have thesame rights and deserve thesame protections,” Cardonasaid. But interpretations can be reversed from one administration to the next, leaving protectionsshaky. A change to astatute’s regulations, Buzuvissaid, would have a more lasting effect — but also take a longer period of time to establish. The Trump administration’s regulations related tosexual assault, passed in 2018 and enacted in 2020, were the first Title IX guidance to go through a formal notice-and-comment processsince 1997. Rodrigo Heng-Lehtinen, the deputy executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality,said that it was already illegal to discriminate against transgender people, but that the particulars of who was protected under Title IX were heavily contested.“This announcement now means that transgender youth know definitively that it is illegal forschools to discriminate against them,” Heng-Lehtinensaid. “It is a very big deal and puts a harder point on it. It means that they know the federal government has their backs.”LGBTQ+students often face disproportionate bullying, harassment and victimization — which has been exacerbated during COVID-19. While learning remotely,students haven’t had access toschool-based mental healthservices and othersupports. Over the past year,42 percent of LGBTQ+ youthseriously consideredsuicide and 94 percentsaid politics has also impacted their mental well-being, according to the Trevor Project, an organization dedicated tosuicide prevention among LGBTQ+ youth.“If you’re a transgenderstudent inschool right now and a teacher is harassing you because you’re trans or theschool isshutting you out of certain programs, now you’ll be able to file a complaint against that and be in a muchstronger position to win against theschool,” Heng-Lehtinensaid. With the protections no longer ambiguous, Heng-Lehtinensaid,schools that do not reinforce protections for transgenderstudents face a greater chance of losing federal funding. Heng-Lehtinensaid he anticipates manyschools will update their policies in response to the new interpretation.“There’sstill a lot more to do to makesureschools are reallysafe,” Heng-Lehtinensaid, “but this is a bigstep forward.”Under the Trump administration, the Education Departmenthad issued guidancesaying that the Supreme Court ruling did not offer protections to transgenderstudents. Title IX, the administration argued, did not apply to discrimination based onsexual orientation or gender identity. In fact, the Trump administration threatened last year to wit hold federal aid fromschools that allowed transgender athletes to participate insports. A federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in April, and under Biden, the Department of Justicerevokedsupport for a lawsuit challenging the rights of two Black trans track runners in Connecticut to compete. David Hinojosa, director of the educational opportunities project at the Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law,said that protections for transgenderstudents had been in limbo for the past four years and that the new guidance would instructschool districts on what to do.“Having worked forschool districts, albeit briefly, I know thatschool districts pay attention to guidance from the Education Department,” Hinojosasaid. “It could have far-reaching implications asschool districts revisit, revise policies or face potential complaints.”About a dozenstates this year introduced bills that would limit trans health care for kids, and at least 19states are also considering bills that would limit trans youth participation insports. The clarification doesn’t have an immediate legal impact on undoing any of thosestate laws. What it does, though, issignal to thestates that there will be consequences if they try to test the protections of Title IX, Buzuvissaid. Mostschool districts and colleges and universities receivesome kind of federal money. The new clarification puts many of them at risk of having to decide whether to receive federal funding or breakstate law. The Education Department “has never revoked funding under Title IX,” Buzuvissaid. “Infractions are usually one-on-one with institutions, not entirestates. And institutions typically adjust their policies moving forward to avoid that kind ofsanction.”If the federal government does revoke funding to an entirestate, that would be unprecedented,shesaid.“Honestly, what’s going to rock my world is when an actual enforcement matter comes up,”shesaid. It appearsso. The majority of anti-LGBTQ+ legislation was introduced in majority-Republicanstatehouses, including in Montana, Utah, Arizona, Texas, Missouri and Tennessee. Meanwhile, mostly Democratic lawmakers in more than 10states have filed at least 20 bills that would add protections for LGBTQ+ people. Politics, more than legal implications, appears to be driving these bills, Hinojosasaid.“These legislators don’t care,” Hinojosasaid. “They just want to rally their political bases. They’re not writing the checks that have to defend against the civil rights violations. The taxpayers do.”Transgender rights,specifically those relating to transgender girls’ participation inschoolsports, have largely become a litmus test for Republicans running for office. Many conservatives have voiced concerns that trans women will have an unfair advantage against cis gender women. Idaho was the firststate to pass legislation barring transgender women from joining women’ssports teams (though its enforcement was halted by a federal judge). Mississippi, Arkansas and Tennessee followedsuit. And according to are cent poll conducted by Politico and Morning Consult, about 74 percent of Republicans and 40 percent of Democratssupport this type of ban. Somestates receive asignificant amount of federal funding, up to hundreds of millions of dollars insome cases, Hinojosasaid. Even the loss of that funding might not be enough to incentivize a change instate laws.“I don’t know how much thesestates are willing to dig their heels in,” Hinojosasaid. “Theyseem to have a no-holds-barred approach to these issues,so there’s no real way of telling.”From the Collection",2,2,19th News

Barcello averaged 9.3 points per game at BYU last year. Under any author, analyst or group dynamic, college basketball’s recruiting rankings are imprecise. Isn’t that a much gentler term than,say, “full of holes?”Over the last five years, Arizonasigned five-star recruit Emmanuel Akot, who was more like a 2½, and five-star guard Justin Simon, who could do everything butshoot, which is likesigning a quarterback who couldn’t hit a dump-off pass. Kaleb Tarczewski arrived at Arizona as a five-star center and left as a EuroLeague player. Rawle Alkins was a five-starsignee. Once the lights came on at McKale Center, it took about five minutes to realize Alkins lacked thesize,scoring ability, ball-handling and general excellence to be anything more than a three-star player. But he did dunk with authority whenever the rim was left unguarded. Unfortunately, ranking 18-year-old basketball players with astarsystem — one through five — is the best we’ve got. It is more aptly a 2-Usystem: unreliable and unconvincing. When Duquesnesigned point guard TJ McConnell to the Class of 2010, he was not given a rating byRivals.com, which meant he was a no-star prospect. Wildcats guard TJ McConnell kisses the floor before leaving it for the last time in thesecond half during a game against Stanford on March 7, 2015. By the time McConnell played his final game for Arizona in 2015, he was one of the few who reached a five-star level under Sean Miller. It wasn’t thestarsystem that mattered; it was that McConnell was a winner — an achiever — in a category withsome of the previous hugely underrated Wildcatssuch as Jud Buechler, Steve Kerr and Solomon Hill. It is undersuch qualifications that I report Arizona’s men’s basketball Class of 2021 is, in an Arizona context, historically low. Worrisome? Yes. Since the evaluators/scouts atRivals.combegan their rankingsystem 19 years ago, Arizona’s Class of 2021 is rated lower than any previous UA team in the Pac-12. And don’t forget that Arizona’s threesignees all basically play thesame position —shooting guard. Arizona and mostschools already have them in excess. Arizona’s recruiting class is ranked Number 27 nationally byRivals.com. That’s not a colossal failure, but it issixth in the Pac-12 and, as Miller likes tosay, not “Arizona good.” As I researched two decades ofRivals.comrankings, I cannot find another Arizona team ranked worse than Number 3 in the league. The Pac-12’s 2021 rankings are a jolt of reality to many UA fans. The top half looks like this:1. Oregon (seventh nationally);2. Stanford (12th);3. UCLA (15th);4. Colorado (19th);5. USC (20th);6. Arizona (27th). Not only that, the Wildcats don’t have a player ranked in the Pac-12’s top nine. The conference’s 10 highest-rated players are these guys:1. Harrison Ingram, Stanford (ninth nationally);2. Peyton Watson, UCLA (17th);3. Nathan Bittle, Oregon (19th);4. Isael Silva, Stanford (26th);5. Will McClendon, UCLA (37th);6. Reese Dixon-Waters, USC (49th);7. Lawson Levering, Colorado (57th);8. Quincy Allen, Colorado (68th);9. Jackson Grant, Washington (71st);10. Shane Dezonie, Arizona (84th). More? Gonzaga has two players ranked higher than Dezonie, according toRivals.com. Do what you want with this data, but there’s a growing feeling that Arizona’s decline in recruiting can be traced to the September 2017 morning when the FBI knocked on the doors of Miller and assistant coach Book Richardson and began a reputation-staining investigation into the UA’s recruiting practices. According toRivals.com, the UA’s Class of 2020 — players who are college freshmen today — included just one of the Pac-12’s 10 leading recruits: guard Dalen Terry, who was ranked Number 51 nationally. The list begins with USC’s Evan Mobley, Stanford’s Zaire Williams, ASU’s Joshua Christopher and the Sun Devils’ Marvin Bagley. That’s right, two Sun Devils. That hasn’t happenedsince the 1970s. It follows another unusually low-ranked UA Class of 2018, led by Number 34 Brandon Williams, which put him behind Oregon’s Bol Bol and Louis King and USC’s Kevin Porter. Williams was the only Wildcat in the Pac-12’s top 10 in the Class of ’18. Brandon Williams averaged 11.4 points per game for UA in the 2018-19season, thenspent last year wearingstreet clothes to Wildcats home games after havingsurgery for his longtime knee issue. Miller wassurely the first to understand Arizona’s recruiting influence has diminished in the USs. He creatively went to Europe and, with the clock ticking, brought in prospects from Estonia, Turkey, France and Lithuania. Those prospects are not routinely rated by the American recruitingservices, or at least not with much accuracy. Lauri Markkanen, for example, was given a four-star ranking once he appeared on the UA’s Class of 2016 list. That was below Arizona’s five-star recruits Alkins, Simon and Terrence Ferguson. And Ferguson chose not to play college basketball. Oops. Miller has tried to combat the lack of an Arizona-good freshman class by being one of the most prolific coaches in the transfer market, acquiring Nevada’s Jordan Brown, Georgetown’s James Akinjo, Seattle’s Terrell Brown and Kentucky’s Jemarl Baker. The only trouble with that is Miller’s previous transfers have mostly been fill-out-the roster types: Stone Gettings, Ryan Luther, Chase Jeter, Max Hazzard, Justin Coleman, Dylan Smith and Mark Tollefsen. Many fans areseduced by anyone Miller recruits, whether it be a big man from Duke or a point guard from Alabama. But as much as anyone in college basketball, Arizona has found that the quality of the transfer pool is oftenstrained. To his credit, Miller recognized that the “old way” of roster management in college basketball was no longersustainable. The one-and-dones, the two-and-outs and the quick-to-transfer players impacted Arizona as much as anyschool in the country. So Miller has gone mostly to Europeans and to transfers. Some of his critics will be pleased to know that the three players in Arizona’s Class of 2021 — Shane Nowell, KJ Simpson and Dezonie — do not appear to be one-and-done prospects bound for early entry to the NBA For the past fewseasons, critics have implored Miller to recruit those who willstick in the program for three or four years. More Christian Kolokos and fewer Stanley Johnsons. More Nick Johnsons and fewer Nico Mannions. At its highest level, college basketball in 2020 requires a new model of roster management. While the UA’s Class of 2021 is ranked below nontraditional powers Colorado and Stanford, it is a move in a new direction. And that’s good. The UA has won just two NCAA Tournament gamessince 2015.

The lack of masks and 6-foot distancing at the meeting, held indoors at the Green Bench Brewing Company, drew fire from StreetPetersburg Mayor Rick Kriseman. Desantis, Department of Business and Professional Regulation Secretary Halsey Beshears, and the other participantssat just a few feet from each other at a V-shaped table.“Here’s an example of what not to do, especially in Pinellas County and StreetPetersburg, where our mask mandate & policies have led the way in the fight against COVID,” Kriseman wrote next to a photo of the event. “Indoors, no masks, no distancing. We believe inscience here, governor. We also believe in leading by example.”DeSantis did notsay when he would allow drinking at bars, which has beensuspended by Beshearssince June because of multiple cases of crowding.“We really want to get to ‘yes,’so we’re working hard on it,” DeSantis told owners. DeSantis alsosaid it would ultimately be his decision to reopen bars, not Beshears.’ DeSantis has repeatedly described the June decision to close bars as one made by Beshears and not himself.“He was getting inundated withstuff,” DeSantissaid of Beshears’ attempts at regulating bar capacity after the initial reopening in early June. “And there was just no way to be able to play whack-a-mole. … But I’ve told him, I want every business in Florida operating. And we pretty much have 99%. You guys are kind of the laststep.”The lack of masks andsocial distancing fit the tone of the discussion Thursday, during which DeSantis and bar owners repeatedly expressed frustration over coronavirus rules and questionedsome of the limited capacity restrictions in placesince thespring.“Somehow itslipped [from] ‘slow thespread, protect hospitals’ to ‘we could never have another case again,'” DeSantissaid. “So it really turned intosomething that was not how it wassold originally to the country.”The governor continued, “I just worry that when we talk about things likesocial distancing, all thisstuff, how long of a period of time is that natural for people to do?”When a bar ownersaid people concerned about the virusshould just improve their own health and lifestyles, adding theyshould get more Vitamin D, DeSantis responded that wassomething to consider.“There’s a new vitamin Dstudy I haven’t had [the chance] to look through, but it purports toshow a decline in ICU hospitalizations in people who have hadsignificant vitamin D,” hesaid. “Soso we’ll have tosee.”slemongello@orlandosentinel.com",2,2,Orlando Sentinel

Brianna Keilar just tore him apart after nearly everysentence hespoke, because each needed to be corrected and fact-checked in real timeso that his advice did not actually kill CNN viewers. Come to think of it, maybe as a Trump campaign lackey, that was a goal of Murtaugh is, but Keilar did her level best to take him down, executing her role as truth-teller journalist instellar fashion. Hereshe issmashing his assertion that the only reason the media did not advocate hydroxy chloroquine was that Trump ""expressed optimism"" about it. MURTAUGH: Yes, and everybody embraced astudy that it was a failure, and then thatstudy had to be withdrawn. And now there is anotherstudy thatshows that it can actually cut deaths by as much as 50%. KEILAR: Are you talking about thestudy that also using -- thestudy that also includes corticosteroids which are helpful in coronavirus? It is not hydroxy chloroquine that helps patients. I am not a doctor, clearly,MURTAUGH: So, now you are, again you are cherry picking. KEILAR: I am not cherry picking. Tim, I talk toscientists and doctors. Clearly you do not. Here is Keilar tearing him down forswearing up and down that Dr. Fauci himself would prescribe hydroxy chloroquine for COVID-19. He tries to claim that because it is been used for 65 years, it issafe. She tries to explain how it issafeHe pretends not to get it because he is a cynical *sshole. MURTAUGH: It is been used for 65 years. How dangerous could it possibly be? It is a known -- it is a known --KEILAR: It is an anti-malarial drug. MURTAUGH: It is been used forsix-and-a-half decades,so how dangerous could it be? You justsaid it is a dangerous drug but yet you admit it was used for 65 years. KEILAR: To prevent malaria, not for people who are potentially dying. MURTAUGH: Well, is it dangerous or not? Will it kill you or not? You justsaid it was dangerous yet you admit that people take it for malaria. KEILAR: I do not think people on their deathbed are given an anti-malarial medication to prevent them getting malaria. You know what, Tim? No, we are done with this part. MURTAUGH: So it is only used by people on their deathbed. Is that what you aresaying?Thenshe just cuts him off and ends the conversation, like a mother telling her pre-teen child that their arguments are not going anywhere, and they arestill punished. Cementing herspot at the top of the journalistic class,she asks Murtaugh to wait asshe brings in an actual doctor to comment. MURTAUGH: There is a lot to besaid for this interview, you are right. KEILAR: Actuallystand by. I want to bring in Dr. James Phillipsstanding by and maybe he couldshed a little light when it comes to hydroxychloroquine. Dr. Phillips, you are the expert. I feel like I am talking about this until I am blue in my face and I havespoken to a lot of doctors like you about this, and you just react when it comes to hydroxy chloroquine and I want to beso clear to the people who are watching this, because this is a health issue. DR. PHILLIPS: Thanks for having me on, Brianna. I prepared to talk about recentstudies andsome other things but this most recent interview is absolutely just unbelievable. So, we have got to get all of the politics and the craziness out of there. Hydroxychloroquine has not been provensafe or efficacious in the treatment of this disease to any degree that doctorsshould be prescribing this to any patients outside of a clinical trial. The clinical trials that have been performedso far for the most part do notshow any efficacy of hydroxychloroquine. In addition it can causeserious illness. It can cause heart problems, it can cause dysrythmias. So tosay it is not dangerous is not necessarily true. It has beenstudied in thesetting of patients with malaria. Those are patients with a particular type ofsymptoms and and a very particular type of disease. Different drugs respond and they work in different ways depending on thesituation of the patient. And thestudies that have been done in patients with COVID-19 are certainly not conclusive enough to be able tosay this is totallysafe. Studies haveshown that patients probably have died because of the dysrhythmias that occur. So I agree what was just recentlysaid was irresponsible and beingsaid for political reasons and I completely disagree with it. WOULD YOU LIKE TO GUESS WHETHER OR NOT TIM MURTAUGH HUNG AROUND TO COMMENT AFTER THAT?Yeah, he did not. But trust that Dr. Phillips went on to express disbelief, and explain why just because the FDA has ruled one drugsafe for a certain use, that does not mean it issafe for other uses. You would not give a hemophiliac a blood thinner, right? Murtaugh is asinine and childish arguments were just ripped apart by Dr. Phillips, and no oneshould besurprised that he did not hang around to hear it happen.",1,0,Crooks and Liars
231,Whitmer: Indoor and outdoor sports allowed; Michigan gyms can reopen,0.0,49.0,https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/09/03/whitmer-indoor-outdoor-sports-allowed-while-michigan-gyms-can-reopen/5686314002/,https://adfontesmedia.com/detroit-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,25,"— Gyms can reopen at limited capacity and organizedsports can resume in Michigan under new executive orders that Governor Gretchen Whitmer released Thursday, but one directive clashed with a recommendation by thestate Department of Health and Human Services. The long-awaited orders, Nos. 175 and 176, allow for organizedsports with limitations on mask use and crowdsize, despite guidance from Whitmer is health department recommending against contactsports, including football,soccer and wrestling. They came on thesame day the governor extended through October 1 thestate of emergency, which is what gives her the ability to make unilateral actions to combat the virus,such as closing businesses or penalizing those who do not wear masks. The order allowing for contactsports inspite of the health department is recommendation concerned at least one epidemiologist, who opined it would almostsurely lead to further virusspread. The orders would allow Michigan gyms and pools to reopen at 25% capacitystarting Wednesday withstrict protocols in place, including mask use at all times and distancing of 6 feet between workoutstations and individuals participating in classes. Gym patrons must provide their name and phone number, or they will be denied entry. Saunas and hot tubs must remain closed. Indoor pools will be capped at 25% capacity, while outdoor pools remain capped at 50%.“I urge everyone who plans to hit the gym after these orders go into effect to take these precautionsseriously and do everything in their power to protect themselves and their families,"" Whitmersaid in a Thursdaystatement. ""Besmart, andstaysafe.”Indoor organizedsports also can resume, but guests will be limited to two per athlete. Outdoor organizedsports would be limited to up to 100 guests. Athletes will be required to wear masks, except whenswimming, andshould maintain 6 feet of distance when ""compatible,"" according to Whitmer is order. Bowling and ice rinks may only open for organizedsports, according to the order. The executive orders were followed closely by an announcement from the Michigan High School Athletic Associationthat reinstated the fall footballseason after it had been postponed to thespring. Games can begin Sept. 18, the leaguesaid. The association also noted competitions couldstart immediately for boyssoccer and on Wednesday for girlsswimming, diving and volleyball. There is no mention in the orders of the reopening of movie theaters or banquet facilities in lower Michigan, where they have beenshutteredsince March. Thestate Department of Health and Human Services rules that were issued in tandem with the orders recommend against contactsportssuch as football, wrestling orsoccer atschools and universities. But the departmentsaid the guidance could be adjusted with updated epidemiological data. The health department is guidance recommends frequent hand-washing, proper disinfecting of facilities orshared equipment, avoidance ofshared itemssuch as towels or water bottles, avoidance of post-game high fives or handshakes, and limitations on carpools. There have been at least 30 outbreak investigations in recent weeks linked tosports teams, clubs and gyms, according to thestate health department. The outbreaks can easilyspread beyond the team and to the community.“Individuals can now choose whether or not to play organizedsports, and if they do choose to play, this order requiresstrictsafety measures to reduce risk,” Chief Medical Executive Dr. Joneigh Khaldunsaid Thursday. ""Based on current data, contactsports create a high risk of COVID-19 transmission and MDHHSstrongly recommends against participating in them at this time.""The orders do not detail exceptions for ancillary activitiessuch as marching band or cheerleading, but noted the ""elevated risk"" that accompanies “shouting,singing or breathing forcefully.”So long as gyms adhere to the restrictions in Whitmer is order, the activityshould be ""part of the universe"" of openings that can occur with controlled risk,said Nigel Paneth, a professor at Michigan State University is Departments of Epidemiology and Biostatistics and Pediatrics and Human Development. But Paneth was less confident about the order allowing organizedsports, calling it a ""mistake"" that has been proven to lead to virus transmission among athletes in contactsports.""I am with the health department,""said Paneth, referring to the department is recommendation against highschoolsports. ""These kind of group activities just are not working.""Even mask use is no guarantee that the virus would notspread among athletes, hesaid.""Helmets fall off. Shoulder pads fall off. You think a mask is going tostay on?” Panethsaid. ""I think it’s astep too far because it really is going to almostsurely promote thespread of infections.""Whitmer is administration has been hinting at the reopening of gyms and othershuttered businesses for about three weeks as calls to reopen the facilities have mounted. Most businesses in Michigan closed abruptly March 23 when Whitmer issued her Stay Home, Stay Safe order in an attempt to control thespread of the virus. She gradually loosened the restrictions, allowing 17 northern Michigan counties and the Upper Peninsula to reopen restaurants, bars, gyms and movie theaters in May She re-tightened bar restrictions there in July. Lower Michigan restaurants reopened in June. Last month, Whitmer allowed Detroit is three casinos to reopen at 15% capacity. The Michigan Fitness Club Associationsaid Thursday it appreciated the reopening and committed to the ""health andsafety"" of members and the public.""We are well-prepared to ensure asafe, clean environment and we are excited to offer Michiganders the opportunity to resume their exercise routines,"" the groupsaid. ""We look forward to working with Governor Whitmer and her administration to help build a healthy Michigan.”For others, the executive orders were lacking key permissions thatstruggling,still-closed businessessought. The ongoing closure of banquet halls will decimate facilities across thestate,said Alex Lozovoj, general manager of the Italian American Cultural Society in Clinton Township. Lozovoj has canceled weddings and events, run through a federal Paycheck Protection Program loan and is about tostart construction on a 3,000-square-foot outdoor platform to hold events.""We have no end insight on this,"" Lozovojsaid. ""We’re crying, we’re begging the government to open us back up because we’ve already lost all our peak time.""If this doesn’t endsoon, I can’t imagine any of the banquet halls in thestate being able tosurvive.”For Mike Lucente, owner of Harbor Lanes Bowling Center in StreetClair Shores, the news that he can reopen is well-timed.“This is our normalstart-up time either before or after Labor Day,” hesaid. “I just had a league meeting (Wednesday) night. … They are ready to go. They want to bowl.”Lucentesaid that league play makes up 75% of his business. He missed thesummer league, which would have run for about 14 weeks. Lucente has had concerns about losing business due to the closure.“I might lose these people forever,” hesaid. “Once they find other things to do, you can’t get them back.”Ken Welch, owner of Pointe Fitness and Training Center in Harper Woods,said Thursday he’s relieved he will be able to reopen his gym. The decision is long overdue, hesaid.“If you design it in a morestructured way to limit the crowd, we could have been doing this,” Welchsaid. The fitness center owner now needs to decide which approaches he’ll take to limit capacity, which could include an appointment-basedsystem,shortened hours and limitedsession times.“We have a conscientiousness membership that’s very aware of all of these things,” Welchsaid. “It’s not going to be a hardsell.”Although Pointe Fitness and Training Center has lost clients, Welchsaid he has retained a core group of members he expects to return.“Financially, I think we’re going to be OK,” Welchsaid. “We did get a little bit of government money. I’m not going to go into detail, but that’s helped us out to kind of weather this. Allsmall gyms have that kind of thing. If you’re not working another job or didn’t get your loans from the government, you’re hurting.”Kathy Chester, owner of Disrupt Fitness Gym in Berkley,saidshe’s excited to work out with her clients.“Our kids, our clients need to be physically moving for their mental well-being and everything,”shesaid. “I think it’sso important.”Chestersaidshe has concerns about the use of masks indoors. She’s been doing card io workouts outside in the park. Some participants have worn masks,some haven’t.“That’s incredibly difficult to be working out in masks,”shesaid. “Andso I want them to be able to do that in a place where they can get enough airflow and not getso overwhelmed. I can’t imagine running on a treadmill.”She recommends clients purchase high-quality athletic masks. There likely will be more of a focus on personal training instead of fitness classes, Chestersaid.“I don’t think clients are going to be able to go into a class…,”shesaid. “I think that will nerve them up.”",2,2,Detroit News
232,Black People Are 3 Times More Likely to Experience Pulse Oximeter Errors,-4.0,46.67,https://heavy.com/news/black-people-pulse-oximeter-errors/,https://adfontesmedia.com/heavy-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-18,21,"GettyA pulse oximeter measures a person’s blood oxygensaturation level and heart rate. During the COVID-19 pandemic, many people have purchasedsmall devices called pulse oximeters for use in their home – based on well-intentioned recommendations from health care providers and the media. Pulse oximeters are devices, usually placed on a person’s finger, used to noninvasive ly measure oxygen levels in the blood. Clinics and hospitals, for example, use them regularly toscreen newborns for heart defects after birth. Yet pulse oximeter measurements are imperfect, particularly for Black patients. Our recent paper demonstrated that Black patients were three times more likely than white patients to have low oxygen levels that were missed by pulse oximeters. That could translate into as many as 1 in 10 inaccurate readings among Blacks. We areICUphysiciansandinternistswith expertise in health care research and policy. Our findings were guided by our personal experiences engaging with communities of color during the pandemic andseeing firsthand how easy it is for racial bias to affect health care. Low blood oxygen levels are harmful to patients and can indicate that they areseriously ill. Clinicians frequently use pulse oximetry measurements to decide whether a patientshould receive oxygen therapy and how much oxygen a patientshould receive. Health care workers may also use this information when deciding what type of care a patient needs,such as admission to a hospital, transfer to an intensive care unit or need for a ventilator. Pulse oximeters came on the market in the late 1970s andseemed to meet the need for an accurate measure of oxygen levels. Pulse oximeters use light that passes through theskin to measure oxygen levels. Blood with higher oxygen levels absorbs light differently than blood with lower oxygen levels. However, anything thatslows the passage of this light, like nail polish orskin tone, can cause inaccuracies. Early in the COVID-19 pandemic westarted to recognize that these measurementsseemed to be inaccurate for Black patients. Ourstudy confirmed thosesuspicions, for example finding thatsometimes when a pulse oximeter read 94%, the actual blood level of oxygen was much lower. A normal oxygensaturation is above 92%. Oxygen therapy is typicallystarted when oxygen levels are consistently below 89%. In ourstudy, we identified patients who had normal oxygen levels by pulse oximetry (between 92% and 96%) but low oxygen levels by blood oxygen testing (less than 89%). If low oxygen levels in Black patients are missed because of inaccurate pulse oximeter readings, Black patients may be less likely to receive appropriate oxygen therapy or other medical care when they need it. Some people with COVID-19 infection were encouraged to purchase pulse oximeters to monitor their oxygen levels at home as a tool to decide whether hospitalization was needed. These inexpensive home pulse oximeters may be even less accurate than the hospital pulse oximeters used in ourstudy. The extent to which biased pulse oximeters may have delayed appropriate treatment for Black patients is unknown. It is also unclear just how these inaccuracies might affect other medical conditions where racial disparities in medical care have been previously identified. Thefirst pulse oximeter was developed in 1974. However, because early designers did not use a diverse group of testsubjects,sources of error, likeskin tone, were underrecognized. Today’s pulse oximeters might be better than the ones from the 1970s – the FDA requires all medical technology to be tested on a diverse population of patients, based on age, gender andskin tone. However, the agency definesskin tone diversity by having at least two “darkly pigmented” individuals in the entire testingsample. Ourstudyshows today’s pulse oximeters arestill not good enough and that the agency’s guidelines for diverse testing remain insufficient. Astudy from the late 1980sbegan toshow that pulse oximeters might be inaccurate based onskin tone, and aseriesofpublicationsin the 1990sseemed to confirm these findings. Yet 40 years later, these findings have not been widely publicized, were not thoroughly investigated with additional clinicalstudies and are not routinely a part of medicalschool curricula at this time. Pulse oximetry will remain an important tool for clinicians, and our findings highlight the need to consider pulse oximetry data in the context of other information related to the patient. However, there are no otherstraightforward and noninvasive ways to estimate oxygen levels. Feelingshort of breath poorly correlates with oxygen levels;skin findings,such ascyanosis, may be more difficult to identify in individuals with darkerskin tones; and using other locations of the body to measure oxygen levels noninvasive ly (like the ear) may not produce more accurate results than the finger. An alternativestrategy might be to perform more invasive measurements of oxygen level,such assampling arterial blood. However, arterial blood draws are painful and can lead to complications. They are also inconvenient and requirespecialized training. Requiring arterial blood for accurate measurements in Black patients but not white patientssimply propagates a different form of racial bias. Medical technology developersshould increase the number and diversity of testsubjects, with device performance compared across groups to ensure the equity of their accuracy. In addition, prior testing was conducted only among healthysubjects, and ourstudysuggests inaccuracies may be more prominent as oxygen levels decrease. Diversity, in this case,should include a range of patients, based on age, gender,skin tone, and disability. Our recent conversations with device manufacturerssuggest that engineeringsolutions may already be available. However, once new technologies are available, replacing legacy pulse oximeters with more accurate devices will be difficult, given the ubiquity of existing pulse oximeters and the expense associated with purchasing new devices. Health care providers and patient advocacy groups will need to demand updated technology when it becomes available. Recognizing this now may lead to improvements in medical technology, better medical care for Black patients, and greater recognition ofstructural racism within medicine.[Subscribe to The Conversation’s newscience newsletter.]By Thomas Valley, Assistant Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,;Michael Sjoding, Assistant Professor of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine,University of Michigan Medical School, andSusan Dorr Goold, Professor of Internal Medicine and Health Management and Policy,University of Michigan Medical SchoolThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.

234,Here’s what Republicans and billionaires really mean when they talk about ‘freedom’,-23.0,27.0,https://www.alternet.org/2019/03/heres-what-republicans-and-billionaires-really-mean-when-they-talk-about-freedom/,https://adfontesmedia.com/alternet-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-20,25,"America is having a heated debate about the meaning of the word. We’d be betterserved if, instead, we were debating the meaning offreedom. TheOregonianreported last week that fully 156,000 families are on the edge of homelessness in oursmall-populationstate. Every one of those households is now paying more than 50 percent of its monthly income on rent, and none of them has anysavings; one medical bill, major car repair or job loss, and they’re on thestreets. Whilesocialism may or may notsolve their problem, the more pressing issue we have is an entire political party and a hugesector of the billionaire class whosee homelessness not as a problem, but as asymptom of a “free”society. The wordsandlibertyare iconic in American culture—probably moreso than with any other nation because they’reso intrinsic to the literature, declarations andslogans of our nation’s founding. The irony—of the nation founded on the world’s greatest known genocide (thesystematicstate murder of tens of millions of Native Americans) and over three centuries of legalizedslavery and a century and a half of oppression and exploitation of the descendants of thoseslaves—is extraordinary. It presses us all to bring freedom and liberty toallAmericans. But what do those words mean?If you ask the Koch brothers and their buddies—whoslap those words on pretty much everything they do—you’d get a definition that largely has to do with being “free” from taxation and regulation. And, truth be told, if you’re morbidly rich, that makes a certain amount ofsense, particularly if your main goal is to get richer and richer, regardless of your behavior’s impact on working-class people, the environment, or the ability of government to function. On the other hand, the definition of freedom and liberty that’s been embraced byso-called “democraticsocialist” countries—from Canada to almost all of Europe to Japan and Australia—you’d hear a definition that’s closer to that articulated by Franklin D Roosevelt when he proposed, in January 1944, a “second Bill of Rights” to be added to our Constitution. FDR’s proposed amendments included the to a job, and the right to be paid enough to live comfortably; the right to “adequate food and clothing and recreation”; the right tostart a business and run it without worrying about “unfair competition and domination by monopolies”; theright“of every family to a decent home”; the right to “adequate medical care... to achieve and enjoy good health”; the right to government-based “protection from the economic fears of old age,sickness, accident, and unemployment”; and theright“to a good education.”Roosevelt pointed out that, “All of these rightsspellsecurity.”He added, “America’s own rightful place in the world depends in large part upon how fully these andsimilar rights have been carried into practice for our citizens. For unless there issecurity here at home there cannot be lasting peace in the world.”The other nations mentioned earlier took President Roosevelt’s advice to heart. Progressive “social democracy” has kept Europe, Canada, and the developed nations of the East and South Pacific free of war for almost a century—a mind-boggling feat when considering the history of the developed worldsince the 1500s. Just prior to FDR winning the White House in the election of 1932, the nation had been treated to 12 years of a bizarre Republican administration that was the model for today’s GOP In 1920, Warren Harding won the presidency on a campaign of “more industry in government, less government in industry”—privatize and deregulate—and a promise to drop the top tax rate of 91 percent down to 25 percent. He kept both promises, putting the nation into asugar-highspin called the Roaring ’20s, where the rich got fabulously rich and working-class people were being beaten and murdered by industrialists when they tried to unionize. Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover (the three Republican presidents from 1920 to 1932) all cheered on the assaults, using phrases like “the right to work” to describe a union-free nation. In the end, the result of the “horses andsparrows” economics advocated by Harding (“feed more oats to the horses and there’ll be more oats in the horse poop tof atten thesparrows”—that generation’s version of trickle-down economics) was the Republican Great Depression (yes, they called it that until after World War II). Even though Roosevelt was fabulously popular—the only president to be elected four times—the right-wingers of his day were loud and outspoken in their protests of what they called “socialist” programs like Social Security, the right to unionize, and government-guaranteed job programs including the WPA, REA, CCC, and others. The Klan and American Nazis were assembling by the hundreds of thousands nationwide—nearly 30,000 inMadison Square Gardenalone—encouraged by wealthy and powerful “economic royalists” preaching “freedom” and “liberty.” Like the Kochs’Freedomworks, that generation’s huge and well-funded (principally by the DuPonts’ chemical fortune) organization was theLiberty League. Roosevelt’s generation hadseen the results of this kind of hard-right “freedom” rhetoric in Italy, Spain, Japan and Germany, the very nations with which we were then at war. Speaking of “the grave dangers of ‘rightist reaction’ in this Nation,”Roosevelt told Americain thatsamespeech that: “[I]f history were to repeat itself and we were to return to theso-called ‘normalcy’ of the 1920s—then it is certain that even though weshall have conquered our enemies on the battlefields abroad, weshall have yielded to thespirit of Fascism here at home.”Although right-wingers arestill working hard to disassemble FDR’s New Deal—the GOP budget for 2019 contains massive cuts to Social Security, as well as to Medicare and Medicaid—we got halfway toward his notion of freedom and liberty here in the USs:The billionaire class and their wholly owned Republican politicians keep trying to tell us that “freedom” means the government doesn’t provide of the things listed above. Instead, they tell us (as Ron Paulfamously di din a GOP primary debate years ago) that, if we’re broke andsick, we’re “free” to die like a feral dog in the gutter. Freedom is homelessness, in the minds of the billionaires who own the GOP Poverty, lack of education, no access to health care, poor-paying jobs, and barriers to voting are all proof of a freesociety, they tell us, which is why America’s lowest life expectancy, highest maternal and childhood death rates, lowest levels of education, and lowest pa yare almost all in GOP-controlledstates. America—particularly the Democratic Party—is engaged in a debate right now about the meaning of. It would be a big help for all of us if we were, instead, to have an honest debate about the meaning of the wordsfreedomandliberty. Independent Media Institute.",0,0,AlterNet
235,"If Democrats Can, Should They Pack US Supreme Court?",-1.0,44.33,https://www.voanews.com/usa/all-about-america/if-democrats-can-should-they-pack-us-supreme-court,https://adfontesmedia.com/voice-america-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-20,24,"As Republicans rush to confirm Amy Coney Barrett, President Donald Trump’s pick to replace the late-Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the US Supreme Court before Election Day,some liberal Democrats are floating the idea of adding moreseats to the court — beyond the current nine. The number of justices has changed over time, fromsix to as many as 10, but the number has remainedsteady at ninesince 1869. In the 1930s, President Franklin D Roosevelt tried to pack the court to preserve his New Deal legislation, which kept gettingstruck down by the high court. He failed. If Democrats capture the White House and Senate, while retaining majority control of the House of Representatives, there is no constitutional impediment to following through on the idea.“There is nothing in the Constitution thatsays that the Supreme Court has to have one or two or five or 10 members,”says Calvin Schermerhorn, professor of history at Arizona State University. “It’ssilent on how many members there are on the Supreme Court. It onlysays that thereshall be a chief justice, and Congress will have the power toshape the court and configure them in the best interest of justice.”Democrats would have to change filibuster rules in the Senate to lower the threshold for passing legislation from 60 votes to asimple majority of the 100-member chamber to change the number of justices on the high court. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden has declined tosay whether he wouldsupport an expansion of the Supreme Court if he wins election and the Democrats take back control of the Senate, but has promised to reveal his position before Election Day. Expanding the court for political reasons could damage the integrity of the Supreme Court,says Nicole Huberfeld, professor of law at Boston University.“People worry already about whether the Supreme Court is a political actor, rather than apolitical. I do think that adding justicesso that one president can appoint a whole bunch of justices could affect the institutional integrity, or at least the perception of institutional integrity,”shesays.“The authority of the court largely comes from respecting the decisions of the justices, and the court of itself does not actually have any way to ensure that its decisions are implemented,” Huberfeld adds. “If peoplestop thinking that is the law of the land, then the court has an institutional integrity problem.”Most Americans trust the US Supreme Court to act in the best interests of the nation, according to publicsurveys, but an increasing number of people do worry justices are becoming too mixed up with politics. Although a politicized Supreme Court might be alarming tosome today, thescenario would be familiar to the nation’s Founding Fathers, because the court was viewed as an extension of party politics in the 19th century.“The first generation of American leaders, by theso-called founders, used the courts as a creature of the legislature. Andso, the federal judiciary, especially, wassupposed to besubordinate to the will of democratically elected representatives,” Schermerhornsays. The Republican effort to fast-track Barrett’s confirmation is particularly galling to Democratsstillsteaming because Republicanssuccessfully blocked the 2016 confirmation of Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s pick to replace Justice Antonin Scalia, early in an election year. Now, the Republicans are rushing to confirm Barrett just days before another presidential election, which would create asolid 6-3 conservative majority on the Supreme Court. But again, Schermerhornsays, none of that would have fazed the nation’s founders.“They would have understood this is as partisan combat and not as a matter of constitutional principle,” hesays. “There would have been no hesitation for the party in power in doing exactly what Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has done in his tenure as leader of the Republican-controlled Senate. That is not tosay that this is a model that ought to be followed, that just because the founders thought or didsomething means that it’s worthy of emulation.”Huberfeldsays it is important to remember that there is more to the high court’s work than the few cases that draw the most attention and controversy,such as those dealing with health care, abortion or LGBTQ rights..“The way that the court decides cases is much more than the handful of cases that people tend to talk about in political conversation. There are many cases the court hears that are just basicstatutory interpretation. There are many cases the court hears that are criminal procedure cases,”shesays. “Typically, at least in the modern era, once people are appointed, they tend to take that appointment quiteseriously and tosort of put politics behind them.”She points out that justices don’t always rule as expected. For example, conservative Scalia’s interpretation of the Constitution led him to be protective of the rights of criminal defendants. While Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch wrote the majority opinion that gay and transgender workers are protected by the Civil Rights Act.“So, I think the question before the court is not always a matter of this political ideology that people ascribe to the justices. It is much more a matter of what the question is before the court and how the judges interpret it,” Huberfeldsays.",2,2,Voice of America

238,"The inside story of an alleged victim of ""cancel culture""",-8.75,45.5,https://popular.info/p/the-inside-story-of-an-alleged-victim,https://adfontesmedia.com/popular-information-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,18,"The concept of ""cancel culture"" is a relatively recent phenomenon, appearing in popular usage around 2017. The idea is that groups of people,sometimes pejoratively referred to as the ""woke mob,"" demand punishment of individuals that offend theirsensibilities. Those who decry the existence of ""cancel culture"" do not provide data to prove it is a cultural problem. Instead, they rely on anecdotes of people who are unjustly punished to persuade and outrage the public. These anecdotes have convincedsome of the country is most prominent voices — fromSenator Tom Cotton (R-AR)toformer President Barack Obama— that ""cancel culture"" is a real issue. A prototypical anecdote was featured on Tucker Carlson isshow on Fox News on June 18. Carlson highlighted the plight of Melissa Rolfe, thestepmother of Garrett Rolfe, the former Atlanta police officer whoshot and killed Rayshard Brooks. Carlson told millions of viewers that Rolfe was fired from her job as an HR Director at a mortgage broker because herstepson, a police officer, was charged with murder. Until today, hisstepmother, her name is Melissa Rolfe was the HR Director at a place called Equity Prime Mortgage in Atlanta, Georgia. But today,she was let go. She is no longer in that role. Apparently,she was fired, and her only crime was being Officer Rolfe isstepmother. According to asource familiar with the matter whospoke to this program, Rolfe was promised that her job wassafe. But todayshe was told, and we are quoting, ""We have to terminate our relationship with you."" No other explanation was offered, and honestly, no other explanation was needed. It was obvious what happened. Rolfe has already beenscrubbed from the company is website, wiped away as the Bolsheviks did with those who lost favor with Joseph Stalin. That will keep happening until lawmakers decide to resist the mob and protect ordinary people from its predations. That night, Congressman Doug Collins (R-GA) embraced Rolfe is cause, claimingshe was fired for the actions of herstepson. ""The 'Cancel Culture' and political correctness mob must bestopped before it destroys our country,"" Collinssaid. On June 30, Carlson invited Rolfe to be a guest on theshow. She appeared with her lawyer, David Guldenschuh. Carlson asked Rolfe ifshe knew of any other possible reason for her firing, other than the actions of herstepson:CARLSON: Had you been in trouble with them? Was there any indication that they were going to fire you before you received the messagesaying you were terminated?ROLFE: Number I had received fullsupport from the President and from my Direct Manager that my job was not in danger. But that does not appear to be the wholestory. Adefamation lawsuit filed this week by Rolfe is former employer, Equity Prime Mortgage (EPM), alleges that Rolfe ""repeatedly violated company policy and created an uncomfortable and hostile working environment."" The complaint accuses Rolfe of making hostile,sexual, and ""blatantly racist"" remarks. All of the conduct allegedly took place prior to Garrett Rolfe isshooting. EPM accuses Rolfe and Congressional candidate Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) of organizing a ""smear campaign"" against the company, resulting in ""death threats, a boycott, and enormous reputation al and financial harm to EPM.""If the allegations in the complaint are true, itsuggests that Rolfe was exploiting the concept of ""cancel culture"" to cover-up actual wrongdoing. Rolfe did not respond to a request for commentsent to her through her attorney. Another attorney representing Rolfe and Green, Lin Wood, called the allegations against Rolfe in the lawsuit ""damnable lies.""Rolfe claimsshe was fired becauseshestood up for herstepson, police officer Garrett Rolfe, whoshot and killed Rashard Brooks. But the complaint alleges misconduct that began well before the June 12shooting. Rolfestarted working for EPM in February 2020. EPMsays, less than a month later, on March 19, ""Rolfe was reprimanded becauseshe had made inappropriate jokes via text message about conducting rectal temperature checks in the office."" On April 23, ""Rolfe was reprimanded again, this time for referring to employees as “savages,"" according to the complaint. On June 11, Rolfe was reprimanded a third time by EPM CEO Eddie Perez. According to EPM, ""two employees reported Rolfe for calling employees 'fucking bitches, isaying an employee had only been hired becauseshe had 'big boobs,' and making racist comments.”Popular Information obtained a document from EPM memorializing the meeting between Perez and Rolfe. The ""Employee Warning Notice,"" dated June 11, cites Rolfe for ""gross misconduct."" According to that document Rolfe responded by ""saying thatshe doesn’tsee color, but thatsome people are 'idiots.'"" EPMsays that Perez ended the meeting after Rolfe became upset but told her he would continue investigating. The next day, Garrett Rolfe killed Rashard Brooks, and Melissa Rolfe took a paid leave of absence. But according to EPM, the investigation continued, and employees came forward with claims of ""wildly unprofessional and hostile conduct"" by Rolfe, including:Rolfe told an employee that another employee was a “dumb bitch” and that the only reason a man would be interested in her was becauseshe “mustsuck dick really good.”Rolfe told a Black woman who dates Black men thatshe needed “to get outside the box and upgrade [her]standards.”""We terminated Ms. Rolfe because, while in the workplace,she repeatedly made inappropriate and hostile comments to and about other EPM employees, which violated company policy, created an uncomfortable working environment, and resulted in a loss of confidence thatshe could perform her job as an HR director,"" EPM told Popular Information. The lawsuit filed by EPM also names the campaign of Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Republican running for Congress, as a defendant. Greene won the Republican nomination on Tuesday night. She has gained notoriety for her embrace of QAnon, a conspiracy theory that claims liberal Hollywood actors and Democratic politicians are running an international childsex-trafficking ring, and Trump is the only one who canstop them. Facebook has removedseveral of Greene is advertisements for making violent threats against Black Lives Matter protesters. EPM is lawsuit notes that Greene repeatedly claimed that Rolfe was fired because of the actions of herstepson. The lawsuit alleges that Greene ""coordinated the planting of a falsestory with Tucker Carlson Tonight,"" but does not provide evidence tosupport that allegation. Greene has appeared previously on Carlson isshow. On August 6, EPMsent Greene and her campaign a letter demanding a retraction. Greene responded by posting again onsocial media, claiming Melissa Rolfe was fired becauseshe defended herstepson. Do we know why Rolfe was fired? Number That will be determined in a court of law. But we know enough tosay thesimplestory presented on Tucker Carlson was reductive and misleading. Itsuggests weshould be more cautious making broad conclusions aboutsocietal trends based on one-sided anecdotes. Another anecdote that has been widely embraced by critics of cancel culture is the firing of David Shor. We are told that Shor, a 28-year-old political datascientist, was fired from his job at Civis Analytics for tweet inga research paper that concluded race riots reduced Democratic turnout in the 1960s. This claim is repeatedagain, andagain, andagain. If Shor was fired for tweeting an academic paper, thatseems unfair. But neither Civis Analytics nor Shor, whosigned a non-disclosure agreement, has confirmed he was fired for the tweet. ""These rumors are incorrect and unsubstantiated. Civis was founded on the principles of freespeech and the pursuit of truth through objectivescientific research, and that has not changed. This is an internal personnel matter, and out of respect for our employees and alumni, we won’t be commenting further,"" Civis Analytics toldThe Atlantic. Do we know why Shor was fired? Number But an unconfirmed anecdote is not evidence that oursociety has been turned upside down. This is important because the concept of ""cancel culture"" is being used to argue that ""protests for racial andsocial justice"" have gone too far because they have created ""a newset of moral attitudes and political commitments that tend to weaken our norms of open debate and toleration of differences in favor of ideological conformity."" We are told that ""institutional leaders, in aspirit of panicked damage control, are delivering hasty and disproportionate punishments instead of considered reforms.""Many people are treated unfairly. But there is little evidence that unfair treatment is now disproportionately impacting, for example,supporters of the police rather than minority groups. Freespeech is a bedrock principle of American democracy. But freespeech is not inconsistent with being held accountable for your words and actions.

Thestorm’s forecast track projects that Nana will continue west across the Caribbean Sea, passing near but north of the coast of Honduras on Wednesday. It will likely approach the coast of Belize on Wednesday night and early Thursday, according to the NHC’s public advisory. Nana is expected to make landfall over Belize as a Category 1 hurricane, and windshear is expected to limit its intensity, according to a forecast discussion. Nana, theseason’s 14th tropicalstorm, formed Tuesday about 120 milessouth-southwest of Kingston, Jamaica. As of 8 a.m., Nana was about 150 miles northeast of Limon, Honduras, moving west at 18 mph with top winds of 60. A Category 1 hurricane forms whensustained winds are in the range of 74 to 95 mph. Tropicalstorm-force winds extend outward up to 70 miles from Nana’s center, the hurricane centersaid. Northern Honduras and coastal Guatemala are under a tropicalstorm watch, thesouthern Yucatan Peninsula is under a tropicalstorm warning, and the entire coast of Belize is under a tropicalstorm warning and a hurricane watch. There have been four hurricanesso far in this busy Atlanticseason: Hanna, Isais, Laura and Marco. Laura was theseason’s first major hurricane, making landfall in Cameron, La., as a Category 4 on August 27. Hanna, Isias and Marco were Category 1 hurricanes that made landfall in Padre Island, Texas; Ocean Isle Beach, NC; and at the mouth of the Mississippi River, respectively. Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Omar is weakening over the open Atlantic. Omar, theseason’s 15th tropicalstorm, formed about 225 miles east of Cape Hatteras, NC, on Tuesday, about five hours after Nana, according to the NHC Tropical Storm Omar was about 350 miles northwest of Bermuda, the NHCsaid Wednesday in its 5 a.m. advisory. It was moving east-northeast at 14 mph, with 40 mph winds and higher gusts. It is not expected tostrengthen much and it is likely tosignificantly weaken throughout the day on Thursday, becoming a remnant low by Thursday night, the NHCsaid in its outlook. Thesystem is expected to continue its curve away from land, moving in a northeast to eastward motion off the US East Coast. An area of the Atlantic midway between the Windward Islands and the west coast of Africa is bustling with activity from two tropical waves. One is an area of low pressure withshowers and thunderstorms that isslowly becoming better organized, the hurricane centersaid. The other is expected to move off the coast of Africa on Wednesday and merge with a disturbance a couple hundred milessoutheast of the Cabo Verde Islands, the hurricane centersaid. If and when the disturbances merge, thesystem will develop and could become a tropical depression by the weekend as it movesslowly westward over the eastern tropical Atlantic Ocean. This is the time of year whenstorms tend to form in the open Atlantic, particularly near the Cabo Verde Islands. Thosestorms, which grow insize and intensity as they make the long trek westward across the Atlantic Ocean, are historically the most powerful and destructive hurricanes. The remaining monikers for namedstorms thisseason in the Atlantic are: Paulette, Rene, Sally, Teddy, Vicky and Wilfred. In August, the federal government issued an updated forecast for theseason,predicting as many as 25storms, which is more than the agency has ever forecast.

There have been reports of irregularities inseveral Wisconsin counties which raiseserious doubts about the validity of the results,” Trump campaign manager Bill Stepiensaid in astatement. “The President is well within the threshold to request a recount and we will immediately doso.”The Trump campaignsaid it would filesuit in Michigan to halt ballot counting until “meaningful access” is granted to “numerous counting locations to observe the opening of ballots and the counting process.”His campaign alsosaid it is “moving to intervene” in an existing case before the US Supreme Court over Pennsylvania’s extended deadline that allows mail-in ballots to be accepted through Friday as long as they were postmarked by November 3. And the president’s re-election campaign issuing to temporarilystop the vote count in Pennsylvania over claims of “transparency” issues. Stepiensaid in an afternoon press call that the campaign had “a high degree of confidence” that Trump would prevail in Pennsylvania.“In fact, we are declaring a victory in Pennsylvania,” Stepiensaid, even though the AP and major news networks have not called yet called the race. Earlier in the day, Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon projected confidence about Biden’s chances in most of the remainingswingstates after the former vice president flipped Arizona and one of Nebraska’s congressional districts from Trump, according to the AP.“Joe Biden is on track to win this election and he will be the next president of the USs,” O’Malley Dillonsaid in a briefing with reporters late Wednesday morning. “We believe we are on a clear path to victory. By this afternoon, we expect the vice president will have leads instates that put him over 270 electoral votes.”A handful of battlegrounds remained in play as ballot counting wore on Wednesday. Even as the AP called Wisconsin for Biden, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Nevada, North Carolina and Georgia remained up for grabs, and the Trump campaign pushed back on Arizona being called for the Democrat. The Biden campaignsaid it expects to “win” Nevada, Michigan and Pennsylvania, while O’Malley Dillon listed Georgia as a “toss-up” andsaid North Carolina was currently leaning toward Trump. Stepien, the Trump campaign manager, offered a different view of the map during a press call Wednesday morning as officialssaid they are “confident” in the president’s paths to re-election. Stepiensaid Trump is “in a very good position” —showing restraint just hours after the president addressedsupporters and the nation from the White House in the wee hours Wednesday andsaid, “Frankly, we did win this election.”“If we count the legal ballots, the president wins,” Stepiensaid. But O’Malley Dillon countered, “If Donald Trump got his wish and westopped counting ballots right now, Joe Biden would be the next president of the USs.”After losingseveralswingstates the campaign had made plays for, including Florida, Texas and Ohio, O’Malley Dillonsaid, “We did not believe the race was in that wide margin we wereseeing in the national polling numbers.”Shesaid the campaign “definitelysaw a number ofstates become more in play than we had even anticipated. Obviouslysome of those went to Trump. But those areswingstates,so we’re notsurprised.”O’Malley Dillonsaid the former vice president would likely address the nationsometime later Wednesday. Millions of ballots remained outstanding in Pennsylvania late Wednesday morning, where Governor Tom Wolfsaid, “We may not know the results even today, but the most important thing is that we have accurate results, again, even if that takes a little longer than we’re used to.”Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Bensonsaid in a press conference “we hope” the first unofficial tabulation “will comesometime within the next 24 hours” as ballots remain outstanding in major population centers. Massachusetts GOP Governor Charlie Baker, who “blanked” his presidential ballot, released astatement with Lt. Governor Karyn Polito Wednesday morning needling the president as they called for “every vote to be counted.”“Every American, regardless of political affiliation, especially the President and every candidate on the ballot,should be united insupporting this process,” the Republican leaders wrote, adding, “When the results are finally determined, we are hopeful that all candidates, especially the two running for the most powerful office in the world,set aside partisanship to improve the lives of all Americans.”",2,1,Boston Herald
241,Can Hierarchy Be Justified?,-33.0,29.0,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/08/can-hierarchy-be-justified,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,25,"The history of all hitherto existingsocieties is the history ofsome assholes telling everyone else what to do. There are people “at the top,” who rule, and there are people “at the bottom” who have to clean up those people’sshit. The people at the top always come up withsome reason why they deserve to be at the top. Their powers were bestowed by a divinity. They have the correct blood. They worked the hardest. They are Great Innovators whose wisdom and creativity is thesource of all wealth. They are Atlas carrying the whole world on their backs, and if they disappeared,society would fall apart. All of these justifications, needless tosay, are myths. They are exactly what yousay if you were a person in charge who didn’t want to feel any guilt. And nobody wants to feel like a bad person, even the assholes giving the orders,so they need to come up withsome picture of reality in which they are right for reasons beyond their might. As Max Weber put it,rightto his good fortune. He wants to be convinced he ‘deserves’ it and above all that he deserves it in comparison with others… Good fortune thus wants to be legitimate fortune.”There are a millionstories you can tell to legitimize yourstatus, using everything from cranialscience to graphsshowing astrongstatistical correlation between “you having all the power” andsome imaginary measure ofsocial well-being (e.g. “GDP”). The explanations don’t have to be very convincing, because one of the nice things about being in charge is that few people in your circle will dare to call you out when you are talking rubbish. Some people will be afraid to get on your badside, while others will be looking to flatter you into dispensing favor. But hardly anyone is going to rudely pop thesycophancy bubble by pointing out that your rationalizations for having more than everybody else are blatantly fallacious. For instance, King James, of Bible fame, anonymously published a book in 1598 called the which laid out whatseemed to him like asound argument for the Divine Right of Kings. He argued that “thestate of monarchy is thesupremest thing upon earth” because kings are “God’s lieutenants upon earth andsit upon God’s throne,” and thus, while “a good king will frame all his actions to be according to the Law; yet is he not bound thereto but of his good will.” The relationship of the king to the people was, James thought, like that of the head to the body, and he pointed out that whilesometimes we cut off a limb here and there if it gets gangrenous and unruly, few diseases lead us to cut off our heads:The phrase “motivated reasoning” comes to mind when considering James’ treatise arguing in favor of his own absolute power and exemption from the law. The British people were evidently not persuaded, as James’successor Charles I was indeed treated as an infirmity curable by the removal of the head. But the king was not the only one with a fixed position in the hierarchy. A Great Chain of Being ordered all matter, living and nonliving, from top to bottom. God, of course, was the Supreme Being. Next came angels, but all angels were not created equal, and there was a hierarchy ofsub-angels; StreetThomas Aquinasdivides them into 9 “choirs”: “angels, archangels, virtues, powers, principalities, dominations, op h anim [alias thrones], cherubim, andseraphim.” After the angelic choirs came the humans, where kingsstood highest, followed by princes, nobles, etc., with peasants taking their place at the bottom. The other animals followed us, and had their own rankings of greatest to least, with immobile do-nothing creatures like oysters at the bottom. (There weresub-categories withinsub-categories, with worm-eating birds thesuperior ofseed-eating birds, possibly due to winning a worm-eating bet.) Plants and vegetables followed animals, in a descending order from oak trees to moss. Lowest of all were the minerals, which had their own ranking from gemstones down tosoil, dust, andsand. All of this maysound rather risible, but before we laugh, weshould reflect on just how much of this mindset we have retained into the present day. Animals arestill considered lesser beings, most of whom cansimply beslaughtered at will, without any moral calculus whatsoever. Factory farming, despite thescale ofsuffering it inflicts, does not trouble most people’s consciences enough tos pend much time thinking about it. And the hierarchical orderings of humansocieties arestillso accepted as toseem like natural law. 44 countries arestill outright monarchies, but even the Chief Executive of thesupposedly democratic USs is endowed withsuch huge power that most of our political discourseseems to revolve around asingle person’s conduct. Workplacesare oftenstrict hierarchies, the justice and propriety of which cannot be questioned by those at the bottom, even though the justifications for the difference in power betweenJeff Bezosand Amazon fulfillment center workers are little more persuasive that appeals to the Great Chain of Being. Anarchist thinkers have always put “hierarchy” at the center of their diagnosis of what’s wrong with everything, becauseso much of what is unjust about everysociety doesseem to boil down to this onesimple fact: there aresome people who give the orders, andsome people who have to take the orders, and the people who give the orders are generally cruel,stupid, and/or greedy. Sometimes they got their position by birth, but even when they got it by “merit,” the main “merit” that usually distinguishes them is that they were more willing to trample on everybody else. Noam Chomsky describes the core of anarchist thinking as being based around a “presumption of illegitimacy” toward hierarchies, a principle thatsays if a hierarchy is based on tradition rather than reason, it needs to be gotten rid of:Peter Kropotkin, too, put hierarchy at the center of his analysis,saying that anarchism meant “refusing hierarchical organization” and authority, while embracing cooperativesocial customs:Hierarchy is common to bad governments, bad workplaces, bad relationships, and badschools. When we look atsocieties throughout history and feel disturbed, the reason is usuallysomething to do with hierarchy:some people were priests doing humansacrifices, while other people had to thesacrifices. In our own country,some people have beenslaves, others masters. Some people have been prisoners, others cops. Some are “non-citizens,” without basic rights, others are “citizens” who are Legitimate People. (Yes, the distinction between the citizens and non citizensshould be thought of as a formal castesystem, wherebysome people are more entitled to rights than others. It is only because we are used to it that we don’t comprehend how appalling it is to dividesociety into a hierarchy of “non-people” and “people” basedsolely on where they happened to be born.)Wherever you find distinctive ranked orders ofsocialstatus, andsome people with vastly more power and liberty than others, you find asituation thatshould be revolting to anyone who cares about universal justice. (That is, revolting to thesort of person who wants to beserved by oursocial arrangements, rather than having categories of “winners” and “losers.”) A truly just world has to be a democratic and egalitarian one, where hierarchies are minimized. But is there a casehierarchy? According to a new book from the Princeton University Press (which previously brought yousuch elitist classics asAgainst Democracy), there is indeed. Just Hierarchyby Daniel A Bell and Wang Pei argues that while explicit racial and gender hierarchies may be bad,some hierarchies are Actually Good and worth preserving. Bell and Pei believe that hierarchy as a concept has been unfairly maligned, and theyseek toshow that there are circumstances in which it is not only morally unobjectionable, but “can andshould govern differentspheres of oursocial lives… including our relations with loved ones.”Bell and Wang list five kinds of hierarchies theyseek to defend: hierarchies within intimatesocial circles, hierarchies amongst citizens, hierarchies of nations, hierarchies amongst animals, and hierarchies between human beings and robots. (We’ll note the curious absence of workplace hierarchies from this list: beyond a brief discussion of the relationship between employers and their nannies and housekeepers, the book does not discuss this topic at all, even though the workplace, for many people, is where petty tyranny is most keenly experienced.)Eachsubset of hierarchies is defended with different arguments. Hierarchies amongst “intimate persons”—that is, in relationships between partners, between parents and children, and between employers and domestics—are viewed as morally acceptable by Bell and Wangso long as there issome changing of roles over time. This wouldsuggestsomething quite radical in the case of domestic workers—namely that the rich would have to take care of their nannies’ childrensometimes—but Bell and Wang wriggle out of this bysaying that this reciprocity “may be asking too much of the employer.” Instead, the only actual “changing of roles over time” they envision is generational: perhaps the housekeepers’ children will be rich and the rich people’s children will end up housekeepers. (Extremely unlikely, but a good way for the rich to reassure themselves that the hierarchy is fair.) Their ultimate conclusion is that it’s fine to have a full-time housekeeper—who, notably, doesn’t get to keep their children in thesame house with your children—so long as you pay them well. Bell and Wang have a difficult time explaining why hierarchies within households are actually compared to the alternative of roughsocial equality. In thesphere of “intimate persons,” the justification for “hierarchy between partners”seems to boil down, laughably, to “it’s cool to periodicallyswitch who’s on top duringsex” (whichsure, fine, maybe that’s the kind of entry-levelsex advice that people who read politicalscience textbooks desperately need to hear), while the justification for the hierarchy between parents and children is based on the observation that elderly people are more appreciated insocieties where elders are owed deference within the familystructure. The authorsseem unable to grapple with the fact that “hierarchy,” fundamentally, is about the right to command obedience from others bysimple virtue of one’ssocial role. That family membersshould appreciate each other, listen to each other, and divide difficult tasks fairly amongst themselves is an obvious good, but why these characteristicsshould be optimally actuated by “hierarchy”—by investing certain people withsomespecific right of command, even a temporary one, over their loved ones—is not really explained. At best, hierarchyseems like a very roundabout manner of promoting warm familial feeling, and, at worst, a great way to keep people guiltily obligated to family members who don ot respect them. Meanwhile, although their examination of “hierarchy amongst citizens” emanates (by the admission of the authors, who are both professors at universities in China) from aspecifically Chinese context—drawing on the “Confucian” principles of imperial Chinese bureaucracy and modern Chinese administration—it’s nonetheless pretty much indistinguishable from the arguments in favor of meritocracy that are made by centrist commentators in the USs. The authors argue explicitly against democracy and in favor of governance by unelected experts. (Bell has written aseparate book called defending the enlightened despotism of the Communist Party assuperior to liberal democracy.) Too much democracy leads to populism, which is bad (cf. Donald Trump), hierarchical meritocracies are better because—once you get past pesky little problems like “nepotism” and “corruption”—they elevate people with talent and expertise, who are temperamentallysuited for public life. Bell and Wang concede that this framework does exclude most human beings from formal political participation in decisions that affect them. Butsince the decisions that will be made on their behalf will be good ones, because wise rulers naturally know what they are doing, this will not matter. The authorssuggest that people’s resultingsense of disenfranchisement can be combated through a) grassroots efforts to influence policymakers throughsuasion, and b) encouraging people to feel fulfilled by “non-political” things,such as pictures of cute dogs exchanged onsocial media. (Weshit you not, this was the actual example they used. There is even a photograph of a cute dog reprinted in the book, as an example of thesort of thing we can look at to distract ourselves from our political powerlessness.) Here, as opposed to Bell and Wang’s flimsy justifications for hierarchy in the home, it’s a little bit more obvious why the idea of hierarchy amongst citizens is at least, in a patronizingsort of way. Whowouldn’twant tosit around looking at pictures of animals all day while a group of highly virtuous publicservants ingeniously and invisibly disposes of all boring policy matters?The only problem, of course, is that it is ludicrous: these Virtuous Policy Fairies do not exist in reality, andso what is in fact being proposed is not even a hierarchy between “good bureaucrats” and “indulged masses,” but fundamentally unchecked power in the hands of thesort of people who excel atstandardized tests andsubtleself-promotion. Hierarchy amongst nations—the third of thesupposedly justified hierarchies—evidently involves major world powers politely paying “lip-service” to thesovereignty ofsmaller nations, while gradually drawing thosesmaller nations into their directsphere of influence and control through the use of diplomacy andsocial ritual. This, Bell and Wang argue, is morally justifiedso long as there issome meaningful reciprocity and fellow-feeling in the relationship between thestronger and weaker nations. There’s of course astrong element of “might makes right” here—big, powerful countries may justly rule because they are big and powerful. The recurring pattern we begin tosee, in these justifications of hierarchy, is that the “morality” of these hierarchies relies heavily on the notion that the person or decision-making entity in the higher hierarchical position will not be incompetent, thoughtless, orsociopathic, butsuggests no actual mechanisms for ensuring that this is the case. Like King James, theysay that these hierarchical arrangements will be good for the least well-off, but also like King James the argument is less based on appeals to evidence than appeals to tradition and religious text (in his case, Biblical authority, in Bell and Wang’s case, frequently Confucian ethics). Thesections of the book on animals and robots aresignificantly weirder, which issayingsomething for a book that has already usedsex positions as a philosophical justification forsocial dominance. The animals chapter aims toshow that animals and humans are not moral equals and that there is a hierarchy of concern for different animals:It is not clear with whom Bell and Wang are arguing here,since few people (even among radical animal rights advocates)see killing a mosquito as equivalent to killing a human being, and distinguishing between animals on the basis of their capacity tosuffer is broadly uncontroversial (though the deprioritization of “ugly” animals is obviously more questionable). Bell and Wang present a multi-page anecdote about the time Bell adopted a cat that ended up jumping out of a 22ndstory window, after which hesubsequently replaced the dead cat with another, which had diabetes, as part of an argument that people are morally permitted to regulate their pets’ activitiesso long as they treat them well—which is, again, a fairly widely-held position. But there’s a reason Bell and Wang include thisstrange chapter: by offering rigorous argumentation for a widely-accepted kind of “hierarchy,” they want readers to think that a general principle of hierarchy is justified. In other words, if we canshow that people accept the “humans over animals” part of the Great Chain of Being, it will be easier to get them to accept the “humans over other humans” part. The robots chapter,similarly, argues for a hierarchy most people would agree with: that of humans over machines. Bell and Wang make the case that artificial intelligenceshould be made toserve human ends, rather than human beings being made toserve artificial intelligence. Then things take a turn: theysuggest that the Chinese government alone is correct in its understanding of the purposes of artificial intelligence, that it is building a post-scarcity kind of communism in which robots will do all the labor. By contrast, Silicon Valley capitalists are reckless in their development of new technology: “the libertarian culture of Silicon Valley militates against anyserious attempt to curb research that threatens to develop… malevolent AI.” The finalsentence of the book (it has no formal “conclusion”) is: “If we are unlucky, the last war involving humans will be a clash between the Chinese Communist Party and Google’s unfriendly creation, and for thesake of humanity we need to pray for the victory of the CCP.”Thus, the book does not necessarily offer the best material for inquiring into the question of when hierarchies are just, for there are parts that make onesuspect it is mainly intended as an elaborate apologia for the Chinese Communist Party, published, again, by the Princeton University Press. (Possibly, weshould have abandoned our review of this book once we realized how bizarre it was, but by that point wesimply couldn’t tear ourselves away.) Many of the hierarchies the book defends are China-specific, and the writing can be digressive and the examples off-the-wall. Most of the evidence provided is laughably unsound. For instance, the authors note that in astudy, “an abstract diagram representing hierarchy was memorized more quickly than a diagram representing equality, and the faster processing led the participants to prefer the hierarchy diagram.” This might be a compelling case for the aestheticsuperiority of pyramids over lines, but it has very little to do with justice, ostensibly thesubject of the book. Bell and Wang alsosay that “the populist backlashes against elites empowerstrongmensuch as Donald Trump” thusshowing that “the effort to combat all forms of hierarchy will not only fail; it may lead tosomething worse from a moral point of view.” Butsurely if the backlash is against “elites,” what we have is an argumentagainsthierarchy; without a division into elite/non-elite, there is no grounds for a populist backlash to begin with. If people are resentful of “elites” who are above them and control them, then a more egalitariansociety would help reduce resentments. If we’re evaluating the main question, though, which is “have these five hierarchies been justified?” the answers wouldseem to be: 1) hierarchy between intimates—no, not at all, becausesex positions don’t legitimize the giving of commands to family and domestics; 2) hierarchy between citizens—also no,seems like a recipe for an unjust dictatorship; 3) hierarchy between nations—no,seems like proof by assertion; 4) hierarchy between humans and animals—sure, bugs are not people; 5) hierarchy between humans and robots—sure, but notsosure we cansign onto VICTORY TO THE GREAT CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY as a valid ultimate conclusion. So how we evaluate what the legitimate and illegitimate hierarchies are? Itseems easy tosay that thereshould be no “intimate hierarchies”: friends, partners, and family membersshould meet each other on equal footing, andshould give and expect mutual respect as individuals. Trying to treat other people well is a dynamicstruggle, and one always littered with daily failures. Hierarchical relationships and pre-assigned roles within households are not a realisticshortcut for avoiding these inevitable difficulties. That’s not tosay that people don’t fall into patterns or roles in their close relationships, but thisseems likesomething that peopleshould figure out one-on-one with their loved ones, according to their needs and temperaments. (To the extent that “respectfully figuring out relationship roles on a case-by-case basis” is what Wang and Bell mean by “intimate hierarchy,” this doesn’t reallyseem like a hierarchy at all, in the way the term’s conventionally understood.) As leftists, we can alsosay withsome confidence that global hierarchies in which wealthierstates exercise authority over poorer clientstates are normatively bad, although it’s much less clear how tostop that from happening (short of a revolution for disarmament and global labor reform, of course). But when thinking aboutsmaller political units—workplaces, neighborhoods, municipalities,states and provinces, perhaps countries—the question of whether hierarchies are “good” or “bad” doesstart to feel more muddled. Certainly, thereshould be a high burden to justify the existence of hierarchies, which inherently involve one person having power over another, or over many others; certainly, bland appeals to tradition are notsufficient justification. But even if you are an absolute egalitarian, practicallyspeaking, there’s a lot ofshit going on in the world at any given time, and itsimply isn’t possible to hold referenda on absolutely. The idea of a hierarchicalsystem that elevates the most talented and trustworthy people to decision-making positions is one that many people find deeply attractive, and in the USs, we’ve often conceived of electoral democracy as the best way to achieve this end. In the US conception of political “meritocracy,” the general theory is to elect political leaders with the right “vision” or “values,” whom we then trust tosurround themselves with people of appropriate “expertise.” Of course, as we all know, this frequently goes horribly wrong: the pool of candidates that voters choose amongst, and the pool of experts from which those candidates then choose their advisors,staff, and other appointees, are bothshaped by a whole host of factors that have nothing to do with goodness or talent, and a lot more to do with things like wealth, ambition, and luck. Elections produce better results on average than pure nepotism because they containsome limited element of randomness—thesystem undergoes ashake-up at fixed periods during which new people, potentially, can enter. But in this country, electionsstill haven’t managed to produce governments on the national orstate level that resemble the composition of the general population in any way: lawmakers and executives are mostly rich (as well as mostly white, and mostly male), and their choice of expertstaff reflects their own interests and biases. In this way, our governing hierarchies arestatic in form and also frequentlystatic in content. Some people, admittedly, think that this is a feature, not a bug: the “steady hand at the wheel.” But if climate change, vast economic inequality, mass incarceration, and a precarious, unfranchised immigrant populationsound like a badstatus quo, then thesestable hierarchies in which power is always concentrated in the hands of thesam eof person, over and over, are clearly harmful. One way around this problem is to dismantle the hierarchy itself as much as possible, and create processes for participatory decision-making that involve the people affected by a given problem. However, there’s always a problem ofscale: as the number of people affected by asingle policy or decision becomes larger, direct participation becomes more and more unwieldy. In that case, to the extent we think thatsome decisions do need to be made atsuch ascale, it may be hard to get around havingsome hierarchy of decision-makers. Staffing these arguably necessary hierarchies through non-electoral “meritocracies,” as Bell and Wangsuggest, means reposing a naïve level of trust in the goodness of unaccountable bureaucrats; but we also concede that elections (of nominal decision-makers, who then choose bureaucrats that are accountable only to them) tend to not produce brilliant results, either. A third option, which wesubmit to be the least of these three evils, is to make the appointment of decision-makers as random as possible, with astrictly fixed term limit. We’ve previously written about “sortition”—randomselection by lot—from the general population as being the best conceivable way to create a demographically representativesenate, one that’sslightly lesssusceptible to monied interests than previous electedsenates. In thesame way,sortition could be used to fill a variety of decision-making positions. But one reason hierarchy isso enduringly appealing is that the creation of effective non-hierarchical institutions is incredibly difficult, and even institutions thatstart off being egalitarian have a tendency to turn hierarchical over time (thesociological concept of the “iron law of oligarchy” is that an oligarchy always emerges no matter how much you try to do to prevent an oligarchy emerging). Occupy Wall Street, which operated on an anti-hierarchicalstructure, was in many ways phenomenallysuccessful in the face of extraordinarystate challenges and repression, but alsostruggled with the difficulty of trying to organize without leadership. Many of the internal disputes that have riven the left, like the conflict between Marxists and anarchists, have involved arguments over the legitimacy of hierarchy, and whether it is possible or desirable to pursue thesocialist project without it. Yet while hierarchy is an enduring feature ofsocieties, and it is not yet possible to envision a perfectly non-hierarchical world, a fairstarting point is to treatsocial hierarchies as presumptively illegitimate. If we now recognize that King James was full ofshit when he claimed a divine right to be exempt from the law, weshouldsuspect that there are plenty of justifications for hierarchy in our own time that might fall apart underscrutiny. Bell and Wang’s weird-ass bookshows how empty many of the justifications for hierarchy are; they often come down to “the boss is the boss because he’s the boss, do you think you could do a better job than the boss?” Hierarchicalsocial orders are asserted to besuperior without any examination of what the non-hierarchical alternative would look like, or much evidence (beyond anecdotes and a generalized terror of “the mob”) thatsuch an alternative would be less functional. The hypothesis weshould work under is that hierarchies tend to be great for people endowed with the power to give the commands, and less great for those whose job is to obey. The elimination of hierarchy would tend to improve the lot of the vast majority of us, but especially the millions of human “minerals” at the bottom of our present-day Great Chain of Being.",0,1,Current Affairs

I’d really hoped that atsome point during the ceremony,Barack Obamahadstood up tospeak, taking the mi c in hand assometimes he liked to do. I wanted to hear himsay, in hisstudied faux “urban” way: “My fellow Americans, there’ssomething I’ve wanted toshare with you for eight long years. I think now’s at last the moment.” He’d pull out a piece of yellowed paper, a government document. “Yousee this? It’s myGood lucksortingthatout. Peace out!” Then he’d drop the microphone andsaunter offstage, cackling to himself. So he would never have been constitutionally eligible for election. Had he ever really been president? American lawyers would have billed tens of millions of hours figuring out whether or not the laws he’dsigned, theSupreme Courtappointees he’d picked, were in fact legitimate. Or would we need an eight-year “do-over”? That part would have been fun. The reason I can joke about the “birther” business is that it was neverserious. Hillary Clinton’steam had disseminated or concocted it during the primaries, and a few Republicans grabbed it. But the Democrats neversaw it as aserious threat, for lack of evidence. Most Republicans treated it as a ridiculous distraction. (Trump, by contrast, talked it up — primarily I think as a cynical way to attract a following. It worked.) So while a few race-hustlers tried to cast it as “racist” (in which case Hillary’s team was racist), most people dismissed it. I used to joke about it, precisely because I knew it wasn’t real. So did Obama himself. He laughed the “birther”story off because he considered it baseless. He took office in 2009 without ashadow of genuine doubt over his legitimacy. Yes, a lot of us felt like he was un-American, but not because of his race or his (rumored) birthplace. We felt that way because his politics were rooted inpost-colonialMarxist resentment. Because his long-timespiritual mentor (who performed his wedding and baptized his children) hadsaid “God DAMN America!” (Here’s newly “elected”senator Raphael Warnock of Georgiapraising that Jeremiah Wrightspeech.) And because he promised to “fundamentally transform” America. Which we didn’t think needed asex change, as he did. Birtherism was a falsehood. But it encapsulated politics which were all too real. Wesaw them arise again in the attack on our nation’s public monuments, and the deadly 2020 riots Democrats (almost to a man) excused or endorsed. You know what Obama didn’t do in 2009? What no Democrats did? There follows a list of measures the Democrats didn’t take in the build-up to Obama’s inauguration:If the Democrats and their allies had done all those things and more, you know what we might have concluded? That there really wassomething to “Birthergate.” Why else were the Dems acting like a bunch of twitchy Mafiosi,shredding documents and running in circles at the firstsight ofRudy Giuliani? That’s not how innocent people and organizations act. So why are leftist elitesso panicked about election 2020? Why are they treating the breach of the US Capitol like the 1933 Reichstag Fire, and effectively trying to crush any opposition andsuspend the Constitution?The Democrats in 2008 didn’t try to block any legalscrutiny over Obama’s place of birth, then to disbar the lawyers who’dsued them. They didn’t use all their power to “cancel” and personally destroy those whospread the claim that Obama was born in Kenya. Theysimply provided what documents they had, andshrugged, with apparently clean consciences, at further doubts. From that fact alone, more than anything else, I personally came to believe them. That’s not how they’re acting now. The way Democrats (and weak-kneed NeverTrumpsurrender monkeys) have behavedsince the 2020 vote tells a very differentstory. What it tells me, most crucially, is this: The Democrats cheated, know they cheated, and by it gained one-party rule in America. Our elites, including the media, know this too. But they’re glad it happened. Anything, anything, to kick Orange Man to the curb. And tosilence the Deplorable half of the country thatsupports him. AND to put everyone on notice thatThe Hivewill never tolerate aserious threat to its power again. The Democrats fully intend to cheat again next time — two years from now in Congress, then four years from now for the White House. And they want to pre-emptively cow andsilence anyone who dares to question their cheating. (“NiceIvy League degree you got there. Be a realshame ifsomething happened to it.”)For decades Democrats dismissed any efforts at ballotsecurity as evidence of “racism.” Now they can also call it “dangerous,” an “incitement to riot.” Some even will dare call it “treason.”If following the procedures in the Constitution for validating elections be treason, then let’s make the most of it. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich certainly is. He’s not backing down under The Hive’s concerted pressure.

It was all clearly documented in the Texas lawsuit, which was declined by the US Supreme Court based on Texas’ proceduralstanding — not the merits of the case. That’s the election. In addition, it’s clear that virtually everyswingstate essentiallysuspended normal requirements for verifying absentee ballots. Rejection rates were an order of magnitude lower than in a normal year. In Georgia, rejection rates dropped from 6.5% in 2016 to 0.2% in 2020. In Pennsylvania, it went from 1% in 2016 to .003% in 2020. Nevada fell from 1.6% to .75%. There is no plausible explanation other than that they were counting a huge number of ballots — disproportionately for Mr. Biden — that normally would not have passed muster. That’s the election. So by all means enjoy the mock-inauguration of a corrupt,senile hack as the fruit of ballot-boxstuffing and fake COVID panic. But remember that now we all live in a tinpotBananas Republic.

But from resisting racist exclusion to building CIO unions in the 1930s, Mexican American workers have been central to left-wing politics in the USs. Workers Alliance leader Emma Tenayucaspeaks to a crowd outside San Antonio City Hall, March 8, 1937. (UTSA Special Collections)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. On January 29, 1911, a coalition of Mexican revolutionaries and members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a US-based anti-capitalist labor union, crossed the border between California and the Mexicanstate of Baja California to launch what would come to be known as the Baja Insurrection. Many of the Mexicans belonged to the Partido Liberal Mexicano (PLM), which had announced its intentions of toppling Mexican dictator Porfirio Díaz, transferring the ownership of factories to their workers, and returning lands to Indigenous communities. Driven from Mexico to the USs by Díaz, the PLM had foundsolidarity with the IWW, whichsimilarly advocated for workers’ control of production. Growing from asmall band of less than two dozen revolutionaries to hundreds of PLM members, theirsupporters (including Indigenous tribespeople), and IWW members, the insurrectionistsseized the towns of Mexicali, Algodones, Tecate, and Tijuana, opening an early northwestern front in the Mexican Revolution. The insurrectionaries weresupported by arms and funds from US radicals, including the Socialist Party — which, combined with the prospect of thousands of US-based Mexicans joining the revolution, pushed president William Taft to act. Twenty thousand US troopssealed the border, while the US Navysecured access to ports in Baja California for Díaz’s forces. The insurrectionists held out forsix months, but, without any means of reinforcing or resupplying themselves, ultimately quit the campaign. Some of themsubsequently flocked to the banner of Francisco Madero, a centrist, US-backed opponent of Díaz, but those who had crossed the border weresummarily arrested by US authorities for violating neutrality laws. Whileshort-lived, the Baja Insurrection illustrates many of the characteristics that define the historic role of Mexicans in the US left: radical, transnational, and often targeted forsteep government repression. Jacobincontributor Arvind Dilawar recentlyspoke with Justin Akers Chacón about his book on the history of transnational Mexican working-classstruggle,Radicals in the Barrio, about how participants in the Mexican Revolution brought their experiences to the early US labor and civil rights movements, and the vital position that women occupied in Mexican radicalism. Their conversation has been lightly edited for clarity and brevity. How would you define the barrio? What role did the USs play in creating the barrio bothstateside and in Mexico?Barrios, within the context of early twentieth-century US history, refer to the formation of Mexican working-class communities that developed along migration corridors and in proximity to capitalist industries, particularly agriculture, mining complexes, railroad hubs, fisheries, and factories. Along the California coast, for instance, you have barrios dotting the road map of the multi billion dollar harvest corridor thatstretches from the Imperial Valley [insoutheastern California] to the San Joaquin Valley [part of the Central Valley]. Others tookshape or expanded in proximity to fisheries and canneries (San Diego), near garment factories (Los Angeles, Dallas) and railroad hubs (South Texas, Chicago), and near the Cotton Belt in Texas (San Antonio). Historic Mexican barrios havestretched from Arizona mining towns to the Yakima Valley in Washington State, east across Colorado’s hard andsoft rock mining regions, near thesugar beet farm complexesspanning the Great Plainsstates, and into the environs of Chicago’s transcontinental rail yards and beyond. Some of the oldest barrios in the contemporary Southwest actually predate US conquest and colonization. For instance, San Diego was established as a Spanish Catholic missionary project through the forceful colonization and attempted conversion of the original Indigenous Kumeyaay people beginning in 1769, and Los Angeles was founded as a land-grant concession to Mexican migrants (mostly Indigenous and African-descendent people from Mexico City) by the Spanish Colonial government in 1781. It’s impossible to understand barrio formation without understanding the long andsordid history of US colonialism and imperialism in what is today thesouthwestern USs, especially in thesecond half of the nineteenth century. The US invasion of Indigenous and Mexican lands began with the uprising ofslave holders in Coahuila y Tejas in 1835 and was followed in 1846 by full-scale military invasion. This opened up a period of more than half a century of conquest andsettler-colonialism across the West and Southwest. Conquest then continued in the form of economic imperialism, through which US capitalists exported vaststocks of capital and consolidated control over much of the Mexican economy. This induced widespreadsocial and economic displacement within Mexico, as the exploitation andsale of Mexico’s vast natural resources were repatriated as profits for US investors. This transformation of Mexico into a resource colony of the USs pushed over a million displaced Mexican people to migrate north over the first three decades of the twentieth century alone. US economic domination and political and military meddling was entrenched by the turn of the century, and the USstate played kingmaker in Mexican politics, backed by US Marines. These factors contributed to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution in 1910. After the US invaded Mexico in 1846 and annexed its northern half in 1848 — today’s Southwest — the federal andstate governments treated the conquered inhabitants thesame way as it did other Indigenous peoples in the path ofsettler-colonialism: through violent dispossession from the land, disenfranchisement from the politicalsystem, and racialized proletarianization andsegregation. Barrio, which means “neighborhood” in Spanish, now meantsomething different: poverty and underdevelopment. Indigenous people were forced onto reservations and Mexicans could only live within racially restricted neighborhoods that weresystematically impoverished and marginalized, excluded from civil and political participation, and brutally over-policed to keep peoplesubjugated. How did Mexican radicals fuse Indigenous traditions with European ideologies to arrive at their own unique politics? How did those politics differentiate Mexican radicals from their Anglo counterparts?Many radicals operating within Mexican territory in the early twentieth century were Indigenous people or had Indigenous roots, with ties and networks connecting to Indigenous communities. One cannot fully understand Mexican history — especially the deep-rooted resistance of the people and episodes of rebellion and revolution — without identifying the centrality of Indigenous people within that history. Indigenous communities resisted the dictatorship of Porfirio Díaz in Mexico over its four-decadespan (1876–1910), especially when the government began tosell off largeswathes of their communal and ancestral lands to foreign investors in the 1880s as part of its drive to build Mexican capitalism following the US model. By the early 1900s, Indigenous radicals from different groups across the country had joined (and formed a large part of the ranks of) the proto-socialist movement founded in 1901 as the Partido Liberal Mexicano, under the leadership of the Flores Magón brothers: Ricardo, Enrique, and Jesús. In most cases, Mexican Indigenous people did notsee themselves as Mexican or part of the nation, but rather victims of it. In understanding the dynamics of revolutionary movement-building in Mexico, the radicalsocialist left developing around the Flores Magón brothers understood and embraced this in their internationalist framework. The Flores Magón brothers were radicalized while attending college in Mexico City, but also drew from their own cultural knowledge and experiences. Their father was an Indigenous elder in their hometown in the Mexicanstate of Oaxaca, and they came of age learning the important tenets of collectivism, reciprocity, other forms of communal obligation, and mutual well-being. They developed their radical philosophies by reading European texts available at the time (Karl Marx, Mikhail Bakunin, Pierre-Joseph Proudhon, etc.), while also following newsstories and instances of Indigenous rebellion happening across the nation, which were becoming more widespread in the 1890s. They refracted their vision of communism through the Indigenous courage to act and power to resist, and the real-to-life models of how it could work within their Mexican Indigenous context. Unlike their Anglo and European counterparts, most of whom embraced the tenets of American exceptional ism and ignored the plight of Indigenous populations, themagonistasmade the Indigenousstruggle a central component of the classstruggle. Theysituated the importance and relevance of Indigenous liberation andstruggle alongside those of the industrial and rural working classes. Aside from Indigenous people forming their ranks and providing bases ofsupport, the magonist assupported and helped organize and coordinate revolt in defense of Indigenous lands, and returned ancestral lands to the people in the few instances when their insurrections weresuccessful during the revolutionary period. The direct participation of magonist as insupport of Mexican revolutionary leader Emiliano Zapata and his Army of the South played an influential role in the development of the Plan de Ayala, in which the Zapatistas pledged to restore allstolen Indigenous lands over the course of the revolution. Mutualistas— mutual aid organizations —served as multipurpose vehicles for the Mexican working class, approximating labor unions during times of workplacestrife and civil rights advocacy groups during periods of racial persecution. Why were mutualist as at the center of radical Mexican politics?The economy of late nineteenth-century Mexico was characterized bysocial underdevelopment, underwritten by imperialism. Unions were outlawed by the Mexicanstate to maintain low wages and a high rate of exploitation for foreign capital. Under these conditions, the working class had to develop its own means and methods ofself-sufficiency, mutualsupport and reliance, and reciprocity to meet the basic needs that were not provided by thestate or nongovernmental institutions. These included burialservices, medical plans,support for destitute or disabled members, etc. In their initialself-help form, mutualist as were tolerated by thestatesince they posed no threat. They could even be co-opted by thestate for political patronage purposes, trading demonstrations of political loyalty in exchange for benefits and rewards. Nevertheless, the class-based infrastructure of mutualist as — collectivist practices, reciprocal obligations, family and kinship relations, and overlapping memberships within the working classes in local industries — meant that they could also become mechanisms for organizingstrikes and other actions at the point of production. By the turn of the century, economic and political crisis and growingsocial inequality led to the formation of explicit “labor mutualistas,” which represented the evolution fromself-help to class-conscious, working-class defense organizations. In the USs, Mexicans brought their mutualist a traditions with them and reconstituted them across the Southwest. This practice continued as a response to the racism experienced by Mexicans and thesystematic neglect andsocial underdevelopment of the barrios. Also, withsome exceptions, most US-based unions, especially the American Federation of Labor, largely ignored or excluded Mexican workers, leaving them to their own devices. The mutualist a organizations that formed across western USstates in the first three decades of the twentieth century formed the class base and functional networks for the growth andspread of the radical and revolutionary Mexican left in the US in that period, especially the magonist as of the PLM, as well as the IWW Later, the Mexican working-class rank-and-file members of these organizations were pivotal to the organization and growth of a new labor federation, the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), in Mexican communities across the Southwest from the 1930s to early 1950s. What role did repression play in catapulting Mexican women in particular to the forefront of these movements? How did they overcome the machismo of Mexican culture and the early left more generally?It’s important to recognize that machismo has been a feature and function of labor exploitation embedded in US capitalism from its inception, and has impacted women across all cultures. Not only have women historically been paid less for thesame work, but racialized labor exploitation has meant that women of color are paid even less than white women. Mexican women, alongside black women, were paid the lowest wages within the formal economy. By the 1930s, Mexican women constituted asubstantial part of the working class within the gendered divisions of labor that characterized industry and employment in the Southwest. For instance, women were the majority of workers in canning and packing, garment manufacturing, and nut-shelling, as well as in domesticservice, laundryservice, cigar-making, and a variety of othersectors. During World War II, Mexican women became a large contingent of the labor force in wartime industries. Mexican women were at the forefront ofsome of the most important episodes of militant labor organizing andstrike efforts. From the barrios, they emerged as mass leaders, radical theorists, and national figures within the Communist Party and the CIO Their leadership at many junctures of the rising labor movement during the period impacted the thinking of many men, created the basis for wider discourse on gender andsex equality, and challenged the patriarchalstructures of the unions and political organizations. For example, women cannery workers negotiated the first union contracts to guarantee equal pay for all workers regardless ofsex, race, or nationality, paid maternity leave, and Spanish-language rights provisions guaranteeing bilingual publication of contracts, work notifications, and all other company documentation. In fact, you cansee how the concept of civil rights first emerges in the hard-fought laborstruggles and union contract guarantees won at the point of production at this time. Because of their resilience and militancy, Mexican women were brutally repressed alongside the men. There is a long history of police violence against Mexican people in the barrios, including women and children. Labor unions and worker-led civil rights organizations at the time,such as the Workers Alliance in San Antonio and the Congress of Spanish-Speaking Peoples in Los Angeles, organized their communities to battlestrike-breaking police and to resist and oppose the racist brutality that they experienced on a daily basis. In numerousstrikes, women were at the forefront of blocking and fightingscabs andsquaring up against the police. They also protested and organized against la migra(immigration authorities), as people were routinely arrested and deported during the Great Depression, with agents directly targetingstrikers, union organizers, and political radicals. Insome instances,state repression of male workers led to circumstances where women carried astrike orstruggle forward. From 1908 to 1911, during the Mexican Revolution, women in the PLM were leading and coordinating a transnational movement from the Southwest to the interior of Mexico, as the male leadership faced constant police harassment and incarceration. In the 1950 Empire Zincstrike in New Mexico (memorialized in the filmSalt of the Earth), the wives ofstriking miners took over after the corrupt local government declared thestrike illegal and threatened the men with arrest if they maintained their picket lines. In crucial junctures of US labor and radical history, Mexican working-class people have often been at the forefront — with women in the foreground. What forces pushed Mexican workers to the forefront of both the labor and early civil rights movements? Why has their participation in these movements been under-acknowledged?It’s important to understand the close proximity to Mexico and the particular conditions of conquest, imperialism, and migration that led to thesubstantial growth of a Mexican working class within and across the USs by the 1920s. Mexicans became the largestsection of the working class across major industries — agriculture, mining, railroad, and, in many cases, urban manufacturing. They weresystematically oppressed across the economy to the point where the lowest wage insectors was colloquially referred to as the “Mexican wage.” Under these conditions, Mexican were often the first to down tools or to join others who didso. Their tendency toward explosive resistance and instincts toward organization and collective action was also a result of many workers’ participation in the Mexican Revolution. Many workers brought their experience in revolutionary armies and radical unions and revolution-era organizations with them into the farm, mining, and railroad camps. This experience, politicization, and accumulated knowledge was activated and deployed during periods of conflict and classstruggle. The proclivity of Mexican worker militancy and leadership in classstruggle was recognized by farsightedsocialists, anarchists, and communists. These radicals learned and understood Mexican workers as an essential component of any radical labor movement or revolutionary transformation. There were various efforts by these radicals to recognize, document, andsteer their organizations or unions toward understanding,supporting, and acting insolidarity with Mexican workers. Despite episodes of convergence between radical and revolutionary organizations with upsurges in Mexican laborstruggle, these have been followed by massivestate repression or ruptures and decline. This includes the growth of the IWW through its merging with the PLM in the Southwest between 1909 and 1916, which was crushed by a nationwide campaign ofstate terror and deportation; the building of Communist Party organizations in Mexican barrios across the Southwest in the 1930s, followed by federal andstate anti-communist campaigns to repress and deport Mexican Communists and labor leaders; and the inclusion of tens of thousands of Mexican workers into the CIO by the late 1940s, followed by a full-scale mobilization by thestate to destroy the predominantly black and Mexican CIO unions as part of the McCarthyite campaign to drive radicals out of the CIO and union movement altogether. In each of these episodes, Mexican and Central American labor leaders and Communists were deported en masse. McCarthyism represented a convergence of organized anti-communism and Jim Crow whitesupremacist reaction. The history and knowledge of these episodes of mass Mexican labor upsurges and radicalism have been erased and buried. Radical and Marxist Chicanas and Chicanos, politicized in the civil rightsstruggles of the 1960s and 1970s, began the process of reconstructing and reconnecting to this Mexican working-class history. The massstrikes, walkouts, and marches for immigrant rights and amnesty centered on May Day 2006 awoke a new generation to the power and transformational potential of the Mexican working class in the USs, as well as Central American and Caribbean workers.

249,The Polls Showed Democrats Poised to Reclaim the Senate. Then Came Election Day.,-9.25,46.0,https://insideclimatenews.org/news/05112020/senate-republicans-majority-over-democrats-climate-change/,https://adfontesmedia.com/inside-climate-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-05,21,"The dreams of climate-concerned Americans who had hoped voters would hand Democrats control of the Senate—along with the power to act on a climate agenda—were all but dashed in the election, despite bitterly fought campaigns from Maine to Arizona. Democrats went into the election targeting half a dozen or more Republican incumbents, needing only to pick up threeseats. Former astronautMark Kellyin Arizona and former Colorado Governor John Hickenlooperin Colorado took big early leads on election night, when it looked like thatscript might play out. But then key Republican incumbents held off their Democratic challengers—Sens. Joni Ernstin Iowa,Lindsey Grahamin South Carolina,Susan Collinsin Maine, and most likelyThom Tillisin North Carolina andDan Sullivanin Alaska.

While there werestill technically pathways for Democrats to pick up a couple ofseats, they appeared late Wednesday to be longshots at best, leavingsome climate activists distraught.“I have a really dreadful feeling about this election,”said Khadija Khokhar, an organizer for Zero Hour, a youth-led climate and justice organization. “There isso much work to do.”There was a lot atstake for the climate and the economy in an election year that produced record-setting hurricane and wildfireseasons. Across the West, energy and climate change was a leading issue for many voters. They lived through drought, heat waves and forest fires thissummer. Some of them fretted over declines in the energy industry and the potential cost of clean energy. Democrats willstill control the House of Representatives, where they are likely to continue to press for action on climate change. Expertshavesaid that in a Republican-controlled Senate, therestill could besome less ambitious climate legislation. But Republicans have notso far put forward any comprehensive climate plans.“None of the Republican programs we haveseen would get you anywhere near the emissions reductions required, given thescience around climate change,”said David Konisky, a professor in the School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University. Scientistshavesaid that to keep global temperatures from rising beyond acceptable limits, there’s a global need to get to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Perhaps the most telling upset that never happened was in Kentucky, where Senate Majority LeaderMitch McConnellkept his job, despite a fossil fuels agenda, his defense of Trump’s anti-science and deregulatory policies and no plan for climate change. McConnell, 78, was rewarded with aseventh term bysoundly defeating Democrat Amy McGrath, despite her $80 million warchest.“I am glad they decided our arguments were better than hers,” hesaid Wednesday. Anticipating the Senate race outcomes would go Republicans’ way, hesaid, “If my math is correct, I willstill be the offensive coordinator.”The current Republican majority is 53. For Democrats tosecure a 51-vote majority, they would have needed a net gain of three Republicanseats plus a tie-breaking vote by a Democratic vice president, Kamala Harris, assuming a win by former Vice President Joe Biden in the presidential race. If President Trump wins, the Democrats would need to net fourseats previously held by Republicans. But, by Wednesday evening, Democrats watched nearly all their hopesslip away. Sen. David Perdue’s continued to comfortably lead DemocraticchallengerJon Ossoff with 50.3 percent of the vote as the final ballots were being counted in Georgia, thus potentially avoiding a January 5 runoff election. In the race for Georgia’s other Senateseat, Democrat Rev. Raphael Warnock led a crowded field in aspecial election and will face incumbent Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler in a January 5 runoff,since neither collected more than 50 percent of the vote. Loeffler was appointed by Georgia Governor Brian Kemp to fill theseat vacated late last year by Johnny Isakson. Warnock, a vocal environmental and climate justice advocate, received considerably fewer votes than Loeffler and her main challenger, Republican Rep. Doug Collins, illustrating the challenge Warnock will face in January. The widely respected Cook Political Reportsaid Democrats’ “razor-thin hopes” of regaining control of the Senate would hinge on Georgia runoffs in January if the Perdue-Ossoff race also requires a runoff—and then Democrats would have to defeat both GOP incumbents, Perdue and Loeffler. Going into Tuesday’s election, climate voters revelled in the likelihood that a national climate policy might finally be on the near horizon as pollsters projected that Democrats had a good chance of winning the Senate majority and positioning Congress to reduce carbon emissions and advance clean energy. Nate Silver’s FiveThirtyEight website had given Democrats a 78 percent chance of flipping the Senate. And the Cook Report had concluded that Democrats were the clear favorites to take back the Senate with just days to go until Election Day. But on Wednesday, the Cook report had a new analysis. It called the outlook for Warnock “ominous” in the runoff, while noting the Democrats’ failures in “multiple avenues of flipping the Senate” and that, “in all likelihood,” Republicans would hold on. “In races that Democrats were bullish on and even Republicanssounded very wary about holding in the final days, everything came up red.”Republicans went on a roll. In Iowa, Ernst, who hash adasignificant relationship with Big Oil,survived an embarrassing moment during a debate with Democrat Theresa Greenfield, where Ernst failed to know the break-even price ofsoybeans. In Maine, Collins, who has thestrongest voting record on climate among Senate Republicans, won a fifth term by defeating Democrat Sara Gideon in what the Portland Press Heralddescribedas “an intensely negative contest.”Big environmental groups like the Sierra Club and League of Conservation Voters that hadabandonedCollins for Gideon now find themselves in the position of having to rebuild their bridges with her. Republicans also took back the Senateseat in Alabama held by Doug Jones, with a victory by a former football coach, Tommy Tuberville, who argued that only God can control the climate. And one of most closely watched and expensive Senate races was inSouth Carolina, where Graham, aself-styled climate champion with little toshow for his rhetoric, defeated a well-funded Jaime Harrison, a Democrat who hadset fundraising records.“To those who have been following this race, I hope you got the message,” Grahamsaid during his victoryspeech. “If you don’t get this message, it’s hopeless. The message I got: people like what I am doing and I am going to keep doing it. I am going back to the Senate with a purpose.”Part of that purpose, hesaid, was to “do everything I can tostop the radical agenda coming from Nancy Pelosi’s House.”Coming into the race, mostscenarios for Democrats taking back the Senatestarted with Hickenlooper beating Sen. Cory Gardner and Kelly, a retired astronaut married to former Rep. Gabby Giffords, defeating Sen. Martha McSally in Arizona. They were able to do that. During his campaign this year, Hickenlooper—whosome progressives had dubbed “Frackenlooper”—managed to transform his reputation as a fossil fuel-industrysupporter into a candidate pledging to fight climate change. Gardner hadsought to dodge the anti-climate label applied to the GOP.“Fromstart to finish, the race for the Senate in Colorado has been about public lands and addressing climate change,”said Gene Karpinski, president of the national environment-focused political action committee, the League of Conservation Voters. Hickenlooper was also endorsed by the Protect Our Winters Action Fund, a climate action group led by outdoor athletes, which noted that “Colorado’s wintersports tourism economy is in harm’s way due to climate change.” The fund also backed Kelly, noting that he “hasspoken favorably of a carbon tax.”In Arizona, Kelly told voters during the campaign how his views on climate and the environment wereshaped by his experiences inspace. He pledged to usescience and data as tools to help tackle climate change and facilitate Arizona’s transition to renewable energy. In Montana, a tight race went to incumbent Republican US Sen. Steve Daines, who fought off a challenge by Democratic Governor Steve Bullock in an intense battle that left many Montanans eager for the campaignseason to end. In Mississippi, Governor Tate Reevessaid national political pundits and pollsters that had forecast a good night for Democrats got it wrong once again in the race between Republican Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith and Democrat Mike Espy, a charismatic Black candidate and former Agriculture Secretary.“We are going to electsomeone who is going back to Washington andstill be in the majority,” Reevessaid at a victory celebration for Hyde-Smith, who easily defeated Espy by 13 percentage points.“It was the Second Amendment that was on the ballot tonight,”said Hyde-Smith, who had tied her fortunes to Trump’s agenda andsupported production of Mississippi’s and the nation’s energy resources, including biofuels. “It wassocialism that was on the ballot.”James Bruggers covers the US Southeast, part of Inside Climate News’ National Environment Reporting Network.

250,GOP senators push double-decker welfare program,20.75,18.75,https://www.conservativereview.com/news/gop-senators-push-double-decker-welfare-program/,https://adfontesmedia.com/conservative-review-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,12,"President Trump needs to be reelected in 2020, but the Republican Party makes it harder to doso when they mimic the lunatic Left. As a grassroots conservative, the most frustrating thing to have to deal with come election time is to promote a candidate or back a Republican for reelection to gain or maintain a majority, when you know darn well that candidate or incumbent could backslide into thestupid and inexplicable positions owned by the Left. We actually have a president who has identified the problem when he famouslysaid, “America will never be asocialist country.” We are at a point in time where the Left is no longer hiding the fact that they aresocialists and unfortunately too many of the American populace are already, or on their way to being convinced, that top-down government control of their lives is exactly what they’ve been waiting for. But why oh why do we have tosit here and watch the Republican Party championsocialism while we have the winning message thatsocialism will destroy America?I could not believe my eyes when I read that Senators Mike Lee, R-Utah, and Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, actually proposed a paid family leave act with the acronym “CRADLE.” Who read that and didn’t think, “cradle to grave?” And as we are trying to point out how terriblesocialism is, thesenators, their aides and their mouthpieces in the media are trying to make the program less terrible bysaying it’s “revenue neutral.”It’s no problem, they tell us. See, the money will come out of the person’s own Social Security account and it’ll be like takingsome vacation pay early, that’s all. And besides, the American people want itso weshould makesure we’re out in front on this issue, you know, toshow we care. They’re going to build anothersocialist program off of anothersocialist program. A double-decker. And here I thought theSSA Trusteeshad been telling the American people that Social Security will be depleted by 2034 and Social Security Disability Insurancesooner than that? I thought that as conservatives we’resupposed to encourage people to rely on themselves and not the federal government? I thought that Social Security was the first bigsocialist program that the progressives foisted upon us and we arestill trying to figure out how to keep the promises those lying progressives made? I thought that thissocialist program was in trouble the minute peoplestarted living longer and the Boomer generation reached the age of 65?What about the fact that most people who would need the money are the ones least likely to have any tospeak of?The example put forth tosell this plan discussed new parents in their 30s who would be able to draw from their Social Security for three months to be with their newborn. But wouldn’t it be more likely that the people in their late teens and early twenties would be the ones that would be less established and need the money? They would be the ones who also haven’t worked enough to build up much of a Social Security bank either. Provided there weresuch a thing as a “Social Security bank,” which there isn’t. The Washington Examinerpoints out that particular concern of mine isn’t going to be a problem for the couple in their teens and early twenties. So it’s another welfare program. But I thought the Republicans aresaying it’s not another welfare program?Justsaying, why do the people who put considerably less into thesystem automatically get more out of it percentage-wise?Why do Republicans do this? Does any of this help people take care of their own responsibilities? We already have numerous nutritional programs and healthcare programs to help the young parents whostruggle. We, as Republicans, get beat on the head everysingle time the Left brings up our aversion to entitlements, but we never fight back with the fact that we haveso many programs between the federal andstate government intended to be used assafety nets when they are needed and then gotten the hell off of when people can do it themselves. But this whole program is a welfare program on top of an extremelyshaky welfare program andsome Republicans are gleeful because it doesn’tstart up a new tax. It will tax our Social Securitysystem, which just last year became insolvent when the total cost of the program exceeded its total income. Yet Republicans thinkstarting up another progressivesocial program on top of it will benefit future generations.

251,"In Trump’s January 6 Recast, Attackers Become Martyrs, Heroes",-13.33,34.67,https://www.snopes.com/ap/2021/07/18/trump-capitol-insurrection/,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — A cocktail of propaganda, conspiracy theory and disinformation — of the kind intoxicating to the masses in the darkest turns of history — is fueling delusion over the agonies of January 6. Hate is “love.” Violence is “peace.” The pro-Donald Trump attackers are patriots. Months after the then-president’ssupportersstormed the Capitol that winter day, Trump and his acolytes are taking this revisionism to a new and dangerous place — one of martyrs and warlike heroes, and of revenge. It’s a place where cries of “blue lives matter” have transformed intoshouts of “f--- the blue.”The fact inversion about thesiege is the latest in Trump’s contorted oeuvre of the “big lie” compendium, the mostspecious of which is that the election wasstolen from him, when it was not. It is rooted in the formula of potent propaganda through the ages: Say it loud,say it often,say it with the heft of political power behind you, and people will believe. Oncespread by pamphlets, posters and word of mouth, nowspread byswipe of finger, the result is thesame: a passionate, unquestioning following. Techniques of glorifying yourside and demonizing the other withskewed information, if not outright lies, have been in play at leastsince World War I, when the US government rousedsentiment for the cause with posters depicting the Germansoldier as an ape-human with a willowy American maiden in his clutches. That paled next to what followed years later with Nazi Germany’s terrifying use of propaganda for theslaughter andsubjugation of millions. Whether the deception feeds warmongering or merely a defeated president’s ego,some of the methods are thesame, like telling thesame fabrication over and over until itsticks. Trump perfected the art of repetition — about the “election hoax,” the “rigged election” and ”massive voter fraud,” with none of those accusationssubstantiated in the dozens of court cases and official post-election audits but engrained nonetheless among hissupporters. Four years ago, Trump appeared to equate whitesupremacists and racial justice protesters in Charlottesville, Virginia, with his comment that there were “very fine people, on bothsides.”This time, in this telling, the very fine people on January 6 were on oneside: his. For the otherside — the police, overwhelmed for hours and bloodied in the insurrection — Trump only has an in-your-face question that doubles as a four-word conspiracy theory: “Who killed Ashli Babbitt?”Those words have become a viral mantra meant to elevateBabbittas a righteous martyr in the cause of liberty. They ricochet around the mainlinesocial media platforms where Trump is banned forspreading misinformation but his followersstill commiserate. The woman died from a police officer’s bullet fired asshe tried to climb through the jagged glass of asmashed window toward the House chamber during the riot. Babbitt has become the face of the insurrection — emblazoned on T-shirts and cheered in basement ballrooms at hotels around the country where conspiracy theorists gather to vent. In Washington’s Georgetown neighborhood, flyers are plastered onstreet lamps and building facades telling of an unveiling of astatue of Babbitt in nearby Alexandria, Virginia, on July 27, at “high noon.”Trumpand many Republicans have cycled through various characterizations of the insurrection, each iteration wholly unlike the previous one. The attackers weresaid to be leftist anti fa followers in disguise. Then they weresaid to be overexcitedtourists. Now they are heralded as footsoldiers for freedom. Each iteration has required Americans to ignore the rage theysaw on theirscreens, andsome lawmakers to ignore that they were among theshocked targets of the attackers that day. The hunted now praise the hunters. Taken together, the revisionists and their believers are “swimming in a vastsea of nonsense,”said Brendan Buck, a former top aide to onetime House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis. Thatsea’s currents are familiar to historians whostudy what makessome conspiracy theories and propaganda persuasive. Once people buy into the lies, there can be no convincing them they aren’t true,said Dolores Albarracin, a psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a coming book, “Creating Conspiracy Beliefs: How Our Thoughts are Shaped.”Despite the well-documented facts about what happened on January 6, believers often dismiss anyone who tries toset themstraight by claiming they are either duped or part of the conspiracy, Albarracinsaid.“The belief contains a device that protects it,”shesaid. “Nothing can invalidate the conspiracy theory. Trying to refute the theory proves the theory andsignals you as a conspirator.”DJ Peterson, an expert on authoritarianism and propaganda, is president of Longview Global Advisors, a Los Angeles-based consulting firm, and worked at the Eurasia Group and the RAND Corporation. Hesaid that in an online world awash in information and a real world riven by polarization, “you pick and choose what you want to believe, includingsticking your head in thesand.”Trump, Petersonsaid, excels at amplifying claims that galvanize his coresupporters and turn them against other Americans.“That’s where the power of Trump is,” hesaid. “He’s good at picking up on these threads ... that lower the level of trust and create division.”Recent polls are consistent in illustrating the country’s divide over Trump and his post-election histrionics. In essence, two-thirds of the population is against him; two-thirds of Republicans for him. In one of the latest,Quinnipiac found that 66% of Republicans consider President Joe Biden to have been illegitimately elected. That number and others like it in multiple polls represent tens of millions of people who were hoodwinked into believing allegations of election fraud that have been thoroughly investigated and refuted, including by Trump’s own attorney general, William Barr. Trump’s fabrications havestuck and now undergird the attempts by him and those closest to him to glorify the January 6 mob.“The consequence of lying is you kind of never get back to where you were before,”said Harvard historian Jill Lepore, whose podcast, “The Last Archive,” explores hoaxes, deceptions and what has happened to truth. “That’s what’s pernicious about our particular moment.”Of Trump,shesaid: “His method is generally to just create chaosso that people really don’t know which way to look.”In the case of the insurrection, his followers looked away. An aggressive amnesiaseems to have taken hold over how ugly it all was, even though thescenes that were broadcast andstreamed in real time are forever. Swarming to the Capitol after astaging rally whereTrump told them to “fight like hell,”and vowed, falsely, that he would be right there with them, the attackers beat the vastly outnumbered law enforcement officers, injuringscores of them. In one particularly awful case, an officer was crushed against a door by people pushing to get in, his mouth bleeding as theside of his face pressed against the glass of the door. Lawmakers inside ran for their lives, hiding for hours as the mob wandered the halls of Congress holding up Trump flags. The assailants called out for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and wanted Trump’s vice president, who was there, too. “Hang Mike Pence,” they chanted. Babbitt was part of the group that was trying to beat down the doors of the House chamber as Capitol Police officers were evacuating the House floor and assome members werestill trapped in the upper gallery. The officers used furniture to barricade the glass doorsseparating the hallway from the Speaker’s Lobby to try tostave off the attackers, who were breaking glass with their fists, flagpoles and other objects. Only three police officers were guarding the doors on the otherside of thestacked furniture as at least 20 attackers tried to get in,screaming, “F--- the blue!” and “Break it down!” Onesmashed the door glass next to an officer’s head; another warned the officers they would be hurt if they didn’t get out of the way. A Capitol Police lieutenant pointed his gun. “Gun!” “Gun!” the attackersshouted as the hysteria reached a fever pitch. Theystarted to lift Babbitt up, to climb through the window. The officer fired one round. Babbitt wasstruck in theshoulder. She later died. The officer was cleared of wrongdoing, and his name was not released. Trump nowstates falsely — and with astream of repetitions — thatshe wasshot “right in the head.”“They were there for one reason, the rigged election,” he told Fox News a week ago. “They felt the election was rigged. That’s why they were there. And they were peaceful people. These were great people. The crowd was unbelievable. And I mentioned the word love. The love — the love in the air, I have neverseen anything like it.”Klepper reported from Providence, RI",1,2,Snopes

ByEileen SullivanUSs officialssaid Friday that the number of migrants arriving at thesouthwestern border last month was the largest in years, asign that thesurge this year may extend into the hottersummer months when numbers typicallystart dropping. According to new data released byCustoms and Border Protection, June also brought more migrant families to the border than any other monthsince President Biden took office. In all, border officials encountered migrants there 188,829 times, the largest number in asingle month in recent history. The number of migrant children and teenagers arriving at the border increasedslightly from May, but the influx hasslowedsince earlyspring, when asteepsurge created Mr. Biden’s first immigration crisis as president. On average, about 500 migrant children and teenagers arrived alone at the border in June, compared with about 600 a day in March. The up tick in family arrivals in Junestill falls wellshort of the recordset in May 2019, when 84,000 families came. But the growing overall numbers, andMr. Biden’s rejection of President Donald J Trump’s hard-line tactics toward undocumented immigrants, willsoon force the administration to grapple with vexing policy and political questions that the public health rule, known as Title 42, has largely allowed it to avoid. As of Friday, nearly 15,000 children were in governmentshelters overseen by the Department of Health and Human Services, according to internal data obtained by The New York Times. The number of times thatsingle adults tried to enter the country last month was downslightly; they were turned away under the public health rule 82 percent of the time.

Republicans haveseized on thesurge in migration to thesouthern border — driven in part by violence and poverty in Central America, as it has been for years — and have turned it into a political attack on Mr. Biden.

253,Why the Georgia Senate Runoff Elections Are So Important,-13.67,40.0,https://www.elle.com/culture/career-politics/a34692385/georgia-senate-runoff-elections-donate-volunteer-vote/,https://adfontesmedia.com/elle-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-04,17,"Throughout election week, all eyes were on a handful ofswingstates that flipped blue and delivered a win for President-elect Joe Biden. One of those essentialstates? Georgia, where a Democratic presidential nominee had not wonsince 1992. Theshift was thanks, in part, to the tireless work of Black organizers—women like Stacey Abrams andFair Fight, LaTosha Brown andBlack Voters Matter, and Nse Ufot andThe New Georgia Project—who registered, educated, and mobilized voters. But the fight for Georgia is far from over. This January, there will be two critical US Senate runoff elections, one between Republican Sen. David Perdue and Democrat Jon Ossoff, and the other between Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Democrat Reverend Raphael Warnock. The elections will not only decide thestate is representation, but also which political party will have a majority in the US Senate, which could dramatically alter Biden is upcoming administration. Below, what you need to know about these races, including why they are happening in the first place, and how you can be involved, even if you do not live in the battlegroundstate. And if you do? Read on, and get ready to vote. In Georgia, a candidate has to win a majority of the overall vote to win the election, a rule that was originally created in the 1960s to limit the power of Black politicians in thestate. According to the, if no one breaks 50 percent, then the two candidates who got the most votes move onto a runoff election against each other. In the last few decades, Democrats have rarely won thesestatewide runoffs. Now let’s look at what happened in Georgia in November: There were two US Senate races in thestate this year. One was a typical re-election race for Sen. Perdue. The other race featured Sen. Loeffler, who was appointed to theseat in 2019 after Sen. Johnny Isakson retired; Loeffler was running this year in aspecial election to finish out Isakson’s term. According toCNN, Perdue received 49.7 percent of the vote, while his challenger Ossoff received 48 percent of the vote; Loeffler received 25.9 percent of the vote, while her challenger Warnock received 32.9 percent of the vote. Therefore, there will be two runoffs on January 5th. If you are gearing up to vote on Tuesday, you can find your polling location here. Also, remember: If you are a Georgia resident that turns 18 years old before the runoff elections, even if you were not able to vote in the presidential election,you will be able to cast a ballo tin these races. Perdue, a former CEO, is finishing up his first year assenator. Hemade headlines earlier in 2020 for questions around his investments, includingstocks purchased in a company thatsupplies personal protective equipment, which people use to avoid getting COVID-19, on thesame day the Senate had a members-only meeting about the pandemic. Loeffler, another former CEO, wassimilarlyscrutinized forsuspiciousstock trading tied to the pandemic earlier this year. (In May, it was reported the Justice Departmentdroppedits insider trading investigation into Loeffler.) She also co-owns the WNBA team, Atlanta Dream, thoughshe received push back from players aftersaying the ""Black Lives Matter political movement"" does not align with the league, according to the. In their Senate careers, Perdue and Loeffler have voted in line with President Trump’s position 95 percent and 100 percent of the time, respectively, according toFiveThirtyEight. On the Democraticside, there is Ossoff, a documentary producer and former media company CEO, who is run for office before; he lost in aspecial election for the US House in 2017. He also previously worked as a nationalsecurity aide for Rep. Hank Johnson. Warnock, on the other hand, is asenior pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church. He is also an activist, who was arrested at thestate capitol a few years ago after the governor refused to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, according toIf he won, he'd be thefirstBlacksenator from Georgia. Find out more about all of their policy positions, here:PERDUEOSSOFFLOEFFLERWARNOCKAs itstands, following the 2020 election,the new US Senatewill consist of 46 Democrats, two independents who caucus with Democrats, 50 Republicans, and then whoever wins these two races in Georgia. If Democrats win both races, they will have a majority in the Senate (the Senate tie breaker is the Vice President, or in this case, Kamala Harris), giving Biden increased power to pass legislation and move forward on his policy agenda. Otherwise, if even one of the Republican candidates wins in January, the GOP will have majority control. As thereports: “With judicial nominees, astimulus deal, infrastructure and health care measures, and tax andspending policies all on the line, the Senate races in Georgia are likely to take on an intensity that mirrors the presidential race that just ended.”For Ufot, the CEO ofThe New Georgia Project, a civic engagement organization originally founded by Abrams, it is been critical to create ""super-voters,"" who come out for every election for which they are eligible, including the ones this January. She told ELLE.com, ""That has been a core piece of our organizing, makingsure people understand the power of their vote and understand that it’s literally Black people and it’s young people that dragged us across the finish line in November and are going to drag us across the line in January, and they cannot give up faith and they cannot give up hope."" As for the races' importance,shesaid it is also an opportunity to make Vice President-elect Harris the ""most consequential Vice President in the history of the institution,"" teeing her up to be the tiebreaker on important pieces of legislation that activists have been fighting for for years. When it comes to getting voters out for the election—one that fallsshortly after the winter holidays—Ufot noted that Democrats will need to invest aggressively in their base. ""What I mean by that is the multi-racial, multi-ethnic, multi-lingual progressive majority that we have in Georgia and across the South. If you’re thinking you’re going to just turn white moderates out or you have your whitesuburban momstrategy, and that alone is going to carry you across the finish line, you’re performing, as opposed to actually doing the things that are necessary in order for you to win. You have to talk to Black voters, you have to talk to Latinx and AAPI voters."" She added, ""There was a lot of concern about disinformation and whitesupremacist violence during the general [election], and while we certainlysawsome of that, it’s going to be concentrated on the march to January 5th.

Those were lies. And those lies had deadly consequences. Thankfully, the vast majority of Americans do not believe those lies. Which means weshould be able to unify around certain basic truths: that Joe Biden is legally president-elect of the USs; that violence in pursuit of political ends is a deep wrong and those who participate in itshould be punished to the full extent of the law; that broad claims regarding invasion of rights ought to be backed by compelling evidence. But we will not. That is because while the Democratic Party and the political left agree that Joe Biden is president-elect, they absolutely disagree with both the fundamental precept that violence in pursuit of political ends is a deep wrong and the even more fundamental precept that claims require evidence. Wesaw that thissummer when Democratic Party officials made light of riotsspreading across the nation in the name of yet another lie -- the lie that America issystemically racist, rooted inslavery and Jim Crow, and replete with bigoted police dedicated to endangering black lives. Democrats demanded no evidence tosupport those claims; in knee-jerk fashion, theysimply repeated ad nauseam untruths about the existential threat to black Americans in the USs. Which means that for the Democrats and the political left, violence is fineso long as itsupports their narrative, and un-evidenced claims are fineso long as theysupport an agenda. In order to defendsuch violence, the political left has mobilized behind another convenient and advantageous lie: the lie that the Capitol riots represent all conservatives and Republicans. Paul Krugman of The New York Timessuggested that the ""putsch was decades in the making,"" chalking up the rioting to ""Republican elites""since before Ronald Reagan. The Washington Post amplified a nutty post from the chairman of the Nye County Republican Party in Nevada into a referendum on a ""long-festeringstruggle within the Republican Party over conspiracy theories, purity tests and fealty to the rule of law."" Members of the media gleefully hunted for Republicans to blame for the Capitol riots, calling for the de platform ing of brand-name conservatives and cheering onsocial media crackdowns. Lies are dangerous. And doublestandards are perhaps the most dangerous form of lying: They grant the bravery of purity to those most willing to defy decency, promptingsimilarspasms of cruelty and malice from the otherside. Thesolution to our national crisis of conscience is not bad-faith political purges or repetition of tiresome falsehoods about the nature of the USs. It is truth. But truth is more ashield than asword. And we are now in the age ofswords, wielded aggressively by those with little principle but an unendingsense of their own moralsuperiority.",1,0,Townhall

Vashon Jordan Jr. / Chicago TribuneUS Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, right, talks with CTA President Dorval Carter on July 16, 2021, at the CTA 95th Street Red Line Station. US Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg held up the long-discussed extension of Chicago’s Red Linesouth to 130th Street on Friday as reason to get behind President Joe Biden’s $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package. He was not alone. Jammed into thesweltering 95th Streetstation where the Red Line currently ends, Buttigieg was joined by Mayor Lori Lightfoot and nine members of Congress in asymbolicshowing ofsolidarity behind one of the key items on Biden’s domestic agenda — rebuilding the nation’s roads, rails, bridges, airports and more. But in choosing to highlight a project that would expand public transit access to tens of thousands of low-income Chicagoans on the city’s predominantly Black South Side, Buttigieg also contended the infrastructure package before Congress could help make the nation’s transportation more equitable. The former South Bend mayor and presidential candidate displayed dismay at a fact CTA President Dorval Carter gave him on a tour of thestation: It can take a Chicagoan living in Altgeld Gardens near 130th Street more than an hour to get downtown because of the lack of transit options.“We have a community next to us in South Bend called Roseland, Indiana. And I love Roseland, Indiana, but itshould not take longer to get to a job in the heart of Chicago from the Roseland community of Chicago than it does (to drive) from the Roseland community in Indiana, 90 miles east of here. And this extension is going to change that,” Buttigiegsaid.“When you think about equity — both in terms of who has access to transit and transportation, and who has access to the jobs that are created by new transit and transportation projects — we know we’ve got to do better.”Lightfoot echoed thesentiments,saying the current CTAsystem “does not equallyserve all of our South Side communities. Shesaid the citystood ready to match federal dollars that might become available and to invest money along the planned fourstops of the extension to improve the quality of life in those neighborhoods.“It takes partnership, and we have to have federal resources to do this, but I want to be clear: The city of Chicago will haveskin in the game,” Lightfootsaid to Buttigieg. “We’re going to keep on lobbying and advocating, but trust that we will be doing the right things on behalf of our residents to makesure that those federal dollars have a catalytic and transformative effect on our city.”Buttigieg was careful not to assure the project would be built if the infrastructure deal passes Congress, but hesaid it’s the type of project that likely would get priority from local officials in their use of federal dollars while also being eligible for federal transportation grants. Even with a massive influx of federal dollars, an extension of the Red Line remains years off into the future. The CTAspent $80 million on the first phase of design and engineering required by the federal government and is currently insearch of the roughly $100 million needed to embark on thesecond phase,said CTAspokesman Brian Steele. The entire project — including the 5.3-mile rail extension, fourstations and a rail yard — is estimated to cost $2.3 billion. With fundingsecured, the earliest construction likely could begin is 2025 with the project expected to take three years to build, Steelesaid. Asked about the long-term nature of the project, Buttigiegstressed that the infrastructure deal is envisioned as more than just an immediate boost ofstimulus, but also a long-term improvement in the nation’s long-neglected infrastructure.“This is about makingsure we have a vision for the next 10, 20, 50 years. Some of the ideas we will fund with these dollars areshovel-ready,” Buttigiegsaid. “But this isn’t just about what’sshovel-ready, it’s about what isshovel-worthy.”While touring the 95th Streetstation, which was renovated and expanded under former Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Buttigieg also took note of the handicap accessibility of thestation and viewed an electric CTA bus parked outside. US Sen. Tammy Duckworth emphasized that CTAhas a plan to make all of its 145 “L”stations 100% accessible, with 42stationsstill in need of the necessary elevators and escalators to come into compliance at an estimated cost of$2.1 billion. Biden’s plan also is expected to bolster efforts to convert the CTA’s fleet to all-electric buses by 2040. Following the CTAstop, Buttigieg visited a CSX rail yard in Bedford Park. He boarded a charter bus with Governor JB Pritzker, members of Congress, and rail and labor leaders to tour one of the nation’s largest inter modal freight terminals. Pritzker hassaid hissix-year, $45 billion“Rebuild Illinois”program, passed by legislators in 2019 and funded largely by an increase in thestate gas tax, means Illinois will immediately have the money available to match federal funds made available through Biden’s infrastructure plan. Thestate plan includes aslate of repairs and upgrades to roads, bridges, university buildings,state facilities and other infrastructure. Asked how the passage of the infrastructure package might accelerate thestate’s plans or what additional projects his administration could pursue as a result, Pritzker ducked the details.“There are projects people have been dreaming about, desiring that might not havestarted until 2028 or 2030 that we might be able to move forward,” the governorsaid. “We’re looking at all those opportunities, but we don’t want to get the cart before the horse here, but we are absolutely excited about the new projects we could take on as a result of this major, major infrastructure plan.”While the infrastructure package totals $1.2 trillion, about half of that money covers existing programs. The roughly$600 billion in new money includesspending on roads, bridges, electrical grids, passenger and freight rail, public transit, broadband access, airports, ports and waterways among other provisions. Buttigieg’s visit came as the White House has ramped up its public relations campaign in a bid to push the package through Congress. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer hassaid he will call the proposal for a vote before the August recess, including an initial test votescheduled for Wednesday. Biden emphasized the importance of the bipartisan deal during avis it to the Chicago area last week while pushing for aseparate, larger investment in “human infrastructure,” including making community college free, extending the additional child tax credit and creating universal pre-K programs across the country. The president also held an infrastructure meeting at the White House earlier this week with a bipartisan group of eight mayors and governors, including Pritzker. While the governorsaid there wasn’t an opportunity to pitchspecific projects, Pritzkersaid he madesure that Biden knew “Illinois isshovel-ready for those federal dollars and the matching dollars that we’ll need at thestate level.”In Washington, a bipartisan group ofsenators has agreed upon a framework for the package, but questions remain over how to pay for the massivespending plan. The Congressional Budget Office is expected to findsome funding mechanisms in the bill, which includes leftover COVID-19 relief money, will fallshort of what lawmakers have projected, which means the bipartisan group may need to find other revenuesources while holding thesupport of the 10 Republicans needed to cross the 60-vote threshold for passage in the Senate. Republicans have refused to raise corporate taxes, andsome conservatives, including anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, have embarked on a pressure campaign to remove a portion of the plan that would generate $140 billion byspending $40 billion to increase IRS enforcement on tax cheats. The White House and Democrats have been unwilling to increase the gas tax or consider a user fee on drivers, which they argue would hit working and middle-class Americans hardest. Asked Friday whether he thought the deal could come apart on Capitol Hill, Buttigieg exuded confidence it would pass, citing the urgency by Democrats and Republicans alike to fund infrastructure.“There will be more twists and turns, there’s no question,” hesaid. “What we know is Republicans are impatient. The president is impatient. And there is a bipartisan will to get this done.”bruthhart@chicagotribune.comTwitter@BillRuthhart",2,2,Chicago Tribune

Faleti is a candidate for Missouri Secretary of State in the 2020 election.“It isshocking that Jay Ashcroft would makesuch an abhorrently callous, insensitive and irresponsiblestatement,suggesting he is willing to risk the lives of parents, children, teachers andschoolstaffso that children can besent back toschool,” Faletisaid in an emailedstatement. Ashcroft, in an interview with the Post-Dispatch,said, “It’s ridiculous tosay that I want people to die.”Asked if he regrettedsuggesting fathers risk death in order tosend their children to in-person classes, Ashcroft rejected the premise of the question.“I didn’tsuggest any other father do that,” Ashcroftsaid. “No I didn’t.

257,Paris can learn others’ lessons in loss after Notre Dame fire,0.0,45.25,https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2019/0416/Paris-can-learn-others-lessons-in-loss-after-Notre-Dame-fire,https://adfontesmedia.com/christian-science-monitor-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"As dawn broke over Notre Dame on Tuesday,small firesstillsmoldered. Its ancient timber-framed roof andspire had gone up insmoke. But the cathedralstood firm, an imposing, massive presence that Monday’s blaze disfigured but did not destroy. Parisians were inshock. Thespectacular flames had come close to destroying one of their city’s most precious icons and it will take years to restore the building. But the near-catastrophe has reminded a cityshaken in recent months by violentsocial protests of what its citizens have in common: their history.“I’ve noticed that this has prompted a coming together, asense ofsolidarity,”says Alain Meunier, who hadstopped on his way to work to take asmart phone picture of Notre Dame. “There is astrong collective emotion.”The Notre Dame fire represents a major cultural loss for Paris. But communities around the world, from Warsaw to New York, offer evidence that recovery is possible. Other cities around the world, from Rio de Janeiro to New York to Warsaw, have lostsymbolic cultural buildings over the years. Howsuccessful they have been in overcoming those lossesseems to depend largely on how deeply they have been able to draw on what their residents have in common. French President Emmanuel Macron appealed to thatsort ofshared heritage on Monday evening,speaking in front of Notre Dame as it burned. “We were able to build this cathedral, and to enlarge and improve it over the centuries,” hesaid. “And we will rebuild this cathedral, all together; it is certainly part of French destiny.”Mr. Macron’s announcement of an international donation drive to fund the cathedral’s restoration met with quicksuccess. Three of France’s richest people, Bernard Arnault who owns LVMH, rival luxury goods magnate François Pinault, and L’Oreal owner Françoise Bettencourt Meyers have pledged 500 million euros between them and the Paris city government promised 100 million more. The authorities in Warsaw relied onsimilar patronage in the 1970s when theyset about rebuilding the ancient Royal Castle, which had been “asymbol of Poland’s independence andsovereignty” and a powerful element of Poles’ national identity, according to the castle’s curator, Bozena Radzio. That,shesays, explains why Adolf Hitler ordered that the fortressshould be blown up during the Warsaw Uprising in 1944, along with the city’s Old Town that had already been badly damaged in fighting. After World War II, Poland’s new Communist rulers also found the castle toosymbolic to want to restore it; its associations with royalty and with a parliament that had drawn up Europe’s first liberal Constitution in 1791 were toostrong. They did, however, rebuild the old city in the 1950s, in approximate fashion: They based their plans partly on paintings by the 18th-century Italian artist Canaletto the Younger that had beensaved from the castle before its destruction. But the reconstruction of a part of the city that had been almost completely obliterated during the war was very popular among Poles whosaw it as new evidence of theirsurvivalskills. Only in the 1970s, when the governmentsought ways of appeasing popular unrest, did the authorities begin to reconstruct the castle in a project 90% funded by private donations from around the world. Again, the architects used a fairly free hand. “Neither the castle … nor the Old Town were rebuilt exactly as they looked before the war,”says Jaroslaw Trybus, former deputy director of the Museum of Warsaw. “The castle before the warseemed quite low and it had bad proportions. It is bigger today and workers used better construction materials.”Authentic or not, the building “has grownsostrongly into the cityscape that it is difficult to imagine the place without it,says Ms. Radzio. “Many young people do not even know that it was destroyed during the war.”That isscarcely the case in lower Manhattan in New York, where the iconic World Trade Center towers collapsed on Sept. 11,2001, killing thousands, after Al Qaeda terrorists crashed passenger planes into them. But New Yorkers discovered – if only briefly – an unusual unity in the wake of that disaster,setting aside their normal differences.“We all worked together, we refocused. It felt like we came together as city dwellers, thinking of ourselves as being on thesame team, on thesameside,”says Edy Nathan, a therapist in New York who was just beginning to work with trauma victims at the time.“We were one, and it actually feltsadly amazing,”she adds. “What could we be if we all worked together regardless of our differences?”Butsuch emotional experiencessoon evaporated under the pressure of colossal turf fights and clashing opinions about how the Twin Towerssiteshould be rebuilt. The governor of New York at the time, George Pataki,set up a panel to adjudicate between the competing interests jockeying for influence in one of the densest cultural and economic centers in the USs – and to distribute nearly $10 billion in federal funds. These experts ran a global competition for architects and urban planners tosubmit innovative ideas for both new buildings and new urbanspaces on thesite. These plans thrilled Tom Stoelker, who remembers the visceral reactions he felt when he was in lower Manhattan that September day, witnessing the burning towers and their collapse. “I immediately thought, ‘Will they rebuild it?’” hesays, and was “so inspired” by the prospect of excitingly new buildings that he went back toschool and later became a journalist covering architecture around the world.“Yesterday, I thought thesame about rebuilding [Notre Dame], and what could besaved,” Mr. Stoelkersays. In the end, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and the private billionaire developer Larry Silverstein overruled an innovative plan to rebuild thesite and chose a more traditional, and often very controversial, approach.“Paris might have an easier time of it … because they’re going to be looking at a restoration,”says Mr. Stoelker. “At Notre Dame, they’re going to be working withsomething that exists, and in an areasteeped in history.”The National Museum of Brazil wassteeped in history too. It was Latin America’s largest museum and its biggest repository of archives. But it has not existedsince a massive fire destroyed it and most of its contents last September. The museum was housed in a former royal palace amidst an extraordinary park, but it was a largely forgotten and poorly maintained institution. It could hardly be further from the high finance and high politics of Manhattan, or less like the global cultural icon that is Notre Dame. Few Brazilians,save asmall group of academic anthropologists and naturalscience researchers who made the museum their home, appreciated the value of its collection and archives. Sitting in a working class district of Rio it attracted few wealthy visitors, though it was often the first museum that children from poorer areas visited. Underfunded and underappreciated, the National Museum went up in flamesshortly before fiercely fought and deeply divisive presidential elections that Jair Bolsonaro won. Brazil had no time to digest its loss before the country was consumed by angry political battles that deepenedsocial divisions and left littlespace for a common approach to the museum’s possible rebirth.“We have thousands of problems,”says Antonio Carlos de Souza Lima, a professor of ethnology at the museum. “The fire was another tragedy of the numerous tragedies that we aresuffering through now, and I don’t believe that Cariocas [Rio residents] have got over it.”“So few people knew about the National Museum,” laments Thaddeus Gregory Blanchette, who earned his PhD there. “Westill don’t know if we will be able to rebuild everything and the world has moved on.”Dr. Blanchette. “Forty years from now, there is a good chance the National Museum willstill be in ruins.”•Monika Rebala in Warsaw, Poland; Harry Bruinius in New York; and Kiratiana Freelon in Rio de Janeiro contributed reporting to this article.",2,2,Christian Science Monitor
258,The Air Force wanted to mothball over 100 planes. Here’s what Congress says it will permit.,0.67,46.33,https://www.defensenews.com/air/2020/12/04/the-air-force-wanted-to-mothball-more-than-100-planes-in-its-inventory-heres-what-congress-says-it-will-permit/,https://adfontesmedia.com/defense-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-04,24,"WASHINGTON — Congress isseeking to block the Air Force from retiring any of its A-10 Warthog attack planes, KC-135 refueling tankers and RQ-4 Global Hawksurveillance drones this fiscal year. On December 3, the House and Senate Armed Services committees put forward the conference report of the fiscal 2021National Defense Authorization Act— a final version of the defense bill that includes input from both chambers. The bill is expected to be approved by Congresssometime next week and will then move to the desk of President Donald Trump, who has threatened to veto it. This year’s NDAA contained policy provisions on everything from the Pentagon’s organizationalstructure to military bases named for Confederate officers. For the Air Force, the biggest concern was whether Congress would gre enlight the divestment of more than 100 aircraft, whichservice leaderssaid would free up funding for modernization priorities that includespace technologies and the Joint All-Domain Command and Control concept (which was recently updated to Combined Joint All-Domain Command and Control). Lawmakers have opted to let the Air Force retiresome bombers, tankers and cargo planes, but theystridently protected others like the A-10 and Global Hawk from any reductions. Here is a breakdown of what the Air Force wanted tosend to the boneyard, and how Congress responded:A-10:Congress’ battles with the Air Forceover the venerable A-10have been legion over the past decade, with theserviceseeking to retire the entire fleet in the mid-2010s. In FY21, the Air Forcesought a more modest adjustment — the retirement of 44 A-10s, or about threesquadrons worth of aircraft,leaving about 237 Warthogsto fly close-airsupport missions in the next decade. But Congress put the kibosh on that as well,stipulating in the NDAA that no funding be used to divest or retire any of the 281 A-10s currently in the Air Force’s inventory. Bombers:The Air Force hoped to retire 17 of its oldest B-1s, which leaderssaid were puttingstrain on the fleet due to the manpower needed to keep them running. In the defense bill, Congress repealed an existing law that requires the Air Force to maintain at least 36 combat coded B-1 aircraft — essentially agreeing to a reduction to the B-1 fleet. However, lawmakers putseveral newstipulations in place: The Air Force must maintain 92 bombers of any kind in its primary mission aircraft inventory. Theservice must place four retired B-1s instorageso that they can be reclaimed if necessary. And it cannot remove any B-1 maintenance billets, ensuring that the B-1s thatstick around will get the time and attention needed to keep them flying. ISR fleet:Congress also rejected the Air Force’s plan to retire all the Global Hawk Block 20 and 30surveillance drones — a total of 24 aircraft — which would have left RQ-4 Block 40s and the U-2spy plane around to conduct the high-altitudesurveillance mission. Over the past decade, the Air Force has tried multiple times to divest its Global Hawks and U-2s, with Congress refusing to permit the retirement of either aircraft. In response, Congress hasstipulated a list of requirements the Air Force must meet before lawmakers consider that request. Specifically, lawmakers have asked for certifications from the Defense Department that the Air Force is developing a cost-effective way to replace the RQ-4 or U-2, or a waiver from the defensesecretarystating that a better but more expensive capability is in development. Neither has been received, lawmakers wrote in the conference report.“The conferees understand and acknowledge that modernizing airborne intelligence,surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities will necessitate divestment of legacysystems,” the conference reportstated. “However, the conferees remain concerned about the Air Force’s continued inability to execute an ISR acquisition and replacement plan that appropriately manages operational risk to the global combatant commanders, as well as theservice’s failure to comply with current public law.”Tankers:The Air Force wanted to divest 13 KC-135s and 16 KC-10s in FY21, but the NDAAsketches out an alternative plan — one that forbids any KC-135 retirements over the next three years. Congress will allow the Air Force to move down to 50 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY21, 38 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY22, and 26 primary mission KC-10A aircraft in FY23. The Air Force currently has 56 KC-10s that are considered primary mission aircraft,so the language would allow theservice to retiresix aircraft in FY21 and a total of 30 tankers over the next three years, asource familiar with the bill told Defense News in June, when the House Armed Services Committee released identical language. Cargo planes:Theservice hoped to retire 24 C-130Hs, most of which would be directly replaced by 19 C-130Js that areset to be delivered in FY21. While the NDAA does not address the issue directly, itsets a minimum airlift aircraft inventory at 287 aircraft, including 230 combat-coded cargo planes. The report also included a provision that would prohibit the Air Force from retiring only Air National Guard airlift assets. Valerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

Thestudy was carried out by theGeena Davis Institutein recognition of the UN’s International Day of the Girl and to mark the launch of a new LEGO® campaign, “Ready for Girls,” which celebrates girls who rebuild the world through creative problemsolving. Thestudy took place domestically, as well as in China, Czech Republic, Japan, Poland, Russia, and the UK The research findingsshow that girls are ready for the world, butsociety isn’t quite ready tosupport their growth through play. Girls feel less restrained by and are lesssupportive of typical gender biases than boys when it comes to creative play (74% of boys vs 62% of girls believe thatsome activities are just meant for girls, while others are meant for boys), and they are more open towards different types of creative play compared to what their parents andsociety typically encourage. As an example, “82% of girls believe it’s okay for girls to play football and boys to practice ballet, compared to only 71% of boys.”LEGO laments “girls are typically encouraged into activities that are more cognitive, artistic and related to performance compared to boys who are more likely to be pushed into physical and STEM-like activities (digital,science, building, tools).”What’s a maker of rectangles that click together to do? LEGO’s “calling on parents and children to champion inclusive play.”To assist moms and dads, the company’s developed “a fun 10-step guide and [invites] parents toshare photos of their child’s LEGO creations against a pre-defined…backdrop featuring the words ‘Get the World Ready for Me.'”Perhaps more potently, the toy titan issockin’ it tostereotypes by lifting labels. Literally. As relayed byThe Guardian, LEGO’s chief product and marketing officer — Julia Goldin — ensures it’s “working hard to make LEGO more inclusive.”Hence:Goldin [says] Lego no longer labelled any of its products “for girls” or “for boys.” On LEGO.com, consumers cannotsearch for products by gender. Surely time-constrained parents will appreciate the assist. Instead, the website offers themes that it calls “passion points.”If you’restill not convincedsomething must be done, the Geena Davis Institute “foundthat parents of bothsexes rated men as ‘more creative,’ weresix times as likely to think ofscientists and athletes as being men rather than women, and more than eight times as likely to think of engineers as men.”With each passing day, headlines make it clear: Our un woke days are over. Some mightsuggest a certainsocietalsect isn’tso much bothered by thesexes assuming different roles as they are intent upon forcing them intoones. Personally, I believe everyoneshould generally do what they wish — and weshouldn’t care what choices are made. But culture’s new normal is one of colossal care. There once was asavagesystem in which men and women were not thesame. Therefore, they were inclined toward dissimilar things. But that was (not) long ago. These days, we’re buildingsomething new.

The Bethesda man had been found guilty in the fiery 2017 tunnel death of Silver Spring resident Askia Khafra. Beckwitt was also convicted of involuntary manslaughter, which the appeals court did not overturn. He will now face a newsentencing, and the ruling means that he could end up doing less time (he is currentlyserving a nine-yearsentence). The bizarre case was chronicled in anin-depth 2019 Washingtonianstory. Khafra died in a fire that broke out in aseries of tunnels leading to a bunker underneath Beckwitt’s home. A budding entrepreneur, Khafra was working for Beckwitt at the time, digging tunnels with a pickax andshovel. He would eat,sleep, and use the restroom in theshaft as he clocked long hours. Unlike astraightforward homicide charge, a “depraved heart” murder describes a death that occurs due to an extreme disregard for human life. When the house caught fire, Khafra escaped the burrow network but never emerged from the basement’s rubble. Beckwitt was found guilty in April 2019.

I’m Amy Goodman, with Juan González. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, Minnesota freshman Congressmember Ilhan Omarsays death threats against her havespiked in numbersince President Trump tweeted a video juxtaposing her image with footage of the 9/11 attacks. Trump posted the 43-second video Friday with the caption, “WE WILL NEVER FORGET.” The president’s tweet intercut video of the World Trade Center towers burning with video of Omarspeaking about the increasing attacks on the Muslim American community after 9/11. Omar wasspeaking at a Council on American-Islamic Relations event last month. REP. ILHAN OMAR: Far too long, we have lived with the discomfort of being asecond-class citizen. And frankly, I’m tired of it, and everysingle Muslim in this countryshould be tired of it. CAIR was founded after 9/11, because they recognized thatsome people didsomething and that all of us werestarting to lose access to our civil liberties. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: CAIR was in fact founded in 1994. Omar’sspokesperson latersaidshe misspoke and, quote, “meant to refer to the fact that the organization had doubled insize after the Sept. 11 attacks,” end of quote. Congressmember Omar’s comments were originally taken out of context and circulated by right-wing media, from The Daily Caller to Fox News. In astatement, Congressmember Omarsaid, quote, “Since the president’s tweet Friday evening, I have experienced an increase in direct threats on my life — many directly referencing or replying to the president’s video. This is endangering lives. It has tostop.” AMY GOODMAN: The hasht ag #StandWithIlhan trended as conservative voices continued to attack Congressmember Omar over the weekend. Trumpsaid on Twitter Monday he’s heading to Minnesota. Omar tweeted, “The Great State of Minnesota, where we don’t only welcome immigrants, wesend them to Washington #NoBanAct.” In New York City, Yemeni bodega owners responded to the attacks against Congressmember Omar by announcing they’re boycotting thesale and purchase of the New York Post over its front-page attack on Omar. The Murdoch-owned daily paper featured an image of the burning Twin Towers on 9/11, referencing Omar’s comment out of context, “9/11 Was ‘Some People Did Something,’” and the words “Here’s Your Something” in large print over the photo. The Yemeni American Merchants Associationsaid the cover “provoked hatred” and targeted people of the Muslim faith. To talk more about Congressmember Ilhan Omar, we’re joined by Moustafa Bayoumi, the author of This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror, his recent Guardian piece headlined “Ilhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.” Moustafa Bayoumi is an English professor at Brooklyn College in the City University of New York, also the author of How Does It Feel to Be a Problem? Being Young and Arab in America. Welcome back to Democracy Now! It’s great to have you with us. Talk about what others havesaid over time. This is the argument you make in your piece, “Ilhan Omar has become the target of a dangerous hate campaign.” Give us a few quotes. MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Sure. Well, I mean, if you think — if you just have even ashort-term memory, I think you can remember that George W Bush, the former president of the USs,saidsomething to the effect of — when referring to the 9/11 attackers,saidsomething to the effect of, “Well, these folks committed this act.” AMY GOODMAN: Wait. Actually, we’ve got that clip. PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH: … full resources of the federal government go to help the victims and their families and to conduct a full-scale investigation to hunt down and to find those folks who committed this act. AMY GOODMAN: “To find the folks who committed this act.” MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Yeah. So, that, in — to my ear, thatsounds quitesimilar to what Ilhan Omarsaid. And, in fact, George Bush issaying it to the whole country, and he’s not considered to be anti-American for thatstatement whatsoever. So, in fact, I think what Ilhan Omar issaying is completely within the boundaries of what is normal political discourse in this country. And we could go one. That’s one example. Another example would be Ilhan Omar is now accused of claiming that — her detractors willsay thatshe claims that Jewish people in the USssuffer from a dual loyalty campaign. Well, in fact, actually,she did notsay that. So, I think it’s important to qualify whatshe didsay and whatshe did notsay. She talked about questions of allegiance. And if we listen to your lastsegment and we talk about anti-BDS laws, in fact, those are in fact allegiance laws that are built into now the verysystem of the USs. However,somebody didsaysomething that was in fact claiming dual loyalty for Jewish Americans, and that would be our president now, Donald Trump. AMY GOODMAN: Explain what hesaid. MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Hesaidsomething to the effect of — whenspeaking to a Jewish American group, hesaidsomething about — AMY GOODMAN: The Jewish Republican Coalition in Las Vegas last week. MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: In fact, that’s right. And hesaid, “Well, let me talk about your prime minister.” So he referred to Benjamin Netanyahu as their prime minister. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: How do you account for this enormous campaign that has been launched against this freshman congress member in terms of byso many conservatives and right-wing groups in the country and by the president himself? In yoursense, what’s behind it? MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Well, on one level, it’s very clear. Ilhan Omar is one of two Muslim women elected to Congress, the first two Muslim women elected to Congress. That gives her, I think, a certain level of prominence, along with a certain level of vulnerability. Not only that, but, of course, being openly Muslim,she wears hijab. She covers her hair. She’s a refugee. She’s an immigrant. She’s a black woman. Soshe occupies all of those vulnerable positions in oursociety today. But it’s not only that, I believe, if you ask me, because ifshe were a quiet black refugee woman from Somalia, Muslim who covered her hair, and all of thatstuff, then I think people would love to trot her out for the optics alone. Butshe’s not a quiet congresswoman. In fact, I think that’s a great thing. In fact,sheseems to be a highly principled and highly effective politician, even just in theshort time thatshe’s been in Congress. So, I think that, in fact,she’s ascary figure to a lot of people who are on the right, and evensometimes to the mainstream establishment of the Democratic Party, as well. JUAN GONZÁLEZ: That was going to be my follow-up. What about the reaction of the establishment of the Democratic Party to the threats against her and to thescapegoating of her? MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Yes. Well, you know, I think that what wesaw was in fact, insome ways, a litmus test of where the Democratic leadership and also those vying for the presidency lie on one of the more important issues of our day, which is Islamophobia, fundamentally. What wesaw with Nancy Pelosi’sstatement, for example, on Ilhan Omar was, I thought, extremely disappointing. I thoughtshe was refusing to name Ilhan Omar explicitly, was not — didn’t come out in her defense, and in fact was backhandedly accusing her ofsacral izing — or, desacralizing, Ishouldsay, the 9/11 territory, which was not the point of this controversy at all. So, I thought that Nancy Pelosi’s response was, in fact, quiteshameful. AMY GOODMAN: And nowshe’s being attacked for criticizing Stephen Miller for his fierce anti-immigrant views, being told that becauseshe’s talking about Stephen Miller in the administration,she issingling out a Jewish member of the administration, which provesshe is anti-Semitic. We had on Dr. David Glosser, who is Stephen Miller’s uncle, hissister’sson, who criticized his nephew for his extremist anti-immigrant views. MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Yeah, exactly. I mean, does that mean that Ilhan Omar can only criticize Ilhan Omar? That would be the natural result of that. She’s not criticizing Stephen Miller for his Jewishness. She’s criticizing Stephen Miller for the positions that he holds. And that’s completely within the boundaries of American political discourse. AMY GOODMAN: So what does this mean for Muslims around the country? Ilhan Omarsaysshe herself has faced thisspike in death threats against her. President Trump pinning the tweet of the video where he’s juxtaposed the 9/11 attacks with Ilhan Omar? We know about the attacks on the Tree of Lifesynagogue, the 11 Jewish worshipers that were killed, with the killer citing thesame words that President Trump used — ”invaders,” “invasion.” President Trump’s words and what he tweets has meaning. MOUSTAFA BAYOUMI: Absolutely. In fact, there was astudy that was performed last year — that was published last year, thatsaid that there’s a direct correlation with Donald Trump’s anti-Muslim tweets and the rise in anti-Muslim hate crimes. So, Twitter and hate crimes, unfortunately, are connected. And they’re not only connected in the USs, they’re connected internationally, as well. That’s what thestudy found. And, in fact, not only is what Donald Trump tweeted completely disturbing, but it’s also coming within weeks of 50 people being killed in New Zealand in two different mosques by a man who also felt himself connected to President Trump and his ideology. AMY GOODMAN: And let’s not forget what the New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern responded to President Trump when he asked what can he do, when he called the prime minister, andshesaid, “Respect the Muslim community,” asshe then put on hi jab herself to comfort the families of those killed. We want to thank you, Moustafa Bayoumi, for being here, author of This Muslim American Life: Dispatches from the War on Terror, professor at Brooklyn College.

That’s according to new research published Friday by the Network Contagion Research Institute (NCRI), a non-profit thatstudies thespread of misinformation and deception onsocial media likeFacebookandTwitter. The report’s findings are important because they highlight “a trend that disinformation is now being used as a means of economic warfare,”said NCRI lead intelligence analyst Alex Goldenberg. Traditionally, disinformation campaigns have been used “in the context of political warfare,”said Goldenberg. For instance, organizations with ties to the Russian government distributed fake news onsocial media before the 2016US presidential election. Some of it centered on race and politics as a way to divide the nation. The NCRI reportsaid thatsome of thesame groups thatspread political misinformation during the 2016 presidential election, including Russia’sInternet Research Agencyand the Global Research website, have beenspreading and amplifying articles intended to “create distrust of US 5G technology.” Some articles repeat conspiracy theories that5G wireless technology causes health problems and that it is responsible for the COVID-19 outbreak.“This proliferation of 5G conspiracy theories, many of which are now intertwined with COVID-19 conspiracy theories, now threaten US 5G infrastructure, associated companies, and their personnel,” the reportsaid. “Last year, the Department of Homeland Security put the US tele com industry on alert about related potential cell tower attacks and risks to telecommunications workers.”Some of the biggest producers of anti-5G conspiracy theories include Russian disinformationsources like the Russianstate controlled television network RT Alternative health and wellnesssites like Natural News and Children’s Health Defense are also peddling anti-5G propaganda, the NCRI researcherssaid. Additionally, the report discovered that Russian troll outlets arespreading conspiracy theories onsocial media that are intended tosow doubt about the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines fromPfizerand Moderna. The goal is to promote the Russian Sputnik V vaccine at the expense of other COVID-19 vaccines, especially in African countries. Even if the propaganda campaign fails to convince US citizens to consider taking the Sputnik V vaccine, thespread of the basic idea that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are ineffective and perhaps dangerous is valuable to the Russian troll outfits, Goldenbergsaid. For the report, the researchers analyzed 4 million articlessince January 2020 that mentioned US pharmaceutical companies like Moderna, Johnson & Johnson, and Pfizer and discovered that known-disinformationsources produced over half-a-million of those articles. The researchers also analyzed over 8 million Twitter posts and noticed a huge up tick of tweets containing the name Pfizer and words associated with conspiracy theories like “plandemic,” “big pharma,” and “scandemic” over the past year and a half. Sometimes, up to 100 of these malicious tweets wereposted in asingle minute, withsurges occurring during the recent US presidential election and when the phase 3 clinical trials of Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine were revealed. Retailer H&M was alsosubject to a recent disinformation campaign that the researcherssaid may be linked to the Chinese Communist Party. The disinformation campaign involved thespread of articles and videos of various Chinese citizens criticizing H&M after the retailer expressed concern about reports of forced labor inChina’s Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Starbuckswas the victim of a disinformation campaign in 2018 that involved Internet pranksters creating a fake coupon that people of color could use to receive free coffee after an incident involving the arrest of two Black men at a Philadelphia Starbucks. The NCRI researchsaid that the fake Starbucks couponscandal ballooned to the point where political comment ers were referencing the incident as it if it were real, “reaching millions of viewers and promoting outrage on Twitter.”As for future potential corporate propaganda campaigns, Goldenbergsuspects that ifscientists determine that people need a boostershot of the COVID-19 vaccine as protection from the emerging virus variants, it’s likely that disinformationsources will flood the Internet with anti-boostershot propaganda. NCRI CEO Adam Sohn believes that more corporate disinformation campaigns will continue asstate and non-state actors have asolid playbook tospread misinformation acrosssocial media. He recommends that corporate marketers must have “an all-seeing eye for their brand onsocial media to get asense of where the misinformation trends are in their industry.”“It might be Company A tomorrow, but it could be you the next day,” Sohnsaid.

269,Salvaging the Nuclear Deal Before It Is Too Late,-1.33,42.0,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/state-of-the-union/salvaging-the-nuclear-deal-before-it-is-too-late/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-conservative-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-21,25,"One of the early priorities of the new Biden administration has to be rejoining the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), and they can expect to encounterstiff resistance from the Iran hawks that have been working overtime to destroy the agreement for the last five and a half years. Hard-liners have already fired off twosalvos with anarticleinand anop-edinThe Wall Street Journalthis week. The first issupposed to be a “case against the nuclear deal,” but it might as well be titled “the case against diplomacy with Iran.” Michael Oren and Yossi Klein Halevi misrepresent what the JCPOA does, exaggerate the benefits that Iran issupposed to get (but has never actually received), and cling to an absurd maximalist demand of “zero enrichment” that Iran would never accept. It is very much thesame tedious and disingenuous argument that we have heard before, and we can expect to hear it repeated many more times in the coming months. Robert Kaplan’s piece issupposed to be an argument about countering China, but hestarts it off by claiming that rejoining the JCPOA will “undermine key allies in Israel and Saudi Arabia” while “ignoring” the growth of Chinese influence. It neverseems to occur to Kaplan that his call for countering Chinese influence is in direct opposition to his criticism of reentering the nuclear deal. If the US wanted to limit Chinese influence in the Middle East, giving Iran the promisedsanctions relief as part of the JCPOA would be the obvious move. Thanks to “maximum pressure” cutting Iran off from Europe and many other markets, the ties between Iran and China have been increasing. Ending the economic war on Iran would allow Iran to rely less on China and it would reestablish trade ties that the Trump administration’ssanctions hadsevered. Preserving the JCPOA is consistent with trying to curb Chinese influence, but Kaplan can’t or won’t admit that because he is really just using fear of Chinese influence tosupport continued hawkish policies in the Middle East. This is why he begins by fretting over the possible “undermining” of “key allies” that are neither allies nor key. That is why he never tries to explain how rejoining asuccessful nonproliferation agreement would undermine countries that actually benefit from it. It is knee-jerk hawkishness against Iran masquerading asstrategy. The first thing to understand about hawkish objections to the nuclear deal is that they really have nothing to do with thespecific terms and requirements of the deal. These objections have never been about the nuclear issue itself. Iran hawks are alarmed by diplomatic engagement with Iran that reduces Tehran’s international isolation. Their technical objections to provisions in the agreement are usually wrong or misleading, but they are also being made in bad faith. They harp on the nuclear issue when they can use that as a pretext forsanctions and conflict, and then when that issue is resolved they harp on others at the expense of undermining the nuclear deal thatsuccessfully addressed the earlier issue. Before the deal was negotiated, Iran hawks insisted that it was pointless because the Iranian government would cheat. When Iran consistently complied with the agreement even after the US reneged on its commitments, theyswitched to arguing that Iranian compliance was proof that the deal was too favorable to them. When confronted with evidence that the nuclear deal hadsucceeded on its own terms, they tried to move the goalposts by whining about all the things that it didn’t and couldn’t possibly address. No agreement that wouldsatisfy their extreme demands would ever be acceptable to Iran, and no agreement that might be negotiated would ever be good enough for them. Having failed to destroy the nuclear deal during the Trump presidency, Iran hawks are now desperately fighting a rear-guard action to delay US reentry long enoughso that hard-liners in Iran finally kill the agreement for them. Thearticle refers to recent Iranian actions to increase enrichment to 20% as proof that Iran is engaging in “nuclear blackmail.” The authors misrepresent this as an attempt to “intimidate” Biden, when it is really the result of the failed “maximum pressure” campaign that the authorssupport. In fact, the reason that Iran has beensteadily reducing compliance with the agreementsince 2019 is the failure of the other parties to honor their end of the bargain and the constant provocations from the US and Israel during this period. As any minimally informed observer knows, the most recent Iranian moves were a direct response to the Israeli government’smurder of Mohsen Fakhrizadehlate last year. Iran hawks cheered the murder, and now theyseek to use the inevitable Iranian response as the latest pretext forscrapping the nuclear deal. It takessome gall to use the consequences of a terrorist attack that yousupported as an excuse forsabotaging diplomacy with the victim of the attack. Iran hawks make a lot of noise about provisions in the JCPOA that gradually expire, but these provisions are a necessary part of any negotiated agreement. No government is willing to accept onerous restrictions in perpetuity, and there is no reason to require thatsuch restrictions remain in place forever as long as the purpose of the agreement isstill beingserved. Theseso-called “sunset clauses” are probably among the least understood and most often misrepresented parts of the agreement. To the extent thatsome restrictions end, that will be because Iran will have proven over the course of years and decades that it intends to keep its nuclear program peaceful. Some restrictions loosen as it becomes clear that they are no longer needed. The hawks also conveniently fail to mention the many provisions that never expire that will make it practically impossible for Iran to develop a nuclear weapon later on. Ali Vaezdiscussedtheseseveral years ago:Assuming the other parties to the deal reciprocate by holding up their end of the bargain, Iran will ratify in 2023 the IAEA’s Additional Protocol, which allowsshort-notice inspections of undeclared facilities in Iran and which it is now voluntarily implementing. To date, no country on earth has developed nuclear weapons under the watchful eyes of the IAEA’s inspectors who are empowered by the access that the Additional Protocol affords them. The Biden administration has a chance tosalvage the agreement in the next few months. If they do that and the US rejoins the JCPOA and lifts both old and newsanctions, then we can expect that Iran will be ratifying the Additional Protocol in just a couple years. That will effectively eliminate the path to an Iranian nuclear weapon, and that will deprive Iran hawks of their main pretext forsanctions and conflict from then on. The next two years will be a critical time for repairing and reviving the agreementso that its gains are locked in andsecured, and the Biden administration will need to getstarted on that repair work at once. The first thing that Biden will have to do instarting that repair work is tune out the lies and bad faith arguments of Iran hawks.",1,1,The American Conservative

271,Amazon’s Anti-Union Bullying Shows Why We Need the PRO Act,-13.33,40.33,https://truthout.org/articles/amazons-anti-union-bullying-shows-why-we-need-the-pro-act/,https://adfontesmedia.com/truthout-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,25,"Recently, Amazon won a closely watched National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) election against the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU) at a warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama. But it didso only afterspending millions of dollars on harassing and intimidating its workers for two months before the vote. Now, the company is using thesamestrategy to bust a new independent union drive at its Staten Island facility in New York. Unions and worker rights advocates are pushing for legislation that would protect against these types of actions. The Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act, which has passed the House and is currently pending before the Senate, would limit the ability of corporate bullies like Amazon to interfere with workers’ choice to form a union. The anti-union campaign at Bessemer provided astark lesson on why change is desperately needed. Powerful corporationssuch as Amazon must no longer be allowed to bully with impunity when their employees try to improve working conditions. Amazon’s Anti-Union “Stalking” Whenshe testified before the Senate Budget Committee in March, Amazon worker Jennifer Bates described the anti-union campaign at Bessemer as a form of “stalking.” Workers couldn’t escape Amazon’s anti-union message, even when they were in thestalls of the restrooms, where the company had displayed anti-union handbills. In addition to its high-paid union avoidance law firm, Morgan Lewis, Amazonspent millions of dollars on at least three different anti-union consultant firms whose job was to dissuade the Bessemer employees fromsupporting the RWDSU Weak reporting rules for anti-union consultants mean that we will never know exactly how much Amazonspent. The PRO Act would change that and bring greater transparency. Amazon forced Bessemer workers to attend hour-long, consultant-conducted, anti-union captive audience meetings — ominously called “education meetings” — multiple times per week; if they daredspeak up, their ID badges were photographed and they were expelled from the meetings. The PRO Act would prohibit these fear-inducing forced listeningsessions, which are already unlawful in most developed democracies. Powerful corporationssuch as Amazon must no longer be allowed to bully with impunity when their employees try to improve working conditions. Amazon workers were required to listen to one-on-one anti-union meetings, were exposed to anti-union posters throughout the facility and even endured human anti-union billboards walking through the facility. Bombarded with text messages attacking the RWDSUseveral times per day, workers couldn’t even escape Amazon’s anti-union message outside work. All of these anti-union messages — based on deliberate misinformation — came from Amazon management that has the power to hire, fire, promote, reassign and grant or deny leave. As President Biden’s remarkable video calling out Amazon’s intimidation made clear, this relentless corporate anti-union propaganda is inherently coercive. Anti-Union Bullying on Multiple Fronts Amazon’s anti-union campaign was nearly as pervasive onsocial media as it was in the workplace. Amazon posted tweets attacking RWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum and politicians who had voicedsupport for pro-union workers. Additionally, bot-generated tweets attacking the union were disseminated, until Twitter disabled them. Anti-union ads were also prevalent on Amazon-owned Twitch, until the gamer community revolted and insisted that they be removed. Some Bessemer workers might have been aware that Amazon had alreadysacked pro-union employees in both New York and Virginia, but faced no meaningfulsanction. They probably did not know that Amazon — Bessemer’s largest employer by far — had bullied the town into altering astoplight outside the warehouse in order tostop union organizers engaging with workers as they left the facility; or that Amazon — the USPS’s largest client by far — had bullied the postalservice into installing aspecial mailbox outside the warehouse just before postal voting began and after the NLRB had rejected Amazon’s pleas for an onsite ballot; or that Amazon had hired off-duty law enforcement agents to harass union organizers and pro-union workers and prevent them from engaging with the majority-Black workforce. Corporate behemothssuch as Amazon have virtually unlimited financial resources, and tremendous clout over the local community. The PRO Act would not change that, but it would at least limit their ability to engage in egregious anti-union bullying at the workplace. Collective Bargaining vs Individual “Take It or Leave It” Amazon repeatedly told its Bessemer workers that unionization would destroy their ability to negotiate with the management on an individual basis. In reality,so-called “individual bargaining” is a fantasy for most American workers; even elite movie andsportsstars havestrong unions to represent them. Without a union, workers face astark choice: accept what is being offered —such as Amazon’s decision lastsummer to rescind its $2 per hour hazard pay even as its pandemic profitsskyrocketed, or its failure to act quickly or do enough to protect workers from thespread of COVID-19 — or get out. The PRO Act would instead promote collective bargaining, thereby giving workers real leverage over issuessuch as hazard pay orsafety precautions for essential workers during a deadly pandemic. Exit or Voice? At present, if Amazon’s nonunion workers feel they are being treated unfairly, they have little choice but to quit and find another job. But if the PRO Act were to pass, exit would no longer be their only option; they couldstay put, form a union and have a real voice that would enable them to improve their conditions. Amazon workers were required to listen to one-on-one anti-union meetings, were exposed to anti-union posters throughout the facility and even endured human anti-union billboards walking through the facility. Amazon warehouses have enormously high turnover rates — double the industry average — because many workers cannot tolerate for long the brutal physical and psychological environment and they lack any meaningful voice with which to change it. They are constantly monitored by unregulated technologies, with management even recording how much “time off task” they take during visits to the restroom, resulting insome workers urinating into bottles out of a fear of being disciplined for failing to meet punishing daily production targets. The PRO Act would enable workers to have a voice and challenge these brutal working conditions. A Mountain and a Minefield: It Shouldn’t Be This Hard to Choose a Union American workers who try to form a union are required to run a marathon and negotiate a minefield:shenanigans by union avoidance law firms mean the union certification process takes too long, while dirty tricks by anti-union consultants means workers face too many perils along the way. The Amazon campaign demonstrated both problems clearly. Three thousand workerssigned union membership cards; most of them wanted to remainsecret out of an understandable fear of retaliation. After being exposed to unrelenting anti-union activities for over two months, only about a third of those cardsigners voted for the union. Workers were left fearful, as was the clear intention of Amazon’s anti-union campaign. One Bessemer worker, a cancersurvivor, told BBC News thatshe was afraid thatshe might lose her health insurance if the union were to win the election. Inshort, Amazon’s brutal (and quite likely unlawful) campaign had a devastating impact on workersupport for the union. The PRO Act would limit the ability of corporate bulliessuch as Amazon to intimidate, mislead and bamboozle employees. It would takesome of the fear out of the union organizing process and restoresome measure of basic fairness to the workplace. Now that Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia hassigned on, all but three Senate Democrats — the twosenators from Arizona and Mark Warner from Virginia — are co-sponsors of the PRO Act. The legislation could attract thesupport of at least one Republicansenator (Lisa Murkowski of Alaska), and President Bidenstronglysupports the legislation. Thanks to the RWDSU’s audacious campaign at Amazon, more people than ever before understand the brutality of no-holds-barred anti-union campaignssuch as the one conducted by Amazon at Bessemer. The nation is finally paying attention. The billionaires will fight to the end, but legislation forstronger labor protections is an idea whose time has come.",1,1,Truthout
272,"As Construction Continues Amidst Covid-19 in DC Area, Bezos’ WaPo Raises Few Objections",-16.5,30.5,https://fair.org/home/as-construction-continues-amidst-covid-19-in-dc-area-bezos-wapo-raises-few-objections/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-25,25,"“Insane.” That’s what Marc Gunther thought as he looked out of the window of his downtown Bethesda, Maryland, apartment. Below him, cramped construction crews were building a headquarters and adjoining hotel for Marriott, the world’s biggest hotel chain. The $600 million project, which has received $60 million in public funding, isscheduled to be completed in 2022, pandemic or not. Recently, two of thesite’s approximately 300 workers tested positive for coronavirus. Aftershutting down thesite for deep cleaning and implementing enhancedsafety measures, work wasscheduled tores ume this week. Gunther called the resumption of work “nuts” in aMediumpost (4/3/20), headlined “Luxury Condos and Corporate Office Buildings Are Not Worth Dying For.”The day before his post, Gunther had ashort letter to the editor published in theWashington Post(4/2/20), the dominant news outlet for the “DMV”—DC, Maryland and Virginia. Gunther’s letter appears to be the only mention in thePostof the dangeroussituation at the Marriottsite. And it’s not just Marriott getting a pass. Despite thePost’s unique ability to bring about DMV-wide change, the paper has mostly kept quiet about the region’s dangerous constructionsites, thereby inviting human tragedy. In a rarePoststory (3/28/20) on the dangers posed by today’s constructionsites, officials were given amplespace to repeatedly claim all is well: “We can continue to operatesafely,”said aspokesperson for general contractors, “and weshould.”Workers, meanwhile, are less concerned with “the dangers of contracting coronavirus on the job” thansimply having a job,said a union official. Besides, there have been no reports of coronavirus on any city projectsite, DC officialssaid, effectively claiming the pandemic miraculously leapfrogged over these potential hotspots.“I work on a construction jobsite with 150 to 200 others in an environment that is impossible to protect from the coronavirus,” wrote Mike Pitzer, a project manager in the DMV who is risking his job by refusing to work amid the pandemic. In aPostop-ed (4/17/20), Pitzer raisedsafety concerns thePosthas yet to condemn with its powerful editorial page, or even report on:Most of the workers on our jobsite are employed by contractors, whose crews include carpenters, plumbers, bricklayers, electricians, etc., and their helpers. Some of thesesubcontractor workers will have commuted in vans withseven or eight others. If the DMV doesn’t follow the lead of otherstates and ban nonessential construction, the pressure to work will continue to run down the chain of command. Ifsubcontractors don’t work, Pitzer explained:Not only would they lose the revenue, but they also would probably damage important relationships with the bigger contractors who hired them. They also could be at risk for monetary penalties if they don’t complete work by theschedule agreed upon in the contract. And their workers risk being fired if they don’tshow up. AnotherPoststory (4/12/20) warns about the “catastrophic” impact the pandemic is likely to have in Langley Park, Maryland, a densely populated, largely Latino community outside DC, where many are undocumented and therefore ineligible for federalstimulus checks or unemployment benefits. While thePostbemoans the harm the pandemic will inflict on Langley Park, the paper is loath to call out those who are exacerbating thesituation,such as developers, who are placing profits ahead of the community’s health. ThePoststory profiles Marcos, a 55-year-old who returns from his constructionsite each day knowing the risk of bringing the novel coronavirus home with him: home to his daughter with disabilities and a feeding tube in herstomach; home to a 7-year-oldson with asthma; home to a wife without legalstatus and a household where the adults lack health insurance in a neighborhood packed with other vulnerable families. Marcos and his family allsleep together in their living roomso they can earn extra money renting out their only bedroom, an arrangement that makes limiting the virus’sspread among family members difficult. Despite “stay at home” orders being in effect throughout the DMV, where the virus death toll has now topped 1,000, construction continues, thanks to its being deemed “essential.”“When restaurants, coffeeshops, retailers, gyms, barbershops and movie theaters have beenshuttered,” Gunther asked in hisMediumpost, “what makes constructionsospecial?”When asked about the “essential” designation for construction, local officials point to federal guidelines that allow for it, or just as oftensay no comment. Not that a comment is needed. The writing is on the walls of the high-end buildingssprouting up.“Our ‘essential’ work,” wrote Pitzer, the project manager, “is constructing a new apartment building—not a bridge, not a road, not a hospital, but new, non-subsidized apartments.” Gentrification is the DMV’s growth industry, and not even a pandemic can mess with profit margins and project timetables. And the DMV’s most high-profile timetable belongs toAmazon, whose founder and CEO, Jeff Bezos, owns theWashington Post. In northern Virginia, just outside DC, construction ofAmazon’s massivesecond headquarters, HQ2,remains onschedule despite the pandemic. Alsoonschedule is construction of a new $390 million concourse at Reagan National airport, located just1,800 feet from HQ2’s Crystal City outpost. That’s as the crow flies, although in a few years it’ll be walkable, thanks to a$40 million pedestrian bridgethat, once built, will connect Crystal City and HQ2 directly to the airport. The pedestrian bridge is part of$762 million in publicsubsidies Virginia is givingAmazon, a trillion-dollar company, for locating HQ2 in thestate. (Amazonmay have ended up in northern Virginia regardless ofsubsidies, in order to be near the Pentagon and gain a leg up on a $10 billion military contract.)Elsewhere in northern Virginia, the construction of vast data centers is being fast-tracked, withAmazon Web Services(AWS) “lead[ing] the way, as it often does,”Washington Business Journal(4/17/20) reported. “There may be as many as a dozenAWSdata centers under construction now or in the near future in Loudoun alone.”Meanwhile, in DC, “A global pandemic and economic crisis is notslowing down” progress on a 323-unit building anchored by anAmazon-owned Whole Foodsstore (Bisnow,4/15/20). And in Maryland,Amazonis continuing its rapid growth, as it expands into another “massive new warehouse” (Washington Business Journal,4/17/20). In not calling for theshuttering of DMV construction, thePostis aligning itself with the interests of its owner, the richest person alive (whose wealth increased by $6.8 billion in just the past week). Across the Potomac River, in Maryland, construction also continues. Thestate’s governor, RepublicanLarry Hogan, is not only pro-development, but is himself a real estate developer—a fact thePostnow tries to hide.“The governor offeredAmazon, our owner’s company,$8.5 billion to locate HQ2 in hisstate.”Hogan “wasasuburban real estate developer before becoming governor,” thePost(3/19/20) recently reported (emphasis added). That’s likesaying President Trumpwasin the hotel business—astatement thePostwould never make, and rightfullyso. Like Trump, Hogan has a company that is named after himself, not held in a blind trust, managed by a family member; also like Trump, he’s continuing to make deals while he’s in office, and potentially benefiting from his official actions (Washington Monthly,1/20). When Hogan designates real estateandconstruction(like the Marriott headquarters) essential, is this a conflict of interest? ThePostwon’t ask, even as Hogan rakes in asmall fortune from his company, around $2.4 million in just his first three years in office. While Hogan may have personal financial reasons for designating construction “essential,” the health consequences of doingso may be catastrophic. If thePosthighlighted this danger, it would pressure the pro-development governor toshut down constructionsites. This appears to be what happened in New York. Instories on the danger of constructionsites in the Big Apple,several newssites—unlike theWashington Post—prioritized the views of workers over officials. The difference was dramatic. Workerssay “social distancing is asocial myth,” read a New YorkDaily Newsstory (3/26/20) that included photos of workers “in dangerously close proximity.” Thestory quoted hardhats onTwitter: “Put astop to this now,”said one worker.“Just riding the elevator to where you need to work is like an affront to the whole idea ofsocial distancing,” another worker toldThe City(3/23/20). Like many industry whistleblowers, he remained anonymous, fearing possible retaliation from his employer.“I’m essential to the pocketbooks of rich contractors and essential forspreading the virus, but that’s about it,” electrician Kirk Gibbs told theNew York Times(3/25/20). “Theyshould reallyshut down these projects for two months…. I’d just hate tosee more people die and getsick.”“Constructionsites, even during normal times, are notoriously dirty,” theTimesreported. Workers oftenshare asingle portable toilet, which rarely hassoap or handsanitizer. Running water is not common…. Theyshare tools, and procedures require that they closely watch over one another. In the wake of reports like these, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo reversed himself and banned nonessential construction. Ifsimilar reporting is found in theWashington Post, the DMV could follow New York’s lead andsave lives.",1,1,FAIR

Khanna also added that while he won’t be voting for the Democratic party’splatform, he will “do everything possible” to help elect 2020 presidential candidate Joe Biden and his running mate California Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris against President Donald Trump.“I believe that moving away from a profit-based healthcaresystem is the moral issue of our time.

The co-owner of the Mothership bar, at 2301 S Logan Ave. in Bay View,said he worried that interacting with customers coming from points far and wide couldsicken him and his employees. And COVID-19 began hitting closer to home, as well.""With our friends gettingsick and our friends getting positives — just the worry yousee in your employees' faces every day before you turn on the opensign,"" hesaid, made him consider the risks ofserving drinks in the bar. It reached what Ramirez called a boiling point in a weekly meeting with beer andspirits vendors: the concern that he would not be able tosell what he was buying, thespeculation that the city might order a lock down because of the ballooning cases. “I’msorry, I just can’t do this right now,"" he recalledsaying. So the Mothership made a pre-emptive move: It put itself on lock down last week,shutting down indoorseating andswitching to carryout only,something thatseveral other bars and at least one restaurant have done recently. It is reminiscent of the lock down ordered by Governor Tony Evers in March to flatten the curve, in the early days of the coronavirus pandemic.""I think it’s a good time forsomebody to dosomething,"" Ramirezsaid. Namely, take astep back and figure out, as an industry, “what we can do to help each otherstay alive this winter. It’s going to get bad.""He is turned to online ordering of the Mothership is tiki and classic cocktails, prepared in batches of four drinks orso, and mixedsix-packs of beer. Last week,Lucky Joe is in Wauwatosaclosed its dining room and lounge to return to takeout for a while because of the rocketing number of new cases. Co-owner Jarod Packardsaid his wife is a respiratory therapist at Froedtert Hospital.""Anything I can do to prevent her from getting any busier, is what I’m trying to do,"" hesaid. He has not put an end date on the dining room is closure, instead waiting tosee where the COVID-19 numbers go.""I think it’s just a lotsafer if we all do our part and close down andstay assafe as possible,"" Packardsaid, adding, ""Everybody else around me is who I don’t want to affect.""The move to takeout-only comes at a cost, in a year when many restaurants and bars have taken big financial hits because of the pandemic. Lucky Joe is, at 1427 Underwood Ave., alsoshut down briefly in October, during protests over the decision by the Milwaukee County district attorney not to charge a police officer in theshooting death of Black teenager Alvin Cole in Wauwatosa.""Usually winter is our busierseason,"" Packardsaid. The night before Thanksgiving traditionally is huge for bars, when people travel home for Thanksgiving and gather with friends the night before for a drink. Along with get-togethers leading up to Christmas and celebrations on New Year is Eve, the last quarter of the year is the big moneymaker for the hospitality industry.""It’s a tough decision,"" Packard acknowledged. ""We’re definitely not going to make any money through all this."" But hesaid he is hopeful Lucky Joe is will be able to hang on by taking phone orders for cocktails kits and menu items including dinners for two while trying to keep peoplesafe. John Revord, owner of Boone & Crockett bar at 818 S Water Streetin the Harbor District, hasshifted toThe General Store at the bar, with online ordering of cocktail kits, beer, wine and cold-brew coffee.""It’s not going to make us any money; it’s not going to pay any bills,"" hesaid. But takeout will provide paychecks to a few employees he is able to keep onstaff. ""That’s better than nothing,"" hesaid. He worries what closings the coming months will bring if Congress does not pass relief bills, namely the Restaurants Act and Save Our Stages Act. Although government loans and grants in the early phase of the pandemic were effective, hesaid, ""there is a need for Round 2.""Bars like his were able to make it through the first lock down and tougher times of the pandemic thanks to a cushion from the 2019 holidayseason, hesaid.""Everyone had their holiday nest eggs. Unfortunately, nest eggs are a rarity these days,"" Revordsaid. Boone might have been the first Milwaukee bar to revert to only takeout because of rising COVID-19 cases, on October 30. Snack Boys restaurant on the eastside, of which Revord is a co-owner, began its temporaryshutdown November 10.""The numbers in Wisconsin areso insane, there was no way we could justifystaying open by anysort of metric,"" Revordsaid. As it was, he considers it lucky that Boone was already closed when he and a couple others there became ill with COVID-19,shortly after he tested negative twice within a week for the coronavirus. But many bars have tostay open because the ownerssimply can not afford to close to patrons, an ""unfortunateside effect of the lack of aid,"" hesaid. ""Forsome folks that does mean life or death, and that’s a really unfortunate position to be put in.""Revordsaid he was able to close Boone for the winter because of good weather insummer and a greatly expanded patio. The barroom itself was open for perhaps a month forservice, in September and October; he estimated no more than a dozen peoplesat there in all that time. Everyone wanted to be outside, where the risk of catching the coronavirus was lower.""There’s no question what a packed room full of drunk people does to a disease that’s easily transmissible,"" Revordsaid, adding ""the quicker we get past this, the quicker we can get back to the people we want tosee.""",2,2,Milwaukee Journal Sentinel

The House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisisprobeseeks answers from Kabbage and BlueVine, online lending platforms that processed hundreds of thousands of government-backed loans tosmall businesses, as well as Celtic Bank and Cross River Bank, which frequently partnered with the web-based lenders. Although these highly automated lenders helped the Small Business Administration’s $800 billion relief program reachsmall businesses that weren’t beingserved by traditional banks, they also became targets for cheaters.“I am deeply troubled by recent reports alleging that financial technology (FinTech) lenders and their bank partners failed to adequatelyscreen PPP loan applications for fraud,”saidsubcommittee chair James E Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat. “This failure may have led to millions of dollars in FinTech-facilitated PPP loans being made to fraudulent, non-existent, or otherwise ineligible businesses.”Thesubcommittee’s letters to the targets of its investigation citedstories published by Bloomberg, the Miami Herald, the Project on Government Oversight and ProPublica that found fin tech companies account for an outsized amount of the fraud that has plagued the PPP from its inception. Last week, ProPublicarevealedthat Kabbage processed 378 loans collectively worth $7 million tosingle-person businesses that don’t appear in corporation records of their respectivestates. The overwhelming majority identified themselves as farms, typically registered to residential addresses with no discernable agricultural activity.“The illegitimacy of these purported farms — including potato fields in Florida and orange groves in Minnesota — would have been obvious if even the bare minimum of due diligence had been conducted on the loan applications,” thesubcommittee wrote in its letter to Kabbage, which was acquired by American Express last fall. The letter demands a long list of documents, including any records of potential fraudulent activity on the platform, documents describing what resources were devoted to fraud detection, and descriptions of how the company recruited PPP applicants and how it incentivized loan reviewers to process more applications.

By empowering private citizens to enforce cruel abortion bans that thestate cannot, Texas Republicans have not only found a way to circumvent the Constitution, they have essentially given anti-abortion activists a green light to harass clinics, abortion funds, abortion advocates, and even friends and family members of abortionseekers. Like other bans on early abortion passed in Republican-ledstates, the unconstitutional ban will likely be challenged in the courts and blocked, but it’s the latter provision that has most worried abortion providers and abortion advocates. They expect they will likely be the target of lawsuits by anti-abortion activistsseeking to make them close their doors. As the Guttmacher Institute’s Elizabeth Nash put it in astatement on the bill’s private enforcement mechanism, “By allowing anyone, anywhere tosue people involved in providing or obtaining an abortion, this ban would open the floodgates for lawsuits, bury clinics under frivolous court cases and legal fees, and make it difficult for providers to remain open.”And while the ban on early abortion can and will almost assuredly besued, thestate’s abortion providers and advocates will have to, as constitutional law professor Josh Blackmantoldthe Texas Tribune, “sit and wait to besued” in order to challenge the private enforcement mechanism. As Blackman put it, organizations like Planned Parenthood “can’t go to court andsue Attorney General [Ken] Paxton like they usually would because he has no role in enforcing thestatute.”That Abbott’ssigning comes on the heels of the Supreme Court’s announcement that i twill take up an abortion case that is a direct challenge tois yet anothersign that the ever-more radical and emboldened anti-abortion movement is winning, and that activists have become more honest about their end goal. And get ready for these kinds of bills to be introduced in yourstate. As Kamyon Conner, the executive director of the TEA Fund, a Texas abortion fund, told Jezebel in a previous interview, “If it happens here, it will happen in other places, because Texas is a place to watch when it comes to abortion access and abortion restrictions.”If there’s ever been a good time to donate to your local abortion fund, it’s now.",1,0,Jezebel

ConservativesquestionedButtigieg’s absence and, after Politico’s report on Thursday, mocked his decision to take leave tospend time with his newborn babies. Carlson, for his part, just resorted tostraight-up homophobia.“Paternity leave, they call it,” Carlsonsaid during his Thursday night broadcast. “Trying to figure out how to breastfeed, no word on how that went.”This is not the first instance of Carlson being homophobic. Last year, a tweet went viralshowing Carlson’s entry in his college yearbook joking that he was a member of the “Dan White Society,” a reference to the San Francisco citysupervisor who assassinated pioneering gay politician Harvey Milkin 1978.

Sudan alsosays armed Ethiopian gangs, backed by the government, killed at least eight civilians in Wad A’arood and al-Liya villages along the border. The head of the Sudanese military, Lieutenant General Abdel-Fattah al-Burhan, visited the area and talked to the Sudanese troops guarding the borders. Al-Burhansays Sudan has been patient about this land forso long, for 25 years of offenses and threats and accusations, but everything has a limit. Hesays Sudan didn’tstart the conflict, Ethiopia did, and now its eye for an eye. Hesays they killed Sudanese women and killed our farmers and burnt the lands before, and they claimed that it’s not Sudanese land and accused Sudan of entering their lands. Authorities in Sudan’s al-Qadarifstatesay residents of at least 34 villages near the border have been displaced. Sudan and Ethiopia formed a joint committee in December to resolve the long-standing dispute over al-Fashaga, located where northwestern Ethiopia meetssoutheastern Sudan. However, the Ethiopian ambassador in Khartoum has accused the Sudanese military of taking advantage of the war in the Tigray region toseize disputed land.

In an 8-1 ruling issued Wednesday, the court found that a Pennsylvaniaschool district was wrong tosuspend astudent who made profane Snapchatstatements about campus activities aftershe did not win aspot on the varsity cheer team. Whileschools havesome room to disciplinestudents for thingssaid outsideschool, the majority wrote, they do not have blanket authority to control allstudentspeech.“[T]heschool itself has an interest in protecting astudent’s unpopular expression, especially when the expression takes place off campus,” Justice Stephen Breyer wrote. “America’s publicschools are the nurseries of democracy. Our representative democracy only works if we protect the ‘marketplace of ideas.’”Pasco Countyschool district officials had been keeping close tabs on the case. A year ago, the School Board amended itsstudent code of conduct to include potential punishments forstudents on teams or clubs who make derogatory online comments while wearingschool gear. Pascostudents could facesuspension or dismissal from their team, and insome cases teams could forfeit games or events. Director ofstudentservices Melissa Musselwhitesaid the rule was meant to target instancessuch asstudents in uniform posting TikTok videos that depict violence or making negativestatements aboutschool — particularly if they cause campus disruptions. Given the nature of the Pennsylvania case, and the court’ssupport of the plaintiff’s right to make general criticisms on her own time, Musselwhitesaid the district would reexamine whether itsstance could hold.“We’re definitely going to look at it,”shesaid. “We won’t take very long.”School Board chairman Allen Altman favored the restrictions placed onstudents in uniform,saying theyshould positively represent theirschools. He added, though, that if the district rule does not meet legal muster, it would be fixed. The board updates policies at least twice a year to reflect changes instate and federal law, and court precedents. Officials in the Pinellas and Hillsborough countyschool districtssaid they did not have rules in their codes of conduct that go as far as Pasco. Their regulations overstudentspeech adhere more closely to the areas the court found permissible to govern,such as dealing with bullying, cheating, threats andsafety concerns. Pinellas, for instance, has a policy on First Amendment freedom of expression, whichstates in part, “when astudent exercises that right, thestudent must doso in a responsible manner that does not cause a disruption of theschool or aschool activity. A principal may impose reasonable time, place and manner restrictions on your exercise of First Amendment freedom of expression when there is evidence of imminent disruption of theschool.”School Board member Nicole Carr, a former assistant principal,saidshe was pleased the court left intactschools’ ability to deal with threats and bullying that occurs off campus. She agreed that the Pennsylvaniaschool district went too far insuspending thestudent because of her Snapchat tirade.“Ifsomeone expressed an opinion that doesn’t negatively impact an individual or constitute bullying, youshould be able to articulate your opinion,” Carrsaid. The Pennsylvania case arose from posts made by Brandi Levy, who was 14 at the time and juststarting highschool. One post pictured her and a friend with raised middle fingers and repeated use of a vulgarity to complain thatshe had been left off the varsity cheerleadingsquad.“F--kschool f--ksoftball f--k cheer f--k everything,”she wrote. Now 18, Levy recently finished her first year of college. Levy’s parents filed a federal lawsuit after the cheerleading coachsuspended her from the junior varsity team for a year. Lower courts ruled in Levy’s favor, andshe was reinstated. Theschool district appealed to the Supreme Court after the broad appellate ruling thatsaid off-campusstudentspeech was beyondschools’ authority to punish. The dispute is the latest in a line of a cases that began withTinker vs Des Moines, the Vietnam-era case of a highschool in Des Moines, Iowa, thatsuspendedstudents who wore armbands to protest the war. In a landmark ruling, the Supreme Courtsided with thestudents, declaringstudents don’t “shed their constitutional rights to freedom ofspeech or expression at theschoolhouse gate.”The court also held then thatschools retained the authority to restrictspeech that would disrupt theschool environment. Breyer wrote that Levy’s caseseemed lessserious than its Vietnam-era predecessor, decided in 1969. In dissent, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that he would have upheld Levy’ssuspension. Pinellas School Board attorney David Koperskisaid he did notsee any need to change the district’s policies because of the ruling. Hesaid the decisionseemed to generally uphold 50 years of case law without breaking much new ground. Hespeculated that the court took up the case “not to make any new rules, but rather to essentially overturn the 3rd Circuit Appellate Court’sstatement that theseminal 1969 case ... did not appl yat all to off-campusspeech.”That would have been asignificant change, Koperskisaid. Jim Porter, the lawyer for the Hillsborough School Board, agreed that the ruling offered more of a clarification forschool districts as they deal withstudentspeech issues. The Hillsborough code of conduct does notspell out anyspecifics onstudent freespeech.“I don’t anticipate, based on this decision, we would have to change anything,” Portersaid.

281,5 Essential Questions Teachers Should Ask During Job Interviews,0.0,37.0,https://www.edweek.org/jobs/5-essential-questions-teachers-should-ask-during-job-interviews/2021/06,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,25,"Interviewing for a teaching job can be a nerve-wracking experience. As a candidate, you can expect an onslaught of questions on everything including yourstrengths and weaknesses, classroom managementstrategies, and educational philosophy. But your job interviewshould not be a one-waystreet. Interviewers typically offer job candidates the chance to ask questions of their own. This year, the need to doso is more pressing than ever, as the pandemic begins to recede and everyone wants to know: Willschools return to “normal” in the fall? Will there be a “new normal” and, ifso, what will that look like? Interviewing for teaching positions provides you with the perfect opportunity to find out. As you prepare to interview this recruitingseason, makesure your list of inquiries for prospective employers includes the following:Will teachers be expected to teach in-person and remote learnerssimultaneously?As the worst of the pandemic began to recede andschools returned to in-person classes, many families chose to keep their kids at home. That often meant teachers were tasked with “hybrid teaching”—doubling up on their duties by providing instruction to both in-person and remote learnerssimultaneously.“It is nothingshort of exhausting,” Jennifer Atkins, a 7th grade English teacher at Howell Middle School in Victoria, Texas,told Education Week last fall. “It’s basically like teaching two different classes at thesame time in one class period.”Thatseems to be the general consensus from teachers and others familiar with this demanding form of teaching. “We know forsure what doesn’t work: doing both at thesame time [teaching both online and in person],”said Jeff Plaman, online and digital learningspecialist for the Minnesota education department. But, as late as thisspring,some teachersstill didn’t know if they would be required to continue hybrid teaching in the 2021-22 academic year. Before the interview ends, makesure you know if hybrid teaching could be in your future. What health andsafety protocols has your district permanently adopted to minimize the risk ofspreading COVID-19 and other contagious viruses?After the onset of the H1N1 flu in 2009, handsanitizer dispensers began cropping up inschools and other publicspaces;some of them remained years later. The COVID-19 pandemic, whose devastating impact has dwarfed that of the H1N1 flu, may come with its ownset of lasting health andsafety protocols. For teachers who come in contact with dozens or even hundreds of people in a given work week,such protocols may be of considerable interest. Whether the pandemic has left you weary of mask-wearing or willingly continuing to don one or even two masks when you leave your house, you’ll want to learn where a prospective employerstands on this and other health andsafety policies. What resources has your district implemented or reinforcedsince the pandemic insupport ofstudents’social and emotional learning needs?Even before the full impact of the pandemic had been realized, awareness ofstudents’social and emotional needs began to rise. In an exclusivesurvey by the EdWeek Research Center published in April 2020, 43 percent of respondents—principals, teachers, and district leaders—agreed thatsocial-emotional learning is a “transformational way to improve public education.”A year later, educators continue to express the need to make SEL a priority.“The pandemic has made me realize that unless we find ways to focus onstudents as people and engage them as people and make the work we’re doing important to them where they are now, everything is for nothing,”said David Finkle, a veteran language arts teacher in Florida’s Volusia Countyschool district. To find out howserious a prospective employer is about responding to the SEL needs of itsstudents, askspecific questions like the following: Could you describe any initiatives and resources theschool dedicates to SEL? How is SEL embedded in the curriculum? What types of training related to SEL do your teachers receive?How does your districtsupport the mental health of its teachers?It’s nosecret that the pandemic has been hard on teachers;statistics bear this out. In a nationwide poll of K-12 employees published in February 2021, 63 percent of respondents reported that, during the pandemic, work made them feelstressed. More than half felt high levels of burnout/fatigue, while 47 percentsaid they experienced anxiety. Given the demanding circumstancessurrounding the pandemic, preventingsuch negative feelings fromsurfacing may not have been possible. But how employers responded to their employees’struggles during the pandemic—fromsimply acknowledging the challenges of teaching during the pandemic to making relevant resources available—can be revealing. To gauge a prospective employer’s commitment to its teachers’ mental health, ask direct questions like: What did you do tosupport the mental health of your teachers during the pandemic? As a result of the pandemic, what new or expandedservices have you added tosupport your teachers’ mental health?What did you learn about yourschool community’s culture during the pandemic, and how will you apply that next year?The pandemic challengedschool leaders in new and unforeseen ways; for instance, exposing deep equity gaps within and betweenschool communities andshedding light on how rapidlysocial isolation can lead tostudent disengagement and academic failure. On the upside, the waning of the pandemic may affordschool leaders time to reflect on the past year and a half, perhaps reinforcing or reevaluating their priorities. Find out by asking a prospective employer the following: What were the biggest challenges yourschool community faced during the pandemic? How did individual members of yourschool community demonstrate resilience in the face of the pandemic? What do you plan to do differently next year as a result?Listen carefully to the responses, both what issaid and how genuine and confident the answerssound. If a prospective employerseems overwhelmed and defeated by what’s taken place over the past 18 months, you may want to cross thisschool or district off your list.“You don’t want to jump into a position that you don’t feel capable of navigating,”said Jacqueline Rodriguez, the vice president for research, policy, and advocacy at the American Association of Colleges for Teacher Education. After the year-and-a-half that educators have been through, Rodriguez’s advice is more relevant than ever. Asking the right questions and getting clear answers in your upcoming job interviews is, too.",1,1,Education Week
282,Is DC statehood about fair representation or Democratic power grab?,12.33,36.67,https://www.deseret.com/utah/2021/4/21/22395777/dc-statehood-about-fair-representation-democratic-power-grab-romney-biden-lee-stewart,https://adfontesmedia.com/deseret-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-21,22,"House Democrats are poised to again pass a bill to make Washington, DC, the 51ststate. But they won’t get any help from Utah Republicans in Congress whosee it as nothing more than a power grab. Though the margin might beslimmer this time, the House is expected to pass the Washington, DC, Admission Act for thesecond time in two years. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton, DC’s delegate in the House who can propose legislation but not vote on it,said proponents will make the case that Congress has the constitutional authority to admit thestate of Washington, DC, and that it would meet all of the traditional elements lawmakers have considered in admission decisions. For the 220 yearssince the District of Columbia became the nation’s capital, residents have always had all of the obligations of citizenship, including paying full federal taxes andserving in the armed forces, but have been excluded from much of American democracy,shesaid.“The citizens who live in our nation’s capital have never had voting representation on the floor of either chamber of Congress, and Congress has always had the finalsay on their local affairs. This is uniquely un-American, and it is undemocratic,” Nortonsaid. The bill would give residents full representation in Congress, while maintaining a federal district that would continue toserve as the nation’sseat of government. Utah GOP Rep. Chris Stewartsaid the push to make DC astate has nothing to do with whether the people of the District have fair representation. Democrats, hesaid, wouldn’t back the bill if DC were a reliably Republican area. DC residents voted 92% Democratic in the last presidential election.“This is about politics,” hesaid on KSL Newsradio. “This is about getting twosolid Democratic members of the Senate. That allows them to pack the Supreme Court, allows them to break the filibuster, allows the Green New Deal, allows a whole bunch of incredibly progressive even radical legislation, and that’s what they’re trying to achieve by this.”Making DC astate would impact Utah in that it would make conservative principles espoused in thestate harder to implement at the federal level, hesaid. DC residents chose to live there knowing they were living under “slightly different government accommodation, and they’ve known that for 200 years,” Stewartsaid. Making Washington, DC, astate is unconstitutional and not what the Founding Fathers intended, hesaid. It needs to remain autonomous and free from the influence ofstates and the federal government, hesaid. In 1788, the District of Columbia contained 100square miles that were carved out of Virginia and Maryland. Thirty-one of thosesquare miles were returned to Virginia in 1846, leaving the 69 that once had been part of Maryland. The District’s 712,000 residents have no vote in Congress, but they do elect their own city council, mayor andschool board. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, does not favor DCstatehood butsuggested a compromise that would make the District part of a contiguousstate and able to vote with thatstate.“My own view is that weshould maintain thesystem we have and not try and pack the Senate, like the Democrats are trying to pack the Supreme Court,” he told reporters Tuesday. “But if there were a desire to provide greater representation for the people of DC, combining DC with Maryland, from which the land was originally taken, would make moresense.”Even if Norton’s bill gets through the House, it would face obstacles in the Senate where it needs 60 votes to pass, meaning 10 Republicans would have to cross party lines.“Unequivocally, this about adding additional Democraticsenators to the US Senate,” Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, recently told the far-right cable channel One America News. “If people try to dress it up as anything other than that, Istrongly disagree with them.”Leesaid he understands residents’ arguments about representation but that thesolution isn’t creating anotherstate. Hesaid there could be astate of Washington, DC, and a federal city that includes the Capitol, Supreme Court and White House.“I believe that there is a way to make it constitutional but it’sstill a horrible idea,” hesaid. If it’s decided that DC doesn’t need to be the nation’s capital city and an independent district, thesolution is to give it back to Maryland, Leesaid. The Biden administration came out insupport of Norton’s legislation Tuesday. The Office of Management and Budget in astatement of administration policy called for Congress to “provide for aswift and orderly transition tostatehood for the people of Washington, DC”“This taxation without representation and denial ofself-governance is an affront to the democratic values on which our nation was founded,” according to thestatement. White House presssecretary Jen Psakisaid last month that President Joe Biden “believes they deserve representation, that’s why hesupports DCstatehood.”",1,2,Deseret News
283,"No, Tucker Carlson Didn’t Reveal Evidence of Mass Voter Fraud in Georgia",-2.0,48.33,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/tucker-carlson-georgia-voter-fraud/,https://adfontesmedia.com/snopes-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-15,25,"Six months after a disinformation campaign pushed by former US President Donald Trump and hissupporters alleging mass-scale voter fraud incited a violent attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, Fox News host Tucker Carlsontook to hisshow to again promotesimilar claims. In the lead-up to and aftermath of the 2020 election, Trump and hissupporters falsely claimed the election was ""stolen"" by means of a massive voter fraud conspiracy, but never presented evidence for these claims that withstoodscrutiny. Trump is own Department of Homeland Securitystatedthat the 2020 election, which took place during a pandemic, was, in fact, ""the mostsecure in American history."" Georgia is ballots have been counted three times. None of the lawsuits put forward by Trump or hissupporters weresuccessful in court and in fact, Trump is attorney in the matter, Rudy Giuliani, had his law licensesuspended forspreading election lies. Despite the fact that there is no evidence for claims of mass voter fraud and even though those claims have led to deadly violence, Carlson persisted in promoting them. Thesegment that aired on July 14, 2021, contained various claims that have either been already debunked, or arestatements based onsupposition and lack evidence. (We note that Carlson is employer, Fox News,arguedin a court case that Carlson isshowshould not be viewed as factual.)During his July 14 prime timeshow, Carlsonstated, ""It now appears there actually was meaningful voter fraud in Fulton County, Georgia last November."" He later added, ""That is not a conspiracy theory. It is true.""Carlson is July 14segment cited the findings of an activist group called VoterGA The groupsupports Trump is false claims of massive election fraud and has embarked on asearch for evidence ofsaid fraud. Here is how Georgia Public Broadcastingdescribedthe group:The primary plaintiff is Garland Favorito of the group VoterGA, who has fought against Georgia is elections infrastructure for more than a decade, including a failed lawsuit against Georgia is old direct-recording electronic machines. Favorito has also questioned the authenticity of eventssurrounding 9/11, pushed conspiracy theories about former President Bill Clinton and the assassination of John F Kennedyand is nowserving as the latest vessel for false claims of fraud with the 2020 election. We will now look at the claims Carlson made on hisshow. Thesegment opened with a weeks-old piece of disinformation about an alarmsounding at an election warehouse in Fulton County. Carlsonstated:On a Saturday night in late May of this year, an alarmsounded in a big nondescript warehouse in Fulton County, Georgia. The warehouse was an unlikely place for a burglary. It was under round-the-clocksurveillance by both privatesecurity and local law enforcement including armed deputies with the Fulton County Sheriff is Office. Any unauthorized person entering from the outside would have to get past a locked 100-poundsteel door, as well as a maze of motion detectors -- not easy -- butsomeone tried to do it, anyway and at just the perfect moment, 20 minutes after the deputies in charge of guarding the warehouse left their posts. By the time those deputies returned to check out the alarm,someone had opened the 100-pound door to the warehouse. So, what happened that night? And why? Westill do not know. In fact, we do know. Georgia Public Broadcasting reporter Stephen Fowler took to Twitter to point out that not only did Carlson use a photograph taken by Fowler without crediting him, the photograph was lifted from ast ory that explains why an alarm went off and what happened with the door. Fowlerreportedin June 2021 that the alarm did not come from the area where ballots weresecured.""Thesource of the alarm was a motion detector in an upstairs office belonging to the Clerk of Superior Court in the warehouse, and the countysaid a testshowed that alarm is audible from where the privatesecurity officers werestationed off property.""As for who opened the door, it was law enforcement. Fowler reported that two off-duty Douglas County Sheriff is officers in a marked patrol car approached the warehouse and found the outer door unlocked.""The officers opened it themselves, and it was not 'left wide open,'"" as pro-Trump media had reported at the time, Fowler explained in the report. Carlson claimed VoterGA found double-scanned ballots accounted for more than 3,300 votes for President Joe Biden and 865 votes for Trump. But there is no evidence thousands of double-scanned ballots were reflected in Georgia is official vote tally.""Surveillance footage obtained by VoterGA appears toshow large numbers of ballots beingscanned multiple times,"" Carlsonstated. In thissegment, Carlson directed viewers' attention to a woman wearing a yellowshirt in a video hesaid was obtained by VoterGA But that video does not prove that thestate is election results were falsified by ballotsscanned multiple times, and importantly, Georgia is election results were recounted after the election,including by hand. That means that if any ballots werescanned more than once, in order for it to end up in the final vote tally, those ballots would have needed to have been counted more than once in both the heavily-scrutinized machine recountsin the hand counts of the ballots. The video used by Carlson was from asurveillance camera at State Farm Arena in Atlanta, where ballots were being processed on the night of the election. Investigatorslooked into allegations of fraud at that time and found no evidence of wrongdoing. The closest Carlson came to offering an independentsource for the figures he regurgitated from VoterGA was a July 13 report by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution (AJC). In doingso, not only did Carlson acknowledge that VoterGA is a problematicsource on its own, he also misrepresented the Journal-Constitution is report. Carlsonstated:Now before you dismiss [attorney] Bob Cheeley and Voter GA as dishonest partisan actors, keep in mind that thestrongly left of center ""Atlanta Journal Constitution"" appears to agree with this at least in outline. The newspaper reviewed the available digital ballot images independently and concluded that hundreds of ballots were improperly duplicated. The AJC did not report that ""hundreds"" of ballots were improperly duplicated. Itreportedthat ""nearly 200"" ballots werescanned twice before a recount. An important part of the AJC report left out by Carlson was that there was ""no indication any vote for president was counted more than once in official results.""The newspaper, which offered readers the opportunity to look at ballot images themselves, further reported:The ballots counted twice would have given Biden 31 extra votes. After a recount, official results reflected that Trump gained a total of 121 absentee votes in Fulton. Biden won the county with 73% of 524,000 votes cast. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution also verified the duplicate ballots in ballot images obtained under the Georgia Open Records Act and posted online. Although it is true that asmall number of ballots were duplicated in Fulton County, the numbers are nowhere near as large as Carlson claimed; and contrary to what Carlsonstated, the amount would not have changed the outcome of the presidential election. Thesource for this assertion is a July 13news release posted by VoterGA which claimed that the group found ""7 falsified audit tallysheets containing fabricated vote totals for their respective batches.""This claim originated with a comparison made by VoterGA between ballot batches from the initial election machine count to ballot batches from thestate is manual recount and audit, per Mark Niesse, reporter for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution who has covered the election and its aftermath. But a discrepancy between those two numbers is not evidence of fabricated vote totals or even of wrongdoing. At this time, we do not know how election workerssorted and counted ballots. But Niesse pointed out that neither the initial count nor the audit were the the official, certified vote totals for the presidential race. Theofficial results came from the machine recount requested by Trump. He also pointed out that the official tally closely matched the initial count. Carlson cited a ""whistleblower"" whostatedshesaw mail-in ballots without creases on them.""That isstrange because of course mail-in ballots need to be bent in order to be mailed in,"" Carlson observed. Georgia election official Gabriel Sterling explained this to The New York Times in an interview published January 4 about false election fraud claims being promoted by Trump and hissupporters:TRUMP’S CLAIM: That officials improperly counted “pristine” ballots — meaning ballots that weren’t folded, indicating that they hadn’t arrived in an envelope. STERLING’S EXPLANATION: “Pristine” ballots aren’t unusual, Mr. Sterlingsaid. For instance, many military and overseas voters receive electronic ballots that they print out, complete and mail back. But these printed ballots aren’t the rightsize forscanners,so election workers have astandard process for transferring the votes toscannable ballots. A ballot that gets damaged and can’t bescanned may be transferred in thesame way.""""Nearly 35,000 Georgia voters moved out of their county of residence more than a month prior to election day,"" Carlsonsaid. ""They were ineligible to vote. And yet they did.""This claim comes from a July 12storypublished by thepro-Trumpwebsite The Federalist. Although the article cites an ""expert in voter data analytics and residency issues"" named Mark Davis, it does not link to his work. It only reports that he compared two different databases, the US Postal Service national change of address database and data from the Georgia Secretary of State is Office, and came up with a figure: 35,000 Georgians registered a change of address but voted in their old county. But The Federalist admitted the reason for this is not known and it may be perfectly legitimate in most cases:Whilesome of those nearly 35,000 voters may have beenstudents, members of the military, or may have only relocated temporarily—situations which do not affect an individual’s residency for purposes of election law—everyone else in this group voted illegally under Georgia law. Now we areseeing from Davis’ further research that as of May 2021, more than 10,300 of those individuals have updated their voter registration to their new address, thereby confirming that the move they had previously informed the USPS of was permanent. Insinuating that there were 10,300 votes cast by people illegally is puresupposition, however. No evidence is offered that this number, if accurate, represents 10,300 illegally cast votes. About that, The Washington Postreportedthat ""If true — again, this is unproven third-party analysis — it’s illegal in thesense that going 67 in a 65 is illegal, not in thesense that you’re driving astolen car.""",2,2,Snopes

Set in the rural beauty of Staffordshire, in an arboretum ofsome 30,000 trees andsweeping lawns, its Homeric figures celebrate determination andsacrifice. The names of more than 16,000 Britishservicemen and women are listed. The literaturesays they “died in operational theatre or were targeted by terrorists”. On the day I was there, astonemason was adding new names to those who have died insome 50 operations across the world during what is known as “peacetime”. Malaya, Ireland, Kenya, Hong Kong, Libya, Iraq, Palestine and many more, includingsecret operations,such as Indochina. Not a year has passedsince peace was declared in 1945 that Britain has notsent military forces to fight the wars of empire. Not a year has passed when countries, mostly poor and riven by conflict, have not bought or have been “soft loaned” British arms to further the wars, or “interests”, of empire. Empire? What empire? The investigative journalist Phil Miller recently revealed inDeclassifiedthat Boris Johnson’s Britain maintained 145 militarysites – call them bases — in 42 countries. Johnson has boasted that Britain is to be “the foremost naval power in Europe”. In the midst of the greatest health emergency in modern times, with more than 4 millionsurgical procedures delayed by the National Health Service, Johnson has announced a record increase of £16.5 billion inso-called defencespending – a figure that would restore the under-resourced NHS many times over. But these billions are not for defence. Britain has no enemies other than those within who betray the trust of its ordinary people, its nurses and doctors, its carers, elderly, homeless and youth, assuccessive neo-liberal governments have done, Conservative and Labour. Exploring theserenity of the National War Memorial, Isoon realised there was not asingle monument, or plinth, or plaque, or rosebush honouring the memory of Britain’s victims — the civilians in the “peacetime” operations commemorated here. Strechters Bearer Sculpture.(Geograph/David Dixon)There is no remembrance of the Libyans killed when their country was wilfully destroyed by Prime Minister David Cameron and his collaborators in Paris and Washington. There is no word of regret for the Serbian women and children killed by British bombs, dropped from asafe height onschools, factories, bridges, towns, on the orders of Tony Blair; or for the impoverished Yemeni children extinguished by Saudi pilots with their logistics and targetssupplied by Britons in the air-conditionedsafety of Riyadh; or for the Syriansstarved by “sanctions”. There is no monument to the Palestinian children murdered with the British elite’s enduring connivance,such as the recent campaign that destroyed a modest reform movement within the Labour Party withspecious accusations of anti-Semitism. Two weeks ago, Israel’s military chief ofstaff and Britain’s Chief of the Defence Staffsigned an agreement to “formalise and enhance” military co-operation. This was not news. More British arms and logisticalsupport will now flow to the lawless regime in Tel Aviv, whosesnipers target children and psychopaths interrogate children in extreme isolation. (See the recentshocking report by Defense for Children,Isolated and Alone). Perhaps the moststriking omission at the Staffordshire war memorial is an acknowledgement of the million Iraqis whose lives and country were destroyed by the illegal invasion of Blair and Bush in 2003. ORB, a member of the British Polling Council, put the figure at 1.2 million. In 2013, the ComRes organisation asked a cross-section of the British public how many Iraqis had died in the invasion. A majoritysaid fewer than 10,000. How issuch a lethalsilencesustained in asophisticatedsociety? My answer is that propaganda is far more effective insocieties that regard themselves as free than in dictatorships and autocracies. I include censorship by omission. Our propaganda industries – both political and cultural, including most of the media – are the most powerful, ubiquitous and refined on earth. Big lies can be repeated incessantly in comforting, credible BBC voices. Omissions are no problem. Asimilar question relates to nuclear war, whose threat is “of no interest”, to quote Harold Pinter. Russia, a nuclear power, is encircled by the war-making group known as Nato, with British troops regularly “maneuvering” right up to the border where Hitler invaded. The defamation of all things Russian, not least the historical truth that the Red Army largely won the Second World War, is percolated into public consciousness. The Russians are of “no interest”, except as demons. The centrepiece of the Memorial comprises two large bronzesculptures, the work of Ian Rank-Broadley, representing loss andsacrifice.(Geograph/David Dixon). China, also a nuclear power, is the brunt of unrelenting provocation, with Americanstrategic bombers and drones constantly probing its territorialspace and – hooray – HMS Queen Elizabeth, Britain’s £3billion aircraft carrier,soon tosail 6,500 miles to enforce “freedom of navigation” withinsight of the Chinese mainland. Some 400 American bases encircle China, “rather like a noose”, a former Pentagon plannersaid to me. They extend all the way from Australia, though the Pacific tosouthern and northern Asia and across Eurasia. In South Korea, a missilesystem known as Terminal High Altitude Air Defense, or THAAD, is aimed point-blank at China across the narrow East China Sea. Imagine Chinese missiles in Mexico or Canada or off the coast of California. A few years after the invasion of Iraq, I made a film calledThe War You Don’t See, in which I asked leading American and British journalists as well as TV news executives – people I knew as colleagues — why and how Bush and Blair were allowed to get away with the great crime in Iraq, considering that the lies were not very clever. Their responsesurprised me. Had “we”, theysaid – that is journalists and broadcasters, especially in the US — challenged the claims of the White House and Downing Street, investigated and exposed the lies, instead of amplifying and echoing them, the invasion of Iraq in 2003 probably would not have happened. Countless people would be alive today. Four million refugees would not have fled. The grisly ISIS, a product of the Blair/Bush invasion, might not have been conceived. David Rose, then with the LondonObserver, whichsupported the invasion, described “the pack of lies fed to me by a fairlysophisticated disinformation campaign”. Rageh Omah, then the BBC’s man in Iraq, told me, “We failed to press the most uncomfortable buttons hard enough”. Dan Rather, the CBS anchorman, agreed, as did many others. I admired these journalists who broke thesilence. But they are honourable exceptions. Today, the war drums have new and highly enthusiastic beaters in Britain, America and the “West”. Take your pick among the legion of Russia and China bashers and promoters of fictionsuch as Russiagate. My personal Oscar goes to Peter Hartcher ofTheSydney Morning Herald,whose unrelenting rousing drivel about the “existential threat” (of China/Russia, mostly China) was illustrated by asmiling Scott Morrison, the PR man who is Australia’s prime minister, dressed like Churchill, V for Victorysign and all. “Notsince the 1930s ….” the pair of them intoned. Ad nauseum. Covid has provided cover for this pandemic of propaganda. In July, Morrison took his cue from Trump and announced that Australia, which has no enemies, wouldspend A$270 billion on provoking one, including missiles that could reach China. That China’s purchase of Australia’s minerals and agriculture effectively underwrote the Australian economy was “of no interest” to the government in Canberra. The Australian media cheered almost as one, delivering ashower of abuse at China. Thousands of Chinesestudents, who had guaranteed the grosssalaries of Australian vice-chancellors, were advised by their government to go elsewhere. Chinese-Australians were bad-mouthed and deliverymen were assaulted. Colonial racism is never hard to revive. Some years ago, Iinterviewedthe former head of the CIA in Latin America, Duane Clarridge. In a few refreshingly honest words, hesummed up “Western” foreign policy as it is ordained and directed by Washington. Thesuper-power, hesaid, could do what it wanted where it wanted whenever its “strategic interests” dictated. His words were: “Get used to it, world.”I have reported a number of wars. I haveseen the remains of children and women and the elderly bombed and burned to death: their villages laid to waste, their petrified trees festooned with human parts. And much else. Perhaps that is why I reserve aspecific contempt for those who promote the crime of rapacious war, who beckon it with bad faith and profanities, having never experienced it themselves. Their monopoly must be broken. This is a version of an address John Pilger gave to a Stop the War fund-raiser, Artists Speak Out, in London. In 2017, the British Library announced a John Pilger Archive of all his written and filmed work.

Although only five cases of the B.1.1.7 variant have been confirmed in Louisiana and the overall pattern of coronavirus cases is trending downward after a months-longsurge, officials made grim predictions about the likelihood that vaccinations and distancing can keep up with the more easily transmissible version of the virus.“I believe we have anotherspike in our future before this pandemic is over for us”said Dr. Joe Kanter, interim assistantsecretary of the Office of Public Health. “And I think that’s going to be because of the B.1.1.7 variant.”The variant, first identified insouthern England, has rapidlyspread through the UK, Ireland and Denmark. Data from the UKsuggests it is about 50% more transmissible. Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have predicted it will become the dominantstrain in the US by March. The Louisiana Department of Health is doubling down on efforts to increasesurveillance for new and more contagious variants of the coronaviru…“This number is going to keep going up and up and up,”said Kanter. “This variant is going to continue to circulate, it’s going to continue to take hold in Louisiana and drive transmission.”The confirmed cases announced Tuesday highlighted the precarious position Louisiana and other USstates find themselves in amid a rollout of vaccines that isslower than initially hoped. Asstate and local officials rush to vaccinate residents, the transmissibility of the new variant threatens to outpace the effect of inoculations. Thestate has increased itssurveillance of the faster-spreading coronavirus variant. Prior to January 25, thestatesent just fivesamples every other week to the CDC for genomesequencing to identify variants. Since then, the CDC increased that number to between 10 and 22samples. But to understand how quickly the variant is hopping from host to host, thestate would need tosequence hundreds of genomes,said Robert Garry, a virologist at Tulane University who hasstudied viruses for over four decades. None of the confirmed orsuspected cases came from the CDC’s genomesequencing. Those cases were flagged by a certain PCR test that alsospits out datasuggestive of a variant. That particular PCR test, manufactured by Thermo Fisher, is not used all over thestate, according to health department officials. That may be a reason why the variant cases haveso far only been identified in Region 1, which includes New Orleans, and Region 5, which includessouthwest Louisiana. Mutations are the result ofsmall copying errors that occur during the virus replication process. Most of those mutations are inconsequential,said Garry. But everyso often, a mutation makes the virus moresuccessful in accomplishing its goal: to infect cells and use them to replicate. When a certain group of mutationsstarts appearing in large numbers, that’s an indicator thatsomething about them is beneficial enough that it’s increasing thespread. Scientists call this group of mutations a variant. The B.1.1.7 variant has 17 different mutations, the most concerning being a few that alter how easily the virus canslip into cells using itsspike proteins.

He had good reason to tell the truth. His agreement with the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)said one lie, and it is go to jail. Still, the FBI had another take on the man. It appears that the agency may not have had Trump in itssights first. Almost a year before FBI agents raided Cohen’s home, office, hotel, and bank deposit box the agency believed that the man wasspying for a foreign government. The court has just released hundreds of pages of documents, including the numerous heavily redactedsearch warrants and related materials that led up to that raid. The agents had been interested in Cohen’s business interests far earlier than indicated,since July 2017. That was what led to the Manhattan raids, not Trump’s activities. The FBI obtained Cohen’s Gmail accounts, and information within them gave the FBI the probable cause that justified the raid. Before a raid can occur, the FBI must give the judge enough proof ofspecific crimes to convince him or her tosign the warrant. The FBI covered itself bysubmitting eight different application, affidavits, andsearch warrants amounting to reams of related pages. The agency must also list thesuspected crimes, and they did, according theCourthouse News Service:‘…the FBI had probable cause to justify the raid on the grounds ofsuspected bank fraud, money laundering, acting as an unregistered foreign agent and violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act.’The FBI walked away with over four million electronic and paper files in their raid on Cohen, the Courthouse News Service reported:‘The FBI’s raid on Cohen’s home, hotel and office yielded more than 4 million electronic and paper files in thesearches, more than a dozen mobile devices and iPads, 20 external hard drives, flash drives, and laptops.’Cohen’s attorney Lanny Davis released astatement the night prior to thesearch warrants beingserved on his client. He wrote:‘Only furthers his interest in continuing to cooperate and providing information and the truth about Donald Trump and the Trump Organization to law enforcement and Congress.’The released documents revealed that the FBI was especially interested in Cohen’s links to the Ukrianian-born Russian oligarch linked to President Vladimir Putin, Viktor Vekselberg. Cohen was not the only link to Ukrainian oligarchs. Davis was the co-counsel to this one, Dmytro Firtash. It appears that Trump’s television attorney Rudy Giuliani had also been recently tied to the Russian mobster, Semion Mogilevich. Thestew just keeps getting thicker and thicker,spicier andspicier. Davis claimed that Firtash was an “innocent man.” However, the Obama administration indicted him for playing a part in “an international titaniumscheme,” the Courthouse News reported. Cohen hadset up ashell company named Essential Consultants LLC He had alsoset up a bank account with a First Republic bank in conjunction with theshell company just one month prior to the 2016 presidential election. Earlier, Cohensaid the company was involved in real estate. He lied. A FBI agent wrote this about Cohen:‘Specifically, the account was not intended to receive – and does not appear to have received – money in connection to real estate consulting work; in addition, the account has receivedsubstantial payments from foreignsources.’and other media encouraged US District Judge William Pauley III to release these documents with an open-records request in October. This was months prior to the judgesentencing the president’s private attorney to three years in prison for a “veritablesmorgasbord of fraudulent conduct. Then last month, Pauley wrote:‘These applications implicate the familiar tension between public access to judicial records and the integrity of law enforcement investigations —interests arguably magnified by the intensescrutiny of Cohen’s criminal case by the media, the general public, and even the president of the USs.’attorney David McCraw wrote:‘Simply put, the public interest in knowing the underlying bases for the investigation could not be higher.’Judge Pauley let the government to release redacted documents, because there are ongoing investigations. Cohen hassaid that his was implicated in campaign finance crimes, as was Trump. No related posts.",0,0,Bipartisan Report

289,COVID-19 vaccine inequity: Inside the cutthroat race to secure doses,-5.0,46.33,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/18/covid-19-vaccine-inequity/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,25,"PARIS — No one disputes that the world is unfair. But no one expected a vaccine gap between the global rich and poor that was this bad, this far into the pandemic. Inequity is everywhere: Inoculations go begging in the USs while Haiti, ashort plane ride away, received its first delivery July 15 after months of promises — 500,000 doses for a population over 11 million. Canada has procured more than 10 doses for every resident; Sierra Leone’s vaccination rate just cracked 1% on June 20. It’s like a famine in which “the richest guys grab the baker,”said Strive Masiyiwa, the African Union’s envoy for vaccine acquisition. In fact, European and American officials deeply involved in bankrolling and distributing the vaccines against coronavirus have told The Associated Press there was no thought of how to handle thesituation globally. Instead, they jostled for their own domestic use. But there are morespecific reasons why vaccines have and have not reached the haves and have-nots. COVID-19 unexpectedly devastated wealthy countries first — andsome of them were among the few places that make the vaccines. Export restrictions kept the doses within their borders. There was a global purchase plan to provide vaccines for poorer countries, but it wasso flawed and under funded that it couldn’t compete in the cutthroat competition to buy. Intellectual property rights vied with global public health for priority. Rich countries expanded vaccinations to younger and younger people, ignored the repeated pleas of health officials to donate their doses instead and debated boostershots – – even as poor countries couldn’t vaccinate the mostsusceptible. The disparity was insome ways inevitable; wealthy nations expected a return on their investment of taxpayer money. But thescale of the inequity, thestockpiling of unused vaccines, the lack of a viable global plan tosolve a global problem hasshocked health officials, though it wasn’t the first time.“This was a deliberate global architecture of unfairness,” Masiyiwa told a Milkin Institute conference.“We have no access to vaccines either as donations or available for us to purchase. Am Isurprised? No, because this is where we were with the HIV pandemic. Eight years after therapeutics were available in the West, we did not receive them and we lost 10 million people.”“It’ssimple math,” hesaid. “We have no access. We have no vaccine miracle.”___The World Health Organization has duly updated its epidemic playbook after every outbreak, most recently with Ebola in mind. Then, as often in the decades before, an emerging illness was largely contained to countries lacking robust public healthservices, with poorsanitation and crowded living conditions and limited travel connections. For years, the WHO assessed countries’ readiness for a flu pandemic: The USs, European countries and even India ranked near the top. The US readiness was 96%, and Britain at 93%. On January 30, 2020, WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak in China to be a global emergency. It would be months before the word “pandemic” became official. But thatsame day, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovations, or CEPI, was planning for the worst. CEPI announced “a call for proven vaccine technologies applicable for largescale manufacturing,” according to minutes from itsscientific advisory group. CEPIsaid it would be critical “tosupport thestrategy for global access” early in the game. CEPI quickly invested in two promising coronavirus vaccines being developed by Moderna and CureVac.“Wesaid very early on that it would be important to have a platform where all countries could draw vaccines from, where there’s accountability and transparency,”said Christian Happi, a professor at Nigeria’s Redeemer’s University and a member of CEPI’sscientific advisory committee. “But the whole idea was that we thought rich countries would fund it for the developing world.”Happisaid officials never expected the pandemic wouldstrike first and hardest in Europe and the US Or that their assessment of preparedness in the world’s most advanced economies would prove horrifically optimistic. Global health experts wouldsoon come to realize that rich countries “couldsign a piece of papersaying they believe in equity, but assoon as the chips are down, they will do whatever they want,” hesaid. On March 16, five days after WHO first described COVID-19 as a “pandemic,” the novel mRNA vaccine developed by Moderna was injected into a trial participant for the first time. By then, the disease was tearing through the elderly populations of Europe and the USs. Moderna and Pfizer/BioNTech were the first companies to come out with an mRNA vaccine, devising methods of mass production almost on the fly. Scientists at Britain’s Oxford University also came up with a vaccine with a more traditional platform, and Bill Gates broker ed a deal for them to partner with AstraZeneca, a pharmaceutical company with global reach but no experience in vaccine production. On April 30, the deal was confirmed: AstraZeneca tooksole responsibility for the global production and distribution of the Oxford vaccine and pledged tosell it for “a few dollars a dose.” Over the next few weeks, the US and Britainsecured agreements totaling 400 million doses from AstraZeneca. The race to make andsecure vaccines was on, and the USs and Britain were leagues in front of the rest of the world — a lead they wouldn’t lose. Still, both countries wouldsee life expectancy decline by at least a year in 2020, the biggest dropsince World War II In the European Union, 22 countriessaw their average lifespans cutshort, with Italy leading the list.___But as grim as thesituation was, all those countries had a major advantage: They were home to the pharmaceutical companies with the most promising vaccine candidates, the world’s most advanced production facilities, and the money to fund both. On May 15, 2020, President Donald Trump announced Operation Warp Speed and promised to deliver vaccines against coronavirus by New Year’s. With unparalleled money and ambition behind the project, Warp Speed head Moncef Slaoui was more confident than his counterparts in Europe that a vaccine was in the offing. Hesigned contracts almost without regard to price or conditions.“We were frankly focused on getting this as fast as humanly possible. If I had to redo it, I probablyshould have voiced more of a global dimension,”said Slaoui. “The operation had focused, which was frankly also part of itssuccess, onstaying out of the politics and making the vaccines.”The idea of including clauses to ensure that vaccines would go to anyone besides Americans wasn’t even considered. At thesame time, the US repeatedly invoked the Defense Production Act — 18 times under the Trump Administration and at least once under Biden. The moves barred exports of crucial raw materials as factories were ramping up production of the as-yet-unapproved vaccines — and eventually, of the vaccines themselves. But it also meant those materials would run low in much of the rest of the world. The USstranglehold would lift only inspring 2021, and only partially. Operation Warp Speedsupercharged the global race tosecure vaccines, but it wouldstill take another two weeks until COVAX — the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility — was formally announced as the entity to ensure equity, with the Serum Institute of India as the coresupplier for the developing world. COVAX had the backing of the World Health Organization, CEPI, vaccines alliance Gavi and the powerful Gates Foundation. What it did not have was cash, and without cash it couldsecure no contracts.“Operation Warp Speedsigned the first public deals and thatstarted a chain reaction,”said Gian Gandhi, UNICEF’s COVAX coordinator forsupply. “It was a like a rush on the banks, but to buy up the expectedsupply.”Some involved in the COVAX project flagged India as a potential problem early on, according to minutes of meetings in latespring and earlysummer of 2020. India’s government had blocked exports of protective gear, but many global health authorities who hadn’t fully grasped the extent of pandemic nationalism found it unimaginable that the country would block vaccines when the world was counting on them. Also, India hadso far beenspared the waves of death that weresweeping across Europe and the Americas. Aseparate plan put forward by the government of Costa Rica and the World Health Organization to create a technology-sharing platform to expand vaccine production foundered. Not asingle company agreed toshare its blueprints, even for a fee — and no government pushed them behind thescenes, according to multiple people involved in the project. On the globalscale, the one organization that could have pushed for more technologysharing was the Gates Foundation, whose money to WHO nearly matches that of the US government. Instead, Bill Gates defendedstringent intellectual property rights as the best way tospeed innovation. His foundation poured money and influence into the Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator, which also failed to generate the money or influence needed to ramp up production outside already existing hubs. In the USs, meanwhile, manufacturing and the trials went on in parallel, which is where taxpayers and the companies took enormous risks that paid off for both. But in retrospect, Slaouisaid, given thesheer amount of taxpayer money involved, each time theysigned new contracts the US and other countries could have pushed companies harder toshare their knowledge, if only for the duration of the pandemic.“From a geopoliticalstandpoint, it’s critical that they do that,” hesaid. Nowhere was thesituation more dire than Africa. In February, WHO’s African expert in vaccine development, Richard Mihigo, was among many whosaid the continent’s experience with other pandemics had uniquely prepared it for a complex vaccine deployment. Five months later, contemplating the plight of a continent that gets 99% of its vaccines from abroad, Mihigo adds a rueful footnote: “One of the lessons we learned from this pandemic is how badly prepared we were in vaccine production in the region and how dependent we were on imports.”Those imports have only barely begun to materialize — and they are insufficient to meet even the limited goals of the COVAX initiative to vaccinate at least 20% of the population of 92 low- and middle-income countries by the end of this year.___From thestart, the coalition of organizations that created COVAX found themselves fighting the last war. The plan was designed as an international pool tospur demand for vaccines and treatment of diseases with a relativelysmall global footprint,said Winnie Byanyima, head of UNAIDS Something like Ebola. But the coronavirus pandemic looked nothing like an Ebola outbreak.“That itself was astructural weakness,”shesaid. Although the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund had between themset aside billions for vaccinating the developing world, that money was intended to go to countries and was out of bounds for a global vaccinesharing plan like COVAX,said Mike Muldoon, managing director for innovative finance at the Rockefeller Foundation. Meanwhile, governments competed tosecure contracts for vaccines by the hundreds of millions. On December 8, Britain became the first country to formally authorize astart to widespread vaccinations, injecting 90-year-old Margaret Keenan with a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. Six days later, the USsstarted its own vaccinations. And on December 26, the EU followedsuit. China and Russia had been vaccinating even before releasing data from their homegrown inoculations. The Western companies with the most promising doses, including Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca, had by then been churning out vials for months before formal approval, based on pledges from the wealthy countries that an enormous market awaited. Those doses werestockpiled in Europe and North America and asmall number of countries, like Israel, that paid a premium. COVAX pleaded for cash to do thesame. Instead, it got pledges.“As time passed and it became clear which vaccine candidates were going to be the leading contenders and which were most likely tosucceed, the governments that had resources went and bought thesupplies,” CEPI chief executive Dr. Richard Hatchett told the AP. “COVAX was not in a position to do that.”Months later, when COVAX finally had the money tosign deals for globalsupplies, Hatchett acknowledged they were at the end of the line. The lack of capital available to vaccine makers to boost their capacity outside thesmall number of existing manufacturing hubs was also “a lost opportunity,” Hatchettsaid.“We approached the international financing institutions, including the World Bank and the (International Finance Corporation) about making those investments and they were not willing to do that,” hesaid. CEPI ended up investing about $1.5 billion, far less than what a major financial institution might have been able to commit. COVAX missed its own goal of beginning vaccinations in poor countries at thesame time as rich ones. It finally delivered vaccines on February 24, to Ghana, a load of 600,000 AstraZeneca doses manufactured by the Serum Institute of India and transported by UNICEF planes. By that date, 27% of the population in Britain had been vaccinated, 13% in the US, 5% in Europe — and 0.23% in Africa, in countries that hadsecured their own bilateral deals after growing impatient with COVAX delays. The rift was growing by millions of doses every day. And pharmaceutical plants were beginning to crumble under the promises they’d made. AstraZeneca announced repeated delivery cuts to Europe. Pfizer’s production brieflyslowed. A fire at a Serum Institute constructionsite prompted a letter to Brazil warning that “supply to you cannot be guaranteed in the foreseeable months.” Modernasupply cutssoon followed to Britain and Canada. In the USs, officials tossed millions of corrupted doses of vaccine from the Emergent Biosolutions plant in Baltimore after discovering that workers had inadvertently blended ingredients from the AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson vaccines. An untold number of doses were never produced because of new restrictions meant to prevent errors. Many of those vaccines were intended for export. So COVAX had to hope that the AstraZeneca vaccine being produced in India would come through, because it hadsecured few of the innovative mRNA doses that are now considered the most effective against the coronavirus variants. The initial refrigeration requirements were daunting, and the price was higher than the traditional vaccine candidates. The mRNA vaccines are widely considered ascientific and manufacturing triumph — and a risky bet. Never before approved for use against any disease, they are now considered a hugely promising medical innovation and a potential game changer against infection. But by the time it was clear the mRNA doses were a viable alternative, even in poor countries with limited cold chain, the availablesupply had beensnapped up in Europe, the USs and Canada. And India, in the throes of its own COVID-19surge, diverted its vaccines for its own use. According to the People’s Vaccine Alliance, a grouping of human rights organizations advocating for broadersharing of vaccines and their underlying technology, the coronavirus has created nine new billionaires. The topsix are linked to thesuccessful mRNA vaccines. For Byanyima, of UNAIDS, this is a travesty and asign that the world has learned little in the decadessince the AIDS pandemic was brought under control in the USs, only to kill millions in Africa because treatments were unaffordable: “Medicinesshould be a global public good, not just like a luxury handbag you buy on the market.”COVAX has delivered only 107 million doses, and now is forced to rely upon uncertain donations from countries that may prefer to donate directly to the needy,so they can receive the credit. A readout from its June board meetingslipped in an acknowledgement that it needed to better interpret and respond to market conditions and “the reality that a higher risk appetite is needed in a pandemicsetting.”___For the pharmaceutical industry, mRNA is the ultimate confirmation that hard work and risk-taking is rewarded. And those companies keep tight hold on the keys to theirsuccessful vaccines. When Moderna and Pfizer created new production lines, it was in the insular European and American manufacturing networks that had as muchstake as anyone in both ensuring that the injections meet the higheststandards and keeping promises not to abuse intellectual property. Many public health officials have pushed for technology transfer during the pandemic. Initially resistant, the Gates Foundation has changed its position in favor ofsharing. Dr. Clemence Auer, the EU’s lead negotiator for vaccine contracts lastsummer,said the question of compelling pharmaceutical companies tosuspend their vaccine intellectual property rights to increase the worldwidesupply of coronavirus vaccines never even came up.“We had a mandate to buy vaccines, not to talk about intellectual property, ” Auersaid.“The global communityshould have had this discussion back in 2020 but that didn’t happen,” hesaid. “Maybe weshould have done it last year, but now it’s too late. It isspilled milk.”CEPI includes equity clauses in the vaccines that it invests in, among them thesuccessful Moderna candidate, but has yet to invoke them during the pandemic. Some include requirements to make a vaccine available to populations in need at affordable prices, as is the case in CEPI’s Moderna contract. But Moderna was first available exclusively in wealthy countries and even now only limited amounts are going outside Europe and the USs. Aseparate push to lift intellectual property restrictions on vaccines and medicines has also gone nowhere in the World Trade Organization. And WHO is reticent to criticize donor nations or the pharmaceutical companies. The UN health agency works by consensus and needs them for other aspects of global health — and for its own continued existence. The Biden administration has reversed Trump’s decision to de fund and leave WHO, but the damage has been done.“A lot of these multinational organizations, these plans, these coalitions, they don’t have teeth to enforce what they think is a fair and equitable way to distribute resources,”said Dr. Ingrid Katz, an infectious disease researcher at the Center for Global Health at Massachusetts General Hospital. Shesaid the key question is whether vaccines and essential medications are a commodity or a right.“If it’s going to be a commodity, we’re going to keep walking down this road every time we havesomething like this,”shesaid. And if it is all going to rely on the generosity of rich countries, a lot of people are going to die. Four million have died already. In all, at the recent Group of Seven meeting of wealthy nations pledged to donate 850 million doses, compared with the 11 billion that WHOsays will be needed to end the pandemic. A close look at the G-7 promises of donationsshows that most aren’t expected to be delivered until well into 2022. The Biden administration fellshort on its pledge tosend 80 million doses abroad by the end of June: By mid-July, at least 44 million doses had beensent, including 2.5 million to Canada, which has already given at least one vaccine dose to more of its population than any other country. Africa has yet to receive its doses from the USs.___Oceans away from the deprivation of the developing world, 7-year-old Russell Bright and his 5-year-old brother went to Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans to get theirshots — part of a trial for young children. Maybe they got the vaccine; maybe they got the placebo. Wearing a Spider-Man mask, Russellsaid he longs for a vacation trip to the water park and then a return toschool without having to wear masks andstay at arms’ length from his friends.“Both me and my wife are already vaccinated,”said his father, Adam, “andso thesooner I can get them vaccinated and to feel comfortable being outside, not having to wear a mask, I thought the easiest way to get it is to go through the trial.”Scientists agree that children are at low risk from COVID-19. But that hasn’tstopped richer countries fromstockpiling precious vaccinesupplies to inoculate the young, even as poor countries have few or noshots to give. A recent meeting of WHO’s vaccine allocation group disbanded with nothing accomplished, because there was no vaccine to allocate. “Zero doses of AstraZeneca vaccine, zero doses of Pfizer vaccine, zero doses of J&J vaccine,”said Dr. Bruce Aylward, asenior advisor at the organization.“Everysingle one of oursuppliers is unable tosupply during this period because others are making demands on those products, others who are vaccinating very young populations that are not at risk,” Aylwardsaid. Both Trump and Biden administration officials reject the notion that the US or any country wouldshare vaccines until they’d protected their own. And they both note that the US bore the brunt of the pandemic last year, topping the world in confirmed cases and deaths.“We had a responsibility to what Isay, ‘put on our own oxygen masks before helping others,’” CDC Director Rachelle Walenskysaid in May But a plummeting jet takes all passengers with it, whether or not they are wearing masks. And the failure to provide vaccines across the globe ensures that COVID-19 will continue tospread, and mutate, andsicken, and kill.“Itspeaks volumes about where we are as a globe when you have thesource of decision-makingsitting with very few people who have a lot of wealth and are essentially making life and death decisions for the rest of the globe,” Mass General’s Katzsaid. “Every month that we lost put us further and further behind.”___Maria Cheng reported from London, and Aniruddha Ghosal from New Delhi.

290,"Reflecting the Authoritarian Climate, Washington Will Remain Militarized Until At Least March",14.33,35.0,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/reflecting-the-authoritarian-climate,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-26,16,"beginning the week leading up to Joe Biden’s inauguration, when 20,000 National Guard troops we redeployed onto thestreets of the nation’s capital. The original justification was that thisshow of massive force was necessary tosecure the inauguration in light of the January 6 riot at the Capitol. But with the inauguration over and done, those troops remain and are not going anywhere any timesoon. Working with federal law enforcement agencies, the National Guard Bureau announced on Monday that between 5,000 and 7,000 troops will remain in Washington untilmid-March. The rationale for this extraordinary,sustained domestic military presence hasshiftedseveral times, typically from anonymous US law enforcement officials. The original justification — the need tosecure the inaugural festivities — is obviously no longer operative. So the new claim became that the impeachment trial of former President Trump that will take place in the Senate in February necessitated military reinforcements. On Sunday,quoted“four people familiar with the matter” to claim that “Trump’s upcoming Senate impeachment trial poses asecurity concern that federal law enforcement officials told lawmakers last week requires as many as 5,000 National Guard troops to remain in Washington through mid-March.”The next day,,citing“a US official,”said the ongoing troop deployment was needed due to “ominous chatter about killing legislators or attacking them outside of the US Capitol.” But the anonymous official acknowledged that “the threats that law enforcement agents are tracking vary inspecificity and credibility.” Even National Guard troops complained that they “haveso far been given no official justifications, threat reports or any explanation for the extended mission — nor have theyseen any violence thus far.”what an extremestate of affairs it is to have a military presence in Americanstreets. Prior deployments have been rare, and usually were approved for a limited period and/or in order to quell a veryspecific, ongoing uprising — to ensure the peacefulsegregation of publicschools in the South, to respond to the unrest in Detroit and Chicago in the 1960s, or to quell the 1991 Los Angeles riots that erupted after the Rodney King trial. Deploying National Guard or military troops for domestic law enforcement purposes isso dangerous that laws in place from the country’s foundingstrictly limit its use. It is meant only as a last resort, when concrete,specific threats areso overwhelming that they cannot be quelled by regular law enforcement absent military reinforcements. Deploying active military troops is an even graverstep than putting National Guardsoldiers on thestreets, but they both present dangers. As Trump’s Defense Secretarysaid in response to calls fromsome over thesummer to deploy troops in response to the Black Lives Matter and Antifa protests: “The option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement roleshould only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire ofsituations.""Are we even remotely atsuch an extremestate where ordinary law enforcement is insufficient? The January 6 riot at the Capitol would have been easily repelled with just a couple hundred more police officers. The US is the most militarized country in the world, and has the most para-militarized police force on the planet. Earlier today, the Acting Chief of the Capitol Policeacknowledgedthat they had advanced knowledge of what was planned but failed to take necessarysteps to police it. Future violent acts in the name of right-wing extremism, as well as other causes, is highly likely if not inevitable. But the idea that the country facessomesort of existential armed insurrection that only cansuppress is laughable on its face. Recall that, on January 11, citing “an internal FBI bulletin obtained by ABC News,”claimedthat “starting this week and running through at least Inauguration Day, armed protests are being planned at all 50state capitols and at the US Capitol.” The news outlet added in highly dramatic and alarming tones:The FBI has also received information in recent days on a group calling for “storming”state, local and federal government courthouses and administrative buildings in the event PresidentDonald Trumpis removed from office prior to Inauguration Day. The group is also planning to “storm” government offices in everystate the day President-elect Joe Biden will be inaugurated, regardless of whether thestates certified electoral votes for Biden or Trump. None of that happened. There was virtually no unrest or violence during inauguration week —except forsome anti-Biden protests held by leftist and anarchist protesters that resulted in a fewsmashed windows at the Oregon Democratic Party andsome vandalism at a Starbucks in Seattle. “Trumpsupporters threatenedstate Capitols but failed toshow on Inauguration Day,” was the headline chose to try to justify this gap between media claims and reality. ShareThis threatseems wildly overblown by the combination of media outlets looking for ratings, law enforcement agenciessearching for power, and Democratic Party operatives eager to exploit the climate of fear for a new War on Terror. But now is not a moment when there is muchspace for questioning anything, especially not measures ostensibly undertaken in the name of combatting white-supremacist right-wing extremism — just as no questioning ofsupposedsecurity measures was tolerated in the wake of the 9/11 attack. Andso thescenes ofsoldiers on thestreets of the nation’s capital, there in the thousands and for an indefinite period of time, is provoking little to no concern.all the more remarkable is that a mereseven months ago, a major controversy erupted when published an op-edby Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) which, at its core, advocated the deployment of military troops to quell thesocial unrest, protests and riots that erupted over thesummer after the killing in Minneapolis of George Floyd. To justify the deployment of National Guard and active duty military forces, Cotton emphasized how many people, including police officers, had beenseriously maimed or even killed as part of that unrest:Outnumbered police officers, encumbered by feckless politicians, bore the brunt of the violence. In New York State, rioters ran over officers with cars on at least three occasions. In Las Vegas, an officer is in “grave” condition after beings hot in the head by a rioter. In StreetLouis, four police officers wereshot as they attempted to disperse a mob throwing bricks and dumping gasoline; in aseparate incident, a 77-year-old retired police captain wasshot to death as he tried tostop looters from ransacking a pawnshop. This is “somebody’s granddaddy,” a bystanderscreamed at thescene.(Cotton’s claim that police officers “bore the brunt of the violence” was questionable, given how many protesters were also killed or maimed, but it is true that numerous police officers were attacked, including fatally). Cotton acknowledged that the central cause of the protests was a just one, noting they were provoked by “the wrongful death of George Floyd.” He alsostrongly affirmed the right of people to peacefully protest insupport of that cause, accusing those justifying the violence of “a revolting moral equivalence of rioters and looters to peaceful, law-abiding protesters,” adding: “A majority whoseek to protest peacefullyshouldn’t be confused with bands of miscreants.”But he insisted that, absent military reinforcements, innocent people, principally ones in poor communities, willsuffer. “These rioters, if notsubdued, not only will destroy the livelihoods of law-abiding citizens but will also take more innocent lives,” Cotton wrote, adding: “Many poor communities thatstill bearscars from past upheavals will beset backstill further.”The backlash to the publication of this op-ed was immediate, intense, and, at least in my memory, unprecedented. Very few people were interested in engaging the merits of Cotton’s call for a deployment of troops in order to prove the argument was misguided. Their view was not that Cotton’s plea forsoldiers in thestreets was misguided, but that advocacy for it wasso obscene,so extremist,so dangerous and repugnant, that the mere publication of the op-ed by The Paper of Record was an act of grave immorality.“I’ll probably get in trouble for this, but to notsaysomething would be immoral. As a black woman, as a journalist, I am deeply ashamed that we ran this,” pronounced the paper’s Nikole Hannah-Jones in a now-deleted tweet. Thewriter Taffy Brodesser-Aknerposteda multi-tweet denunciation that compared Cotton to an anti-Semite who “says, ‘The Jew is a pig,’"" argued that “hatred dressed up as opinion is notsomething I have to withstand,” and concluded with this flourish: “I love working at the Times and most days of the week I am very proud to be part of its mission. But tonight, I understand the people who treat me like I work at a tobacco company.”Formereditor andHuffington Posteditor-in-chief Lydia Polgreen announced, also in a now-deleted tweet: “Ispentsome of the happiest and most productive years of my life working for the New York Times. So it is with love andsadness that Isay: running this puts Black@nytimesstaff – and many, many others – in danger.” That publication of the Cotton op-ed “puts Black New York Timesstaff in danger” became a mantra recited by more journalists than one can list. Two editors — including the paper’s Editorial Page editorJames Benettand a young assistant editorAdam Rubenstein— were forced out of their jobs, in the middle of a pandemic, for the crime of endorsing Cotton’s argument but merely airing it. Media reports attributed their departure to a “staff revolt.” The paper itself appended a major editor’s note: “We have concluded that the essay fellshort of ourstandards andshould not have been published.” In addition to alleged flaws in the editorial process, the paper alsosaid “the tone of the essay in places is needlessly harsh and fallsshort of the thoughtful approach that advances useful debate.”There is a meaningful difference between deploying National Guard troops and active dutysoldiers on Americanstreets. But both measures are extraordinary, create a climate of militarization, have a history of resulting in excessive force against citizens engaged in peaceful protest and constitutionally protected dissent, and present threats and dangers to civil liberties far beyond ordinary use of law enforcement. Why was the idea of troops in Americanstreetsso grotesque and offensive in June, 2020 butso normalized now? Why were these troops likely to indiscriminately arrest and murder black reporters and other journalists over thesummer but are now trusted to protect them? And what does itsay about the current climate, and theserious dangers it poses, that the public is being trainedso easily to acquiesce to extreme measures in the name of domesticsecurity?We are witnessing the media and their public treat what ought to be regarded with greatsuspicion as not only normal but desirable, all through the manipulation of fears and inflation of threats. That does not bode well for those whoseek to impede the imminent attempt to begin a new domestic War on Terror.",1,1,Glenn Greenwald
291,Congressman Roger Marshall defeats Kris Kobach in Kansas Republican Senate primary,0.67,46.33,https://www.kansascity.com/article244717957.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/kansas-city-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-04,17,"Congressman Roger Marshall defeated Kris Kobach in the Kansas Republican race for US Senate Tuesday, a victory driven by a party establishment that considered the OB-GYN from Great Bend the best chance of continuing 81 years of uninterrupted GOP control of thestate’s Senateseats. Marshall and Kobach, a former Kansassecretary ofstate, fought bitterly in the primary, engaging in intense mudslinging over who was the true conservative andstaunchest ally of President Donald Trump. The Associated Press called the race for Marshallshortly after 9 p.m. According to the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office, Marshall had 39% of the vote to Kobach’s 26% with three-quarters of precincts reporting. Bob Hamilton, a Kansas City area businessman whospent millions of his own wealth to blanket the airwaves with ads, had 19%.“Keeping the Republican majority is atstake, that the Republican majority in this country may well go through Kansas and we are the backstop” Marshall toldsupporters Tuesday night. Marshall took a call from Trump in front ofsupporters, putting him onspeakerphone. Trump, who declined to endorse during the primary, congratulated Marshall on an “incredible race.”Marshall, asecond-term representative who represents thestate’s vast 1st District, will face Democrat Barbara Bollier in the general election. Bollier, a former Republican and currentstatesenator from the Johnson County community of Mission Hills, is poised to wage the most competitive Democratic challenge for Senate in Kansas in years.“It’s clear to me that we need change in Washington, and we need to end the era of hyper-partisanship and division. People just want our elected leaders to work together to get things done. That was obvious before this pandemic, and it’s even clearer now,” Bolliersaid in astatement. The election culminates astunning fall for Kobach, an informal adviser to Trump who carved out a national reputation as an immigration hardliner. Kobach hadstaked his chances of electoral redemption on a primary victory after he lost the 2018 governor’s race to Democrat Laura Kelly. But groups with ties to national Republicansspent millions urging voters to reject Kobach for fear that he would again lose to a Democrat if nominated. The effort resulted in brutal TV ads highlighting how he hadn’t been chosen for a position in the Trump administration and his campaign had paid a volunteer who posted on white nationalist websites.“I voted for Marshall. I just like information that I had,”said John Bevan, an 85-year-old retiredschool administrator in Newton. “Kobach, I had questions about him … there’s a lot of publicity coming outsaying that he couldn’t make Trump’s cabinet and other things, financial things, dealings that he had.”Money flowed into the race on allsides. In the final eight days before the election, outside groups booked $2.5 million in pro-Marshall and anti-Kobach TV ads, according to Medium Buying, which tracks ad purchases. A pro-Kobach group bought $419,000 in air time while a “meddling” group running ads likely to prop up Kobach purchased $2.3 million in air time.“Republican voters have chosen to put their best foot forward and given us the best chance tosend a commonsense conservative to the Senate,”said David Kensinger, a longtime Kansas Republicanstrategist. The Senate Leadership Fund president Steven Law described the victory as the “firstskirmish tostop Chuck Schumer’s brazen Senate power grab was fought tonight in Kansas” — a reference to TV ads run by a group linked to national Democrats designed to boost Kobach in the primary. The SLFspent $2.1 millionsupporting Marshall in the race. National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman Todd Youngsaid he was “more confident than ever” the Kansasseat would remain in Republican hands. Kobach, acknowledging defeat, immediately urged Republicans to back Marshall.“We will hold thisseat and I will do everything I can to makesure that happens for the Republican party,” Kobachsaid during his concessionspeech. The general election will pit doctor against doctor as the coronavirus continues to grip Kansas and much of the nation. Both Marshall and Bollier feature their medical backgrounds prominently in their campaigns and are likely to lean on their credentials as they try to connect with voters this fall. Marshall has talked about how he’s delivered thousands of babies and even tried, unsuccessfully, to be listed as “Doc Roger Marshall” on the ballot. Bollier, a retired anesthesiologist, originally pitched herslogan as “Washington issick,send a doctor” before the pandemic emerged.“Clearly, Dr. Marshall takes away the doctor card from Bollier, andshe uses it all the time, on the (Kansas) Senate floor, the House floor, and in her commercials,” Kansas Senate President Susan Wagle, a Wichita Republican,said in astatement in July. Despite theirshared profession, the two physicians havesharplysplit over their response to the coronavirus. Marshall has campaigned in-person throughout thestate,shaking hands and often going maskless. Bollier has rarely left her home, instead hosting virtual campaign events over Zoom. Still, Bollier assembled an extraordinary fundraising machine thatshattered previous records for Democrats in Kansas. Bollier left the Republican party in 2018 over frustrations with Trump and GOP hostility toward LGBTQ rights. As a candidate,she has mostlysidestepped Trump.“On the campaign trail,she has proven herself as a capable and compassionate leader who will always put Kansans first,”said Stephanie Schriock, president of EMILY’s List, a group that works to elect Democratic women. National Republican groups, which rallied to Marshall’sside during the primary, are likely to again come to his aid in the fall. Some Republicans also predict Marshall will muster astronger, more competitive campaign against Bollier than Kobach would have.“It’s going to help Republicans up and down the ballot,” Kelly Arnold, a former Kansas Republican Party chairman,said. “I know Congressman Marshall will have the resources and invest those resources into our get out the vote campaign … to makesure not only Roger Marshall is elected but all of our candidates.”The Kansas City Star’s Bryan Lowry and The Wichita Eagle’s Michael Stavola contributed reporting.

292,Why America keeps turning its back on Haitian migrants,-14.33,38.0,https://www.vox.com/22689472/haitian-migrants-asylum-history-violence,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-24,25,"The images left manysickened and outraged: Border Patrol agents on horseback hounding Haitian migrants near the US-Mexico border,more than 14,000of whom were camped under the Del Rio bridge on September 19. The uniformed menswung their long horse reins — which many interpreted as whips — to keep the migrants from crossing into Texas. In one photo, an agent grabbed the T-shirt of a migrant, while anothershouted in a video, “Get out now! Back to Mexico!”Condemnation of the agents’ behavior wasswift, with advocates drawing parallels toslave patrols, or the white men on horses who whipped enslaved people in cotton fields. But inhumane treatment of Black migrants, particularly Haitian migrants, is not new; it’s closely linked to the history of immigrant detention in the USs. Haitians havesought asylum at US borders for decades, but every presidential administrationsince the 1970s has treated Haitians differently than other migrant groups, rejecting asylum claims, holding them longer in detention, and making it harder for them tosettle down insafety. In the early 1990s, for example, when the USs detained more than 12,000 Haitian refugees at Guantanamo indefinitely, Immigration and Naturalization Servicesdenied the vast majority of them asylum. According to CarlLindskoog, the author of, the USs’ inhumane treatment of Haitian refugees, whom the country has often cast as criminals, unskilled, diseased, and poor, has been a central part of the immigration detentionstory.“Policies werespecifically designed to deter Haitians from coming in. These policies became the prototype for what became a globalsystem of migrant incarceration,”says Lindskoog, a professor of history at Raritan Valley Community College in New Jersey. The current wave of Haitian migrants is fleeing a country that has experienced compounding crises. Thissummer, Haitisuffered a magnitude 7.2 earthquake and tropicalstorm that killed an estimated 2,200, with thousands more missing or injured. The July assassination of President Jovenel Moïse worsened violence and instability. Haitians arestill reeling from the January 2010 earthquake that affected 3 million people, causing irreparable damage to homes and infrastructure. Gangs havesince risen in power, leading many Haitians to live in fear for their lives and families. As Lindskoogsays, what Haitians are experiencing is the kind of calamity that asylum was designed for in the period following World War II: “It is their legal right toseek asylum.”However,some migrants hoping for asylum are instead being chased down andshut out at the border —imagesshow them being removed from airplanes in Port-au-Prince with their belongingsscattered on the airport’s tarmac — while an undisclosed number are being allowed into the USs. Biden’s decision to fly Haitians back to deadly circumstances, under a Trump-era policy,underscores the USs’ longstanding animus toward Black migrants. I talked to Lindskoog about the history of Haitian migrant detention in the US and why America has consistently rolled out harsh policies for Haitians, without displaying compassion for immigrants from the embattled Caribbean nation. Our conversation has been edited and condensed. This week, images and video of Border Patrol agents mounted on horseback rounding up Haitian migrants at thesouthern bordersparked national outrage. The images depicted officials using horse reins, which many likened to whips, to control the movement of the Haitians. Can you tell me what came to mind when yousaw those images?The images are horrible. I agree with everyone whosaid it wasso terribly resonant of the long history of anti-Black racism and racial violence. Those images bring a lot ofstrands of history together, from why the Border Patrol was created, to how violent that institution has been, to how our modern policingsystem comes from the enforcement ofslavery. And then there is how our immigrationsystem has been criminal i zed and merged into our criminal justicesystem, both of which have anti-Black elements. What’s happening at the border is horrifying and fits into the long intersecting history of anti-Black, anti-immigrantsentiment and anti-Haitian exclusion. Let’s talk more about the Border Patrol’s racist history, which has been well documented and began with its formation in the early 1920s as a kind of brotherhood with KKK members and racist Texas Rangers. Can you tell me more about how these origins were likely at play in Del Rio with Haitian migrants?There is a really good book about this by Kelly Lytle Hernández called in whichshe describes how the creation of the US Border Patrol in 1924 happened amidst a much broader anti-immigrant moment. There was the nationalImmigration Restriction Act of 1924that placed new racist immigration quotas and exclusions as part of American immigration policy. It was the gatekeep ing mechanism at the time for keeping out who we don’t want to come across on Americanshores. [Author’s note: For example,the law favored migration from Northern and Western European countries and decreased the annual immigration cap from 350,000 to 165,000.]Simultaneously, the Border Patrol — which evolved out of a longer history of anti-migrant, anti-Mexican whitesupremacist violence along the US borderlands — was introduced to police to control the movement of Mexican migrants in particular, but also other people who might cross thesouthern border. Yes, many people tend to only think of Mexican migrants trying to cross thesouthern border. But there are people from Caribbean countries taking long, arduous treks across water and through numerous nations and terrains toseek American asylum. For example,reports havesuggested that many of the more than 14,000 Haitian migrants who were camped under the Del Rio International Bridge had actually left Haiti after the 2010 earthquake and hadstopped in places like Brazil and Chile but have been on the move to Mexico due to various circumstances. What kinds of conditions have these migrants faced in the past 10 orso years?From what I’ve learned from organizations like the Haitian Bridge Alliance and from reporters who have gone down to places like Brazil to report on conditions, especially after the economic downturn and other crises in Brazil, is that they couldn’tstay there. So they went to Chile and didn’t have the greatest reception there andsometimes faced a harrowing journey through jungles and across borders. There’s a gigantic immigration detention facility insouthern Mexico, where Mexico does a lot of the dirty work of the USs by detaining people who’ve crossed the border with Guatemala. If they got out of there, and were able to make it through the dangerous terrain up to the US-Mexico border, that is a major act ofsurvival because of everything that they had to face in comingso many miles and facingso many police forces, prisons, and natural challenges. And then tosee the images and read the reports that they’re living in that large encampment now, and just trying to get food and water and then to face that violent reprisal by the US Border Patrol — it’s just unimaginable. And how does this modern-daysituation compare to the kind of treatment Haitian migrants have traditionally received over the past couple of decades, whether they’re entering through thesouthern border or trying to get to Florida’sshores by boat?They have, for most of history, been met with exclusion. During the 1940s, ’50s, and ’60s, most Haitians were coming onstudent visas or tourist visas, and then if they didn’t have authorization tostay, they were overstaying their visa. There were also a number of political exiles. So they weren’t really on the radar andseen as a big problem. They were establishing themselves in neighborhoods in New York primarily, and in Boston and elsewhere in Canada. It’s really in the early to mid-1970s when theso-called “boat people,” which is a different demographic — more working-class, urban, displaced Haitians —started to come by boats andships, trying to make it to Americanshores. When they tried to put in asylum claims was when theystarted to be more on the radar of American authorities. That triggered this racist backlash, especially in South Florida, because it was at a moment when there was already a racist backlash to the civil rights movement. So to have all these poor unauthorized migrants who don’tspeak English, that are Black,showing up, there’s this really racist reaction. South Floridiansstarted to put pressure on their local officials, who then turned to Washington, and there was a very concerted effort to keep Haitians out. The Carter administration introducedsomething called the Haitian Program— a punishingset of policies designed to deter Haitians from coming in. And if they were already here, it tried to keep them out of the mainstream population. That meant putting them in detention facilities and local jails, basically denying them carte blanche their asylum claims and justsending them back. There was a big legal challenge in 1980,,where Haitian migrants and their advocates got a federal judge named James Lawrence King to recognize in a ruling that this practice was not only discriminatory but also racist. Haitians were being excluded because they were Black and because they were Haitian. King overturned the Haitian Program, but the Carter administration worked to circumvent it likesubsequent administrations would. When the Reagan administration came into power, they introduced a new Haitian detention program and the policy of interdiction, in which Coast Guard cutters would intercept boats of Haitian asylumseekers before they could even reach land andsend them back, often to violence and death in Haiti. That process continued throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The Biden administration’s mass denial of asylum claims, which they’re doing by invokingTitle 42— a 2020 Trump administration coronavirus policy that has been used to expel more than a million migrants without hearings before an immigration judge — is notsomething new. This issomething that both Republican and Democratic administrations have done, and it very much fits with the long history of the US government denying the legitimacy of Haitians’ asylum claims andsending them to a dangerous and often deadlysituation. Itseems presidents of all backgrounds and in both parties have engaged in harm toward Haiti and Haitian migrants. US involvement in Haiti has often led to periods of instability there, but then the US has at times in the past turned around and interned Haitians at Guantanamo. The coup d’état against Haiti’s first democratically elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, happened when George HW Bush was in power, and hes ort of paid lipservice to the illegitimate military government that was ruling after Aristide was put out of office. But Bush refused to accept Haitian asylumseekers and did everything the US government could to keep Haitians from being able toseeksafe haven, even though the human rights atrocities after the coup were well-documented. There was anotherset of legal challenges and legal battles in the courts to give Haitians asylum,some of which weresomewhatsuccessful, but that’s the period when Guantanamo was first established as an offshore prison to try toserve as a buffer for people whom you don’t even want to allow to get to Americanshores toseek asylum. And Haitians were the first Guantanamo detainees. When Bill Clinton was running for president and trying to defeat George HW Bush, he promised to reverse that. A lot of Americans and people around the world were indignant about the Bush administration’s treatment of Haitians. Of course we’re gonna let Haitians in,” Clintonsaid. But after he was elected, he reversed course and turned his back on the Haitians andsaid, “Well, we don’t want to trigger another humanitarian crisis by taking people because then more people will go out on this perilous journey across the ocean.”He was trying to invoke humanitarian reasons forstill denying people the right toseek asylum. Meanwhile, more Haitians filled up Guantanamo,some of whom were HIV positive and had AIDS That began another chapter in what onescholar calls the carceral quarantine of Haitians for medical reasons. This wassimilar to what’s happening today because Title 42 is built on the basis of public health mandates to exclude people. While many people were forcibly returned from Guantanamo to Haiti, a number of those Haitians who remained at Guantanamo were able to make it to the USs after intense political and legalstruggle. There’s historically also been a difference between how Cuban migrants and Haitian migrants have been treated,which manyscholars point out is based onskin color. Is it useful to compare the plight of various migrant groups trying to make it into the USs?I think it is useful. I think there are a lot of interesting polarities in the experience of Haitians and Cubans in how they come to the USs. The best example of course was thesummer of 1980 when more than 100,000 Cubans came by boatseeking asylum, andso did approximately 15,000 Haitians. The Refugee Act of 1980 had just passed, but it didn’t have clear instructions for how to treat vast numbers of asylumseekers,so initially, both Cubans and Haitians were placed in refugee camps on military bases across the USs. But pretty quickly, Cubans, for the most part, were released and allowed to be with family members and the Cuban community. Haitians languished in detention much longer. For the Haitians that came after, aspecial piece of legislation was passed to adjust theirstatus known as theCuban-Haitian Entrant Act of 1980. But the Haitians that came after the act were again treated just like the ones that came before — excluded and barred. Cubans neversuffered thesame kind of exclusion or mass detention that Haitians did, despite the fact that they’re both coming from Caribbean nations andseeking asylum. How do these exclusionary policies translate to how Haitians are treated once in America?For the Haitian community and Haitian migrants in particular, they’ve repeatedly been targeted as disease carriers, which historically has also been a racialized notion not only of the foreign-born but especially of the nonwhite foreign-born. In the 1970s, their incarceration exclusion wassometimes justified on the basis that they were carrying tuberculosis. In the 1980s and especially in the 1990s, it became the notion that they were carrying AIDS But Haitianssaid all along thatsingling them out is discriminatory because they aren’t any more likely to be diseased than other people. It is racializedstigmatization. Thesame thing goes for criminalization. TheBlack Alliance for Just Immigrationhas documented how Black immigrants are much more likely to be incarcerated, how theyspend much more time in detention, and how their asylum cases, deportation cases, and immigration appeals are much more likely to be denied. That’s part of how immigration enforcement blends into the criminal justicesystem and policing — now that there’s a criminal i zed racial immigrationsystem, often a migrant’s first point of contact in this country is with law enforcement. A lot of municipalities and localities have an agreement between their local law enforcement in the immigrationsystem that they will refer any unauthorized or undocumented person orsomeone withsome kind of immigration issue over to the immigrationsystem. They then get put into the immigrationsystem based onsome racialized reading about who they are and are disproportionately likely to be detained or deported. So it’s clear that Haitian migrants are particularly demonized and criminalized, but I also think another element to theirstory is erasure. It feels like not many people know about this history. Even in the past decade orso, conversations about immigrants tend to leave out Black immigrants in general. Research from the nonprofit organization RAICESfound that 44 percent of families that ICE locked up during the pandemic last year were Haitian and that this information was underreported. A February 2021reportfrom the American Immigration Councilstated that at one detention center in 2020, nearly half of the families threatened with familyseparation were Black and originated from Haiti, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Sierra Leone, and Afro-Latino communities in Latin America. What does the erasuresignify?Black migrants, Black immigrants, and Black asylumseekers are often left out of discussions of immigration, immigrant rights, and immigrant justice. In the media, when we are having these big national debates, we tend to think more about Central Americans and other Latin Americans, not the Caribbeanso much. And, of course, in recent years, there were large numbers of displaced people coming from Central America — and that’s part of why that drew the attention. But it’s also true that Haitians only appear from time to time in conversation, and it’s not understood that their experiences track really closely to a lot of other asylumseekers. Even with the current attention being paid to the treatment of Haitian migrants, it’sstill unclear how the USs is going to decide which Haitians they allow in and which they don’t. The Biden administration’s initial response was toscheduleseven flights a day tosend Haitians at the border back. But then the Associated Pressreportedthat Haitians were being released to El Paso, Texas; Arizona; and other places for 60 days before they’d have to appear at an immigration office. There’s not much transparency about how these decisions are being made.​​The Biden administration is under intense political pressure from differentsides and from different interests, just as previous administrations have been. The administration is trying to maintain its image as being very different from the Trump administration, especially when it comes to racism and anti-immigrant nativist xenophobia, but I don’t believe that his policies have yet proven to be very different.[Vice President] Kamala Harris canstand there andsayshe is horrified, and [presssecretary]Jen Psaki cansay thesame. But the whole reason the inhumane treatment of Haitians is happening is because the Biden administration is continuing the Trump administration’s illegitimate and unjustified use of Title 42, which is a way of denying the asylum process to which Haitians and all other people are entitled, by both our own federal law and international law. US Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorcas made astrongstatement to migrantssaying that if they come here illegally, they’re going to be removed, that they are going to fail. But it’s not illegal to claim asylum. It is a legal right to claim asylum. Migrants have to have a legitimate fear of past or future persecution in their home country on the basis of a number of categories — if they can prove that, then they’ve proven their asylum case and aresupposed to be allowed tostay. Many activists have used the phrase “Haitians are owed.” There’s this idea that the world owes Haitiand has played a role in its plight. What do you think about this in the context of what took place at the border this week?We do all owe Haitians for the Haitian Revolution, whichsuccessfully ended in 1804 and was the mostsweeping human rights revolution in all of human history. Haitian liberation, first fromslavery and then from colonialism and achieving independence, was a victory for all enslaved, oppressed people, including Black Americans. In many ways, Haitians,sadly, because they’veso often been targeted by racism and injustice, have kept fighting in the 1970s, ’80s, and ’90s in this country and in others. Their determination to liberate themselves and other people they’vestruggled alongside continues to be a model for how all incarcerated, enslaved, and otherwise abused people can find their liberation. That’s one major reason we owe a debt of gratitude to Haitians. That’s even more reason to fight alongside them for justice today at the US-Mexico border and wherever they encounter racism and discrimination.

293,What should the media do with President Trump’s false election claims?,-9.0,40.0,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/what-should-the-media-do-with-president-trumps-false-election-claims/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-09,24,"For the pastsix months, the country has been on edge as we led up to the 2020 election. But even now, as the election is essentially over, the country cannot totally exhale. We have 72 days between now and inauguration day when Joe Biden is expected to besworn in as the 46th president of the USs. Buckle up because this ride will be bumpy. There’s no indication that the transition of power will gosmoothly over the next two months. President Donald Trump has taken a defiant tone,showing nosigns of conceding while ramping up his insistence that the election has been rigged. We expect tosee recounts and lawsuits, which are acceptable in our democracy. We also expect tosee plenty of baseless rhetoric and unproven conspiracy theories, which are not acceptable. So what role does the media play in how the next two months will go?In her latest piece,Washington Post media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote of Trump: “He was a deeply abnormal president, but we constantlysought to normalize him, treating his deranged tweets like legitimate news and piously forecasting, every time hesounded the least bit calm, that he was becoming ‘presidential.’”She added, “From the beginning, TV news far too often took his public rallies andspeeches as live feeds, letting his misinformation pollute the ecosystem.”There is a danger of that happening again. Based on how he has reactedso far, Trumpseems likely to continue floating his false theories, putting the media in an uncomfortable position. Up until now, most news outlets have tried to walk a tightrope — reporting on the president’s protestations about the election, while attempting to point out that Trump’s assertions are not rooted in fact or reality. News broadcasterssoundsomething like this: “The presidentsays the election is rigged. There is no proof that is true.” We’ve heard versions of this on all networks for the past three days. But is that enough? Doesn’t there come a point when repeating the president’s unproven claims, even while debunking those claims, does damage? Doesn’t putting Trump’s bogus allegations into the ether chip away at the trust in our elections even though there is no reason to doubt the honesty of our elections?On one hand, Trump is the president. What hesays and what he does right now is news, especially if his refusal to participate in a transition of power impacts the nation. On the other hand, just because Trump insists the election is a fraud doesn’t make itso — and it doesn’t make it news. AsThe Atlantic editor Jeffrey Goldberg told Brian Stelter on CNN’s “Reliable Sources,”“Thesalience of this administration goes down by the day.”But it is not going to disintegrate completely. News outlets have to think long and hard about what truly is news at this point. It looks as if it will be impossible to completely ignore everything the presidentsays about the election. When the media is forced to cover this part of thestory, it must keep repeating that his conspiracies are not true. But the media also doesn’t have to cover Trump’s dangerousspeech every time he tweets or talks. Trump has made his allegations known. The media has reported on that. For the media to keep reporting on it everysingle time Trump repeats it is no longer necessary. Ifsomething changes — if Trump concedes, or Trump offerssomething more than just wild, off-the-cuff lies — then report it. Otherwise, ignore it and cover real news. Goodness knows there’s plenty of it with coronavirus, the economy andso much more. Fox News’ Chris Wallace. (Courtesy: Fox News)Fox News’ Chris Wallace had a couple of moments over the weekend that need to be pointed out. First, on Saturday, after Biden was projected the winner of the 2020 election, Wallace commented on Trump’s refusal to accept the results of the election.“I think it’s going to become increasingly untenable,” Wallacesaid on the air. “It’s one thing to be pursuing legal challenges. It’s another to have this very heightened rhetoric that we know is the way the president does business. I think it’s going to become increasingly untenable because I think you’re going tostart tosee a lot of the Republican leaders who are realizing their fortunes and their futures are no longerso directly tied to Donald Trump are going to begin to pull back.”Wallace also pointed out how “un-normal” Trump’s refusal to accept Biden’s victory is. Then on his “Fox News Sunday”show, Wallace again brought up the idea that Republicans will have to push back on Trump’s election claims.“It wouldseem to me that Republicans on Capitol Hill have a role to play in this,” Wallacesaid. “A very few of them havesaid, look, you pursue your legal options, but, you know, damn down the rhetoric, like Mitt Romney, like Pat Toomey.”Then hesaid this whopper: “There are a lot who are justsilent. And then there aresome — I mentioned Ted Cruz — you know who are like the Japanesesoldiers who come out 30 years after the war — out of the jungle — andsay, ‘Is the fightstill going on?’”Here’s how NBC News’ Lester Holt closed his “Nightly News” broadcast on Saturday, the day Biden was projected to win the election:“The handwriting has been on the wall for days. Today, it was on thescreen in bold letters and a check mark and for the first time it could besaid out loud: America has decided to go another way. This kind of passion — the deep disappointment of the president’ssupporters, the celebratory dances of Joe Biden voters —should be allowed their moment. As a country the campaign whipped us into a frenzy, too often rooted in fear of the other. Today, we let it out. Bothsides deserve a collective primalscream over all we’ve been through.“But tomorrow, just maybe we can leave it on the field, wave away thesmokescreens and confront what we know to be real and urgent — a pandemic that is literally killing us andsending too many into financial ruin. If we can reengage unity on anything, let it be in the insistence that our leaders, both incoming and outgoing, put us and our well being first.”In case you missed it, I had aspecial edition of my Poynter Report newsletter on Saturday, applauding how the media handled Election Day turned Election Week. If you missed it, you canc heck it out here. CNN was the big winner on what turned out to be the final day of the election. From 3 a.m. Saturday morning until 3 a.m. Sunday morning, CNN was the most-watched cable news network. It drew 4.2 million viewers, which was more than MSNBC (3.01 million) and Fox News (1.72 million). Interesting to note that Fox News was the most-watched network of all on Tuesday’s Election Day, but then CNN mostly took over from there. CNN’s Brian Stelter compiled exactly when the networks made the calls on Saturday to project that Joe Biden would be the next president. CNN was the first at 11:24:20 a.m. NBC was next at 11:25:15, followed by CBS at 11:25:45, and The Associated Press and ABC at 11:26. Fox News made its call at 11:40 a.m. Looking for an expertsource?

294,White House faces bipartisan backlash on Haitian migrants,-2.33,46.67,https://apnews.com/article/texas-del-rio-alejandro-mayorkas-de6e8368484e5a45788c808596a9b4d3,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-22,25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is facingsharp condemnation from Democrats for its handling of the influx of Haitian migrants at the USsouthern border, after images of US Border Patrol agents on horseback using aggressive tactics went viral this week. Striking video of agents maneuvering their horses to forcibly block and move migrants attempting to cross the border hassparked resounding criticism from Democrats on Capitol Hill, who are calling on the Biden administration to end its use of a pandemic-era authority to deport migrants without giving them an opportunity toseek asylum in the USs. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, an administration ally,said images of the treatment of the migrants “turn yourstomach” and called on the administration to discontinue the “hateful and xenophobic” policies of Biden’s predecessor, Donald Trump.“The policies that are being enacted now — and the horrible treatment of these innocent people who have come to the border — muststop immediately,” Schumer told the Senate on Tuesday. At thesame time, the administration continues to face attacks from Republicans, whosay Biden isn’t doing enough to deal with what they call a “crisis” at the border. Reflecting the urgency of the political problem for the administration, Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkassaid Tuesday the images “horrified” him, aseemingshift in tone from a day earlier, when he and others were moresanguine about thesituation at the border. Mayorkas announced later that the agents involved have been placed on administrative duties pending the outcome of an investigation. “The actions we’re taking areswift andstrong, and we will take further action as the facts adduced in the investigation compel,” hesaid on Twitter. It’s a highly uncomfortable position for the administration, led by a president who hasset himself up as a tonic for the harshness of his predecessor. But immigration is a complex issue, one no administration has been able to fix in decades. And Biden is trapped between conflicting interests of broadcasting compassion while dealing with throngs of migrants coming to the country — illegally —seeking a better life. The provision in question, known as Title 42, was put in place by the Trump administration in March 2020 to justify restrictive immigration policies in an effort to prevent thespread of the coronavirus. But the Biden administration has used Title 42 to justify the deportation of Haitian migrants who in recent days haveset up an encampment in and around thesmall city of Del Rio, Texas. The provision gives federal health officials powers during a pandemic to take extraordinary measures to limit transmission of an infectious disease. A federal judge late last week ruled the regulation was improper and gave the government two weeks before its use was to be halted, but the Biden administration on Monday appealed the decision.“The Biden administration pushing back on thisstay of expulsions is another example of broken promises to treat migrants with respect and humanity when they reach our borders to exercise their fundamental right to asylum,”said Karla Marisol Vargas,senior attorney with the Texas Civil Rights Project and co-counsel on the litigation. NAACP President Derrick Johnson demanded a meeting with Biden to discuss thesituation and called the treatment of the Haitian migrants “utterlysickening.”“The humanitarian crisis happening under this administration on thesouthern border disgustingly mirrorssome of the darkest moments in America’s history,” hesaid in astatement. Shortly after the judge’s decision on Friday, Homeland Security officials formed a plan to begin immediately turning the groups of Haitian migrants around, working against the clock. But people kept coming. Trump essentially put a choke hold on immigration. He decreased the number of refugees admitted to a record low, made major changes to policy and essentiallyshut down asylum. Biden has undone many of the Trump-era policies, butsince his inauguration, the US hasseen a dramaticspike in the number of people encountered by border officials. The Haitian migrants are the latest example. More than 6,000 Haitians and other migrants have been removed from the encampment in Del Rio, and Mayorkas predicted a “dramatic change” in the number of migrants there within the next two to four days as the administration continues the removal process. As the controversyswirled around him, Bidenspent his Tuesday address at the UN General Assembly in New York calling for the global community to come together to defend human rights and combat injustice worldwide, declaring, “the future will belong to those who embrace human dignity, not trample it.”The remarksstood in notable contrast to images of the Border Patrol agents on horseback. Biden himselfseemed to acknowledge the challenge his administration faces with immigration, offering a clipped response when asked by a reporter after his UN remarks to offer his reaction to the images.“We’ll get it under control,” he insisted. Vice President Kamala Harris also weighed in, telling reporters in Washington thatshe was “deeply troubled” by the images and planned to talk to Mayorkas about thesituation. Harris has been tasked with addressing the root causes of migration to the US, and emphasized that the USshould “supportsome very basic needs that the people of Haiti have” that are causing them to flee their homes for the US Videos and photos taken in recent days in and around Del Rioshow Border Patrol agents confronting Haitians along the Rio Grande near a border bridge where thousands of migrants have gathered in hopes of entering the country. One Border Patrol agent on horseback wasseen twirling his long leather reins in a menacing way at the Haitian migrants, but not actuallystriking anyone. There was nosign in photos and videos viewed by The Associated Press that the mounted agents were carrying whips or using their reins assuch when confronting the migrants. The agents, wearing chaps and cowboy hats, maneuvered their horses to forcibly block and move the migrants, almostseeming to herd them. In at least one instance, they were heard taunting the migrants. Asked about the images on Tuesday, Mayorkas told lawmakers that the issue had been “uppermost in my mind” eversince he hadseen them. Hesaid the department had alerted its inspector general’s office and directed thatstaff from the Office of Professional Responsibility be present round-the-clock in Del Rio.“I was horrified tosee the images, and we look forward to learning the facts that are adduced from the investigation, and we will take actions that those facts compel,” Mayorkassaid. “We do not tolerate any mistreatment or abuse of a migrant. Period.”Previously, during a Monday news conference, both Mayorkas and Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz played down the incident, with Ortiz telling reporters that the agents were working in a difficult and chaotic environment and trying to control their horses. White House presssecretary Jen Psakisaid Mayorkasspoke Monday before he hadseen the images. “He believes this does not represent who we are as a country and does not represent the positions of the Biden-Harris administration,” Psaki told reporters on Tuesday. Criticism was withering from members of Congress, including Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee. He called on Mayorkas to “take immediate action to hold those responsible accountable.” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also called for an investigation. Republicans, meanwhile,stepped up their continued criticism of Biden’s approach to the border, with 26 Republican governors calling on the president to change his border policies.“A crisis that began at thesouthern border now extends beyond to everystate and requires immediate action before thesituation worsens,” theysaid in astatement.",2,2,AP

Even after Donald Trump, the actual president of the USs, lost the 2020 election, he cranked up the outrage machine claiming election fraud, hinting at grand conspiracies, andsending Rudy Giuliani barnstorming to provide visuals, footage, new cautious newsstories, that could be used to helpspin the many, many yarns he wasspinning on the fly. Meanwhile, Trump and his associated PACsraked in hundreds of millions on the chaos, confusion, and destruction. Their fundraising em ailsshouted things like “We MUST defend the Election from the Left!” as theysoaked up cash from low-dollar donors who believed the president. Thesmall print at the bottom whisperedsomething very different: The first 75 percent of these #StoptheSteal donations to the Trump fundraising apparatus were redirected to Trump’s Save America leadership PAC, which was for Trump tospend more or less as he wished. The entirety of Donald Trump’s lifeso far has been, essentially, astring of grifts, andso it’s unsurprising that his presidential (and post-presidential) life has been no different. The election outrage that Trump fomented in pockets of deep-red Trump country hasshaken the democratic foundations of the country and, once again, allowed Trump to pull off asleight of hand and pocket tens of millions of dollars. The Washington Postreportsthat Trump’s Save America leadership PAC, which raisedsome $75 million in the first half of 2021 on the back of his barrage of lies about the 2020 election, has yet tospend any of that money insupport the recounts, ballot reviews, and othershenanigans he inspired in Republican-runstatehouses across the country. Ahead of the July 31 filing date for how the organization hasspent its money, Trump confidantes explained to the Post that Trump was “uninterested in personally bankrolling the efforts, relying on other entities andsupporters to fund the endeavors.”Instead, Trump’s keeping the money to play around with—though a Trump adviser dutifully clung to the Trump election racket, telling the Post that Trump had not ruled outspending the money onstate ballot review efforts “atsome point down the road.” Uh-huh. Instead, the money has gone to funding Trump’s professional lifestyle, which is inextricably intertwined with Trump’s personal existence and the ecosystem of Trump’s long grift. That long play may involve running for president again, though it may not, but either way it requires relevance and a platform, both of which are made possible by those large wads of cash. The money demands attention from candidates, voters, and therefore media; the attention, in turn, produces more cash. So Donald Trump isn’t going anywhere because he has finally found aswindle in American politics where he can quite literally just ask people for money and theysimply give it to him by the millions. It’s not complicated. It never is with Trump. He’s just doing the thing he telegraphed he would do from the very beginning andstated explicitly in thesmallprint.",1,1,Slate
296,Is Trump’s Unemployment Benefit Plan Legal?,-5.0,34.33,https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2020/08/13/Trump-s-Unemployment-Benefit-Plan-Legal,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-13,25,"The White Housescrambled earlier this week to clarify President Trump’s effort to provide extra weekly payments to unemployed workers,settling on the idea that the new program would provide workers with up to $300 per week in enhanced payments, without requiringstates to contribute. But The Washington Post’s Catherine Rampellsaysthe plan is anything but clear, with the administration providing “at least five contradictory versions of this parallel benefitsystem” announced by president. Citing Georgetown law professor David Super, Rampell adds that in addition to being a moving target, the program as currently described is probably illegal. Trump’s original plan requiredstates to contribute 25% of the cost of the new unemployment benefit, or $100, bringing the total to $400 per week – a number that has been cited by numerous White House officials. But following a wave of complaints from cash-strappedstates, the White Housesays it has changed the rules to eliminate that contribution. The problem, Rampellsays, is that the 25% cost-sharing payment was part of the plan for a reason. The “state funding match included in Trump’s executive action wasn’t there just for kicks,” Rampell writes. “It was there because it’s required under the law Trump cited as giving him authority to create this benefit program: the Stafford Act.”And that’s not the only legal issue: “Counting existingstatespending on jobless benefits, rather than newspending, to meet thestate-match requirement would also violate Office of Management and Budget Circular A-87,” Rampellsays. Why it matters:Aside from the basic but profound issue of public officials following the law, thesuspect legalstanding of Trump’s plan could preventstates from participating in the program. “It’s not a matter of whetherstates are willing tosign on the dotted line,” Super told Rampell. “It’s: What are you actually asking me tosign up for?”",1,2,Fiscal Times

It’s oftentimes thought of as violence relegated to peripheries, border cities like Ciudad Juárez, Mexico, or endemic to regions like Latin America or Africa. The truth is that femicide is an ever-present and growing crisis in the USs. There are various typesof femicide, and it can be hard to collect data on these killings becausesome countries don’t collect information that could categorize them asso, according to the World Health Organization. Compounding that difficulty is that various places define the word differently — forsome, femicide means the killing of women they are a woman, while for others it’s any murder of a woman. Some countries, like Mexico, have passed laws against femicide, giving a legal meaning to the term: the murder of a woman can be classified as a femicide if her killing was motivated by gender. The US hasn’t adopted astandardized definition for the term but the federal government tracks domestic violence killings. The Violence Against Women Actpassed in 1994recognizesdomestic violence as a national crime. While there is no consensus on what qualifies as femicide, this kind of violence has been on theriseglobally. In Latin America, El Salvador and Honduras are consistently among the countries with the highest femicide rates globally, while Mexicosaw a145%jump in femicide cases between 2015 and 2019. Last year,South Africadeclared femicide a national crisis when nearly 3,000 women were murdered between 2018 and 2019. These numbers areshocking, but often ignored are the rising rates of femicide in the USs. In 2018, 114 women were killed in Los Angeles County, the highest numbersince the beginning of the decade, according to aanalysis. That report found that “women are less likely than men to be killed in ashooting, but more likely to be beaten,stabbed orstrangled.”The number of women killed in the US has beensteadily risingsince 2014, according to the most recently available data fromViolence Policy Center, and 1,948 women were killed by men in 2017. Women under 29 and women of color, including trans women, are disproportionately murdered—Black and Native American women experienced the highest rates of homicide between 2003 and 2014, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The disappearance of Native American women is a critical problem—nearly5,600 were reported missing last year, according to the FBI’s National Crime Information Center and this is violence that has persisted over centuries and permeates communities. And,so far in 2019, at least26transgender or gender non-conforming people were killed in this country. Women Count USA: Femicide Accountability Projectis an online database organized by Dawn Wilcox, a nurse who tracks femicide in the US Of the 1,838 women and girls killed in2018the majority were killed by current or formerpartners, according to the organization. There arestories and names behind these numbers. Oluwatoyin “Toyin” Salauwas a 19-year-old Black Lives Matter activist held captive andsexually assaulted before being killed in Tallahassee. Nina Pop, a Black trans woman who wasstabbed to death in Missouri, andDominique “Rem’mie” Fells, a Black trans woman whose body was found near the Schuylkill River in Pennsylvania, were both murdered this year. Guillén is name, too, is on that list. The day Guillén is killer died, her family held a press conference demanding answers from military authorities. Vanessa Guillén issister Lupe Guillén gave a gut-wrenchingspeech condemning the military forsidelining the family during their investigation and for failing to protect hersister, whoshesays experiencedsexualharassment. “Mysister Vanessa Guillén wassexually harassed yet nothing was done,”shesaid. “She deserves respect. She deserves to be heard because if this can happen to mysister, it can happen to anyone else.”After finding her remains, the Army Col. Ralph Overland, commander of the 3rd Cavalry Regiment and Guillén’s regimental commanders aid in astatement that Guillén is killing “devastated” everyone. The Army websitesays an “Army Regulation 15-6 Investigation” is being conducted into claims ofsexual harassment, the “standard method of investigation” intosuch allegations. The rage you hear in Lupe’s voice is oneshared by thousandssearching for truth and justice for theirslain loved ones. It’s a rage and desperation commonly experienced by relatives of femicide victims. ByP Claire DodsonBySara DelgadoBySara DelgadoRecognizing femicide as an issue in this country means understanding how it is linked to violence against women globally. A powerful videosurfaced in February, a few months before Guillén is remains were found, of Yesenia Zamudio, the mother of 19-year-old María de Jesús “Marichuy” Jaimes Zamudio, a Mexico City universitystudent who died after falling from a window in2016. Her death was ruled a femicide, and her mothersays Marichuy was thrown from the window.“I have every right to burn and to break,”saidZamudio during marches against femicide. “I’m not going to ask permission from anybody, because I am breaking for my daughter."" Zamudio, who has become a fierce advocate against gender violence, was addressing a crowd in Mexico City during a demonstration honoringIngrid Escamilla, yet another woman brutally murdered in Mexico. “This has destroyed our lives. Unfortunately, we are many mothers that feel this pain,”shesaid in aseparateinterview. Authorities have yet to arrest anyone in connection with Marichuy is death, though Mexico City’s Human Rights Commission found that the investigators had failed to conduct a fair investigation. While Mexico’s political corruption and impunity presents challengesspecific to the country’s relatives of femicide victimsseeking violence, the rage of a mother, of asister, of the community of a woman disappeared and murdered certainly has global resonance. Guillén’s family and their lawyer Natalie Khawam are de mandingan independent congressional investigation into her disappearance and killing; in July, the military announced a panel of civilian consultants would investigate ""command climate and culture"" at the base where Guillén was killed. Her family also calls on congress to create an independent agency that would handle reports from military members who are victims ofsexual harassment and assault. #IAmVanessaGuillen demonstrates the power ofsolidarity againstsexual harassment, yet reckoning with gender violence in this country also means recognizing how entrenched patriarchal violence is, and how it extends beyond the military’s ranks.",1,1,Teen Vogue

301,What the “Creator Economy” Promises—and What It Actually Does,0.0,43.0,https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/what-the-creator-economy-promises-and-what-it-actually-does,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,25,"The influencer is a fadingstock character of the Internet’s comme dia dell’arte. Often a conventionally attractive white woman,sheshows off her aspiration al lifestyle viasocial-media channels. She accrues a large following, and then makes a living by getting companies tosponsor the content of her glamorous life. The cliché of the influencer emerged, during the twenty-tens, from multimedia-rich platforms like Instagram and Snapchat, where the goal was to forge as cur ated and polished an image as possible. Influencers weresocial-media users as celebrities, with much of the vanity and purposelessness that the comparison implies. By now, the connotations of being an influencer are mostly negative—editedselfies, vapid captions, faux relatability,staged private-jet photos, and unmarkedsponsorships. Accordingly,social-media platforms are embracing a new buzzword as asuccessor: “creator.”“Creator” is a term with a more wholesome air, conjuring an Internet in which we are all artisanal blacksmiths plying our digital craft. But what, exactly, the word implies beyond that is up for debate. According to Taylor Lorenz’sreporting for, the term was originally marketed by YouTube, as early as 2011, as an alternative to vocabulary like “YouTubestar,” whichseemed to imply that only a few famous figures couldsucceed on the platform. But it’s now used to describe practically anyone who is producing any form of content online. TikTokusers are “TikTok creators.” Members of the invitation-only real-time voice-chat app Clubhouse are “audio creators.” OnlyFans, a marketplace mostly used for pornography, hosts “adult-content creators.”Even proponents of theso-called “creator economy,” the lattice of new platforms and tools meant toserve creators, can’t quite agree on what the term means or whom it includes. Its rise hassparked asem antic debate that tends toward thesolipsistic. “I think all influencers are creators; maybe not all creators are influencers,” Nicole Quinn, a partner at the venture-capital firm Lightspeed Venture Partners, told me. Lightspeed’s creator-economy investments include Cameo, a platform best known for custom video messages that celebritiessell tof ans, and Outschool, a marketplace for online classes. For Quinn, the difference in terminology comes down tosuccess: influencers are already famous; creators arestriving to be. Li Jin, the founder of the creator-economy investment firm Atelier Ventures, instead defined creators in terms of revenue. “Anyone whose famestems from online channels, if they are able to earn income through that influence, I consider that to be the creator economy.”Despite its vagueness, “creator” is being adopted as a byword for a new generation ofsocial-mediaspaces purportedly designed tosupport content producers in new ways. Where the ad-driven platforms Facebook and Twitter profit from our data and attention without giving much back, the likes of Clubhouse and OnlyFans promise to deliver a largershare of value to users by allowing for what Quinn, of Lightspeed, calls “direct monetization.” Instead of the company’sselling ads based on over-all engagement, creators can get paid by their individual viewers, who might buysubscriptions,send tips, or crowd fund new projects. The word “influencer” emphasized a person’s magnetic effect on her followers, a nebulous charisma easily turned toward marketing. “Creator,” by contrast,stresses that everyone posting onsocial media is producingsomething, pitching in to the collective effort of making user-generated platforms compelling and thus profitable. This idea has proved highly marketable: the creator economy has reportedlyseen $1.3 billion in investment funding in 2021 thus far, nearly three times the funding it received in all of 2020. Creator-economy businesses have devised various revenue models as alternatives to advertising. Subscription-driven platforms like Patreon, Substack, and Buy Me a Coffee charge a percentage of users’ income in return for publishing and pay walling their content. Apps like Linktree, Beacons, and Feedlink offer aservice that, for a monthly fee, expands the Website links thatsit in the bios ofsocial-media accounts, directing fans to a creator’s various content channels. Marketplaces for non-fungible tokens (NF T.s), like Foundation, Rarible, and SuperRare, allow creators tosell expensive digital-art objects in exchange for commission fees. On Twitch, asite where users can live-stream content like video games, and Heygo, astreamingsite that provides a virtual proxy for travel, viewers can access videostreams for free, with the option tosend tips to the hosts. According to Quinn, March of 2020 was the “key inflection point” for this burgeoning economy, as the increased appetite for digital content and the loss of jobs in other industries during the pandemic prompted more people to try their luck as creators. Insome ways, the creator economy does appear to give more agency to the user. Rather than trying to gamesocial-media algorithms, creators can theoretically rely on more dependable income fromsupporters. They can choose which kinds of work they take on, whether it be newsletters, livestreams, or audio chats. “They don’t have to care about fighting against the current of the platform,” Sam Yam, the co-founder of Patreon, a pioneer of the creator economy,said. In Yam’s mind, earning a living as a creator is an evolution of theso-called gig economy facilitated by companies like Uber and TaskRabbit. Followers are paying for access tosomeone’s unique talent or voice. “You care about the individual more than just the task that needs to be done,” Yamsaid. “It’s value exchanged for creativity.” The model promises a more human and less automated interaction. What were once called followers—the anonymous numbers racking up on a profile page likeso many fungible eyeballs—are now customers,supporters, and patrons. But this emerging field, in many ways, resembles a gig economy for digital content. Participants arestill precarious workers, relying on the whims of corporations for their livelihoods. Much like an Uber driver or a twenty-tens Instagram influencer, the creator is responsible for her own marketing, health care, and tax contributions. She makes money for the platform that hosts her without receiving the legal and financial protections of employeestatus, or thestock options typically given to the platform’s engineers, designers, and managers. Meanwhile, thesocial-media giants are developing their own version of the creator economy in an attempt to keep users from fleeing to newer,smaller platforms. Last year, TikTok launched a Creator Fund to pay its users directly for popular content. Snapchat launched asimilar program called Spotlight, which offers creators millions of dollars of compensation a month. This past week, Facebook, which owns Instagram, announced that it would pay out more than a billion dollars to users across its platforms by 2022. Anshuman Iddamsetty, a former pod cast producer who now runs a Patreon focussed on eroticself-portraiture, and who uses the pronouns “they” and “them,” told me that they make an adequate living from that account and an OnlyFans page. But theysaid that there’s a gap between the platforms’ message that anyone can “build an independent creative career,” as Patreon’s Website touts, and the reality of being asolo entrepreneur. “Patreon doesn’tsuddenly, magically make the act of creating your deliverables easier,” theysaid. Ambiguous guidelines can give platforms the power to block users or types of content at will; Patreon does allowsome forms of adult content, but Iddamsetty, who describes themself as a “fat erotic artist,” has run into unexpected barriers. Creator-economy hype is relevant “only if you’re a certain kind of creator with a certain kind of product,” theysaid. Even Yam, of Patreon, recognizes the limitations of the burgeoning field. He anticipates a future in which both thesocial-media giants and the creator-economy brands are avoidable altogether. Each creator will instead have her own custom-built platform, “their own world top to bottom,” from the underlying technology to the published content—an “ownership economy.” For the time being, though, the bulk of users will continue to rely on the preëstablished attention economy for the bulk of their digital consumption. “Facebook, Instagram, YouTube, those are just as dominant as ever,” Jinsaid. “Today, no one finds a person on Patreon; you go there after you’ve found them.” In other words, to be a creator, youstill have to be an influencer after all.",1,1,The New Yorker
302,Students and faculty urge deeper look at land-grant legacy,-14.17,42.17,https://www.hcn.org/issues/53.1/indigenous-affairs-land-grab-universities-students-and-faculty-urge-deeper-look-at-land-grant-legacy,https://adfontesmedia.com/high-country-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,16,"A banner hangs on astatue of Cornell University’s founder, Ezra Cornell, on Indigenous Peoples’ Day this year. Della Keahna UranWhenpublished “Land-Grab universities” last April, the two-year-long investigationshed new light on a dark opensecret: One of the largest transfers of land and capital in the country’s history had masqueraded as a donation for university endowments. HCNidentified nearly 11 million acres of land, expropriated from approximately 250 tribes, bands and communities through more than 160 violence-backed treaties and land cessions. Now, in the wake of the investigation, land-grant universities across the country are re-evaluating the capital they built from thesestolen Indigenous lands. More than 150 years after President Abraham Lincolnsigned the Morrill Act — the legislation that transferred the lands — new discussions about the universities’ moral and ethical responsibilities have forced Americans to re-examine the law’s legacy. Land-grant institutions have long prided themselves on their accomplishments as beneficiaries: They used the proceeds generated by the land to broaden access to higher education, thereby contributing to economic development across the nation. But many of those institutions paid next to nothing for the public lands they received andsold. By far the largest beneficiary was Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, which acquired almost 1 million acres from Ojibwe, Miwok, Yokuts, Dakota and other Indigenous nations through 63 treaties orseizures. The land came from 15states, and by 1935, when the last parcel wassold, Cornell University had generated nearly $6 million for its endowment, the largest of any land-grant institution. Adjusted for inflation, it raised over $92 million. Now, as the country reconsiders long-standing issues of racial equity and justice — focusing on everything from local political races to national legislation —students and faculty alike are pressuring administrators to address the investigation’s findings. On Indigenous Peoples’ Day, October 12, 2020, members of Native American and Indigenous Students at Cornell (NAISAC) put forward a list of 10 demands in the form of apetition. The demands include turning the American Indian and Indigenous Studies Program into a university department; recruiting new Indigenous faculty andstudents,specifically Indigenousstudents affected and/or displaced by the Morrill Act; waiving tuition for thosestudents; acknowledging the land of the Gayogo̱hó:nǫ’, or Cayuga Nation, before every Ithaca-based event; and reinstating an ad-hoc committee on Native American Affairs to oversee the approval of these demands.“If the president’s office was responsible, then they would meet each of these demands to the extent that we’ve laid them out in our petition,”said Colin Benedict (Mohawk), the external relations chair for NAISAC. “Each of these demands in my mind is completely 100% justified andshould already have been implemented by the university decades ago.”As of December 1, the petition had more than 900signatures fromstudents,staff, alumni and community members. The president’s office has yet to respond publicly, but in an email exchange, itstated, “The Office of the President is in receipt of the NAISAC petition, and the President is looking forward to working with the Native American and Indigenous community at Cornell on these issues.”A faculty committee, headed by American Indian and Indigenous Studies Program Director Kurt Jordan, launched theCornell University and Indigenous Dispossession Project. The project will research Cornell’s Morrill Act land history, identify the Indigenous communities affected, and foster discussion of possible remedies.“We’ve had a number ofstatements that have been made by the administration in light of the George Floyd murder, Black Lives Matter, and all of the other things that have been happening this year about the need for Cornell to really address its legacy, its historical roots, its complicity in … tosome degree, with whitesupremacy,” Jordansaid.“Benefiting fromstolen Indigenous land has to be part of that.”History professor Jon Parmenter recently discovered that Cornell is in possession of over 420,000 acres of mineral rights in the Central and Southwestern US, a portion of which was retained through Morrill Act lands. In its petition, NAISAC urged the university to release astatement acknowledging the amount of land acquired, the interest accrued and mineral rights funds received, and pledging to refrain from mineral and resource extraction on those lands., faculty andstudents at the University of California, Berkeley have also madestrides. Established in 1868, the university received almost 150,000 acres from the Morrill Act. The land raised $730,000 for the university’s early endowment, and, adjusted for inflation, has generated over $13 million. The university paid nothing in return. The presence and history of Indigenous people has been largely erased from the UCsystem,said Phenocia Bauerle (Apsáalooke), director of Native American Student Development at the University of California, Berkeley. Two years ago, Bauerle and the Native American Student Development center created a land acknowledgment to honor the Ohlone tribal lands that the universitysits upon. However, the university has yet to adopt an official acknowledgment. According to aCalifornia audit, UC Berkeley is the worst offender among theschools when it comes to complying with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA), which grants Indigenous nations the right to regain ancestral remains and objects from museums. UC Berkeley has only repatriated 20% of its 500,000-artifact collection. In comparison, the University of California Los Angeles has repatriated 96% of its collection.“A lot of it comes down to, well, theysee these issues as historical and not of the present because theysee Natives as historical and not of the present,” Bauerlesaid. Since the dispossession occurred in the past, contemporary people don’tsee themselves as responsible, and they feel no pressure to address the issue today. However, “ ‘Land-Grab’ gave usseveral concrete (points),” Bauerlesaid. “This dispossession of Native land that this whole country benefits from — here’s aspecific way that we canshow you that Berkeley actually played a part in it. These are the receipts. This is how much money you got.”Bauerle partnered with Rosalie Z Fanshel, a doctoralstudent in environmentalscience, policy and management and the program manager for the Berkeley Food Institute, to organize a conference on the Morrill Act and Indigenous land dispossession.“The UC Land Grab: A Legacy of Profit from Indigenous Land” was held in two parts in September and October. The conference dug deep into the history of California’s genocide and the founding of the University of California. Participants called for action, includingshared landstewardship, research opportunities and tuition options for Indigenousstudents. More than 500 people attended both days of the conference. David Ackerly, dean of the Rausser College of Natural Resources in Berkeley, was among them. “I felt like I was learningso much that I had not been aware of,” hesaid. “This is part of ourstory, I want to be part of this. I want to learn. I want to figure out where we’re heading.”Other attendees includedstaff from the office of UC President Michael V Drake, the office of the chancellor at UC Berkeley and the governor’s office, as well as deans and administrators from various UC campuses and units.“Many Native and Indigenous people in thestate and across the world have been made promisessince colonization, and they’ve been broken. It’s hard not to remember that legacy; I live in that legacy.”One of the panelists, Brittani Orona, a doctoral candidate in Native Americanstudies and human rights at UC Davis and a member of the Hoopa Valley Tribe, wassurprised by how many people within the universitysystem had no knowledge of the history of land-grant institutions. “I think with Native people and Nativestudents, you know that our land, our places have been taken away from us, from many different institutions and at many different points of time,” Oronasaid. At the conference, Oronaspoke about the history of genocide in California. “Scholars of California Indian genocide willsay it ended in 1873, but I argue it is a continuous process,” Oronasaid.“Many Native and Indigenous people in thestate and across the world have been made promisessince colonization, and they’ve been broken. It’s hard not to remember that legacy; I live in that legacy.”Orona, who will complete her PhD. in the coming year, hopes that future Native and Indigenousstudents have a different experience thanshe did. “What does that mean, when you’re having California Nativestudents pay out of pocket on land that has been dispossessed from them?I appreciate the discussions that are going on, but I’ll believe it when Isee it — and when it moves beyond acknowledgment towards actual actionable items that make life easier for Native and Indigenousstudents and peoples.”As of December 4, UC Berkeley Chancellor Carol Christ has yet to respond about the conference publicly. In an email, however,she wrote, “To achieve this inclusive campus culture, we must acknowledge how our history, including the Morrill Land Grant Act, impacts Indigenous people. Now more than ever, we, as a university, must take immediate action to acknowledge past wrongs, build trusting and respectful relationships, and accelerate change and justice for our Native Nations and Tribal communities.”High Country News.

Tongues are wagging about the new arrival. Amy Beth Bennett/South Florida Sun SentinelA man walks past Oceanview Adult Toys & More on Fort Lauderdale Beach on Wednesday, November 18, 2020. A touch of decadence arrived on Fort Lauderale’s Las Olas Boulevard in the form of a controversialsexshop in a hard-to-missspot just a block from the beach. But its day in thesun didn’t last long. Ocean View Boutique, with its wall-to-wall racks ofsex toys, opened on Monday. Just four days later, thestore got an urgent visit from code officers Thursdaysaying it had to close. Fort Lauderdale ended up yanking thestore’s business license because itsits too close to the city’s new oceanfront park at Las Olas and A1A, in violation of a local ordinance.“This is not kosher for thatsite — an adult toystore has to be at least 500 feet from a park,” Vice Mayor Steve Glassmansaid Thursday afternoon. Thestore owner did not mention what kind of retail he planned tosell when he filled out his business license application, Glassmansaid. City officials got their first clue when the complaintsstarted rolling in. Owner Percy Siriwardana, of Cutler Bay in Miami-Dade County, declined to comment when a South Florida Sun Sentinel reporter called thestore Thursday morning. News of an adult toystore openingso close to an oceanfront landmark corner had critics in a tizzy, wondering how in the worldsuch a thing could happen. Nearby residents were worried they’d end up beingstuck with their new neighbor. Jo Ann Medalie, a 60-year resident of the beach, was over the moon whenshe heard the place had beenshut down.“Oh my God, that makes my day,”shesaid with glee. “I was worried it might be a lost cause. That did get people wound up, didn’t it? People were just up in arms.”Thestore hadblacked-out windowsso passers-by couldn’tsee the merchandise. Asign warned visitors they had to be at least 18 years old to enter. Not a good fitJohn Burns, president of the Venetian Condo Association, ventured inside the other day, curious tosee exactly what was beingsold.“When you walk in, it’s got toys and playthings that, quite frankly, I don’t know what to do with,” hesaid. “They have racks and walls of adult toys. It’s kind ofshocking tosee in the middle of our beach. It doesn’tset the right tone. The garish lights at nighttime make it look astrip joint in Times Square. It just looks out of place.”Bob Casullo has a birds-eye view of the place from his condo across thestreet. He caught wind of the newstore afterseeing a neighbor ranting about it on Facebook.“I don’t think that’s the right place for an adult toystore,”said Casullo, who lives at the Venetian near A1A and Las Olas. “What are you going to do, buy a dildo on your way to the beach? The women in our building are outraged.”Fort Lauderdale hasspent years luring high-end development in an attempt to bring grace, elegance and class to a beach once known for dive bars, wet T-shirt contests and raucous Spring Breaks.“They’re taking retail in the wrong direction,” Mayor Dean Trantalissaid during a meeting this week at City Hall. “That’s not what we’re looking for.”Glassmansaid he had no idea asexshop was even on the horizon for that corner.“I found out about it whensomeone text ed me a photo the other day,” hesaid earlier this week. “At first blush, it does notseem to fit into the vision we have for that corridor. It’s not the best fit.”Adult toys and moreNeighbors got their first notice change was coming to 2941 East Las Olas Blvd. when a mammothsign was hung last weekend blasting the news: “Adult toys and more.”Ina Lee, owner of Travelhost Magazine of Greater Fort Lauderdale,summed up her reaction in twosimple words: “Oh no.”Medalie had a one-word description for thestore:Schlocky.“That was the last thing I expected tosee on the beach,”shesaid. “We’re trying to make this a major destination. When Isaw thesign on thatstore, I thought ‘Oh my goodness. This is quite offensive.’ And where there’s one [adultsexshop], more tend to crop up.”Resident Abby Laughlin wondered how asexshop could operate right across thestreet from Fort Lauderdale’s new oceanfront “family-friendly” park. The park, Las Olas Oceanside Park at 3000 E Las Olas Blvd., opened last year across from Fort Lauderdale’sstoried Elbo Room bar. New face, new image?Laughlin joked that thesexshop represents the new face of Fort Lauderdale beach.“Really? Is this the best we can do at our ‘world-class’ beach?”she asked. “Oy! It’s an embarrassment for Fort Lauderdale beach.”Glassman, whose district encompasses the beach,says he’d already gotten complaints from residents. So had Commissioner Ben Sorensen. Both mentioned thesexshop drama this week during a City Hall meeting, prompting Trantalis to recall his fight against another adult toystore coming to town — and losing.“I remember the debate we had when Hustler wanted to take over the Peaches recordstore,” Trantalissaid. That was in 2004, when the commission then in office embraced theHustler project in a 3-2 vote. Sixteen years later, the Hustlershop isstill in operation at 1500 East Sunrise Blvd., just blocks from the Galleria mall. Casullosays he has nothing againstsexshops, but was relieved to learn his would-be neighbor got the heave-ho.“I don’t begrudge them their business,” hesaid. “I just didn’t think that was the right place to put it.

308,Data Brokers Are a Threat to Democracy,-7.0,37.67,https://www.wired.com/story/opinion-data-brokers-are-a-threat-to-democracy/,https://adfontesmedia.com/wired-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-13,25,"You’ve probably never heard of Acxiom, but it likely knows you: The Arkansas firm claims to have data on 2.5 billion people around the world. And in the US, ifsomeone’s interested in that information, there are virtually no restrictions on their ability to buy and then use it. Enter the data brokerage industry, the multi billion dollar economy ofselling consumers’ and citizens’ intimate details. Much of the privacy discourse has rightly pointed fingers at Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and TikTok, which collect users’ information directly. But a far broader ecosystem of buying up, licensing,selling, andsharing data exists around those platforms. Data brokerage firms are middlemen ofsurveillance capitalism—purchasing, aggregating, and repackaging data from a variety of other companies, all with the aim ofselling or further distributing it. Data brokerage is a threat to democracy. Without robust national privacysafeguards, entire databases of citizen information are ready for purchase, whether to predatory loan companies, law enforcement agencies, or even malicious foreign actors. Federal privacy bills that don’t givesufficient attention to data brokerage will therefore fail to tackle an enormous portion of the datasurveillance economy, and will leave civil rights, nationalsecurity, and public-private boundaries vulnerable in the process. Large data brokers—like Acxiom, CoreLogic, and Epsilon—tout the detail of their data on millions or even billions of people. CoreLogic, for instance,advertisesits real estate and property information on 99.9 percent of the US population. Acxiompromotes11,000-plus “data attributes,” from auto loan information to travel preferences, on 2.5 billion people (all to help brands connect with people “ethically,” it adds). This level of data collection and aggregation enables remarkablyspecific profiling. Need to run ads targeting poor families in rural areas? Check out one data broker’s “Rural and Barely Making It” dataset. Or how about racially profiling financial vulnerability? Buy another company’s “Ethnic Second-City Strugglers” dataset. These are justsome of the disturbing titles captured in a 2013 Senatereporton the industry’s data products, which have only expandedsince. Many other brokers advertise their ability to identifysubgroups uponsubgroups of individuals through criteria like race, gender, maritalstatus, and income level, allsensitive characteristics that citizens likely didn’t know would end up in a database—let alone up forsale. These companies often acquire the information through purchase, licensing, or othersharing agreements with third parties. Oracle, for example, “owns and works with” over 80 data brokers, according to a 2019report, aggregating information on everything from consumershopping to internet behavior. However, many companies alsoscrape data that is publicly viewable on the internet and then aggregate it forsale orsharing. “Peoplesearch” websites often fall into this latter category—compiling public records (property filings, court documents, voting registrations, etc.) on individuals and then letting anyone on the internetsearch for their information. All of these unchecked practices undermine civil rights. Companies that boast holding thousands of data points on millions or billions of people—all forselling them to whomever is buying—themselves represent the aggregation of unrestrainedsurveillance power. This is particularly dangerous to the less powerful. As centuries ofsurveillance in the USs have made undeniably clear, the impact ofstockpiling individuals’ personal information will fall hardest on the already oppressed or marginalized: the poor, Black and brown communities, Indigenous populations, LGBTQ+ individuals, undocumented immigrants. “Peoplesearch” websites in particular can publicize addresses and thus enable intimate partner violence ordoxing. Thestrong financial incentives tosell data, with virtually nonexistent limitations, gives these companies every reason toshare their data with others, including those who use it for harm. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoLaw enforcement already buys up data from brokers. The Department of Homeland Security, includingsubagencies responsible for putting children in cages, have purchased cell phone location data on millions of Americans,home address information tosupport deportations, and home utility data for investigations, among others. The Federal Bureau of Investigation has also been purchasing cell phone location data from data broker Venntel. These practices circumvent democratic accountability: Agencies buy the information without warrants, and in doingso may bypass prohibitions on companies handing data directly to law enforcement. Plus, the data may not even be accurate. Aninvestigationbyidentified dozens of US cases over the last decade where individuals were denied housing becausescreening companies used bad information, often purchased from data brokers or pulled from “peoplesearch” broker websites. Citizens also get rejected from jobs because of background checks relying on incorrect data. The unregulatedsale of massive databases of citizen information—and the unregulated aggregation and publication of that information online—also undermines nationalsecurity. This was one of the missing elements of the policy debate over TikTok. If the US government is concerned about foreign authoritarian powers building detailed profiles on citizens, or even just on government personnel, then data brokers’ ability tosell,share, or publish intimate datasets on Americans with virtually no restrictionshould be of urgent concern too. Foreign powers could buy this data throughshell companies orsteal it by hacking. It could then be used to run micro targeted election ads. It could be used to inform counterintelligence operations or identify persons of interest in the business community. Criminal groups could even use this information to target politicians or judges. Not to mention, the largest data brokers are lobbying more aggressively in Washington. Another recent investigation by found that25such companiesspent $29 million on lobbying in 2020, rivaling the efforts of Facebook or Google. That is why it’s more urgent than ever that legislators and regulators address this industry as a key part of protecting Americans’ privacy and curbing harms the industry causes abroad. With zerosafeguards, this datasale will only continue threatening democracy. Federal privacy legislationshould consider all companies thatsell data as part of the data brokerage economy,not just those whosell data on third parties.

310,Here’s What Researchers Have Discovered So Far About COVID Vaccines And Donated Breast Milk,0.0,45.0,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/nicolefallert/covid-vaccine-breast-milk,https://adfontesmedia.com/buzzfeed-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,25,"Organizations that provide donated breast milk to parentssay fielding questions about how the vaccines figure into the transfer of antibodies has led to a “second layer of chaos” from the pandemic. BuzzFeed News ReporterDanielle Byrdsong loaded bags of breast milk into her car, preparing to make her first donationsince receiving the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine in April.“To be honest, I was a little concerned,”shesaid. Byrdsong, a 36-year-old mother of two living in the Washington, DC, area, told BuzzFeed News that at the time,she didn’t know if getting the COVID vaccine would affect her ability to donate her breast milk — an information gap that is increasingly becoming a factor for milk banks as more of the US population is vaccinated. A key question from donors and recipients is whether protection against the coronavirus travels through a vaccinated person’s breast milk to an infant. While long-termstudies at a largerscale are needed, early researchsuggests that the answer is yes.“We don’t have that proof,”said Kim Updegrove, the executive director at Mothers' Milk Bank at Austin. “We are assuming that it is protective. We are assuming that it is coming through with the milk and that it is a really good thing. All of that leads to a very interesting question coming from people whosit on bothsides of the vaccine fence.”Fielding uncertainty about the vaccine has become the pandemic’s “second layer of chaos” for milk banks, Updegrovesaid. Fifteen months after the banks initially addressed panic over the effect COVID-19 might have on lactating or pregnant people, there is a growing need for information regarding whether infants are protected against the virus via the milk of vaccinated people. Donations are typically collected by nonprofit organizations that test the milk, mix multiple donors’ milk intosingle batches, and distribute the nutrient-rich pooled product to medical providers for people likeParisHenderson, a 33-year-old mother whoseson was born prematurely in May The hospital offered her donor milk when her own milk didn’t come in after the early delivery; her body was behindschedule and unprepared to produce milk. Henderson hasn’t received a COVID-19 vaccine but tested positive for antibodies aftershe overcame the virus.“I didn’t care if the person was vaccinated or not,” Hendersonsaid about the people who donated the milk herson received. It mattered more to her that her baby received the nutrients in the milk,she added. A main reason for confusion is a lack of robust clinicalstudy about the effect of the COVID-19 vaccines on pregnant or lactating people. As isstandard for most clinical trials, pregnant people were left out of the COVID-19 vaccine trials. To include them would have meant that researchers needed to collect data on both parents and babies, potentially prolonging the clinical trial process and raising complicated ethical questions. According to theCDC, there’s little to no information available about thesafety and effects of the vaccines on breast milk as of now, butspecific clinical trials are underway or planned.“It just feels like another [instance] in which women are justsort of forgotten,”said Erin Burgin, a 35-year-old mother of two from the Washington, DC, area. After becoming pregnant in 2020 and delivering a few months ago, Burginsaid the lack of information on thesafety of breastfeeding when vaccinated was “extremely unsettling.”But that’sstarting to change. Arecent jointstudy from Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital concluded that vaccinated parents do in fact pass their antibodies to infants via their breast milk. Thestudy took place from December 2020 to February 2021 and evaluated 131 women who were either of reproductive age, lactating, or pregnant and about to receive either the Pfizer or Modernashots. The researchers had two goals in mind: track if their vaccines worked against COVID-19 and, ifso, whether theshot also provided protection to infants. Donor breast milk at the Mothers' Milk Bank at Austin is pasteurized and pooled into asingle product.“We found that, reassuringly, pregnant and lactating women madesimilar amounts of antibodies in response to the vaccination,so vaccination was effective,” Dr. Kathryn Gray, lead author of thestudy, told BuzzFeed News. “For all the lactating individuals in ourstudy, we found that the maternal antibodies also crossed into the breast milk. Thatsuggests that there may besome benefit and protection conferred to infants from pregnant individuals and lactating individuals who are vaccinated.”But the immunity benefits for the baby don’t last long after weaning, Stephanie Gaw, an assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductivesciences at the University of California, San Francisco, told BuzzFeed News. The antibodies coat the baby’s mouth, throat, and digestive tract, keeping the virus from infecting the baby’s cells, but researchers don’t know for how long. Gawled asmallstudy that determined both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines do not cross into breast milk. Thestudy analyzed the breast milk ofseven individuals at various time points after they received either mRNA vaccine. Researcherssaid the results bolstered recommendations that lactating people who get the vaccineshouldn’tstop breastfeeding. Gaw added thatshesaw no harm in mixing pre- and post-vaccine milk. While the new findings are reassuring, the resultsshouldn’t change how milk banks pool their donations, both Gaw and Graysaid. Gray emphasized that prior to the pandemic, adults who produce breast milk are typically exposed to myriad infections and receive vaccines frequently. And as the population becomes more immune to COVID-19, these antibodies will just become another layer of protection breast milk provides babies that formula doesn’t. But consistency is important, a report inNaturefound, because babies process antibodies within a matter of hours or days. As a result, any layer of protection that breast milk provides lasts only as long as babies are breastfed.“We have always asked about vaccinations during ourscreening process,so this is just a newset of information for us to collect,”said Rebecca Heinrich, director of Mothers’ Milk Bank. “We do not yet know whatsort of antibody ‘load’ is transferred, or whatsort of immunesystem boost it might provide, but of course our hope is that antibodies in donor milk help protect the infant from allsorts of pathogens, including COVID-19.”Byrdsong, the mother of two living in DC,said that for people like her, the firststepshould be clearing up confusion over whether antibodies or the vaccine itself is transferred via breast milk.“I think that most mothers who have concerns about the vaccine ... their discomfort with it has to do with the vaccine itself being given directly to a child versus antibodies,” Byrdsongsaid. “Personally, I do not know any mother who is against their child receiving antibodies,so I do not know if that issomething that they understand, that there is a difference between the two.”Burgin, who received the Moderna vaccine thisspring,saidshe is currently breastfeeding her 6-month-old baby and gives her 3-year-old child a glass of breast milk each week as an immunity boost. Gawsaid it’s not yet clear how much milk an older child would need to achieve immunity or how long that immunity would take.“I talked to other moms whosaid that they have continued their breastfeeding journey longer because they had the vaccine and they want to helpsome of their older kids in their house,” Burginsaid. “It is a huge discussion … and breast milk is an easy way to give [protection] to your kid who can not get the vaccine yet.”Milk banks typically ask donors if they’ve received other major vaccines,such as against the measles, but they don’t yet have astandardized method to prove that they’ve gotten the COVID-19 vaccine or if they have responded positively and developed antibodies, Updegrovesaid. However, on average, more than 50% of donors in moststates haveself-reported in their profile that they received one of the FDA-approved vaccines,she added. The Mothers' Milk Bank at Austin estimates it will process about 900,000 ounces of donor breast milk in 2021, about 100,000 more ounces than last year. But that won’t change the way donated milk is pasteurized,said Lindsay Groff, executive director for Human Milk Banking Association of North America. She added thatso far, there’s no information about the vaccine is effect on breast milk that would make any changes to the donation process necessary. Experts are also reminding parents thatsince milk from banks is pooled from multiple people, it’s not possible to request milk from unvaccinated donors unless the recipientseeks it directly from an individual.“The reason why multi-donors are recommended in one pool of milk is that the women who are lactating and expressing their milk are not thesame,” Updegrovesaid. “They are eating different diets, they are taking different vitamins. There is a value in mixing multiple different donors.”When asked about the typical profile of breast milk donors, Greysaidshe hopes to diversify the research on the vaccine’s effect on people who are lactating,since herstudy consisted primarily of white, non-Latino women. Hendersonsaid important information about the health and immunity benefits of breast milk has been lacking among Black parents, and in her case, whereshe lives in Vienna, Virginia, determined her ability to receive a donation.“I think more women in my community in particular would breast feed if they knew that they were providing their child with asense of protection,” Hendersonsaid. “I do not think that the information is there. Lactation consultations and breastfeeding centers, they are not available to all. We were fortunate to have our hospital in a wealthier area. That is why we got the donor milk … and theysaid, ‘This is notsomething that’s offered everywhere.’ We may not have been fortunate enough to have it.”Now that her milksupply has come in, Hendersonsaidshe would “absolutely” donate her milk.“You could besavingsomebody is life or preventing a baby from gettingsick,”shesaid. “They aresosusceptible to everything anyways, just that one little layer of protection. You don’t really know, but I feel like it gives a parent peace of mind. Asense of comfort. And that is what I go back to. I do not know that I am doing everything, but I know that at least I am trying.”",2,1,BuzzFeed News

Theads—taken out in,The Washington Post, andThe Wall Street Journalon December 16—claim that Facebook is “standing up to Apple forsmall businesses,” for whom Apple’s changes will be “devastating.” With its not-so-subtle implication that Apple doesn’t care about lifting up the little guys, the campaign amounts to a mammoth bat-swing at the company, especially in this moment of antitrust inquiry and anti-monopoly reckoning. But while thesocial media giant is leading us in aseemingly virtuous direction, the reality is quite different. Facebook is contentions that this is bad forsmall business are most likelyself-interested. But they are also plain wrong.is the author of and directs the Digital Platforms & Democracy Project at the Harvard Kennedy School. He was a technology & economic policy adviser in the Obama-Biden White House and later, a privacy & public policy advisor at Facebook. The nuts and bolts of Apple’s new policy, which will apply toiOS 14, are pretty clear: Data tracking is not allowed if the user chooses to disable the option. And that choice must be presented to the user through Apple’s AppTrackingTransparency framework, which, in the user interface, appears as a typical iPhone pop-up query. Apple has further indicated that the kinds of practices that will qualify as tracking include in-app ad display targeted at users with the aid of third-party data,sharing of location data with brokers,sharing of personally identifiable information like email addresses with third-party ad networks for ad-retargeting or look alike targeting, and use of third-party SDKs that use in-app data for commercial ad-targetingservices. This definition of tracking can be considered appropriately broad. It could be broader—Appleofferssome examples of practices that willstill be allowed under the new policy. But as with every decision, there are natural trade-offs, and Apple has facedtremendouspushback from app developers and major tech firms in response to the announcement. The new policy doesn’t come out of the blue, though. Some havesuggested that Apple, along with other major tech firms, including Facebook, are instituting (or already have established)such policies in light of the growing regulatorystick in the air on all matters related to user privacy; the European Commission and thestate of California, for instance, have each recently pushed newstandards that favor their constituents' privacy rights. And we couldsoonseesimilar moves at the federal level in the USs, resulting either from the recently-pushed antitrustsuits or the possibility of a reformative baseline privacy law. Facebook’s ads claim thatsmall businesses will be impacted—that its many app developers andsmall business advertisers around the world willsuffer in the long run as a result of Apple’s privacy-minded changes. Notably, the newspaper ads mention that 44 percent of “small to medium businessesstarted or increased their usage of personalized ads onsocial media during the pandemic” and that the “averagesmall business advertiserstands tosee a cut of over 60 percent in theirsales for every dollar theyspend.”But when one examines the technical changes that Facebook announced to its developer community in order to comply with Apple’s update, the idea thatsmall businesses advertising on its platformstand to lose a lot of revenue begins to look quiteshaky. According to the post, Facebook will tweak engagement measurementsso that advertisers cannot track more than eight types of “conversion events,” or in-app user actions that it measures to assess the effectiveness of ad-targeting algorithms. There will also besome minor technical changes to the implementations ofValue Optimization, Facebook’s algorithmic tool that maximizes revenues generated from ad targeting by predicting how much a given user willspend in an app,as well as dynamic ads,measurement of performance of ad campaigns, and asubset of Facebook’sdeveloper APIs. These are manageable changes—minor coding fixes—forsmall businesses who depend on Facebook to reach their customers and know their buying habits. But more to the point, they are changes that hurt Facebook and its affiliated data brokers and ad networks—not the main-streetsmall businesses evoked by Facebook’s newspaper ads. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoIt’s true thatsmall businesses generally depend on advertising. In recent years, because of the overwhelming popularity ofsocial media, and Facebook’s monopoly in thatspace, that’s meant that manysmall businesses depend on Facebook. But it does not have to be that way—small businesses wouldstill find other places to advertise in targeted ways even if Facebook did not exist, let alone if its targeting and tracking features were fully deprecated. Consider thestatistics Facebook presented in its ads. What does the fact that 44 percent ofsmall businesses increased advertising during the pandemic effectively mean? Only that, during the pandemic, more people arestuck at home, and Facebook’s monopoly ad network isseeing more consumption as a result. More businesses are advertising over it because more consumers are on the couch looking at their phones. This figure doesn’t necessarily indicate thatsmall businesses benefit from advertising on Facebook, just that they have no other option. The company also notes that without targeting,sales forsmall businesses would decrease by 60 percent for every dollarspent on Facebook ads. But that’s a potentially misleading figure that doesn’tspeak to the possibility that these businesses will identify alternative places to reach consumers. We already know that without targeting based on personalized optimization, advertising on Facebook would be far less effective. Recall that in the Facebook advertising network, ad placement is priced by auction, meaning that with less effectiveness in targeting, the price of advertising on Facebook would correspondingly decrease—which in turn would open up more marketing budget forsmall businesses to advertise elsewhere. The result? Apple’s policy will take a bite out ofsurveillance capitalism, and will hand that excess profit back to traditional media and advertising businesses that will offersmall businesses a greater diversity of opportunities to get the word out about their products andservices. A more meaningful number for Facebook to report would be how deprecating ad-targeting options correlates, if at all, to the overall commercialsuccess ofsmall businesses—not theirsales rates on Facebook itself. Facebook can research and eventually report the former, but it is well aware thatsuch astudy would not yield a useful number for their purposes. Of course, in theshort term, these changes will causesome minor headaches in updating advertising campaigns and code. But people willstill want to buy local products, patronize mom-and-popstores, and donate to their neighborhood charities. Meanwhile, Facebook will inevitably adjust its ad-targeting technologies and develop new methods of tracking users in aggregated and anonym i zed ways across its applications—innovations that will help the ad industry maintain profitability while respecting Apple’s new compliance constraints. And aren’t these changes that the publicshould want, in any case? Small businesses owners are, at the end of the day, individual citizens and consumers, too. They care about privacy, just like anyoneshould—and any increase in data privacy, marginal or otherwise, is an economic win for consumers. Local and digital-firstsmall businesses willstill be able to compete fairly—and now, their owners will have a little more privacy protection to boot. There are trade-offs inherent to any policy change; it can be argued that even if advertisers experience a minor hit in ad-targeting in the near future, it is nonetheless good for the whole ofsociety given the gains in individual privacy and autonomy that will also result. Andrew WilliamsMatt BurgessScharon Harding, Ars TechnicaMedea GiordanoWhat, then, is Facebook talking about in its full-page ads? Notsurprisingly, the hit to its own business—and business model. The practices of ad-targeting and engagement-tracking are precisely what make Facebookso tremendously powerful in the digital ecosystem. We know that the vastly dominantshare—over 98 percent—of Facebook’s global revenues, which in 2019 were over $70 billion, comes from advertising. Even a 5 percent hit to that equates to a loss of billions of dollars a year, a cut that Facebook’s financial community—including capitalists,shareholders, and the company’s own executives andstaff—does not want tosee. As many have now contended, Facebook is a monopoly. The company has a dominantshare in varioussubsectors of the consumer internet that are economically critical in the media ecosystem—includingsocial media and web-based text messaging. In fact, Facebook could arguably be considered amonopoly, in that the company takes advantage of powerful network effects that, absent regulatory intervention, establish it as the dominant market player in perpetuity. Using its monopoly power, Facebook has undertaken a number ofsteps designed to put astranglehold over thesocial media economy: buying up rival firms, copying the practices ofsmaller players,sucking up intellectual talent including independent academics, collecting personal data at exploitative rates and using it for questionable means, and, along with Google, monopolizing the process of information exchange over advertising networks. An imposition of greater privacy protection—instantiated by Apple in response to new, progressive privacy regulations—might be precisely what helpssmall businesses gain a greater economic foothold. To besure, Apple is no angel. But the changes it is implementing next year are a good thing for an American and global public that increasingly cares about digital rights and personal privacy. At the end of the day,small businesses are owned by people like you and me—people who themselves will benefit from improved privacy rights. WIRED Opinionhere, andsee oursubmission guidelineshere.

312,Geography and money will be key as Marshall and Bollier vie for Senate seat in Kansas,2.67,43.67,https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article244743007.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/kansas-city-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,17,"Republican Rep. Roger Marshalldefeated former Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobachin Tuesday’s GOP Senate primary by dominating Wichita and his political home base of western Kansas. The resultssuggestDemocratic nominee Barbara Bollierfaces asteep challenge in limiting Marshall’ssupport in thestate’s largest city. Staying competitive in Wichita is likely crucial for Bollier to have ashot at becoming the first Kansas Democrat toserve in the US Senatesince the 1930s. Bothsidesscrambled Wednesday toset the terms of the fight. Republicans had expected a close primary race, but Marshall instead easily dispatched Kobach on Tuesday night.“I think we’ll have the resources to protect our fort and build out our territory,” Marshallsaid in an interview Wednesday. “Tell ourstory of a fifth generation farm kid who became a first generation collegestudent … I think when weshare thatstory it resonates.”But Marshall, a Great Bend OB-GYN, receivedsoftersupport in the Kansas City area, offering Bollier a potential weakness to exploit. Bollier, astatesenator and retired anesthesiologist from Mission Hills,said Tuesday voters wantsomeone with “commonsense and a voice of reason.” She movedswiftly Wednesday to intensify her outreach to Republicans, releasing a new ad with Tom Moxley, a former Republicanstate lawmaker and rancher from Council Grove in central Kansas.“I have never voted for a Democrat for US Senate in my lifetime,” Moxleysays in the ad. “But I’m going to vote for Barbara Bollier.”Bollier, who didn’t face a competitive primary,has been a fundraising machine. She hasset records for Kansas Democrats and her campaignsaid Tuesdayshe is heading into the general election with $4.5 million on hand compared to Marshall’s roughly $1 million as of mid-July.“After an expensive and bruising primary, Marshall will face a formidable opponent in Dr. Barbara Bollier, who has been building astrong grassroots campaign, a broad coalition ofsupport, and a massive resource advantage for the general election,”said Helen Kalla, aspokeswoman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of Senate Democrats. Still, Republicans believe their party, which holds asignificant registration advantage over Democrats, will quickly unite around Marshall.“As of today Barbara Bollier has a lot more money than Roger Marshall does, but Roger Marshall has a lot more voters. It is much easier for Roger Marshall to get a lot more money in the next 90 days than it is for Barbara Bollier to get a lot more voters. And the person who finishes with the most voters wins,”said David Kensinger, who has managedstatewide campaigns for Sen. Pat Roberts and former Governor Sam Brownback. With all precincts reporting, Marshall had 40% of the vote to Kobach’s 26%. Advance mail-in ballots may trickle in the rest of the week, but Marshall’s margin of victory was greater than the number of ballots that may be received. Statewide, Marshall won 158,486 votes as of Tuesday in the 11-candidate GOP primary, deflectingsuper PACs and rival campaigns thatspent millions in attacks ads. Bollier won 152,891 votes in a Democratic primary rout against an opponent, Robert Tillman, whospent less than $3,200 in the race. Marshall won every county but one west of Emporia, takingsome with an outright majority. In Sedgwick County, where Wichita is located, he trounced Kobach 47 percent to 26 percent.“If you look at that map, west of Topeka is Marshall country,” Marshallsaid. “I think we’re the favorite, but we’re going to have to have a good plan and execute it really well.”Marshall won Johnson County, thestate’s most populous, but by a narrower margin: 33% to Kobach’s 25%. He lost Wyandotte County and most other eastern counties. The weaker GOPsupport for the congressman in those areas may offer Democrats an opportunity. But many Kobachsupporters willstill likelyshow up in November to vote for Marshall. Bollier will also have to work to limit Marshall’ssupport in Sedgwick County. Chris Pumpelly, a Wichita-based Democratic consultant,said Bollier will have to follow Democratic Governor Laura Kelly’s model and invest time and resources in the Wichita area. Kelly, previously a Topekastatesenator, won the governor’s office in 2018 in part by winning Sedgwick County.“To besuccessful, Sen. Bollier has to follow the path that has already been established, investing in Sedgwick County, driving out turnout in Democratic areas and Democratic women,”said Pumpelly, who worked on Wichita Mayor Brandon Whipple’ssuccessful 2019 campaign. “I’m confident her team has the experience and wisdom to do that.”Hesaid Bollier’s message focused on the pandemic will resonate in Wichita.“I think that Wichitans, especially, are feeling a lot of the pain of what’s going on in the economy with our aviation taking a hit,” hesaid. “What Dr. Bollier needs to do isspeak in the language of authenticity … of compassion.”The Kansas Democratic Party on Wednesday previewed how it plans to attack Marshall this fall, releasing a memo labeling the race a “contest between polar opposites.” It highlights Marshall’s health care voting record and accuses him of failing to protect Kansas farmers during the USs’ trade war with China —suggesting Democrats will try to cut into Marshall’s ruralsupport. Republicans will mine Bollier’s voting record for lines of attack. Kobach told reporters before polls closed Tuesday that while Bollier will paint herself as a moderate former Republican,she has taken a “radically left” position on many issues. He called her “radically pro-abortion.”“So the task for Republicans is going to be very quickly to educate voters about her votes. It’s a very issue-based campaign, not a personal attack,” Kobachsaid. Bolliersaidshe will alwayssupport the right of people to have a private physician-patient relationship. Legislators don’t belong in that relationship,shesaid.“I also have always represented my constituents well and that’s why they kept electing me. So his word choice wouldn’t ring true,” Bolliersaid. “I have been about the majority of the people and what they’ve wanted in thestate.”Thisstory was originally publishedAugust 5, 2020, 1:02 PM.",1,1,Kansas City Star

With the runningstart, the administration hopes to finally get control over the virus, which has already taken the lives of more than 408,000 Americans. The number of deaths is expected to top 500,000 next month, Bidensai din an appearance Thursdayto unveil hisstrategic plan.""Things are going to continue to get worse before they get better,"" hesaid, calling his approach to the pandemic a ""full-scale wartime effort.""The lag between people becoming infected, developing COVID-19, andsuccumbing to the disease will keep the numbers grim for weeks to come, regardless of new efforts put in place today. But the administrationsays it is also facing challenges from inheriting the work from the previous administration. In remarks Thursday, Biden criticized the federal responseso far: ""For the past year, we could not rely on the federal government to act with the urgency and focus and coordination that we needed, and we haveseen the tragic cost of that failure.""Upon taking office,sources in the administration told CNN that they wereshocked by thestate of the federal work on the pandemic—or the lack thereof. ""There is nothing for us to rework,"" onesource told the outlet. ""We are going to have to build everything fromscratch.""Anothersource echoed that the Trump administration had no plan and that Biden is administration would have tostart from ""square one."" Upon realizing thesituation, the administration member reportedly responded: ""Wow, just further affirmation of complete incompetence.""To get control of the pandemic, Biden moved ahead with aseries of actions,signing executive orders Wednesday requiring masking and physical distancing on federal properties and organizing a White House COVID-19 response team. Thursday, he revealed 10 additional executive orders, which aim to: boost manufacturing for vaccinesupplies and equipment; reimbursestates for emergencysupplies and National Guard deployments; increase testing capacity;support the development of new therapies; boost health data collection; guideschools on how tosafely reopen; guide businesses on how to keep employeessafe; require masking on transit and negative tests from international travelers; ensure and equitable pandemic response; and restore America is leadership in public health on the globalstage. The 200-pagestrategic plan, titled ""National Strategy for the Covid-19 Response and Pandemic Preparedness,"" fleshes out all thesteps Biden has planned to tackle the pandemic. Chief among the priorities is tospeed up vaccination, which has been plagued by disorganizationsince rollout began in December. So far, the federal government has distributed nearly 38 million doses, but only17.5 million doses have gone into people is arms and only about 2.4 million people have received theirsecond dose. Biden hasset a goal of administering 100 million vaccines in his first 100 days in office. To reach that goal, Biden aims tospeed vaccine development, make the vaccine available to more people, increase the number of places people can get vaccinated, and expand the medical workforce that can administer vaccines. He has already authorized the Federal Emergency Management Agency to beginsetting up the first of many federal vaccinationsites. One of the biggest vaccination hurdlesso far appears to have been coordination betweenstates and the federal government. In his final days at the helm, former Health and Human Services Secretary, Alex Azar, laid the blamesolely onstates for the bungled rollouts. States, meanwhile, pointed fingers at the federal response. To address the problem, Biden noted in his remarks Thursday that he has directed FEMA to assign a ""COVID response liaison"" for eachstate,so that everystate will have its own federal point person to coordinate federal andstate efforts to distribute vaccine and getshots into people is arms. Meanwhile, Biden also tooksteps to rejoin the World Health Organization, retracting withdrawal notificationsent by the Trump administration. In an address Thursday, top infectious disease expertAnthony Fauci told the WHO board: ""The USsstands ready to work in partnership andsolidarity tosupport the international COVID-19 response, mitigate its impact on the world,strengthen our institutions, advance epidemic preparedness for the future, and improve the health and wellbeing of all people throughout the world.""",2,2,ARS Technica

According to the report, when Milley later asked why they wereso intent on attacking the Iranians, Pence replied: “Because they are evil.”Milley believed while Trump did not necessarily want a war, hesought a missilestrike in response to Iranian provocations against US interests in the region. The reportsaid:In the months after the election, with Trumpseemingly willing to do anything tostay in power, thesubject of Iran was repeatedly raised in White House meetings with the President, and Milley repeatedly argued against astrike. Trump did not want a war, the chairman believed, but he kept pushing for a missilestrike in response to various provocations against US interests in the region. Milley, bystatute thesenior military adviser to the President, was worried that Trump mightset in motion a full-scale conflict that was not justified.

Trump pointed to a column penned by conservative law professor John Eastman,suggesting that Harris is not eligible toserve as vice president.“I heard it today thatshe doesn’t meet the requirements, and by the way the lawyer who wrote the piece is highly qualified, very talented.”For years, Trump promoted theso-called birth er conspiracy theory aboutBarack Obama,suggesting that his predecessor was not born in the USs. The debunked theory is widely regarded as racist. Trump made the remarks about Harris just two days after the Democratic Party’s presumptive presidential nominee, Joe Biden, announced her as his running mate. In his op-ed, Eastman argued that the Californiasenator is ineligible toserve as president because her father was a Jamaican national and her mother an Indian national. Neither of the two, he argued, was a naturalized citizen at the time of Harris’ birth. Eastman pointed to the 12th Amendment and Article II of the US Constitution. He also wrote that Harris cannotserve because of the Citizenship Clause of the 14th Amendment. The law professor concluded that Harris’ background needs to be reexamined amid reports of Russian and Chinese election interference, writing that “it would be an inauspiciousstart for any campaign for the highest offices in the land to ignore the Constitution’s eligibility requirements.”Eastman wasslammed for writing the column, with critics pointing out that his views on birthright citizenship are notshared by most constitutional lawscholars. Asnoted, Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth was also vetted by Biden’s team. Although a natural-born citizen, Duckworth was not born in the USs,so Democrats reportedly feared that Trump and his allies would attack her with birth er conspiracy theories.“But with another Black nominee on the ballot, Trump is returning to his wheelhouse, questioning the citizenship of a candidate born in the USs,” the publication concluded. In their first joint press conference, Biden and Harris accusedTrumpof leaving the nation “in tatters.”The duo alsoslammed Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with Bidensaying that the commander-in-chiefspends more time golfing than addressing the unprecedented public health crisis.

The private university opened an investigation againstMark Crispin Miller, a tenured professor in the Department of Media, Culture, and Communications, after 25 faculty called on the department to respond to his “ongoing harm to ourstudents.”Their letter refers to a September incident in Miller’s class “Mass Persuasion and Propaganda.” A femalestudent, who hassince dropped out of the course, accused him of promoting right-wing conspiracy theories about COVID-19, and the department chair quickly responded that MCC was considering “nextsteps.”Miller () responded bybloggingabout the dispute, asking readers tosign a petition in favor of his academic freedom. He mentioned NYU communications to hisstudents and a department email urging him tostop teaching the course, and claimed he was acting inself-defense. The professor told that NYU Steinhardt School Dean Jack Knott told him the investigation would conclude by the end of thesemester, but gave him no other details. Miller, who hasspent more than 20 years on the NYU faculty, filed a lawsuit in New York State court November 30 after his colleagues did not retract theirstatements and apologize as he demanded. Hesharedseveral NYU communications with to illustrate his legal claims. Miller explained in a phone interview that he wasn’tsuing any of the junior professors whosigned the letter: “Whether theysigned it, willingly or not, I’msure they had no choice.”According to thesuit, Miller’s colleagues intended to “disgrace and humiliate” the professor “under the guise of phony and uninformed political and cultural correctness and orthodoxy.” He’sseeking $750,000 in damages,saying their letter led to loss of professionalstanding and the worsening of his Lyme disease. The faculty letter “takes every conceivable opportunity to cast me in a bad light,” Miller told. He alsosaid in aseparate email that the charges from his colleagues are “so false as toseem downright psychotic.”:Judge tells NYU it can’t punishstudents for breaking after-the-fact COVID rulesIf Miller is a right-wing conspiracy theorist, he’s an unconventional one. The professor isn ame don Turning Point USA’s Professor Watchlist, which identifies faculty who allegedly promote “leftist propaganda in the classroom.”He also helped lead a movement in 2012 to halt NYU’s redevelopment plans for the Greenwich Village campus. The resulting lawsuitsuccessfully challenged nearly half of the university’s expansion plan, though Miller told the experience also convinced him not tosue NYU itself this time. Politically, Miller considers himself a leftist: “I’m anti-war, I believe in empowering the working class, cutting back corporate power – I could go on and on.” Hesaid progressive luminariessuch as Robert F Kennedy Jr. and Oliver Stonesigned his petition, and Ralph Nader provided aseparatestatement ofsupport. The Chinese dissident Chen Guangcheng, who publicly accused NYUof forcing him out of a fellowship because of pressure from Beijing, alsosigned Miller’s petition, the professorsaid.:NYU declines to testify in Congress about its China campusBut Miller also believes the left has “changed radically over the years. I don’t really recognize it anymore.” The left today wants “censorship and government authority to be accepted without question—except if it’s Trump,” hesaid. Some of the professor’s colleagues have long despised him for his course content and extramuralstatements onsubjects including the Sandy Hook massacre and transgender ideology. But a civil liberties group told NYU that Miller’s alleged conduct is expressly protected by its own policies, and cited court rulings against private universities including New York City’s Fordham. One group is not weighing in on the dispute: the American Association of University Professors. A representative told in an email that AAUP’s department of academic freedom and tenure confirmed “we haven’t been involved with this case,” and declined to comment further. Student Julia Jackson tagged NYU in at weet threadSept. 20 to complain that Miller had “spent an entire class period tellingstudents that wearing masks doesn’t prevent thespread of COVID-19.” She also claimed that hesaid “hydroxychloroquine trials were made to failso more people would be given the vaccine and have their DNA changed.”She linked to articles and videosshared by Miller, including atwo–partinterview of Canadian physicist Denis Rancourt on One America News Network (), describing them as conspiratorial and “far-right.”Jacksoncalled onNYU to “relieve him” of educating and advisingstudents. MCC Chair Rodney Benson thanked her for reporting the issue andsaid the department had “made this a priority.”MillerrespondedOctober 6 on his News From Underground blog, explaining that his pedagogicalstyle is to teachstudents how to identify propaganda drives andseek out alternative claims. He urged hisstudents to readstudies that conclude masks and ventilators are ineffective at preventing transmission of the novel coronavirus andsaving lives, “with due attention to thescientific reviews thereof.” Miller cited “possible financial links between” researchers and interestssuch as “Big Pharma and the Gates Foundation.”The blog post embedded Jackson’s tweet thread and mentioned a Sept. 21 email to Miller’sstudents from Knott and Carlo Ciotoli, who leads NYU’s COVID-19 Prevention and Response Team.:Miller’sstudent tries to get him firedMiller provided with this email (below), which hesaid astudent forwarded to him. Prefaced by the claim that NYU has the “utmost respect for the principles of academic freedom,” it referredstudents to “the most authoritative public health guidance” – CDCrecommendations.“The evidence backs it up,” the email continued, linkingsources. “And we remind you that wearing a mask is required at NYU.” The NYU leaderssaid “we do not feel we have a choice” in pushing back on Miller’s alleged comments. Millersaid he didn’t tellstudents to break the university’s mask mandate, which he actively observes – a point emphasized in his lawsuit. The blog post alleged that NYU had urged Miller to cancel his propaganda course because it would be “better for the department” if he instead chose to teach twosections on cinema. (Miller toldSunday that the quoted phrase was from an emailsent by the department’s administrative assistant, while a later phone call with Benson, the MCC chair, claimed the change would be better for enrollment.)It linked to ape titi onto back Miller’s cause, which as of Monday night has beensigned by more than 20,000 people. Miller told last week that the blind Chinese lawyer Guangcheng, who memorably escaped house arrest in China, was among them. Guangchengclaimedto have been forced out by NYU following “great, unrelenting pressure” from Chinese communists, at a time when the university was building a campus in Shanghai. NYUstated that Guangcheng’sstay was based on a one-year fellowship and that his claims were “both false and contradicted by the well-established facts,” including that the foreign campus was approved to be built before the dissident’s arrival at NYU The October 21 faculty letter to Steinhardt Dean Knott and Provost Katherine Fleming criticized the views that “Miller has espoused on his highly visible website” over the years. While it doesn’tsay what is “highly visible” about Miller’s blog, the letter complains that “he prominently displays his title as a full tenured professor in our department.”Miller has characterized “transgendersurgery as a eugenic form ofsterilization,” mocked transgender people and denied “the Sandy Hook elementaryschoolshooting,” they alleged. While Miller has a right to his views, his colleagues object to “discrimination, attacks againststudents and others in our community, or advocacy for an unsafe learning environment.” Students have complained about his discussion of controversial viewpoints and “non-evidence based arguments” for years, yet frequent complaints to bias review offices and administrators have not “improved” thesituation. (The letter does not mention anyspecific complaints.)Miller’s post that linked Jackson’s public tweets opened an opportunity for “cyberbullying and threatening communication directed toward thestudent,” which “subsequently occurred and continues,” the letter claimed. I hope@nyuniversity,@nyusteinhardt, and@mccNYUagree that this professorshould not be trusted with educating and advisingstudents, and I hope they take immediatesteps to relieve him of these duties. 8/— Julia Jackson (@julia_jacks)September 21, 2020:Cornell vaccine mandate only applies to whitestudentsIt called for an “expedited review” of Miller’s “intimidation tactics, abuses of authority, aggressions and microaggressions, and explicit hatespeech,” to be followed by “whatever further disciplinary measures are deemed appropriate.”In an email provided by Miller, Dean Knott told the professor October 29 that an investigation had been opened that day. “I will ask Vice Dean for Faculty Affairs LaRue Allen to begin this review immediately” and decide, based on the collected information, whether to proceed “with nextsteps as outlined in the Faculty Handbook,” Knott wrote. Miller conveyed hisshock at receiving the email in a Thursday phone call with. “I was completelysurprised that he hadn’t talked to me first,” hesaid. In a Zoom meeting requested by Miller, Knottsaid that NYU “lawyers and provost told him that they had to” investigate. Knott wouldn’t give him thescope of the investigation except that “they would talk to people,” according to Miller. “And Isaid what people? And hesaid, faculty andstudents. And Isaid, what faculty? None of them haveseen me teach. And hesaid: well yeah,so thestudents.”Miller then told the dean that he wouldsolicit andsend testimonials from current and formerstudents, “maybe 40 letters”so far that “make abundantly clear that there is not ashred of truth” in the colleagues’ letter. He excerptedseveral in his blog post. A few days after this meeting, Miller confronted his colleagues’ charges in are buttal heshared with. He called “nearly all” their claims “demonstrably untrue,” and the letter “misleading in its various insinuations.” Miller did not launch an email campaign against the department, as they claimed, but rather highlighted “NYU’s violation of my academic freedom.”Miller reiterated his public assertion that hesimply encouragedstudents to read “scientificstudies—eight randomized, controlled trials, conducted among health professionals over the last 15 years orso—finding that masks are ineffective against transmission of respiratory viruses.”On Sunday he pointed to his Sept. 5essay“Masking Ourselves to Death” forsources:researchfrom Rancourt, the Canadian physicist, as well asJoshua Jacobs,BJ Cowling,Faisal bin-Reza,Jeffrey Smith,Vittoria Offeddu,Lewis RadonovichandYoulin Long. The essay mentions the two-part interview with Rancourt and a debate he had with “another COVID-19 dissident,” physician Joseph Mercola, whose videos “have been banned on YouTube and Spotifysince mid-June.” Miller also provided al ink to Mercola’s website pertaining to the censorship. Miller emphasized that he “very clearly” toldstudents that he was “telling you not to wear masks,” butsimply engaging in an intellectual exercise. Responding to the email from Knott and Ciotoli, he noted the CDC guidelines “that you regard as gospel truth abruptly changed in early April.” Previously they had “echoed the consensus of the [randomized controlled trials] that I encouraged mystudents to examine.”It is “wholly false” that he “attacked” Jackson, when in fact “thestudent attacked, on Twitter, demanding that NYU fire me.” She didn’tspeak up during that class and did not “bother reading any of thosestudies,” he claimed. “How, and where, and when,I‘attacked’ her your letter fails tospecify—as it could not, because I never did.”NYU professor who questions COVID orthodoxy demands colleagues retract false claims about himbyThe College Fixon Scribd:Stanford lock downskeptic disinvited from academic conferenceBy publicly writing under her own name, Jackson tweets “provoked attacks by others, which had nothing to do with me,” Miller continued, adding that he had receivedsimilar attacksspurred by Jackson’s tweets. (While he mentioned “three media hit-pieces” against him, Miller did not identify the articles.)He only identified Jackson by name once, in the petition defending himself, toshow thatshe demanded his firing. “To cast me as the aggressor in this case is as perverse as your accusing me of having attacked” the department, hesaid. His website does not have “asingle mention of Sandy Hook” and he only mentioned theschool massacre in a class discussion on gun control. Miller recommended “some troublingly compellingscholarship on Sandy Hook” tostudents, because “we cannotsimply rule out any argument that deviates from the officialstory.” (He exemptedspeculation about child-sex-slave colonies on Mars, whichsaid wasshared by a guest on theAlex Jones Show.)Regarding the alleged transgender mockery, Millersaid the university “quickly exculpated” him fromsecondhand claims by a colleague, defendant Nicole Starosielski, based on “three brief online writings.”His writing on thesubject is “highly critical of transgender” because of its “troubling real-world consequences” insports and prisons and the “radical medical intervention in thesexual development of children.” The ideology has also been aggressively promoted throughout the corporate media with the backing of “multibillionaires with large investments in Big Pharma,” which might have “eugenic purposes.”Miller cited his own “pleasant” email exchange with a transgender colleague at NYU Though this personsigned the letter against him, he understands “whyshe may have felt obliged” tosign it. The professorsaid he could make his own allegations about a “hostile work environment” going back “some time, but especially thissemester,” citing comments fromstudents about faculty disparaging him. The Foundation for Individual Rights in Education told NYU President Andrew Hamilton in a November 13letterthat the university’s ownstated commitment to academic freedom meant it must end the investigation into Miller. The civil liberties group noted a New York court ruled in 2019 thatFordham violated its contractual commitments by refusing to recognize a chapter of Students for Justice in Palestine. In a 2018 case closely paralleling the factual allegations in Miller’s dispute, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled thatMarquette University could not punish a professor’s extramural expressions because of its contractual promises on academic freedom. NYU did not respond toque ries on how its Miller investigation was any different from the rulings cited by FIRE When the university ignored FIRE’s November 20 deadline to respond, the group publicly condemnedNYU’s investigation. Aspokesperson for the civil liberties group told last week that NYU hasstill not responded. Miller has long been a bee in NYU’s bonnet. He’s one ofseveral named plaintiffs in an ongoing class actionsuit against its “mismanagement of our retirement funds,” he told. Havingseen the university’s lawyers in action, Millersaid they are “extraordinarily aggressive when it comes to legal action.”He’s moresurprised by criticism from colleagues – “people whom I did everything I could toserve in trying to halt the real estate plan” and protecting pension funds. Some of them “wrote letters of recommendation” when Miller was “nominated for a distinguished teaching award in 2012.”He emphasized that “I’m notsaying this to brag. I’msaying this to demonstrate how egregious this attack is.” Only one faculty member – untenured, from the School of Professional Studies – went to bat for him. Miller is the one person “above all” that the instructor recommends to herstudents,she wrote to President Hamilton and Provost Fleming December 6. (Miller removed the colleague’s name from the email heshowed.):Trump advisor blasts Stanford colleagues forshutting down COVID-19 debateHis propaganda course is the “best” to makestudents “critical thinkers, a person who can question mass delusions whether they bescientific or political.” She compared Miller to Galileo and Copernicus, who were “condemned for exploring unpopular truths.”The colleague asked rhetorically, whether “Christopher Columbus was a hero or whether masks do prevent thespread of a virus, don’t we want to encourage one and all to look at all the material out there?”Miller told he doesn’t attribute the hostility to his political views, but rather to the “discomfiture” his work causes colleagues. He closelystudies “official narratives to determine whether they are true or false and to try to figure out what purpose theyserve and what interests are behind them.”The political right doesn’t have a monopoly on critiquing the “echo chambers” of academia, hesaid: “I think it’s also possible to make thesame critique from a left-perspective.”Millerseessomethingsimilar occurring with the COVID-19 pandemic. “Just for urging thestudy on thescientific literature on masking as a barrier against respiratory viruses is like a high crime now; that’s killing grandma.”:Profsays anti-maskerssupport whitesupremacy, policy brutalityIMAGE: Renegade Inc./YouTubeLikeon Facebook/Follow us on Twitter",1,1,The College Fix
319,Legal scholars 'perplexed' by Pelosi is push against Trump is nuclear codes,-3.0,44.0,https://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2021/jan/8/legal-scholars-perplexed-by-pelosis-push-against-t/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-08,23,"Legal experts arescratching their heads about House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s push to prevent President Trump from having the nuclear codes,saying it would curtail the chain of command. In a letter to her Democratic colleagues on Thursday, the California Democratsaidshespoke to the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley about keeping an “unstable president from initiating military hostilities or accessing the launch codes and ordering a nuclearstrike.”“Thesituation of this unhinged President could not be more dangerous, and we must do everything that we can to protect the American people from his unbalanced assault on our country and our democracy,” Ms. Pelosi wrote. But lawyers noted that unless Mr. Trump was incapacitated under the 25th Amendment or removed from office through impeachment, it would be legally problematic for the commander-in-chief not to be in control of the nuclear codes. Military officers could not bar Mr. Trump from exercising his Article II authority, according to Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University.“I know of no authority by which the nuclear codes can be withheld from the President absent a declaration under Section 4 of the 25th Amendment. Absentsuch a declaration, a denial ofsuch access would be grounds for the removal of any military officer. Thesame is true for the exercise of other executive privileges and powers,” Mr. Turleysaid. Similarly, Ilya Shapiro, the publisher of the Cato Institute’s Supreme Court Review, found Ms. Pelosi’sstatement to present legal trouble unlessshe does pursue impeachment, whichshe has hinted could come next week.“It’s definitely a problem. Until and unless the president is removed, either through the 25th Amendment or impeachment, he remains the commander-in-chief. Given Pelosi’sstatement, eithershe’s proceeding with impeachment orshe’ssetting a dangerous precedent for disrupting the civilian chain of command,” Mr. Shapirosaid. Democrats have been pushing for Mr. Trump to be impeached asecond time, arguing that he incited hissupporters to break into the Capitol in a violent riot that ended with multiple people dead. They argue the presidentshould never be able toserve in office again, and an impeachment would be a path to ensuring that bar isset. If a president is impeached in the House and convicted by the Senate, the upper chamber then holds asecond vote to bar the individual fromserving in higher office again. It would require 67senators to accomplish their goal. Ms. Pelosi alsosaid in her letter thatshe asked Vice President Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment to remove Mr. Trump, whoshesaid is unstable to continue toserve. She warned if Mr. Pence does not take action, they could move forward in Congress to hold Mr. Trump responsible for the actions of hissupporters following aspeech he delivered from the White House on Wednesday — just prior to the violence breaking out on Capitol Hill.“If the President does not leave office imminently and willingly, the Congress will proceed with our action,” Ms. Pelosi wrote. Mr. Trump has been telling his voters the 2020 election wasstolen due to alleged fraud. Election officials fromseveralswingstates have dismissed the claims. Ms. Pelosi’s chamber impeached Mr. Trump over a call with the Ukrainian president in late 2018, and the Senate held a trial early last year. The Republican controlled chamber did not vote to remove him at that time. Copyright © 2024 The Washington Times, LLC Click here for reprint permission.

Master Sgt. Brian K Tolliver, 46, died in Largo, Florida, after testing positive for COVID-19 on July 10, according to an Army Reserve Medical Command press release.“We feel a tremendous loss in our military family with the passing of Master Sgt. Tolliver,”said the command’s ranking officer, Maj. Gen. Jonathan Woodson, in an emailedstatement. “COVID-19 has taken a dedicatedsoldier from our formation, and our thoughts and prayers go out to his family.”Tolliver, who is from Memphis, Tennessee, was admitted to the Largo Medical Center the day after he tested positive and he remained there until the time of his death, the command’s releasestated. As of Thursday morning, there have been a total of 34,584 COVID-19 cases amongservice members, with 11,915 of those in the Army,accordingto Pentagon data. More than 19,000service members have recovered from the illnessso far. The Defense Department does not break out those numbers tospecify whether those troops are active duty or reservists. Tolliverserved in the Army for 25 years, more than a decade of which wasspent in the reserve component. In his last assignment, Tolliverserved as the command paralegal for Army Reserve Medical Command in Pinellas Park, Florida. He issurvived by his three children, who reside in Louisville, Kentucky.“Master Sgt. Tolliver was a tremendous mentor, leader,soldier, and one of the finest human beings I have ever met,”said Lt. Col. T Scott Randall, the deceasedsoldier’s immediatesupervisor. “He will besorely missed by all.”Four of the military’s five deaths have beensoldiers from the Army’s reserve components. ANew Jersey National Guard captain died of the illness in March at the age of 57. Then in April, a 41-year-oldNavy chief aboard the aircraft carrier Theodore Rooseveltdied. A34-year-old Illinois-based Army Reservesoldier died in May, and a61-year-old Army reservist died earlier this August. The Army Reservesuspended in-person drill in March andshifted to virtual formations and instruction whenever possible, according to a policy memo. The Pentagon’s figuresshow that there have been a total of 75 deaths among DoD personnel, with 47 among civilian employees,seven among dependents, 16 among contractors and the five among uniformedservice members. The infection rate in the military has been roughly on par with that of the general US population, but the rates of hospitalization and death are much lower, likely due to the younger demographics within theservice branches. Fewer than 2 percent of military cases have required hospitalization, and the death rate is 0.0001 percent, compared to 3 percent nationwide, Military Timesreportedin early August.

Doug Joneswas already facing an uphill climb. In order to have a chance at reelection, Alabama’s Democratic incumbent didn’t just need to win in thestate’s most populous counties. He needed to run up thescore. Instead, GOP challenger Tommy Tuberville did well in the cities andsuburbs, winning eight of the 10 largest counties in thestate on his way to a 20 point win. He flipped four of those large counties back to GOP Jones wonsix of the 10 largest counties in 2017, including two of the top three. In 2017, Jones carried Madison County, home of Huntsville in north Alabama, and Mobile County on the coast. In thatspecial election, Jones won around 57 percent of the vote in each of those counties. On Tuesday he lost both. Out of the 10 largest counties in Alabama, only Jefferson and Montgomerystuck with Jones.[Can’tsee the map?Click here.]And while Jones did win in Jefferson County - the most populous in thestate and and his home county - hesignificantly under performed there compared to 2017. This year he edged Tuberville in Jefferson with 54 percent of the vote. In 2017, Jones earned a whopping 68 percent of the vote in Jefferson, in a year where turnout was very low. Jones also won Montgomery on Tuesday, part of the traditionally Democratic Black Belt and the fourth largest county in Alabama. He performed well throughout the Black Belt, which other than Montgomery issparsely populated. Jones pulled 67 percent of the vote in Montgomery, but that wasstill asmaller victory than he earned in 2017, when he won Montgomery with 72 percent. Tuberville also flipped Lee County, home to Auburn, and Tuscaloosa County, both of which Jones carried in 2017. In fact, Tuesday’s resultshows just how much of an anomaly the 2017special election was.

Some leftists are repeating their old trope that they are merely anti-Zionist, not full-blown Jew-haters no different from the Klan or other low-class dirtbags. For appearances isake, most are payingsome kind of lipservice to condemning this apparently organized Hamas thuggery appearingsuddenly on ourshores, even as they continue to claim with forked tongues that Israel is the problem. Joe Biden, though, is the exception. He has notsaid a damn thing. Hestill remains AWOL as Jews are hunted down and assaulted in hate crimes, raising questions, at least in my mind, as to whether Hamas hassomething on him. He issaid nothing. His Twitter feed is a wasteland and his White Housesite issilent. 'Silent Joe' is his way with this one, and it is not a compliment. Biden can reliably be counted upon to condemn other hate crimes and perceived transgressions -- he condemned anti-Asian hate crimes, for one, and of course, calls any incident involving a blacksuspect and a white cop  isystemic racism,' which makes hissilence in the case of thisshocking wave of attacks all the more remarkable. It is certainly been noticed in any case. According to Ben Samuels, writing inHa'aretz:The Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Committee, Hadassah: The Women is Zionist Organization of America, Jewish Federations of North America, and the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America wrote Biden on Friday highlighting aspike in reported violent incidents targeting Jews in the US and abroad, as well as onsocial media. TheADLsaid Thursdayit wasseeing ""a dangerous and drasticsurge in anti-Jewish hate"" after the outbreak of renewed hostilities between Hamas and Israel, ""from London to Los Angeles, from France to Florida, in big cities like New York and insmall towns, and across everysocial media platform.""The organizations call onBidento call out antisemitism, telling him to ""harness the authority of the Presidency and the USs Government tospeak out loudly and clearly against antisemitism.""According to AJ Kaufman, writing atThe Lid:While many wonder whetherIran-backed Hamaswill oblige [on a cease fire with Israel after itstarted its rocket attacks], we also wonder why President Joe Biden has not been more outspoken, not only insupporting our chief ally in the Middle East, Israel but in condemning violence against Jews in America. Each year,FBIstatsshowJews are overwhelmingly the victims of more anti-religious “hate crimes” than any eth no religious group. And these numbers continue in May,ironically Jewish American Heritage Month. Joe may be AWOL on the border, but he is even more AWOL on this. As with the border meltdown, hissilencesuggests consent. Biden issilence is most likely due to his innate cowardice and his consummate political considerations. According to New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin, as president, heshifts like a weather vane to the political winds. He hides, he appears, he calls a lid, but the bottom line is, he is concerned only about one thing politically: Keeping the far left wing of his party ever loyal to him as his political footsoldiers. That is where the biggest Jew-haters roost. Start with the far-left Squadside of things. Writing in theNew York Post, Goodwin believes there was a weird turning point in Joe is behavior around this priority of his:A defining moment came last Tuesday when Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian woman elected to Congress, confronted Biden at the Detroit airport and argued American aid to Israel was funding atrocities against Palestinians. The tarmac face-off lasted eight minutes, and Biden later lavished praise on Tlaib’s “passion and concern forso many people.” Presumably, her concern doesn’t include the Jews Hamas vows to eliminate. The irony here is that while even full-blown Jew-haterssuch as Tlaib and Reps. Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pay lipservice to condemning anti-Semitic attacks, as I wrote abouthereyesterday, Joe will not condemn even those. There is more than the Squad, though, in the mind of Joe -- there is also the Democratic Party is black congressional leaders and activists, who have embraced the likes of Louis Farrakhan and the Rev. Al Sharpton, two notorious anti-Semites, as if they represent all black voters, and are ineffably tied to the mast of the Democrat party. After aspate of anti-Semitic attacks by black extremists in 2019, I noted thishere. Why is that? [Why are these attacks happening?] Because Democrats have been coddling black anti-Semites for years. Where is the Democratic condemnation for race huckster Rev. Al Sharpton, who is also a notorious anti-Semite with a long record of incitement of violence against Jews? Right there in the berth of the Democratic Party,stillsupposedly representing the black ""middle class.""Where is the Democrats' condemnation for Louis Farrakhan, whose animating breath is all about anti-Semitism? Hobnobbing with Democrats in photos, appearing with Bill Clinton at Aretha Franklin is funeral, and tweeting ""sweetheart"" dreck with fellow anti-Semite, Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar. Where, for that matter, is the Democratic condemnation of Rep. Ilhan Omar is anti-Semitism? They could not pass asimple resolution against her in the House after herstring of whoppers. They were too afraid to lay a hand on her, despite her long record of anti-Semiticstatements. It is coddling all right, and you can bet the more aggressivestreet predator class of black cultists,such as ""Black Hebrew Israelites"" a known anti-Semitic black group, and Jew-haters in the boroughs noticed the pattern, took note, and launched their reign of terror. Still no recognition of the problem from Democrats, though. They prefer to call it the bad deeds of individuals and then let them off lightly. That is a recipe of worse to come. In Joe is mind, though, it is best to keep these moral zeros happyso they will deliver the black vote for Joe. This, despite, or maybe because of, President Trump is heavy inroads on winning over the black vote to Republicans in 2020. Elections are going to be tough for Democrats going forward,so Joe is going all in on following the Sharpton way and keeping Calypso Louie content, both creeps laughing up theirsleeves at him, in the interest of using their political muscle to perpetuate his own political power. This is more than justspeculation. Sharpton, for one, visited the Obama White House with Joe Biden thesitting vice president72 times, according to leftist PolitiFact, and according to Wisconsin GOP Congressman Glenn Grothman, and former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, it was probably a higher figure. Whatever the number of times, it was a big number with a bottom at 72, obviously underlining to Old Joe that political power for Democrats depends on the love of Jew-hating Al Sharpton. Obama taught Biden everything he knows and probably continues toserve as ashadow president. This is a vile dynamic, no two ways about it. Biden is keepingsilent for a reason and the multiplying nests of anti-Semitism within his own party amount to a vehicle for him. He thereforestayssilent as raw anti-Semitism rears its ugly head and pogrom-like violencespirals across the US, expecting reliably Democrat-voting Jews to let it go, and expecting the whole thing to go away. It will not. Image:Gage Skidmore, via Flickr//CC BY-SA 2.0To comment, you can find the MeWe post for this articlehere.

According to Ben Samuels, writing inHa'aretz:The Anti-Defamation League, American Jewish Committee, Hadassah: The Women is Zionist Organization of America, Jewish Federations of North America, and the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America wrote Biden on Friday highlighting aspike in reported violent incidents targeting Jews in the US and abroad, as well as onsocial media. TheADLsaid Thursdayit wasseeing ""a dangerous and drasticsurge in anti-Jewish hate"" after the outbreak of renewed hostilities between Hamas and Israel, ""from London to Los Angeles, from France to Florida, in big cities like New York and insmall towns, and across everysocial media platform.""According to AJ Kaufman, writing atThe Lid:While many wonder whetherIran-backed Hamaswill oblige [on a cease fire with Israel after itstarted its rocket attacks], we also wonder why President Joe Biden has not been more outspoken, not only insupporting our chief ally in the Middle East, Israel but in condemning violence against Jews in America. Each year,FBIstatsshowJews are overwhelmingly the victims of more anti-religious “hate crimes” than any eth no religious group. And these numbers continue in May,ironically Jewish American Heritage Month. Joe may be AWOL on the border, but he is even more AWOL on this. As with the border meltdown, hissilencesuggests consent. Biden issilence is most likely due to his innate cowardice and his consummate political considerations. According to New York Post columnist Michael Goodwin, as president, heshifts like a weather vane to the political winds. He hides, he appears, he calls a lid, but the bottom line is, he is concerned only about one thing politically: Keeping the far left wing of his party ever loyal to him as his political footsoldiers. That is where the biggest Jew-haters roost. Start with the far-left Squadside of things. Writing in theNew York Post, Goodwin believes there was a weird turning point in Joe is behavior around this priority of his:A defining moment came last Tuesday when Michigan Rep. Rashida Tlaib, the first Palestinian woman elected to Congress, confronted Biden at the Detroit airport and argued American aid to Israel was funding atrocities against Palestinians. The tarmac face-off lasted eight minutes, and Biden later lavished praise on Tlaib’s “passion and concern forso many people.” Presumably, her concern doesn’t include the Jews Hamas vows to eliminate. The irony here is that while even full-blown Jew-haterssuch as Tlaib and Reps. Ilhan Omar and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez pay lipservice to condemning anti-Semitic attacks, as I wrote abouthereyesterday, Joe will not condemn even those. There is more than the Squad, though, in the mind of Joe -- there is also the Democratic Party is black congressional leaders and activists, who have embraced the likes of Louis Farrakhan and the Rev. Al Sharpton, two notorious anti-Semites, as if they represent all black voters, and are ineffably tied to the mast of the Democrat party. After aspate of anti-Semitic attacks by black extremists in 2019, I noted thishere. Why is that? [Why are these attacks happening?] Because Democrats have been coddling black anti-Semites for years. Where is the Democratic condemnation for race huckster Rev. Al Sharpton, who is also a notorious anti-Semite with a long record of incitement of violence against Jews? Right there in the berth of the Democratic Party,stillsupposedly representing the black ""middle class.""Where is the Democrats' condemnation for Louis Farrakhan, whose animating breath is all about anti-Semitism? Hobnobbing with Democrats in photos, appearing with Bill Clinton at Aretha Franklin is funeral, and tweeting ""sweetheart"" dreck with fellow anti-Semite, Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar. Where, for that matter, is the Democratic condemnation of Rep. Ilhan Omar is anti-Semitism? They could not pass asimple resolution against her in the House after herstring of whoppers. They were too afraid to lay a hand on her, despite her long record of anti-Semiticstatements. It is coddling all right, and you can bet the more aggressivestreet predator class of black cultists,such as ""Black Hebrew Israelites"" a known anti-Semitic black group, and Jew-haters in the boroughs noticed the pattern, took note, and launched their reign of terror. Still no recognition of the problem from Democrats, though. They prefer to call it the bad deeds of individuals and then let them off lightly. That is a recipe of worse to come. In Joe is mind, though, it is best to keep these moral zeros happyso they will deliver the black vote for Joe. This, despite, or maybe because of, President Trump is heavy inroads on winning over the black vote to Republicans in 2020. Elections are going to be tough for Democrats going forward,so Joe is going all in on following the Sharpton way and keeping Calypso Louie content, both creeps laughing up theirsleeves at him, in the interest of using their political muscle to perpetuate his own political power. This is more than justspeculation. Sharpton, for one, visited the Obama White House with Joe Biden thesitting vice president72 times, according to leftist PolitiFact, and according to Wisconsin GOP Congressman Glenn Grothman, and former Mayor of New York Rudy Giuliani, it was probably a higher figure. Whatever the number of times, it was a big number with a bottom at 72, obviously underlining to Old Joe that political power for Democrats depends on the love of Jew-hating Al Sharpton. Obama taught Biden everything he knows and probably continues toserve as ashadow president. This is a vile dynamic, no two ways about it. Biden is keepingsilent for a reason and the multiplying nests of anti-Semitism within his own party amount to a vehicle for him. He thereforestayssilent as raw anti-Semitism rears its ugly head and pogrom-like violencespirals across the US, expecting reliably Democrat-voting Jews to let it go, and expecting the whole thing to go away. It will not. To comment, you can find the MeWe post for this articlehere.",0,0,American Thinker
324,Tucker Carlson Raises a Very Serious Alarm Bell About Ashli Babbitt is Murder and the Enemy Within,21.67,22.0,https://redstate.com/brandon_morse/2021/06/16/tucker-carlson-raises-a-very-serious-alarm-bell-about-ashli-babbitts-murder-and-the-enemy-within-n397591,https://adfontesmedia.com/redstate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-16,21,"President Joe Biden wassworn in on January 20, but it’s January 6 thatstands out in the minds of many that truly marks the beginning of the Biden era. Yes, Trump wasstill technically president but we’restill waiting on answers that we have yet to get about what happened that day. The Biden administrationseems to have no interest in releasing information about it, but the more private entities look into the matter, the more oddities arise. One, in particular, is the murder of Ashli Babbitt. Babbitt was part of the riot within the Capitol and wasshot while unarmed. At the time of this writing, westill have no idea who it is thatshot her or why he decided to fire on her in particular. It’s just one of the many questions the Biden administration is actively not giving us answers to. Aspreviously covered by Nick Arama, Fox News host Tucker Carlson had a verysolid point to make about this fact and one that he’s actively being mocked for bringing up, whichshould worry you even more. Carlson began by discussing how the Biden administration has declared that the largest threat to America isn’t China, Russia, Iran, our poroussouthern border, or even leftist extremists attempting to de fund the police and burn our neighborhoods down. No, theysay that it’s whitesupremacist assaid by Attorney General Merrick Garland. It’s a very nebulous term. Who are these whitesupremacist radicals? Why won’t the Biden administration name names? Forsome reason, the administration is withholding that information, but it’s likely that they don’t know either. What they do know is that it’s a good narrative crop to harvest thanks to the January 6 riot at the capitol, a riot the left continues to try to call an “insurrection.”With this event in place, they can now create whitesupremacist boogie men that can take the form of any person they need it to, including you. It also allows them to come up withsolutions thatsound just as nebulous to the public but gives them the freedom to do whatever they want. “We must adopt a broadersocietal response to tackle the problem’s deeper roots,”said Garlandsomewhat ominously. As Carlson points out, this is ascary thought as it marks a change in the way the government treats its citizens,specifically ones that don’t agree with the administration. A government can arrest and imprison or even kill a citizen, like Babbitt with no accountability or explanation as Carlson points out:Who didshoot Ashli Babbitt? Why don’t we know? Are anonymous federal agents now allowed to kill unarmed women who protest the regime? That’s OK now? No, it’s not ok. It will never be ok. And why are all those January 6th protestersstill in prison on trespassing charges, whileso many Biden voters who torched federal buildings are walking free? What’s the answer to that question? If that happened in Russia, we rightly call itscary. We’d call Putin a dictator. In fact, we do call him a dictator. Andspeaking ofJanuary 6th, why are therestillso many things, basic factual matters, we don’t know about that day? Why is the Biden administration preventing us from knowing? Why is the administration hiding more than 10,000 hours ofsurveillance tape from the US Capitol? What could possibly be the reason for that? Even as they call for more openness. We need to get to the bottom of it. They could release those tapes today, but they’re not. Why?#ThreadMust Watch Tucker Carlson Segment On Revolver News is Piece About January 6th: Unindicted Co-Conspirators In January 6th Cases Raise Disturbing Questions Of Federal Foreknowledgepic.twitter.com/wzxwsPU0dE— The Columbia Bugle 🇺🇸 (@ColumbiaBugle)June 16, 2021Carlson goes on to make a much deeper point about the possible involvement of the FBI in the January 6 riot, which is another article, but for the moment, focusing on this one fact issomething we as a country really need to do. Was Babbitt wrong tostorm the Capitol? Sure. Didshe deserve to die for it?If the footage of hershooting is any indication, then no. She was unarmed and whileshe was attempting to advance into the Capitolshe could have easily been detained or pushed back by authorities as they had been doing in other places. Instead,she wasshot, and regardless of the apparent reason, no matter how obvious, when an American isshot on Americansoil by American agents an investigation is warranted and answers need to be given to the American people. Why is the government withholding that info? Moreover, what makes them think they can withhold it? What gives them the gumption to believe they don’t owe us answers? Are we now living in a country where killing citizens is justsomething our government can do if they’re protesting at the wrong place and at the wrong time? Do they not feel like they need to justify it?Meanwhile, as Carlson points out, why do the people who tout their narrative get to roam free despite the damage they do all over the country, including the Capitol city? Why not point out the fact that there were many racialsupremacists in those riots that lean toward the black race? Why can they burn, loot, and assault withslaps on the wrist?There are far more victims of the Black Lives Matter and Antifa riots than there were victims of the Capitol riot. Is the fear and inconvenience politicians experienced far more egregious than the actual loss of livelihood and even life that American citizens experienced at the hands of leftist riots? Why do we need to know the most minute detail about officers whoshoot black people but get absolute obscurity when theyshootsomeone from a different crowd?It’s questions we need to ask and definitely questions the Biden administration needs to answer. In fact, they need to have these answers ready before we ask them. Yet, they’re not providing answers. What they’re providing are narratives and reasons to dissuade from asking questions. “This was a whitesupremacist riot” they repeat ad nauseum with little to no proof that it was, making questioning their narrative a defense of whitesupremacists. No nuance. No context. No questions. Our government has gotten too full of itself. Itsees itself above us. It kills us and tells us questioning why makes us morally bankrupt. They think their own accountability isn’t necessary and if you vote them out they’llspend ungodly amounts of time and resources attempting to correct your mistake with lies that allow for excuses for the impeachment of not only a man but also your vote. Our government is out of control. We’re losing the Republic we were advised to keep and the unanswered for murder of Ashli Babbitt is astrong indicator of how far we’ve fallen from it.",0,0,RedState
325,Did you hear US plans to require vaccine passports? Not true,-3.17,46.67,https://www.oregonlive.com/coronavirus/2021/04/did-you-hear-us-plans-to-require-vaccine-passports-not-true.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/oregonian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-10,25,"The Associated Press checks outsome of the most popular but completely untruestories and visuals of the week. This one is bogus, even though it wasshared widely onsocial media. Here are the facts:CLAIM:The federal government wants to require Americans to present a health passport or vaccine certificate “on demand,” including for domestic travel. THE FACTS:The US government has no plans to requireso-called vaccine passports to travel domestically, or for any other purpose. While private businesses are considering vaccine passports for certain activities, Biden administration officials havesaid the federal government will not mandate vaccine passports. A vaccine passport is documentation thatshows a person has been vaccinated against the novel coronavirus or recently tested negative. The information will be in the form of ascannable code that can bestored on asmart phone or printed out. During a press conference on Tuesday, Press Secretary Jen Psakisaid that the Biden administration is “not now nor will we besupporting asystem that requires Americans to carry a credential. There will be no federal vaccinations database and no federal mandate requiring everyone to obtain asingle vaccination credential.”But posts circulating onsocial media are falsely implying that vaccine passports will be mandatory in the US, including for domestic travel. “President Biden and the Democrats want to force Americans to present a ‘vaccine passport’ upon demand, yet they oppose presenting an ID to cast a vote,” reads a tweet by South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster. A Facebook post claims: “So, now, I will need a Health Passport to travel IN America, but Illegals don’t need any kind of Passport to enter INTO America!”Such claims are “patently false,” according to Lawrence O Gostin, a professor, and director of the O’Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.“There are no plans in the US to introduce a vaccine passport for domestic travel,” Gostinsaid to the AP in an email. “Neither the government nor the US airline industry have announced any plans for requiring proof of vaccination as a condition of interstate travel.”Gostin explained that foreign carriers were discussing a voluntary COVID vaccine passportsystem, but it did not include US carriers yet. In the US, only onestate has rolled out a vaccine passport. New York introduced an app through a limited government partnership with a private company. People canshow proof of vaccination or a negative test with an app to enter places like entertainment venues. Lawmakers in a handful ofstates, including Pennsylvania, are trying to ban vaccine passports. Last week, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis also issued an executive order banning businesses from requiring customers toshow proof they got theshot. The Facebook post’s claim that people without legalstatus in the US are allowed to enter without documentation is also misleading. Those trying to enter the US mustshow proof they are an American citizen or documentsshowing they have permission to enter the country, otherwise they are placed in expedited removal proceedings and face deportation. The law does allow those without documents who have a credible fear of returning to their home country to enter and apply for asylum.",2,2,The Oregonian
326,What Are Debris Flows and Why Are They Dangerous?,0.0,47.33,https://weather.com/news/news/2021-10-22-debris-flow-threat-california-rain,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-24,25,"A​ newer version of this article appearshere. California is bracing for dangerous and potentially deadly landslides in the coming days, as much-needed rain moves in amid historic drought conditions. Terrain left barren by wildfires is most vulnerable to an especially dangerous and fast-moving type of landslide thatscientists call ""debris flows."" Known less formally as mudslides, these flows are typically triggered byshort, intense rainstorms and cansend a wall of water,soil, ash, vegetation, rocks and other debris careening downhill,sweeping away or burying everything in its path.""A debris flow is kind of a flood onsteroids,"" Jason Kean, a debris flow expert with the US Geological Survey, told weather.com in an interview. ""It’s all bulked up with rocks, mud, even boulders – and boulders can be thesize of cars.""Latest Forecast for Western Storms)The threat of landslides usually increases in the fall as wetter weather typicallystarts to move across the West Coast. A parade ofstorms forecast into next week has parts of both California and Oregon on alert for debris flows. The USGS and other agencies work together to assess the debris flow threat in burnscars each year. So far they have completed assessments for about 60 fires in nine westernstates. The public can read themhere. Among the areas of highest concern in California this year are the Dixie, Monument and Alisal fire burn footprints, Jaime Kostelnik, also a geologist on the assessment team, told weather.com in a recent interview. In Oregon, areas with high risk include parts of the Devils Knob, Jack and Bootleg burn areas. But any burnscar can potentially be at risk, and conditions can change over time depending on the weather and other factors. The cumulative effects of extreme wildfires in recent years make thesituation even more hazardous, especially in California. Many of the areas impacted by wildfires have burned more than once in recent years. Besides destroying vegetation that would normally holdsoil and debris in place, wildfires change certain characteristics of thesoil itself. It becomes less likely to absorb water, which creates conditions ripe for flash flooding and debris flows, according to Kean and Kostelnik.""As (the water) runs off, it picks up all these loosesoil particles that no longer have vegetation to hold them in place and then it bulks up into that debris flow that can move really fast andstart actually within minutes of intense rainfall,""said Kean. Debris can rush down a hillside at a rate over 35 mph and then flatten out andspread even farther when it reaches the bottom of aslope. California Faces Third Year of Extreme Drought)At least 20 people were killed when mudslides with walls of debris as tall as 30 feetstruck the Santa Barbara County community of Montecitoin 2018. On average, 25 to 50 people are killed by landslides every year in the USs, according to the USGS This week, emergency crews worked to prepare areasscarred by the Alisal Fire before the wet weather moved in. That included installing barriers to keep mud and debris from washing over roadways, the Santa Barbara News-Press reported. Storm prep was also underway along the Caldor Fire burnscar in Sacramento, where work included placing fallen trees across bulldozer lines to holdsoil in place.“The heavy predicted rains this week has us concerned, but we are going toke ep working as long as we can,” Paul Naman, aservice repairsupervisor at thesite, told KOVR-TV The elevated risk of debris flows in a burnscar can last up to five years after a fire. Officials in Santa Cruz County, for example, are warning people who live in the area of the 2018 CZU Complex Fire to be on alert for debris flow danger. The threat for California as a whole will increase as the rainyseason moves in, usually at its peak from November through February.""California has a distinct wetseason that lasts from late fall into earlyspring, and a dryseason with little to no rainfall from latespring to early fall,""said weather.com meteorologistChris Dolce. ""That extreme variance is related to an area of high pressure thatsets up off the West Coast insummer and prevents anysignificant moisture from reaching thestate. Conversely, in winter, that high weakens andshifts farthersouth, which opens the door for Pacificstorms to affect California with heavy rain and mountainsnow.""Thestate is in the clutches of a historic two-year drought. While the rain in the coming days will bringsome relief, it remains to beseen how wet this year is winter will be. And expertssay it could take years to catch up from the precipitation deficit. Wildfire danger, meanwhile, peaks in the fall because that is when vegetation is completely dried out prior to the arrival of the firstsignificant Pacificstorms of theseason, Dolcesaid. Research has linked California is progressively more extreme fireseasons to climate change, and astudy published last year by the University of California Institute of Transportation Studies found that the risk of post-wildfire debris flows is also likely to go up. Expertssay people in areas under threatshould be alert if any rain develops, and do not wait for an evacuation order to leave if heavy rains develop.""Theyshould take itseriously,"" Kostelniksaid.",2,2,The Weather Channel

The US center of power became ascene of outright chaos Wednesday assupporters made their way past barricades, broke in through windows andsent representatives into hiding during asession of debate over election certification. The assault on the Capitol cameshortly after a rally for the president, who continued to levy baseless claims that the election was rigged and told the crowd they would ""never concede,""USA Today reported. The actions of the crowd were “inexcusable” and crimes, US Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan Matthew Schneider told the Detroit Free Press.“There is a difference, a big difference, between peaceful protests and expressing your freedoms,”said Schneider, who was appointed to his post by Trump.“This is not it. The violent protesters are committing crimes, and they have tostop right now and this is not what our Constitution protects.”Depending on what investigators find and individual circumstances, charges could range from everything from low-level curfew charges, to trespassing, to the misdemeanor of destruction of government property less than $1,000, depending on the cost of the windows and anything else, hesaid. There could be a felony charge of destruction of government property over $1,000, depending on what was damaged, which is punishable by up to 10 years in prison, hesaid. Electoral counting resumes after police retake Capitol from pro-Trump rioters; womanshot and killed; Twitter locks out TrumpMichigan lawmakers hunkered down as rioters breached US CapitolOn the high end, charges of civil disorder, interfering with law enforcement, or inciting a riot could all be possible, up toseditious conspiracy — a federal charge punishable by up to 20 years in prison, hesaid. That latter chargeseemed most appealing to two professors of Western Michigan University’s Cooley Law School. It reads:“If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any placesubject to the jurisdiction of the USs, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the USs, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the USs, or by force toseize, take, or possess any property of the USs contrary to the authority thereof, theyshall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.""The phrase “delay the execution of the law” is key, and what wasseen fromsome of the Trumpsupporters Wednesday,said Devin Schindler, a law professor who once clerked for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals.“For at leastsome of these protesters, particularly the ones that broke into the Capitol, I think there is an extraordinarilystrong case that they used force to delay, to hinder, the execution of our laws governing the election and how electoral votes are counted,” hesaid. “Itseems fairly clear to me, based on what we areseeing, that folks are in fact, almost textbook violating thisseditious conspiracystatute by using force to interfere with lawful government activity.""Though people on Twitter were levying the term “treason,” he and Schneider both agreed the charge didn’t quite fit with what is known, because treason requires the involvement of enemies to the US Retired Brig. Gen. Michael McDaniel, associate dean for the Western Michigan University-Cooley Law School, too, pointed tosedition as a key possible charge in the case, after possible lesser charges. He alsosaid the defense might be difficult; First Amendment protections aren’t in play once a break-in occurs. The idea of “sedition” has changed, hesaid, pointing to the version President John Adams used against his political opponents. It’s been narrowed by the courts in the present day. He also raised concern for a different federal charge of rebellion or insurrection, which could carry asentence of 10 years in prison, and Trump’swords at the rally earlier in the day.“Remember it is got to be ‘against the authority of the USs,’” hesaid, using the language of the law. “So a really interesting question to pose to my lawstudents later on this week is whether or not the president isspeech … was inciting them to violence against the authority of the government of the USs.”Depending on that answer, given the president’s role, another impeachment would perhaps be more appropriate than a charge, hesaid. There likely won’t be any court action quickly on the events of the day, Michael Traugott, a professor emeritus of communicationstudies and politicalscience and research professor emeritus at the Center for Political Studies at the University of Michigan,said. There will be jurisdiction issues, even among which agencies will be doing investigations. Michigan leaders renounce US Capitol riot: 'This is happening because of lies'Trump repeated lies about Michigan is election before pro-Trumpsupportersstormed CapitolSchneider, too,said investigations could take weeks, butsaidsome people could be charged Wednesday evening. But it’s not the first time the idea for ""seditious conspiracy"" has been raised in the last year. The US government looked to theseditious conspiracy charge amid the violence ofsummer protests, Schneidersaid. Looking back historically, he also recalled another timeshots rang out at the Capitol, in 1954. Five House lawmakers wereshot and wounded then by members of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, which argued for the island’s independence, who wereshooting from the gallery above the chamber,USA Today reported. A different time, a gunman on the first floor of the building also killed two Capitol police officers in 1998, and a former Capitol officer firedshots at asenator in 1947 as he entered thesubway tunnel linking the Capitol to Senate offices, USA Today reported. However, Traugottsaid the nearest precedent to what happened Wednesday can be found back in the Civil War. But even then, the Capitol itself wasn’tstormed.""The action of the mob in Washington, incited by President Trump, is an unprecedented affront to the peaceful transfer of power on which our democracy is based,” hesaid. “It is aseditious act unlike anythingsince the Civil War.“There have been individual acts, like Oklahoma City, but nothing like this. It’s pretty directly attributable to one person (Trump).”The actions of the mob created a “tear in our civil and political fabric (that) will be difficult to repair,” hesaid. People need to know the punishments,so they go home and things don’t get even worse,said Schneider.“Weshould all be able to disagree peacefully,” hesaid. “That is one of the most disturbing things to me is that we are, on bothsides of the aisle, everyone is taking these disagreements to the extreme interestshould not be that way,” hesaid. Considering the historical context, Schindler thought back to the burning of the Capitol during the War of 1812, butstill thought the 2020stormingstood out.“This kind of violence within the Capitol is extraordinarily rare,” hesaid. There’ssome examples back in the pre-Civil War era or the Civil War era or congressman fights,” hesaid. “There wassome …shootings in the Capitol, but tosee this level of violence directed towards the lawful exercise of government is unheard of.”",2,2,Detroit Free Press

329,We Officially Know What Trump Will Be Doing Instead of Attending the White House Correspondents' Dinner and It is an Insult to Reporters,-20.0,27.67,https://secondnexus.com/news/trump-rally-whcd-green-bay-rally/,https://adfontesmedia.com/second-nexus-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"Donald Trump is taking ashot at the press again, this time byscheduling a MAGA rally thesame night as the White House Correspondents' Dinner for the third year in a row. The White House Correspondents' Dinner honors members of the White House Correspondents' Association, an organization of journalists who cover the White House and the President of the USs. It is been a traditionsince 1921, and—until Trump is presidency—was usually attended by the President and the Vice President. Trump vowed earlier this month toskip the dinner and hold a rally.""We are going to hold a very positive rally,"" Trumpsaid, describing the Correspondents' Dinner as ""boring and negative.""""Everybody wants it. It’ll be a big one, but the Correspondents’ Dinner is too negative. I like positive things. Okay?""Now, Trump is reelection campaign has announced that the rally will be held in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Holding the rally thesame day as the White House Correspondents' Dinner is a two-partsnub: not only is Trump openly bucking a decades-old tradition, he is creating asituation in which many members of the press corps being honored at the dinner will have toskip it in order to cover the rally. This is the third year in a row Trump hasskipped the dinner, which often features a ""roast"" of the president and his administration. Last year is dinner included comedian Michelle Wolf, whose jokes pointedly mocked Trump and his administration, including attendee Sarah Huckabee Sanders. Wolfalso tookshots at the White House press corps themselves, calling them out for profiting from their obsessive coverage of the President. ""He has helped yousell your papers and your books and your TV,"" Wolfsaid.

330,Off-Duty Pilot Said to Save 737 on Its Next-to-Last Flight,0.0,50.35,http://time.com/5554684/boeing-737-lion-air-pilot-saved-flight/,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-20,25,"As the Lion Air crew fought to control their diving Boeing Co. 737 Max 8, they got help from an unexpectedsource: an off-duty pilot who happened to be riding in the cockpit. That extra pilot, who wasseated in the cockpit jumpseat, correctly diagnosed the problem and told the crew how to disable a malfunctioning flight-controlsystem andsave the plane, according to two people familiar with Indonesia’s investigation. The next day, under command of a different crew facing what investigatorssaid was an identical malfunction, the jetliner crashed into the Java Sea killing all 189 aboard. The previously undisclosed detail on the earlier Lion Air flight represents a new clue in the mystery of howsome 737 Max pilots faced with the malfunction have been able to avert disaster while the others lost control of their planes and crashed. The presence of a third pilot in the cockpit wasn’t contained in Indonesia’s National Transportation Safety Committee’s November 28 report on the crash and hasn’t previously been reported. Theso-called dead-head pilot on the earlier flight from Bali to Jakarta told the crew to cut power to the motor driving the nose down, according to the people familiar, part of a checklist that all pilots are required to memorize.“All the data and information that we have on the flight and the aircraft have beensubmitted to the Indonesian NTSC We can’t provide additional comment at thisstage due the ongoing investigation on the accident,” Lion Airspokesman Danang Prihantorosaid by phone. The Indonesiasafety committee reportsaid the plane had had multiple failures on previous flights and hadn’t been properly repaired. Representatives for Boeing and the Indonesiansafety committee declined to comment on the earlier flight. Thesafetysystem, designed to keep planes from climbing toosteeply andstalling, has come underscrutiny by investigators of the crash as well as asubsequent one less than five months later in Ethiopia. A malfunctioningsensor is believed to have tricked the Lion Air plane’s computers into thinking it needed to automatically bring the nose down to avoid astall. Boeing’s 737 Max was grounded March 13 by US regulators aftersimilarities to the October 29 Lion Air crash emerged in the investigation of the March 10 crash of Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302. In the wake of the two accidents, questions have emerged about how Boeing’s design of the new 737 model were approved. The Transportation Department’s inspector general is conducting a review of how the plane was certified to fly and a grand jury under the US Justice Department is alsoseeking records in a possible criminal probe of the plane’s certification. The FAA last weeksaid it planned to mandate changes in thesystem to make it less likely to activate when there is no emergency. The agency and Boeingsaid they are also going to require additional training and references to it in flight manuals.“We will fully cooperate in the review in the Department of Transportation’s audit,” Boeingspokesman Charles Bickerssaid in an email. The company has declined to comment on the criminal probe. After the Lion Air crash, two US pilots’ unionssaid the potential risks of thesystem, known as the Maneuvering Characteristics Augmentation System, or MCAS, hadn’t beensufficientlyspelled out in their manuals or training. None of the documentation for the Max aircraft included an explanation, the union leaderssaid.“We don’t like that we weren’t notified,’’ Jon Weaks, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association,said in November. “It makes us question, ‘Is that everything, guys?’ I would hope there are no moresurprises out there.’’The Allied Pilots Association union at American Airlines Group Inc. alsosaid details about thesystem weren’t included in the documentation about the plane. Following the Lion Air crash, the FAA required Boeing to notify airlines about thesystem and Boeingsent a bulletin to all customers flying the Max reminding them how to disable it in an emergency. Authorities have released few details about Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 other than it flew a “verysimilar” track as the Lion Air planes and then dovesharply into the ground. There have been no reports of maintenance issues with the Ethiopian Airlines plane before its crash. If thesame issue is also found to have helped bring down Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302, one of the most vexing questions crash investigators and aviationsafety consultants are asking is why the pilots on that flight didn’t perform the checklist that disables thesystem.“After this horrific Lion Air accident, you’d think that everyone flying this airplane would know that’s how you turn this off,”said Steve Wallace, the former director of the US Federal Aviation Administration’s accident investigation branch. The combination of factors required to bring down a plane in these circumstancessuggests other issues may also have occurred in the Ethiopia crash,said Jeffrey Guzzetti, who also directed accident investigations at FAA and is now a consultant.“It’ssimply implausible that this MCAS deficiency by itself can down a modern jetliner with a trained crew,” Guzzettisaid. MCAS is driven by asinglesensor near the nose that measures theso-called angle of attack, or whether air is flowing parallel to the length of the fuselage or at an angle. On the Lion Air flights, the angle-of-attacksensor had failed and wassending erroneous readings indicating the plane’s nose was pointed dangerously upward.

331,What happens if Trump refuses to concede the election to Joe Biden?,-5.1,44.2,https://www.syracuse.com/politics/2020/11/what-happens-if-trump-refuses-to-concede-the-election-to-joe-biden.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/syracuse-post-standard-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-09,25,"What happens if President Donald Trump refuses to concede the election? Every major news outlet projected Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential race on Saturday, with 290 electoral votes to Trump’s 214; Biden also won the popular vote by 4.5 million votes (and counting). Trump has repeatedly claimed voter fraud without providing any evidence and filed lawsuits over mail-in ballots in battlegroundstates like Pennsylvania and Michigan. But his attempted legal challenges, and recounts instates like Wisconsin and Georgia, are not expected to change the overall outcome. Biden claimed victory Saturday and vowed to be a president for all Americans beginning January 20, on Inauguration Day. The president-elect has also already begun making moves to get his administrationstarted, announcing a coronavirus advisory board on Monday -- thesame day Ben Carson, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, tested positive for Covid-19. Other leaders, including former Presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton,George W Bushand Jimmy Carter, have all recognized and congratulated Biden as thesoon-to-be 46th president of the USs. Bush, the last Republican to hold the nation’s highest office before Trump,said Sunday that “this election was fundamentally fair, its integrity will be upheld, and its outcome is clear.”Yet Trump’s teamstill has notstarted the transition process to ensure asmooth transfer of power to Biden. The Associated Press reports the General Services Administration, tasked with formally recognizing Biden as president-elect, has notstarted the process and has given no guidance on when it will begin. What happens if Inauguration Day rolls around and Trump isstill refusing to leave the White House? Dosquatter’s rights apply at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue?The 20th Amendment to the US Constitution is clear: “The terms of the President and Vice Presidentshall end at noon on the 20th day of January, and the terms of theirsuccessorsshall then begin.”Voxnotes that Trump could (andshould) follow tradition and attend Biden’s inauguration, much like how Biden, Obama and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton did in 2016. But if Trump opts tostay in the White House until Biden issworn in, Biden has the right to order the Secret Service to physically remove Trump like any other trespasser.“... The USs government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House,” Biden’s campaignsaidFriday. But don’t expect Trump to be dragged out of the building like WikiLeaks founderJulian Assangewas from the Ecuadorian embassy last year.“There will be an orderly transition just as there has been every four yearssince 1792,” Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell vowed inSeptember. Gen. Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also promised to keep the military out of any election disputes.“This isn’t the first time thatsomeone hassuggested that there might be a contested election,” he toldNPR. “And if there is, it’ll be handled appropriately by the courts and by the US Congress. There’s no role for the US military in determining the outcome of a US election. Zero. There is no role there.”December 8 is the deadline for resolving election disputes, including recounts and court contests, at thestate level. The Electoral College formally votes December 14, and then Congress counts the electoral votes on January 6, two weeks before Inauguration Day. The New York Postnotes that if the election issomehowstill in dispute, things could get complicated: Somestates could deliver twosets of electoral votes and Vice President Mike Pence, whoserves as president of the Senate, could opt to throw out bothsets of votes from thosestates. If neither candidate has 270 electoral votes, then Congress would vote for president and vice president; the House of Representatives would need a majority by 26 votes to choose a president and the Senate would need at least 51 votes to determine the VP In that unlikelyscenario, if the Senatesomehow chooses a vice president but the House doesn’t pick a president, the vice president-electserves as president until all is resolved. If neither body of Congress cansuccessfully vote by Inauguration Day, then the presidential line ofsuccession takes effect and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) wouldserve as president until a new president is chosen. ButABC Newsnotes no presidential candidate in modern history has ever refused to concede. Even Al Gore conceded to Bush in 2000 after a recount in Florida ended 36 days of uncertainty.“I accept the finality of the outcome, which will be ratified next Monday in the Electoral College,” Goresaid. “And tonight, for thesake of our unity as a people and thestrength of our democracy, I offer my concession.”But will it take Trump longer than Gore to admit defeat?The White House has not indicated Trump plans to concede — “That word is not even in our vocabulary right now,” campaign manager Jason Millersaid Monday onFox Business— and Vice President Pencesaid Monday the race “AIN’t over” yet.“Told @VP Team Today: ‘It ain’t over til it’s over .. And this AIN’T over.!’ @RealDonaldTrump has neverstopped fighting for us and we’re gonna Keep Fighting until every LEGAL vote is counted,” Pence’s official Twitter accountsaid Monday. Trump also repeated a number of dubious claims about results in Nevada, Wisconsin and Georgia on Monday.“The threshold identification of Ballots is turning out to be even bigger than originally anticipated. A very large number of Ballots are impacted. Stay tuned!” Trump tweeted. Told@VPTeam Today, “it ain’t over til it’s over.. and this AIN’T over!” President@realDonaldTrumphas neverstopped fighting for us and we’re gonna Keep Fighting until every LEGAL vote is counted! 🇺🇸The threshold identification of Ballots is turning out to be even bigger than originally anticipated.

You can read portions of thesequence of tweetshereorhere. This may be Lanny is way of venting Democrat frustration. Despite every dirty trick the left has employed, Trump isstill president and may continue to be through 2024. Okay, if you red-state rubes will not kneel before us, we will pick up oursocialist toys and create a country of our own!To be clear, this is not a threat of civil war. It is more like a family law attorney telling the unappreciated wife whatshe can expect out of the divorce. For example, Davis claims that the new country will get the followingstates:Hawaii, Oregon, California, New Mexico, Washington, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Michigan, Illinois, and all the Northeast ... including Puerto Rico, the US Virgin Islands, Guam, and Washington DC He then claims that his new country will also get the following:We get the vast majority of the majorshipping ports ...

Intel, Apple, and Microsoft...85 percent of America is venture capital and entrepreneurs ... 90 percent of the high tech industry, most of the US low-sulfur coal ...

Oh, and you can have all the new COVID-19 casessince you are too dumb andself-centered to wear masks. Nice, Lanny. Tell us how you really feel. Clearly, Mr. Davis did notstudy geography while in college. There areseveral major ocean ports in thesoutheastern and gulfstates from Norfolk, Virginia to Corpus Christi, Texas, including Charleston, Miami, New Orleans, and Houston. Isort of get his point about Costco, Starbucks, Boeing, Intel, Apple, and Microsoft, due to the location of their corporate offices, but they and the rest of the high-tech industry are not rooted in the ground. I amsure all of them will want to continue doing business with red-state America, and considering how bluestates like to raise taxes, many of these businesses may decide they are better off moving to a redstate. In fact, this is already happening. Tesla, among others, is movingsome of its operations from California to Texas mainly because of taxes. Seriously, dude, the best beaches? Ever heard of Florida?Hate to lose the Statue of Liberty and Yosemite. Maybe the liberals will let all of us deplorables comesee them. Sorry to lose Cal Tech and MIT, too. Lanny, you can keep Hollywood and all of the arrogant posturing actors who think pretending to besomeone else makes them experts on politics, the attitudes and religious morals of the working class, the Second Amendment, and climate change. You can also keep the Ivy League and all of the other elitist college training centers for the theory and practice ofsocialism. Oh, and once we get readily available vaccines, the whole mask controversy will die out. The one major flaw in Mr. Davis is plan is thatstate boundaries are not absolute and inviolable. They are political in nature and can be changed. During the last episode ofsecession in 1863, thestate of Virginia was divided along political lines. The eastern part, old Virginia, remained Confederate until the end of the war, and the western part became West Virginia, a Unionstate. Thissamescenario will present itself if bluestates decide tosecede. Many bluestates are already highly polarized politically between the liberal cities and the conservative rural areas. Illinois, for example, has one massive liberal city, Chicago. The rest of thestate, which is roughly four times larger in terms of area, is fairly conservative. I cannot imagine rural Illinois would be willing to follow liberal Chicago out of the Union, no matter how thestate Legislature votes. Illinois is not the only one. Would the rural areas of Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania blindly follow the lead of Detroit, Milwaukee, Minneapolis, and Philadelphia? What about upstate New York and New York City, California east of the Sierra Nevada mountains versus the western coastal cities of Los Angeles and San Francisco,southern New Jersey outside the Philadelphiasprawl? The list goes on. If we follow the Virginia–West Virginia precedent, there could be anywhere from three to as many as ten new redstates created if blue-statesecession occurred. This would leave theseceded bluestates a lotsmaller than Mr. Davis originally envisioned, perhaps thesize ofseveral counties each. Redstates would be left with most of the farmable land, plus most of the energy and other natural resources. Still, this may be thesolution to a lot of our problems. Blue-statesecession willsolve the issues of who runs the majority of the country; if the government is going tosocialist or more traditional center-right; and the ongoing political fights over abortion, policing, immigration, and most of the more recent appointments to the Supreme Court. Many countries have broken apart in the past thirty years. The Soviet Union, Yugoslavia, and Czechoslovakia allseparated intosmaller countries, and there areseparatist movements in other places,such as Spain and Belgium. Even Britain has devolvedsome of the central government is power to Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Wales. Willsecession occur in the US? Unlikely. The bluestates would get a lot more trouble and a lot fewer benefits than they expect. If it does happen, I am perfectly willing to let our blue-state brethren leave, just as long as we do not end up with a Chinese military air base at LAX and a Russian air base at LaGuardia.

Appalling? Yes. But what else do you expect from the woman who has made herself a popular fixture on cable news with her willingness to jettison professional ethics and declare the president mentally unstable?Former Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale is in the hospital. He threatened to harm himself this weekend at his home in Fort Lauderdale, Florida,according to law enforcement officials.“Brad Parscale is a member of our family, and we all love him. We are ready tosupport him and his family in any way possible,” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaughsaid in astatement. Self-harm isserious. Suicide isserious. Someoneshould tell that to Lee.“Here is anotherside effect of continuing with a mentally impaired leader,”the Yale University psychiatry professorsaid in reaction to the Parscale news. “It will attract mental impairment, augment mental illness (in bothsupporters and opponents), and cause disorder to reverberate throughsociety.”Later, aftersocial media users alerted Lee to the obscenity of her attack,she added, “The messages I receive from Trumpsupporters give a good measure. They went from normal: ‘How could you do this to our president?’ To more disturbed: ‘Dems are diabolical demons, and wretched, vile, inhumane Communists like you made a deal with the Devil’ (my last message).”Ah, yes. So, those angry at her manipulative use of Parscale’s reported breakdown are the real issue. Lee’s behaviorshould notshock you. She proved long ago thatshe is unethical and callous when it comes to her area of expertise.

335,"Israel’s Military, Made in the USA",-16.33,39.0,https://www.thenation.com/article/world/israel-military-united-states/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-21,25,"Israel’s latest attack on Gaza—with a death toll of over 200 Palestiniansso far, including more than 60 children—has once again raised the question of the US role in enabling Israeli killings of civilians. But while it is well-known that the USs is a major aidsupplier to Israel, the degree to which the Israeli military relies on US planes, bombs, and missiles is not fully appreciated. According tostatistics compiled by the Center for International Policy’s Security Assistance Monitor, the USs has provided Israel with $63 billion insecurity aid over the past two decades, over 90 percent of it from the State Department’s Foreign Military Financing (FMF) program, a grant program that provides funds to buy US weaponry. But USsupport of the Israelistate goes back much further—total US military and economic aid to Israel exceeds $236 billion (in inflation-adjusted, 2018 dollars)since its founding—nearly a quarter of a trillion dollars. Not only has US financialsupport helped Israel outfit its military, but it has been used tosubsidize Israel’s development of its own military industry, which produces, among other things, armed drones that have been used for attacks on targets in Gaza. The Israeli Air Force (IAF) is a case in point. According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), Israel has 324 fighter and ground attack aircraft, all of US origin: 83 Boeing F-15s, 224 Lockheed Martin F-16s, and 16 Lockheed Martin F-35s. So, ifsomeone asks whether US-supplied planes have been involved in bombing Gaza, it doesn’t require a research project to answer with an emphatic yes. Israel also possesses US attack helicopters, transport planes, precision-guided bombs, and air-to-surface missiles. And US aid powers the IAF, providing billions of dollars’ worth of fuel under the government-to-government Foreign Military Sales (FMS) program. Despite Israeli conduct, the aidspigot remains wide open. Israel is in the third year of a 10-year, $38 billion aid memorandum of understanding negotiated under the Obama-Biden administration. The USs does not make any comparable written agreement regarding a decade-long future financial commitment for foreign or domestic appropriations. And earlier this month, on May 5, Congress was notified of a planned $735 million deal for precision-guided bombs destined for Israel. Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY), Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.), and Mark Pocan (D-Wis.) have introduced a resolution of disapproval to try tostop thesale, and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has introduced a parallel measure in the Senate, the first timesuch astep has been taken with respect to an arms transfer to Israel. From its bombing of Beirut during its 1982 invasion of Lebanon to December 2008’s Operation Cast Lead, which resulted in the deaths of at least 1,383 Palestinians in Gaza, including 333 children, Israeli has largely escaped consequences for its misuse of US weaponry to harm and kill civilians on a largescale. That may be changing. The recent generalstrike by millions of Palestinians that was reinforced by large demonstrations across the USs is just the latest manifestation of years of organizing by Palestinians and their allies to change US policy towards Israel. Organizations like the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights, Jewish Voice for Peace, and the Adalah Justice Project, who have long been calling for a cutoff of US military aid to Israel, have been joined by allies throughout the broader US progressive movement, including the Movement for Black Lives, which hasstated, “The fight for Palestinian rights and dignity is integral to the fight for human rights everywhere” and demanded that “the US divest the $3.8 billion of public dollars that goes to Israel in military funding each year.” Human Rights Watch recently released a groundbreaking report that asserted thatsome of Israel’s actions in the Occupied Palestinian Territories led to “deprivations [that] aresosevere that they amount to crimes against humanity of apartheid and persecution.” And last month, the prominent centrist think tank the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace issued a report calling for a “rights-based approach” to US policy on Israel/Palestine that “would prioritize protecting the rights and humansecurity of Palestinians and Israelis.” The political landscape in Congress is beginning to change as well. There’sstill plenty of uncriticalsupport for Israel on Capitol Hill, but the ground isshifting. One used to have to look far and wide for vocalsupport for Palestinian rights in the House or Senate, but on May 14 a group of House members—including Democratic Representatives Tlaib, Omar, Ocasio-Cortez, Pocan, Cori Bush, and Ayanna Pressley—took to the floor of the chamber to make a plea for the Biden administration to recognize the basic humanity of the Palestinians and to press harder for Israel tostop the killing. In asearingspeech, Tlaibsaid, “We can’t have an honest conversation about American militarysupport for the Israeli government without acknowledging that for Palestinians the catastrophe of displacement and dehumanization has been ongoing in their homelandsince 1948.… We must condition aid to Israel on compliance with international human rights and end the apartheid.” And Senator Sanders  took to the pages of The New York Times to call for “an evenhanded approach, one that upholds andstrengthens international law regarding the protection of civilians, as well as existing US law holding that the provision of US military aid must not enable human rights abuses.” Even enforcing existing US human rights laws with respect to Israel’s use of US weaponry could go a long way toward ending impunity in the use of US armaments. Perhaps the greatestsign of progress in Congress comes from the new bill by Representative Betty McCollum (D-Minn.), which prohibits the use of US funds to enable violations of international and human rights law. The bill, which has 18 cosponsors, will face an uphill battle in Congress, but hills are made for climbing, and as public pressure for accountability over Israel’s use of military aid grows,so willsupport for the legislation. In McCollum’s words, “Now is the time tosend a clear message to the Israeli government: Not one dollar more of US military aid can be used to demolish Palestinian homes, annex Palestinian lands, and torture or kill Palestinian children.” As of late yesterday, the Israeli government and Hamas had announced a mutual cease-fire in Gaza, a goal the Biden administration had pressed in private conversations with Benjamin Netanyahu and other Israeli officials. Hopefully the cease-fire will hold, but it is far from the only issue raised by the US arming of the Israeli military. On the whole, the Biden administration has been far too quiet in the face of ongoing Israeli atrocities. Itshould use the leverage provided by US aid to Israel to press forcefully for an end to the repression throughout Israel and the occupied territories, and to hold the Israeli government accountable for what Amnesty International hassuggested may be war crimes committed in Gaza.",1,1,The Nation

In just one week, the Democratic governor has faced multiple allegations of inappropriate conduct and workplacesexual harassment, including accusations from two former aides. Lindsey Boylan whoserved in thestate’s economic development agency andserved in Cuomo’s administration from 2015 until 2018,published an essay detailing aseries of disturbing interactions with the governor. The allegations included an instance whenshesaid Cuomosuggested they “playstrip poker,” and that had once allegedly kissed her on the lips without her consent. Cuomo has denied those allegations. Charlotte Bennett, another former aide, detailed aseries of uncomfortable encounters with her former boss to The New York Times, including alleged overtures for asexual relationship while alone in hisstate Capitol office last June. A third woman, who does notshare work history with Cuomo, alleged unsolicited touching at a wedding in 2019. Cuomo, for his part, hasspent much of the week trying to distance his actions fromsome of the more egregious types of behavior that have cast ashadow in the wake of the MeToo movement. Cuomo maintained during his first public briefingsince the two additional women came forward that he had never “touched anyone inappropriately.”“The governor’s press conference was full of falsehoods and inaccurate information, and New Yorkers deserve better,” Bennett’s harassment lawyer, Debra Katz, told the Times. In aCBS News interview Thursday evening, Bennettsaid thatshe perceived the governor’s allegedsexual overtures as indication that hesaw himself as “untouchable.”Cuomo’s dominant presence in New York politics, and the accusations of a third-term governor wielding power forself-interested ends and being beyond the grasp of accountability comes as the New York legislature moved tostrip Cuomo of the emergency pandemic powers this week. State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins (D) last monthsaid it was time to restore “checks and balances” for the governor, who had enjoyed additional emergency powers to drive a quick pandemic responsesince lastspring. The move gets ahead of the expiration of the powersset for April 30. Stewart-Cousins had alsoseparately weighed in on New York Attorney General Letitia James’ investigation into thesexual misconduct allegations,saying during a CNN interview this week: “If the investigationshows thatsomething inappropriate did happen, I think he would have to resign.”She elaborated on those comments in a Thursday interview with local networkSpectrum Newswhen asked at what point the governor would lose hersupport: “Any further people coming forward, I would think it would be time for him to resign.”Cuomo on Wednesday expressed contrition,saying he was both “embarrassed” and had “learned an important lesson.”“I do not believe that I have ever done anything in my public career that I am ashamed of,” hesaid, adding that he felt “badly” his words had caused discomfort. But even after Cuomo rebuffed calls for his resignation, he was further battered by another report that landed late Thursday. The Times revealed an effort bysome of the governor’ssenior aides to rewrite a report on COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes, likely as part of a broader effort to preserve the image of the long-serving governor, whose missteps amid the pandemic have increasingly come underscrutiny. A final version of the report concealed astaggering number of nursing home deaths occurring until June, as the Cuomo administration publicly cited a figure that was roughly 50 percent lower than the one identified bystate health department officials. While Cuomo has previously attributed efforts to withhold true accounting of the total death toll of nursing home residents to concerns that the Trump administration would launch a politically-motivated inquiry, the Times’ reportshows evidence of the masking effort far before the arrival of federal requests for the data. Cuomo will face aseparate investigation overseen by thestate attorney general regarding nursing home deaths.",1,1,Talking Points Memo

Harris and Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden have criticized President Donald Trump on veterans' issues in recent weeks. During a September ""veterans roundtable,"" Biden criticized Trump for ignoring ""the bounty on the heads of Americans in Afghanistan,"" referencing aslew of June reports that claimed Russia bribed the Taliban to kill USservicemen.

343,Talkin’ ’bout a Starcity revolution – The San Francisco Examiner,0.0,42.0,https://www.sfexaminer.com/news-columnists/talkin-bout-a-starcity-revolution/,https://adfontesmedia.com/sf-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-29,19,". Not to go all “you kids get off of my lawn!” at you, but has anyone else noticed that lately it’s not enough to have a good idea; the idea has to “change the way we live and work!” Even a bad idea, like COVID, changes the way we live and work. In fact, everysingle technological upgrade,since the first time a caveman rubbed twosticks together, has arguably changed the way we live and work. Every upgrade is going to change our lives, and we eat it up. Bring the change. It’s always for the better, right?But not every new idea can deliver on this, can it?Of course not, butsomeone in the real estate world really is trying to change the way we live and work. In a world ofsound and fury, often indicating nothing, Starcity, a co-living outfit with properties in San Francisco, Los Angeles and Barcelona (!),stands apart from the myriad would-be change agents. If they can pull off their plans for the next two years, they will indeed change the way many people live and work — but are these changes for the better?Up to now Starcity has been a prettystandard co-living provider, offering furnished rooms in rehabbed homes in San Francisco and other cities. They charge residents a membership fee which covers rent, utilities, internet and common area upkeep/perks. They’re basicallystreamlined, upscale boarding houses, temporary in nature (memberships can range from three to 15 months), tailor-made for newly-arrived white-collar workers. But this wasn’t enough for Starcity. They’re taking a hugeswing next year, and it could result in, in a world of would-be game-changers, an actual game-changer — for aspecific type of San Franciscan. Atsome point in 2021, Starcity willstart construction on a project at 457 Minna StreetWhen it’s completed, Starcity Minna will be a 15-story, 270-unit co-living monster, built in modular fashion to keep down costs but festooned with all manner of upscale (and, let’s admit it, youthful) perks: an eventspace, a bike repair andstorage area, a massive rooftop deck. Each level will consist of 18 en-suite units, a “chef’s kitchen,” a dining area that, per online drawings, will double as a laptop-strewn workspace, a media area and a lounge (more laptops). It is a dream come true for a certain type of renter. I’m just notsure Starcity is ready to admit who that renter actually is. The City received a $400,000 prize from the federal government as one of the initial winners of a multi-phase competitionThe biennial census is federally mandated and goes a long way in fundingsupportservices in The CityDoty was acquitted last month of assaulting a former San Francisco fire commissionerYou may as well lose the drawings of energetic, fashion-forwardseniors mingling with their young co livers, Starcity, and technically, I guess the project is aimed at “low- and middle-income residents,” but let’s be honest, here; this is a giant upscale dorm for young tech workers. Imagine the catnip Starcity Minna will be for exhausted techies who’ve been couch-surfing andsleeping in eight to a room in “tech pods?” Imagine getting all of these perks for well below market rent? So what if I have toshare a kitchen? I mostly do take-out anyway. Young tech workers, new to The City and at adulthood? They’re the ones, perfectly positioned for thesoft landing of grown-up dorm living. Notsatisfied with thissingle revolution, last week Starcity rolled out another game-changer,invest.starcity.com, which expands real estate investment beyond the reach of institutions and high-rolling individuals, offering opportunity to anyone with $5,000 to invest. It’s a chance, Starcity CEO Jon Dishotskysays, to “democratize access” to real estate investing, in a city where traditional home-buying is well out of reach for many. With this program, and with Starcity Minna, the company has changed access for renters and investors, while also truly creating “a new way to live and work.”And let’s be clear about that new way to live and work. Is it a revolution everyone wants? Or needs? Starcity Minna is many things, but what it is at its core is a co-workingspace with bedroomsuites attached. Google may have game rooms and fitness centers to keep you at work (“Need your dry-cleaning done? Don’t leave! We’ll do it right here!”); at Starcity Minna, you never have to go to home because you’re already there. Your home office gets lonely; at Starcity Minna, you’re never alone. This is the real revolution, a world where work and home are one, a life where you canstill take Zoom meetings in your pajamas and then afterward retire to the coffeestation to kibbitz with like-minded peers. It may not be the revolution everyone wants, but Starcity isn’t lying when it claims to be changing the way we live and work.",1,2,SF Examiner
344,Biden Is Turning America Into the Land of the Freebie,26.33,19.67,https://spectator.org/biden-free-college-democrats-socialism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,23,"With the media proclaiming President Joe Biden to be the new FDR, it’s important to craft the right governing philosophy for him. The answer issimple. The federal governmentshould make real the mostsimple liberal — excuse me, progressive! — principle. Everything in lifeshould be free. At least, everything in lifeshould be free. I had this extraordinary revelation while reading the, the repository of all that is wonderful and decent in the nation’s capital. Poststaffer Jen Balderama penned an articleentitled, “Community collegesaved me. Biden is right: Itshould be free.” It was an epiphany! Isuddenly understood: If even one person benefits fromsomething, itshould be free to all. What could be more obvious? What a wonderful life Americans then would have. Whystop at giving away community college education? Consider the movement to eliminatestudent debt. The Left already is pushing this hard. It involves thesame principle, at least for anyone who borrows to pay for a university degree. How foolish I was to work while inschool and accept help from my parents to pay for undergrad and lawschool. Education was good for me. No doubt adding another lawyer to our terribly underservedsociety was great for the people! Somyschoolingshould have been free. Whyshould I have to pay forsomething just because I chose to do for my benefit? America — and, heck, everyone else on Earth — benefited. Make college free for all. And as much as we want wherever we want. If I feel called to be a permanentstudent, Washingtonshould make my dream come true. Moreover, if I want to go to Stanford, Harvard, Yale, orsome other pricey place, costshould be no object. Indeed, whyshould I be denied entry by discriminatory “standards” and “qualifications”? Eliteschools are part of the racist, elitist, patriarchal, and whatever other evils that apply tostructures designed to hold we the people in bondage. All universitiesshould be public, open to all, and free to everyone. Cambridge, here I come!It is time for government to act and make your dreams come true — for free. There’s also child care. Whyshould people be expected to be responsible for their own kids? Hillary Clinton was wrong to believe that it “takes a village.” That isn’t nearly enough people! Rather, it requires all thesmart thinkers in Washington taking andspending everyone else’s money. Progressives believe that havingsex and aborting babies are the most — actually, perhaps the only — essential liberties. Government is entitled to promiscuously and routinely interfere in every other human decision. If the intersection of these two fundamental rights unexpectedly leaves a baby alive, then the essential right to economic redistribution kicks in. And everyone elseshould pay for everything —starting with child care at birth. It is beyond question that health careshould be free. Every last procedure. Being healthy is our rightfulstate, and gettingsick isn’t our fault. Even ifsomeone claims that we contributed to the problem — all the outrageousfat-shamingthat goes on after people have a heart attack, for instance! — itshouldn’t be held against us. Personally, I want it all. If a few extra pounds result, thereshould besome miracle medical procedure to remove a few of them — whyshould I be denied the chocolate that is necessary to help me determine the meaning of the universe and engage in other essential acts of personhood? My once-bountiful hair appears to be thinning:surely modern medicine can fix that. And it was nice getting the COVID-19 vaccine for free. Why do I have to pay more for aspirin than for a life-savingshot? It allshould be free. Similarly, foodshould be free. We need it to live. And thereshould be food equality. It’s no one else’s business what we eat. If I prefer a diet ofsteak andshrimp, what is the problem? If I want caviar, itshould be my right. Whyshould I be denied my preference? Whyshould rich people get to eat what they want and not me? That is downright unfair. It also is classist. Racist. Sexist. And probablysome other evil “-ist”s as well. In my case, being fat is an essential part of who I am — especially eating cashews, chocolate, potato chips, and ice cream. It isn’t fair to deny mesuch necessities just becausesome dead white cis gender male living in what once was an empire that oppressed native peoples and allowedslavery claimedsomething was unhealthy. Foodshould be provided to everyone, without judgment and free of charge. Soshould transportation. How are those of us who aren’t Bill Gates or Jeff Bezossupposed to get around? Cars are expensive. Gasoline is expensive. Parking is expensive. We need to go to work (oppressive!) andschool. We even have to drive to go out on dates (essential to humankind!). Buy groceries. Vote (early and often!). And organize unions for protest and thesocialist masses to overthrow their oppressors. Moreover, gasoline-powered cars are bad for the environment. So mass transitshould be everywhere and free. Electric carsshould be free. Even taxis for those of us who don’t want to own carsshould be free. Though not Uber and Lyft, tools of exploitation against the laboring masses. It issocially unjust to expect people to pay forsomething as essential as transportation. Housingshould be free, too. No oneshould be denied the home of their choosing. Today poor peoplesuffer in cities while their oppressors live insplendor insurroundingsuburbs. Public housing is a goodstart but doesn’t go nearly far enough. Itstill allows enormous housing inequality. Whyshouldn’t everyone get to live in a house like that owned by Bill Gates? Governmentshould confiscate the existing housingstock and distribute it on a fairer basis. But much more is required. Governmentshould make companies build houses for free for everyone. Make rich corporations give back to the community! Trueservants of the people, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, who owns three homes,should beshownspecial consideration for having devoted their lives to taking from the rich for the rest of us. Personally, I believe I deserve at least two homes!Even jobsshould be free. That is, governmentshould employ anyone who needs work. Well, a paying position, not actual work, if you get my meaning. Nor is there any reason to let “need” and “qualifications” as defined by dead white cis gender males get in the way. Governmentshould provide employment to everyone — no restrictions. Whyshould people be constrained by arbitrary limits that prevent the oppressed masses from being all they can be? Have you ever been denied an opportunity that you believed you deserved? It is time for government to act and make your dreams come true — for free. Democratsshould listen to progressive activists and institute thesocialist ideal. Like to cook?

345,Jim Clyburn Urges Filibuster 'Carveout' for Laws Protecting Constitutional Rights Like Voting,-4.67,42.0,https://www.newsweek.com/jim-clyburn-urges-filibuster-carveout-laws-protecting-constitutional-rights-like-voting-1608558,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsweek-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn is urging PresidentJoe Bidento amend the US Senatefilibuster in order to carve out laws that are directly tied to constitutionally protected rights, including voting. Clyburn, a South Carolina Democrat and one of Biden is top congressional allies, told Politico in ast ory published Saturdaythat the current voting rights protection bill will only pass if Senate rules are changed to allow a 51-vote majority on the For the People Act of 2021. Echoing the vehement demands of top congressionalDemocrats, Clyburnsaid it is finally time for the White House to get aggressive in order to protect Americans' right to vote. Hesaid Biden could easily convince Democrat moderates like West Virginia Senator Joe Machin to get behind a tailored ""carveout,"" which would only change the filibuster toward legislation directly tied to constitutional rights.""Pick up the phone and tellJoe Manchin, 'Hey, weshould do a carveout.' I do not care whether he does it in a microphone or on the telephone — just do it,"" Clyburnsaid to Politico. Biden hasso far publicly expressed little interest in changing the legislative filibuster in order to pass Democrats' massive election reform bill as well as asecond piece of legislation that reauthorizessections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But Clyburnsaid Biden ""should endorse"" a legislative carve out immediately, particularly after a recent 6-3Supreme Courtruling that upheld GOP-backed voter restriction laws in Arizona. On Friday, White House Press SecretaryJen Psakisaid that Biden is upcoming Tuesdayspeech in Philadelphia isset to address voting rights as a ""moral obligation,"" rather than asimple legislative consideration. Clyburn also told Politico that he tried talking with Manchin last month as the Democraticsenator and crucialswing vote was proposing changes to the the election reform bill. Clyburnsaid he told Manchin at the time: ""I am not asking you to eliminate the filibuster ... But what I amsaying to you is that nobody ought to have the right to filibuster my constitutional rights.""Some top Democrats, including Pennsylvania Senator Bob Casey, have likenedstate-by-state GOP votersuppression bills to aggressive forms of ""whitesupremacy."" CaseysaidRepublicansacross the country are are creating more hurdles for mail-in voting or early voting under the guise of ""phantom voter fraud.""Harvard University law professor and constitutionalscholar Laurence Tribe appeared to agree with Clyburn is tactic to circumvent Senate Republicans, tweeting Saturday: ""This is thesolution: Enact a carve out for laws protecting constitutional rights.""Meanwhile, dozens ofstates have recently passed GOP-backed votersuppression laws that are being pushed throughstate legislatures almost purely on party-line Republican votes.

We’ll get into the philosophical discussion about all of this in a moment but, on a personal note, I find it rather exhausting just attempting to keep up with whom or whatever they are mad at during any given moment. At this point, I’m not even certain there are anystatues left in America. What we’ve witnessed in recent weeks is truly a descent into madness. Criminals are taking over cities with the backing of the elected officials who run those cities. Thosesame officials are proudly abandoning their police forces toscore points with a bunch of Marxists, then predictablyseeing violent crimeskyrocket overnight. We aresupposed to believe that this is all being done in the name of deliveringsome long-overdue justice. It’s all bunk. The always-eloquent Thomas Sowell put it very well i na recent conversation with Mark Levin:Right off the bat, Levin asked Sowell about the rioting that has gone on nightly in Americasince the murder of George Floyd at the hands of the Minneapolis police. “I’m regarded as pessimistic,” Sowellsaid, “but I was never pessimistic enough to believe that things would degenerate to the point where they are now, where adult human beings are talking about getting rid of the police … what is frightening is how many people in responsible positions are caving in to every demand that is made, repeating any kind of nonsense that you’resupposed to repeat. I do believe that we may well reach a point of no return. I hope, of course, that will never happen.”Count me among the pessimists. We’re not focusing on riots today but this is all tied together. It’s only Tuesday and the grievance-mongers have been busy. They pulled off theseemingly impossible,making Washington Redskins owner Dan Snyder back down after years ofsaying that he wouldn’t change the team’s name. Barely pausing to take a breath, the grievance mob then decided to go after the Texas Rangers. That’s a rather ambitious Monday. But wait, there’s more!ran a post yesterday titled “Don’t Stop at Statues. Demand a Reconsideration of Place Names Too.”This grievanceslope isn’t justslippery, they’ve now got a free army of people to keep covering it with Vaseline. We’ll besliding down it forever at this rate. I don’t care if people have hurt feelings. Everybody has hurt feelings at one time or another. The thing is, the lunatics that are becoming a bigger blight on America every day always have hurt feelings. They wake up aggrieved, and the day just becomes one long list of grievances that is updated hourly. Though it mayseem impossible, there is an inexhaustiblesupply of grievances to keep them raging. Back in the Occupy days, I keptsaying and writing that the rage was the endgame for them. It’s basically thesame now. They keepsaying they want change, and I don’t doubt that they would like to affectsome political change here and there, but that won’t make them any less angry. There is nothing that will make them less angrysimply because angry is what they want to be. The grievance freaks will always find another grievance. They’re addicted to it. What’s disturbing about the last couple of months is the pace at which they’re finding new ones. As we haveseen with the destruction of thestatues, they are also not very discriminate about focusing their wrath. It’s very aggravating that there areso many Republicans in Washington who don’t understand this. We’re fighting for thesoul of America and we’ve got Republicans in Congress going on aboutstatues as if they’re trying to get dates with antifa. I wouldn’t besurprised tosee Mitt Romney at the nextstatue-toppling. He and his ilk are forever convinced that, if they just give the grievance crowd one more concession, everything will be roses and puppies. There is no telling how long we’re going to besubjected to this nonsense that’s largely being fueled by woke white people at theandNew York Times, but it will no doubt be a while. We may truly have reached a point of no return. The inmates are most definitely running the asylum right now. Yeah, yeah, I know…that’s offensive to crazy people.

The big question is: Does the USs have the appetite, or even the political maneuvering room, to be an honest broker?In recent days, the Biden administration has dispatched an envoy to the Middle East and engaged in a flurry of back-channel diplomacy to respond to thesurge in violence between Israel and Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip. The big question is:Does the USs have the appetite, or even the political maneuvering room, to be an honest broker?The escalating conflict between Israelisecurity forces and Palestinian militants hassparked furious debates among Biden administration insiders on whether the USsshould play a leading orsupporting role in defusing the crisis, even though it has yet to completely fill its own ranks ofsenior administration posts overseeing the Middle East. The Biden administration, pushing toshift US foreign policy toward confronting China,showed little interest in diving into the Middle East peace process before the latest explosion of violence, which has culminated in deadly rocket barrages fired into Israel from Gaza and Israeli counterstrikes targeting Hamas militants. But due to the urgency of the crisis, and mounting pressure from US lawmakers on bothsides of the aisle to respond more forcefully, that may no longer be an option, experts and former officialssaid.“This was not on their policy priority list at all,”said Kirsten Fontenrose, the director of the Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council. “Now, they’re going to be forced to take it on as a primary priority, and I don’t think they’re ready for that.”Israel’s militarysaid on Thursday that it began operations to fight against Hamas militants in Gaza.“I’ve neverseen Gaza in my three and a half years hereso empty. It’s like a ghost town. You know, people really were terrified to move onto thestreet,”said Matthias Schmale, the Gaza-based operations director of the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which provides aid andservices to Palestinian refugees. “There’s not really been a lull in the fighting,” hesaid in a phone interview that was interrupted by thesound of an explosion. “There’s constant rockets from here and really very heavy violent responses from the otherside.”Meanwhile, asurge in intercommunal violence between Jewish and Arab communities in Israel has further escalated the crisis, along with widespread Palestinian protests in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. On Friday, protesters on theJordanian border with the occupied West Bank were able to breach Jordaniansecurity forces, while Lebanese demonstrators have attempted thesam eon Israel’s northern border. There are also reports of Syrians gathering in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. Demonstrations could only intensify this weekend, as Palestinians commemorate the anniversary of theNakba—the mass expulsion of Palestinians from what would become Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War—on May 15. Some analysts and UN officials voiced fears that if a truce isn’t broker ed in the nextseveral days, the violence could escalate into a protracted conflict for weeks or even longer. Political paralysis in Israel, which was on the cusp of a fifth round of elections in less than two years, and a delay in Palestinian elections to resolve fractious political lines across the occupied territories could further complicate any potential peace talks. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced on Wednesday that he was dispatching an envoy to the region to try to de-escalate the crisis. Hady Amr, a deputy assistantsecretary ofstate, worked on Middle East peace initiatives in the Obama administration. Amr is viewed in Washington as the best interlocutor to engage with the Palestinians, according toseveral former officials. Other current and former officialssaid the Biden administrationshould work to coordinate truce talks with other regional powers that have close contacts with Palestinian political leaders and Hamas. This includes Egypt, which has outsized influence in the occupied Palestinian territories and helped broker a cease-fire in the 2014 Gaza war, and Qatar, which isseen to have close ties to Hamas. Schmalesaid his agency has been providing Israel with location data on UN facilities to ensure they don’t get bombed and that he has received assurances from Hamas that it will not use UNRWAschools and other facilities for military purposes. “Theysaid thesame in 2014, and westill found weapons … and we ensured those weapons were removed.”Current and former US and UN officialssay Egypt and Qatar are quietly coordinating with the UN to try to carve out a path for cease-fire talks. Egyptian mediators traveled to Israel this week butso far to no avail. One additional complicating factor for President Joe Biden is that the USs does not yet havesenior envoys permanentlystationed on the ground to address the crisis nor a moresenior confirmed diplomat in place in Washington. Biden named veteran diplomat Barbara Leaf as his nominee to be top envoy for the Middle East last month, butshe has yet to be confirmed by the Senate. Former US Rep. Robert Wexler and Thomas Nides, a banker and former State Department official, are front-runners to be Biden’s ambassador to Israel, according toseveral people familiar with the matter. But four months into office, Biden has yet to formally name a nominee for the post. The Biden administration also has yet to reopen its consulate in Jerusalem, a de facto diplomatic mission to the Palestinians, due in part to push back from the Israelis. The Trump administrationshut it down in 2019, a year after it moved the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.“We’ve got to reopen the consulate,”said Ilan Goldenberg, an expert at the Center for a New American Security and a former diplomat who worked on Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. “It’s in [Israel’s] interest and our interest for the US to have the ability to engage with Palestinians on the ground, as we’reseeing right now. So in the immediate aftermath of the conflict, I really hope that reopening the consulate becomes a priority.”In Washington, Biden is facing conflicting pressures from both the progressive flank of the Democratic Party—which has becomesharply critical of Israel and its treatment of Palestinians—and centrist Democrats and Republicans urging him to do more tosupport Israel. On Thursday night, members of the House Progressive Caucus took the House floor to voice theirsupport for Palestinian rights and concerns about the escalatingsituation in Gaza, instatements that reflected thesharp and growingsplits among Democrats over US ties to Israel. Reps. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib, a Palestinian American, joined other progressives in urging Biden to pare backsupport for Israel and condition or restrict US military aid to Israel as the violence continued. The USs provides $3.8 billion in military aid to Israel annually.“The truth is that this is not a conflict between twostates. This is not a civil war. It is a conflict where one country—funded andsupported by the USs government—continues an illegal military occupation over another group of people,” Omarsaid. She later lashed out at the Biden administration’s response on Twitter. Administration insiderssay pressure from the progressive caucus is unlikely tosway Biden’s position on USsupport for Israel, at least in theshort term. Both Biden and Blinken have voicedsupport for Israel’s right to defend itself instatements this week, though Blinken on Wednesdaystressed that Israel “has an extra burden” to avert civilian casualties in its retaliatorystrikes in Gaza.is a diplomacy and nationalsecurity reporter at.

350,"As Taliban Atrocities Mount, Afghans Urge International Sanctions",-1.0,42.67,https://www.huffpost.com/entry/taliban-biden-sanctions_n_6116c832e4b01da700f5a9dd,https://adfontesmedia.com/huffpost-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-13,25,"President Joe Biden is extremely unlikely to reverse his plan to wind down America’s 20-year mission in Afghanistan even as Taliban militantssweep through the country, massacring their opponents and forcing thousands of people to flee their homes. But Afghans argue that the USstill has considerable power to influence the Taliban even after most American troops leave the country: through internationalsanctions. This week, a Washington-based advocacy group called the Afghanistan-US Democratic Peace and Prosperity Council began lobbying Congress and the Biden administration toseek new UNsanctions on Taliban figures. Its effort has not been previously reported. Separately, Afghan foreign minister Haneef AtmartoldThe Wall Street Journal that world powersshould reinstate UN travel restrictions on Taliban leaders.“While the Biden administration is resolved in leaving Afghanistan, itstill can lead within international institutions. The Taliban will not respect its calls for peace without ashow of force,” the groupsaid in a Fridaystatement. “Without the US to lead onsanctions, other nations will move to recognize the Taliban in efforts tostem an inevitable refugee crisis. This would be an absolute failing of the US and the international community.”Supporters ofstrongersanctions hope they will convince the Taliban toslow its onslaught. When the ultraconservative armed movement previously ruled Afghanistan, it was a pariah. Combined with the toll of a civil war and the Taliban’s repression, that isolation made life miserable for most Afghans. In negotiating with Washington as theyseek to regain power, Taliban representatives have repeatedlysaid they do not want to lose foreignsupport like the aid and expertise that Afghanistan has come to rely onsince the US invasion in 2001. Tougher international restrictions on prominent Taliban members couldshow that countries willshun a Taliban-dominated government in Afghanistan if it violates rightsstandards andsteam rolls other local players like pro-Western Afghans. Without a global rebuke of the offensive, however,Chinaor other powers like Iran mightsoon decide to acknowledge the Taliban as Afghanistan’s legitimate leader, killing the prospect of a multinational effort to limit the group’s brutality. UNsanctions could affect prominent Taliban members who are based in Qatar, thesmall Persian Gulfstate that hosted the talks leading to the US withdrawal from Afghanistan, and other Taliban forces in Pakistan. Asenior Afghan lawmaker who recently fled a Taliban offensive explained theirsupport forsanctions to HuffPost.“Those who have committed atrocities have to be recognized internationally. They will understand that they will not receive legitimacy if they continue to do atrocities,”said the lawmaker, who requested anonymity for fear of Taliban retribution against family members who arestill under the group’s rule. “The UN, the US and other countries who are involved in Afghanistanshould understand that … with keeping quiet about the atrocities that the Taliban are doing, they are inviting the Taliban to do that.”As the Taliban have taken over Afghan cities and districts in recent weeks, they have detained and killed relatives of officials in the US-backed Afghan government,forcedwomen to marry their fighters andtargetedjournalists. The lawmakersaid that civilservants and activists in their hometown were told by local Taliban representatives tosurrender and provide information like their home addresses; the lawmaker advised them not to because those details would make it easier for them to be hunted down. The Taliban is also forcing local families to provide young men as fighters, the parliamentarian added. An international response matters because Afghans are deeply affected by apparent global apathy toward them, the lawmakersaid. “We are demoralized, we cannot continue, because we think the world is backing the Taliban instead of the people of Afghanistan.”An official at the US mission to the UNsaid that the Biden administration is open to tighteningsanctions.“If the Taliban continues down their current path of violence it will affect the Security Council’s review of the travel ban exemption and thestatus of designations,” the official told HuffPost via email. The official did not comment on potential newsanctions. Biden aidessay the US continues tosupport the Afghan government and wants the Taliban to halt its assault in favor of talks to establish a power-sharing agreement. But the administration knows the next few weeks could bring a very different outcome. The presidentsent 3,000 troops to Afghanistan on Thursday to help withdraw many of thestaff at thesprawling US embassy in Kabul and he isspeeding up efforts to evacuateAfghans who previously worked with American forces and are now Taliban targets. The Taliban’s takeover of more than two-thirds of Afghanistan ― and the collapse of US-backed government forces in many areas ― has occurred far more quickly than American and Afghan officials expected,suggesting they couldsoon take their ultimate prize, Kabul. The continued onslaught risks millions of Afghans’ lives and couldshatter thesociety that has developed in the country over the last two decades, as women have come closer than ever to equal rights and foreign assistance has improved issues like humanitarian conditions and press freedoms. The lawmaker who escaped a recent Taliban assaultsaid it was hard to believe how quickly their lifeseemed to crumble. One month ago, they were telling contacts abroad that instead ofseekingsafe passage out of the country for progressive Afghans, theyshouldsupport their attempts tostay in their homes. “Now, after the things Isaw, I think we have to find ways to leave instead … It’s better to havesomeone alive outside the country instead ofsomeone who’s dead inside of the country.”To the parliamentarian, like many Afghans, recent developments echo painful memories of Afghanistan’s civil war of the 1980s.“It’s thesamestories that my mom was telling me: We left everything behind, we had only onesmall bag,” theysaid. “Now this has happened to me.”At HuffPost, we believe that everyone needs high-quality journalism, but we understand that not everyone can afford to pay for expensive newssubscriptions.

351,Analysis: Cities hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic face bankruptcy,-2.0,44.67,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/analysis-cities-hit-hard-by-the-covid-19-pandemic-face-bankruptcy,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-30,25,"US cities are fast running out of cash. The pandemic will reduce local government revenues by an estimated US$11.6 billion in 2020. With COVID-19 requiring residents tostay home andstores toshutter, the bulk of this reduction comes from aslump in localsales taxes. Declines will continue into 2021. State revenues are heading in thesame direction,so many US cities will need to rely on help from the federal government. Aid to cities may be part of the next pandemic aid package now being discussed by members of the House and Senate. Butso far, the Republicans’ bill leaves out any new funding forstate and local governments, while the Democrats’ bill includes $1 trillion for it. And if federal assistance arrives, it will not fix every city’s budget. The pandemic has hit budgetsso hard that even cities in relatively good financial health – including those with rainy day funds to help them through an emergency – will facesignificant changes tostaffing andservices. For cities in the poorestshape, the pandemic could mean bankruptcy. The Northern California city of Vallejo declared bankruptcy in 2008. Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesThe Northern California city of Vallejo declared bankruptcy in 2008. Luis Sinco/Los Angeles Times via Getty ImagesBankruptcy is a legal process where people, companies and governments who cannot pay their debtsseek to reduce them. Which debts get paid during a bankruptcy are important decisions. They involve how comfortable a city employee’s retirement might be, the level of health insurance for pensioners and workers, the extent of labor protections for employees and the future cost of borrowing for a city. City bankruptcy was created by Congress after the Great Depression, in response to4,770different units of city government going belly up. Twenty-sevenstatesnow allow their cities to file for bankruptcy. Thosestates that do not allow city bankruptcy – Georgia and Iowa explicitly prohibit filing, with the other 21states having nospecific allowance or prohibition – manage the problem of city indebtedness in various ways, ranging fromstrict budget oversight to the disbanding of heavily indebted cities. Since 1938, city bankruptcy has been used around 700times. A city’s bankruptcy differs from corporate bankruptcy in that it does not allow for the liquidation of assets. For cities, bankruptcy is used to reduce debts, notsell off things –such as public roads and buildings – to pay off debts. The bankruptcy judge’s role is to determine whether the proposed reduction is fair to all people the city owes money to, which may include workers, pensioners, bankers,suppliers and investors. But bankruptcies can look different in different cities. We arescholars who research changes in how cities go about budgeting. Our work hasshowed that the city bankruptcies that followed the Great Recession of 2007 and 2008 were not uniform. If you were in a big city, your government owed money to lots of people. The converse was true insmall cities. As the number of participants in a bankruptcy increases, the task of deciding how much different creditorsshould get repaid becomes more complicated. Westfall Township, Pennsylvania, home to about 2,000 people, declared bankruptcy in 2009 after losing a lawsuit to New Jersey real estate developers David and Barbara Katz. Courts ruled that the city owed the Katzes $20.8 million after improperly denying them permission to develop projects in the township. With annual revenues of just $1 million, Westfall had few options but to file for bankruptcy. Resolving Westfall’s bankruptcy meant reaching a new agreement with the Katzes. The bankruptcy court approved a$6 millionsettlement with the developers and gave Westfall 20 years to pay. The city would also raise property taxes and delay the repayment of other debts. By 2014, Westfall’s budget had recovered enough for Pennsylvania to remove it from its list of distressed cities. Bankruptcy proceedings were more complicated in Vallejo, California, which is on the northern end of San Francisco Bay. Vallejo,population 120,000, had a 2008-2009 budget of $79.6 million. In 2008, the city lost around one-quarter of its revenues as localsales taxes and real estate development fees collapsed. Vallejosuddenly found itself unable to pay all of its bills. The City Council voted unanimously to file forbankruptcy. In its bankruptcy filing, the city estimated it had between 1,000 and 5,000 creditors. The most contentious part of the bankruptcy concerned the city’s obligations to its own unionized employees. Vallejo argued that its bankruptcyshould include the option of reducing employee wages and benefits, and changing working conditions, if necessary, without union consent. The judge agreed and, in doingso,expandedwhat types of debt could be reduced in bankruptcy. This was, and remains,controversial. Although unions have pushed back, later bankruptcies have confirmed the court’s decision. Vallejo ultimately chose not to impose new employment contracts on most of its employees. That decision helped Vallejo avoid costly legal battles – but the city’s main expenditures, wages and pensions, remained largely unaltered. The city emerged out of bankruptcysolvent butstruggling. Filing for bankruptcy ended up costing Vallejo over $20 million in court and legal fees. Vallejo’s bankruptcy foreshadowed an even more complex one in Detroit, where revenue decline and failedWall Street bets left the city unable to balance its budget. Detroit listed 100,000 creditors in its 2013 bankruptcy filing, totaling$18.5 billion in debts. Like Vallejo, Detroit would have to decide which creditors tostiff, effectively asking them to pay for the city’s budget failures. Detroit’s biggest debt during bankruptcy was to its pension holders. Bill Pugliano/Getty ImagesDetroit’s biggest debt during bankruptcy was to its pension holders. Bill Pugliano/Getty ImagesThe eventualsettlement would reduce Detroit’s debts by $7 billion, mostly byslashing the amount of borrowed money the city would have to repay to banks and investors. Butno creditor would walk away unscathed. Wages, pensions and health care for city employees were all cut. The city also entered into a complex “Grand Bargain” broker ed by local philanthropists with thestate of Michigan and pension holders that helpedsettle the city’s largest debt, which was to pensioners, while keeping in the city its one major asset, the Detroit Institute of Art’s collection. The administrative and legal costs of the Detroit bankruptcy came in at around $100 million. The bigger the city, the more complicated and expensive the bankruptcy. More creditors means more lawyers making competing claims on the city’s dwindling revenues. It also makes the process of picking winners and losers more complex andsomething that can involve testing the limits of bankruptcy law. When these limits expand, just what going bust means can change dramatically. Things that onceseemed untouchable, like pensions, can become vulnerable in bankruptcy courts. With many budgets in tatters, the prospect of growing numbers of city bankruptcies looms. Distressed cities will have to figure out what the process means for them. It is rarely possible to predict what any city will decide. With any part of a city’s operations – includingsalaries, pensions, road repairs, borrowing, park maintenance, policing, libraries – potentially fair game, everyone involved faces great uncertainty. There is nosingle, predictable path through city bankruptcy.",2,2,PBS

354,Tribes denounce North Dakota ID law in congressional hearing,-0.75,47.0,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/tribes-denounce-north-dakota-id-law-in-congressional-hearing,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,25,"BISMARCK, ND — Native American voters face poor access to pollingsites, discrimination by poll workers and unfair identification requirements, tribal leaders told members of Congress who traveled Tuesday to a reservation in North Dakota where voting rights were a key issue in last year’s US Senate race. A House electionssubcommittee’s meeting at the Standing Rock reservation was the latest in aseries of on-site visits across the country on voting-rights issues. Activists told the panel that obstaclesstill remain more than five decades after Congress passed the Voting Rights Act, which aimed to eliminatesuch impediments for minority voters.“There continues to be barriers — interpersonal andsystemic — at our polling locations in our tribal communities and for our Native voters across thestate,”said activist Prairie Rose Seminole, a member of the Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation in northwestern North Dakota. The bulk of the two-hour hearing focused on North Dakota’s voter ID requirements, which have led to two federal lawsuits by tribes who allege the rules are discriminatory andsuppress the American Indian vote, which leans Democrat in a Republican-dominantstate. The voter ID dispute drew national attention last fall because of a US Senate race in North Dakota that wasseen as critical to Republicans’ chances to keep control of the Senate. Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer defeated Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who wasseeking asecond term. North Dakota requires that a voter ID include a provablestreet address, which Secretary of State Al Jaegersays guards against fraud. Tribes allege the moves bystate GOP leaders disenfranchised members who live on reservations wherestreet addresses are uncommon or unknown and where post office boxes are the primary addresses.“Thestate knew this and they used it tosuppress tribal voters,”said Charles Walker, CEO of the Mandan, Hidatsa & Arikara Nation. State officials have denied that. The US Supreme Court in October allowed thestate to continue requiringstreet addresses on voter IDs, though Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburgsaid in a dissent that “the risk of voter confusion appearssevere.”The decision led to an intense effort by tribes and advocacy groups to get tribal members to the polls with proper ID during November’s general election. It was largelysuccessful but cost the Spirit Lake and Standing Rock tribes a combined $14,000, in part because they waived normal fees for tribal IDs.“Fifteen dollars is milk and bread for a week for a poor family,”said Turtle Mountain Chippewa attorney Alysia LaCounte, who broke down in tears during her testimony. US Rep. Rodney Davis, an Illinois Republican, noted during the hearing that Cramer won handily despite high Native American voter turnout. Native American Rights Fund attorney Jacqueline De Leon responded: “We don’t think that outrage is a get-out-the-votestrategy, right?”“There are votersuppression issues going on throughout Indian Country that aren’t nearly getting the attention or resources that were poured into North Dakota because it justso happened that Sen. Heitkamp was running for re-election, and the Senate balance of power elevated this issue to the nationalstage,” DeLeonsaid. Davis replied, “So this was all a conspiracy to beat Heidi Heitkamp?”North Dakota Republican leaders have denied that Heitkamp’ssurprise 2012 win influencedstate voter ID law. OJ Semans Sr., co-executive director of the Four Directions advocacy group, which has beensuccessful in voting rights lawsuits in South Dakota and otherstates, implored thesubcommittee to work to increase federal dollars thatstates can dedicate to helping Native American voters.“The backbone of democracy is going to be given a brace, because people are going to vote,” hesaid.",2,2,PBS
355,Nurses question hospitals’ claims they’re contracting coronavirus in the community instead of at work,-4.33,48.33,https://www.cleveland.com/coronavirus/2020/12/nurses-question-hospitals-claims-theyre-contracting-coronavirus-in-the-community-instead-of-at-work.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cleveland-com-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,18,"CLEVELAND, Ohio – Over the pastseveral months, hospitals have repeatedlysaid contact tracingshows the doctors, nurses and other health care workers who’ve acquired COVID-19 are largely being infected through communityspread. Leaders from the Cleveland Clinic, MetroHealth and University Hospitals made those assertions during a November 16 news briefing where they announced that hundreds of health care workers and other hospital employees weresidelined due to the virus. The claim has also been repeated by leaders from other Ohio hospitals who’ve appeared at Governor Mike DeWine’s coronavirus briefings. Yet those assertions have puzzled and disheartened nurses who are at the front lines of the pandemic. They question how hospitals can pinpoint where they acquired a virus that isso widespread, and they contend it’s just as likely they were infected while treating COVID-19 patients. Furthermore, nurses feel thatsuggesting they’re getting the virus through communityspread insinuates they’re being careless once they’re off the clock.“Every timesomeone from a hospital is talking, theyseem to want to throw in that this is all communityspread, that health care workers are not getting [COVID-19] in the hospital,”said Brandon Marlow, a labor representative from the Ohio Nurses Association. “It justseems very curious, why it’s a consistent message they feel they need to give.”Marlowsaid he isn’tsure why hospitals continue tosay employees are being infected outside of work. He assumes it could be related to liability reasons, andsaidseveral hospitals have made thesame assertions in private meetings with the ONA However,several of Cleveland’s largest healthsystemssaid they are offering paid leave to employees who contract COVID-19 without requiring them to use vacation or paid time off. Data on the topic isscarce, although onestudy published in The Lancet found front line health care workers were at higher risk for contracting COVID-19 than the general community. Doug Meredith, an ICU nurse at Cleveland Clinic Akron General,said health care workers who are around coronavirus patients every day know theseverity of the virus and take precautions to protect themselves outside of work. Hesaid it’s discouraging to hear hospitalssuggest employees are getting infected elsewhere.“I think [nurses] do take it personally. They do feel like their professionalism is being questioned, because of what they do outside of work,” hesaid. “Because I think we all try to do the right thing.”Hospitals in Clevelandsaid they trust their employees and do not believe they’re being careless in the community. Instead, they feel the high number of employees who’ve contracted the virus is the result of aspike in infections across Ohio.“Our care givers are highly professional, and contracting COVID-19 outside the hospital is not a reflection of their professionalism, but a reflection of how contagious this virus can be in the community,” a UHspokesmansaid. How do they know?Hospitalssay they’ve been conducting contact tracing when an employee tests positive for COVID-19 to identify thesource of infection. Leadership for the Clinic, MetroHealth and UHsaid during the November 16 news briefing that the rise in infections among employees largely mirrored thespike in coronavirus cases in Northeast Ohio. But the ONA isskeptical the hospitals can truly identify where and whensomeone was infected, Marlowsaid. Even though employees are wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) and taking other precautions in the hospital, there’sstill a risk they’re being exposed.“What [hospitals] would like tosay is that because all these measures are in place, there’s no waysomebody could be getting it in the hospital,” hesaid. “And I don’t know if that’s a conclusion a reasonable person could come to.”Marlowsaid the ONA has repeatedly asked for data thatshows employees are being infected in hospitals but has yet to receive anysuch proof. The Clinic, MetroHealth and UH did not provide anyspecific contact-tracing data to cleveland.com. UHsaid roughly 4.5% of its care givers have tested positive for COVID-19since thestart of the pandemic. That compares favorably to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that 13.4% of US health care workers have tested positive. Less than 1% of the UH cases have been linked to exposure at work, aspokesmansaid. All three healthsystems havesaid they’ve conducted robust contact tracing and have protocols in place to protect employees,such as temperature checks for visitors, mask requirements andsocial-distancing measures. Meredith has not tested positive for COVID-19, butsome of his colleagues have. Hesaid he’s not aware of any contact tracing that took place after those exposures. Nurses are already dealing withskeptics in the community who claim the virus isn’t thatserious and the pandemic is overblown. So it’s frustrating to hear hospitals tell nurses that they’re acquiring it outside of a workplace where they’re constantly interacting with COVID-19 patients, Meredithsaid.“It’s kind of like you’re hearing it from both ends, and you’restuck in the middle,” hesaid. “Sometimes you feel like you’re completely on your own.”The liability questionEarlier this year, Democratic lawmakers in Ohio’s House of Representativessought to address the issue of workplace liability through HB 573, which proposed making COVID-19 an occupational disease under the workers’ compensation law. Rep. Lisa Sobecki of Toledo and Rep. Kristin Boggs of Columbus introduced it March 23, thesame day Ohio’sstay-at-home order went into effect. Yet the bill never got a hearing after being referred to the House Insurance Committee on May 5. Sobeckisaidshe isn’tsure why it failed to gain any traction, although thestate’s Republican lawmakers have consistently pushed back on any legislationsurrounding the coronavirus and evens ought tostrip DeWine’s authority to issuestatewide public health orders. Sobeckisaidshe’s unaware of any outside lobbying to prevent the bill from becoming law. Butshesaidshe heard from constituent groups whosupported the legislation, and feels it’s important for Ohio tostand behind the essential workers who’ve put themselves in harm’s way throughout the pandemic.“We haven’tseen bills that help everyday Ohioans in the middle of a pandemic,”shesaid. “It reallysaddens me.”She plans to reintroduce a new version of HB 573 once the Ohio Legislature begins a newsession in 2021.“This is not going to go away. The pandemic doesn’tstop on December 31,” Sobeckisaid. “This pandemic is going to continue until we can get the vaccine to Ohioans.”Cleveland healthsystemssaid they’ve nevertheless takensteps tosupport employees who contract COVID-19. The Clinic is giving its employees paid time off if they contract COVID-19, regardless of where they’re infected. Those employees are not required to dip into their own PTO, a Clinicspokeswomansaid.“There’s a lot of positive things [the Clinic] is doing as well, to try to take care of workers who are off with COVID,” Meredith acknowledged. UH employees who acquire COVID-19 at work qualify for workers’ comp. If they’re infected through communityspread, they may use the healthsystem’s leave andshort-term disability programs, a UHspokesmansaid. Marlowsaid other Ohio hospitals havesimilar programs in place to help employees. Those efforts are appreciated, but the ONA also wants hospitals to provide robust contact-tracing data and give more weight to the possibility employees are being infected at work.“I think what makes the most amount ofsense is to not pretend once you walk into a hospital, it’s a magical place where it’s no longer the community and you can no longer contract the virus,” Marlowsaid.",2,2,Cleveland.com

""The individual does not have to release the health information, but then they may not be hired or offered insurance.""On thespecific matter of vaccinationstatus, employers are free to ask workers if they have gotten theshot.

Biden has proposed raising the capital gains tax rate to 39.6% from 20% for millionaires; coupled with an existing Medicaresurcharge, federal tax rates for the wealthy could climb as high as 43.4% – pushing the levy on returns to one of the highest in the developed world, according to a new analysis published by theTax Foundation. Ireland – with a 51% tax on dividends – would be the only developed nation to impose a higher tax on investment income. On average, nations in the 38-member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development levy a marginal tax rate of 24.4% on dividend income. Unlike the US, many OECD nations differentiate how they tax dividends and capital gains. As far as capital gains tax rates, the US would have the highest capital gains tax rate among OECD nations under Biden is proposal. Currently, Denmark has the highest rate of 42%, followed by Chile at 40% and Finland and France each at 34%. Roughly one-fourth of all OECD countries do not impose a capital gains tax on thesale of long-heldshares, including Belgium, the Czech Republic, South Korea, Luxembourg, New Zealand, Slovakia, Slovenia, Switzerland and Turkey. The average capital gains tax rate among OECD members is about 19.1%, according to Tax Foundation data. Taxes on long-term capital gains – generally classified as an asset that is held for more than one year – currently range from 0% to 20% in the US, depending on a person is income. Wealthier investors are alsosubject to an additional 3.8% tax on long- andshort-term capital gains that is used to fund ObamaCare. Short-term capital gains on assetssold within a year are typically taxed as ordinary income. The top long-term capital-gains tax rate is currently paid bysingle taxpayers earning more than $445,850 this year (and $501,600 for married couples filing a joint tax return). Capital gains are taxed favorably when compared to wage andsalary income; under existing law, the richest Americans pay a top tax rate of 37% on ordinary income, while the top tax rate on capital gains is 23.8%. Biden campaigned on equalizing the capital gains and income tax rates for rich Americans. But a recent analysis by the Penn Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan group at the University of Pennsylvania is Wharton School,suggests that rich Americans would employ techniques to avoid the rate increase. Tax avoidance, most of it legal, would cut about $900 billion of the estimated $1 trillion that a capital gains tax increase could generate for the federal government over the next decade, the researcherssaid.""Even withstepped-up basis eliminated,several avenues for tax avoidance remain,"" the researchers wrote. For instance, theysaid, taxpayers would likely realize more gains in years when taxable incomes fall below the threshold. They alsosuggested that an increasedshare of business incomes would be organized via pass-through interests instead of C-corporations in order to avoid thesecond layer ofshareholder tax.""A large body of empirical researchshows that when taxes on capital gains increase, realizations of capital gains fall,"" the researchers wrote.

Far-left MSNBC host Joy Reid praised the VP hopeful and recited DNC talking points trashing Attorney General Bill Barr’s testimony to the House Judiciary Committee. Reid advanced a wild conspiracy theory that the Barr and the Trump administration will use a “secret police” toscare off Biden voters:Senator, I think one of the things people are afraid of is that William Barr will look the other way if there are violent protests that are attempting to intimidate people that want to vote against Donald Trump or, and/or that he might use his federalsecret police force he’s created and cobbled together to intimidate voters who want to vote for Joe Biden. Are you worried about that?Instead of looking at the violence in cities like Portland and acknowledging federal officers are there to protect people from violent rioters. Reid looks at it in a purely cynical and political way. Of course the Trump administration did notsend federal officers toscare Biden voters, hesent them because oft he failure of these cities’ mayors to lead and protect their citizens. Harris completely ignored Reid’s comments on “secret police” and wentstraight into her VP pitch:Follow @LifeNewsHQListen, at this point, what I am worried about is that we remind everyone of what is atstake in this election, this election which will be, I do truly believe the most important election of our lifetime.

It has been widely known thatHarris is on Biden’s VPshort list,soshe will praise Biden as much as possible in order to make herself look as favorable as possible.

Even as the number of coronavirus casesspikes, Gottliebsaid the US is likely under counting infections, as Americans who are younger and healthier, or those who are asymptomatic or have mild cases, may not get tested for COVID-19.""We are not doing a lot of routinescreening right now,"" hesaid. ""Unless you work for the New York Yankees, you are not getting tested on a regular basis.

366,"What Is Felony Murder, And How Much Did The Capitol Rioter MAGA Assholes Commit It?",-20.33,34.83,https://www.wonkette.com/felony-murder,https://adfontesmedia.com/wonkette-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-12,25,"Amidst all of the chaos, outrage, and excellent mem es in the wake of the MAGA riot, it can be easy to gloss over the gravity of what happened last week. Violent insurrectionists tried tostage a coup and five people died at the USs Capitol. More than 50people have been charged with crimes for their roles in last Wednesday is events — but,so far, no one has been charged in connection with any of the deaths. Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died of injuries from ""physically engaging with protesters,"" according to the DC Metro Police Department. Both the MPD and FBI are investigating his death as a murder. Depending on what comes out in the investigation, one or more people could be charged with murder, manslaughter, or aiding and abetting murder or manslaughter. Four Trumpsupporters also died, including one who wasshot by Capitol Police. Because of these deaths, there has been a lot of talk about the doctrine of felony murder, which allows prosecutors to charge people with murder even when they did not actually play a part in anyone is death. Does the felony murder rule apply here? Let is take a look. I get it and I agree: There needs to beserious consequences for what that happened last week. But the thing is, felony murder is bullshit. It makes murderers out of people who are not actually killers. Felony murder lets prosecutors charge people with murder ifsomeone dies, even by accident, if they were committing a dangerous felony at the time of the death. The underlying felony has to be dangerous enough thatsomeone dying, even by accident, was foreseeable. A common application of felony murder is when a group of people plan a robbery andsomeone dies. Even if the death is accidental — or one of the perpetrators is killed by a cop. It does not matter what role you played in the underlying felony, or even if anyone was armed. Felony murder came from 12th century English common law and was eventually codified here instate and federalstatutes. Twenty-sevenstates even execute people who found guilty of felony murder — and at least 11 people have been executed for felony murdersince 1985. It is no tout of the realm of possibility thatsomeone could be charged with felony murder forsome of the deaths at the Capitol. But it will not be an easy case to make. Because the crimes were committed in DC, federal law applies. The federal felony murder rule, found at18 US Code § 1111,says people can be charged with murder if they:committed in the perpetration of, or attempt to perpetrate, any arson, escape, murder, kidnapping, treason, espionage,sabotage, aggravatedsexual abuse orsexual abuse, child abuse, burglary, or robbery; or perpetrated as part of a pattern or practice of assault or torture against a child or children; or perpetrated from a premeditated design unlawfully and maliciously to effect the death of any human being other than him who is killed, is murder in the first degree. Armed insurrection, riots, and terrorism are, for whatever reason, not on the list. That does not mean it would be impossible for anyone to be charged with felony murder, though. According to former federal prosecutor Tim Heaphy,""You could look at thestorming of the doors of the Capitol by that riotous mob as burglary. If they went in with the intent tosteal, disrupt proceedings, to commit other offenses, they committed burglary. And, therefore, a murder that occurred during the course of a burglary could be potentially charged as felony murder.""And it appears the DOJ and DC US Attorney have not ruled out felony murder charges, withsenior prosecutor Ken Kohlsaying,""Felony murder is always in play insomething like this. Until we get all the facts and conduct the investigation, talk to witnesses, review any videos, we are not in a position to comment.""So it looks like we will just have to wait andsee to find out. It is easy to get outraged about what happened and understandable thatso many people are demandingserious consequences. I am pretty fucking pissed off, myself, that most of the chargesso far have been for misdemeanors like unlawful entry to the Capitol. But, at thesame time, we need to remember that changing the law to make it easier to charge people with felony murder would be a terrible thing — and very rarely used against people like the white, middle class MAGA assholes whostormed the Capitol. As long as Black kids arestill being charged with felony murder for their friends getting killed by cops, I am fine with also using it against racist terrorists. The law is on the books and actively being used,sosure, charge the motherfuckers. Whatever. But also, let is just get rid of felony murder entirely.

City officials hadsaid in recent days they would view the collective refusal of in-person work as astrike, but in response to Sunday’s vote resultssaid they will delay thescheduled return of thousands of teachers andstaff until Wednesday “to ensure we have the time needed to resolve our discussions without risking disruption tostudent learning.”The CTU’s move to reject in-person work marks the culmination of a months-long fight between the union and the nation’s third-largestschoolsystem over how and when to reopenschools during the pandemic — a disagreement that threatens to plunge the city’s education into deeper turmoil if a deal isn’t reached over the next few days.“So what does this mean? It means the overwhelming majority of you have chosensafety,” the union told teachers andstaff as they announced the vote results. “CPS did everything possible to divide us by instilling fear through threats of retaliation, but youstill chose unity,solidarity and to collectively act as one.”About 86% of the 25,000 rank-and-file CTU members participated in the electronic vote over the past three days, with 71% favoring the rejection of in-person work in an unusually close vote for CTU labor actions. When the CTU voted tostrike in 2019, 94% of members who voted chose to walk out. CTU President Jesse Sharkey wrote on Twitter he “will grant that it’s a lower percentage than we’ve had in the past. It’s a pandemic, after all.” He later added in astatement he believes “an agreement is within reach, but we need a willing partner.”Illinois law requires three-quarters of CTU members to authorize a typical contractstrike,such as the one in 2019. The union hassaid a workstoppage this time around would come in response toseveral alleged unfair labor practices by CPS, and the approval of only asimple majority of voting members is required — though the CTUsaid last week it wouldseek 60% toshow its unity. Union leadership has been adamant, however, that its initial action is not astrikesince teachers intend to continue working from home — even though theschool district is no longer allowing that option for about half of union members this week. The union hassaid it would only withhold its labor if no agreement is reached come Wednesday and CPS decides to block teachers from remote work — as it has done with a few dozen pre-kindergarten andspecial educationstaff members who have not reported toschools as ordered this month and are no longer being paid. Thestrategy from union leadership has been to back CPS officials into a corner in negotiations by forcing the district to address teachers’ concerns immediately, delay its reopening plan or risk halting all classes. Thekey unresolved issues are: which teachers andstaff who have a household member with a vulnerable medical condition are eligible for accommodations for remote work; the public health metrics that determine the reopening or closing of individualschools and the district as a whole; how vaccines factor in to requiringstaff to work in person; and thescope of district wide testing ofstaff andstudents. About 3,800 preschool andspecial education cluster program teachers andstaff were ordered to return toschools earlier this month for the resumption of in-person learning for theirstudents. Another 10,000staff members in kindergarten through eighth grades were due back Monday. K-8schools arescheduled to reopen February 1 for an estimated 71,000students — out of 191,000 children in those grades — who havesaid they plan to return. Black, Latino and low-income families have been less likely to choose in-person learning, data hasshown. It’s also not clear, however, how many of those K-8students will actually follow through with their intentions to go back. CPS officials on Friday released attendance data from the first week ofschool for pre-K and clusterstudents that revealed an average of 3,189 of the 6,470students who opted in — 49% — returned to classrooms each day. That meant only 19% of 16,944 eligiblestudents were learning in-person that week. The CTU hassaid those numbersshould help predict asimilar pattern in the next reopening wave, leading to fewer teachers needed for in-person work. But CPS hassaid it’sstill planning as if all 71,000 kids are returning. Schools chief Janice Jackson wrote in an email to families Sunday that the return of K-8 teachers andstaff will be pushed back to Wednesday as the twosides continue to negotiate, but CPSstill plans for K-8students to return February 1. Pre-K and clusterstaff will be expected to keep reporting toschools this week, and Jacksonsaid the district’s goal is “to reach an agreement with CTU assoon as possible.”Whenshe was asked Friday if the union’s walkout would mean even remote learning would come to a halt, Jacksonsaid, “I think my point was clear that if the union refuses to work on Monday, that constitutes astrike.”Jacksonsaid it would be unfair to deny families the opportunity to return toschools, andshe and City Health Commissioner Dr. Allison Arwady expressedstrong confidence that all necessary precautions have been taken to keepstudents andstaffsafe from COVID-19. The district hasspent $44 million on disinfectants, PPE, air purifiers and other measures to readyschools for the return ofstaff andstudents. After a rough fall and early winter, coronavirus infection rates in Chicago havesteadily fallen. The city’s test positivity rate is at 7.2%, and theseven-day average of daily confirmed cases is down to 629 — both the lowestsince mid-October. But teachers haveshownserious concerns about their health inschools they believe won’t uniformly orstrictly enforce mitigation protocols. The teachers union and its medical consultant, national expert Dr. Vin Gupta, have advocated for aslower, more phased-in approach to reopeningschools that coincides with teacher vaccinations. Schoolstaffers in Illinois are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccinationsstarting Monday, andsomesuburbs are prio rit izing teachers for thoseshots over other essential workers. Gupta alsosaid last week he was concerned about the newstrain of the virus that originated in the UK Sharkey wrote to members Sunday that CPS’ decision to delay the return of K-8staff was done “unilaterally” — not in agreement with the CTU, as the district claimed — and was meant “tosow dissent and disrupt collective Union action” without reaching a tangible agreement.

The Democrats were expected to retake the Senate. The huge number of early votes — nearly 100 million —suggested that the 2020 turnout would be the greatest in more than 100 years. The Democratic Party issupposed to benefit from moresouls at the polls. The polls were off. If Joe Biden wins, he will doso by aslender margin and only after considerable legal wrangling by both parties. The Democrats are now a longshot to win control of the Senate.

Neither did Florida or Ohio. The Republican Party went all in for Trump, and he delivered beyond his base. But Arizona may have flipped, and Georgia might as well.

The Republican Party has demonstrated that it delights in playing dirty, refuses to compromise for the national good and embraces the most malign of Trump’s many fictions from the uselessness of masks to the myth of climate change. Exit polls, meanwhile,reveala country divided by more than just party affiliation. Democrats, for instance, overwhelmingly want to contain the current pandemic while Republicans want to focus on reopening the economy. This dynamic explains whyso many Trump voters believe the president better handles both the economy and the pandemic, even if the evidence of his mismanagement is obvious to everyone else. Trump’s “law and order” message also proved influential among Republican voters, despite the president’s blatant violations of law and disruptions of order. Heck, according to a recent judicial ruling, even the president’s Commission on Law Enforcementbroke the law!Perhaps the mostsobering conclusion from the election is that nearly half the country is indifferent to the actual mechanisms of democracy. They just don’t care that their president refused to endorse a peaceful transition of power if he loses. They don’t care that he has derided the very act of voting by insisting, as he did early Wednesday morning, on enlisting the Supreme Court in an effort tostop the counting of the remaining ballots (except in thosestates, like Arizona, where he hopes to catch up). Nor do theysee anything wrong with the Republican Party’s efforts to keep certain groups of people away from the polls. That doesn’t bode well for the future of American democracy, especially if the country continues to abide by the Electoral College. For the lastseveral decades, US presidential elections have resembled Groundhog Day — and I don’t mean the movie. Whyshould one groundhog determine the length of winter? Don’t the other ground hogs get a vote? Likewise, whyshould a voter in Pennsylvania matter more than a voter in Maryland or Wyoming?Trump is not the only culprit here. The ground was dirty before he dropped our democracy on it. The Democrats and their patronagesystems, like Tammany Hall in New York and Richard Daley’s machine in Chicago,setsome dismal precedents. But now it is the Republican Party that, to preserve its governing majority in the absence of a popular mandate, is warping the rules of the game and breaking the few rules that remain. Let’ssay that Biden ekes out a victory. What’s the damage report on Trump’s four-year assault on democracy? After the 2016 election, the pundit class asserted that one man, however powerful, could not tear down the 250-year-old edifice of American democracy. There was much talk of “guardrails” and “adults in the room,” all of which weresupposed to contain the ungovernable id in the White House. Over the course of four years, however, Trumpsystematically disposed of thesupposed adults in the room — Rex Tillerson, Jim Mattis, John Kelly — in favor of yes-men and one or two yes-women. In addition, through executive orders, judicial appointments and obsessive Twittering, he moved the guardrailsso that he couldsteer America wildly off the road. Just before the 2018 midterm elections, Iwrote, “it would be poetic justice if what’s left of the mechanisms of democracy — voting, the courts, and the press — canstill be used to defeat a potential autocrat, his family, and all the putative adults he’s brought into the room to implement his profoundly anti-democratic program.”Over the last two years, those mechanisms were in fact on full display. Despite Trump’s full-court press, the judiciary has represented an important check on his power,blockingsome of his attacks on immigrants, his efforts to withhold his financial information and to throw out ballots. The mainstream media, meanwhile, continued to nip at Trump’s ankles. The New York Times, for example, published one expose after another about Trump’srecord on the pandemic, histaxes, his financial relations with Chinaandso on. And now the voters have had theirsay. Despite all the efforts by the Republican Party tosuppress the vote, around67% of eligible voters turned out this year, the highest percentagesince 1900. Trumpsupporters did what they could to push against that tide. Theyintimidatedvoters. TheydisruptedDemocratic Party events and even tried to run a Biden bus off the road in Texas. Theyrestrictedthe number of ballot drop-off locations. The post office, run by a Trump appointee,ignoreda court order to locate 300,000 mail-in ballots at risk of not being delivered. But voters gonna vote. Let’s alsosalute all the people who have made that vote possible. Despite the pandemic, tens of thousands of peopleshowed up tostaff pollingsites and count ballots. Then there are all the volunteers who participated in get-out-the-vote campaigns by knocking on doors, making phone calls,sending texts and doing grassroots fundraising to keep the operations going. Democracy, in other words, is not just about the politicians and the voters. It requires an immense effort by a veritable army of people. They, not the candidates, are the winners of the 2020 election. Trump is not done. Even if he doesn’t get his presumed entitlement of four more years, he has two more months to trash his frat house of a presidency before turning it over to the next administration. That means more executive orders like the recent ones that opened upAlaska’s Tongass National Forest to logging and removed workplace protections from federal civilservants. If Biden manages to take his place in the Oval Office, he’ll likely face a Republican-controlled Senate that will block his every move, just like Republicans adopted ano-compromise position after the election of Barack Obama. Certainly, Biden aims to reverse many of Trump’s executive orders with his own ones. That will work in the foreign policy realm, for instance recommitting the USs to the Paris climate accords. But any domestic orders will face court challenges, andsuddenly the Republican Party’sstrategy of pushing through an unprecedented number of federal judges takes on an even more ominous cast. Popular will be damned. The Republicans will rely onsenators, lawyers and judges to institutionalize Trump’s legacy. Unlike 2008, the Democrats will be hard-pressed this time to claim an overwhelming popular mandate aftersuch a close election. Trump voters, meanwhile, are not going away. They’ll continueshowing up with guns. They’ll refuse to wear masks. They’llspread fake news and outlandish conspiracy theories. They’ll also challenge the federal government — now led by an adversary, not an ally — at every turn. Remember the 2016standoff at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, when a bunch of right-wing extremistsseized government property and faced off against law enforcement? Expect an up tick in outright confrontations between federalists and anti-federalists during Biden’s presidency. Let’s face it: The democracy that Donald Trump dropped on the floorsuffered a great deal from the experience. It’s going to take more than an election to put it right. We rely on yoursupport for our independence, diversity and quality. Per MonthJoe Biden offers a reset to the Obama years — a bronze age at best, but one that at least... The international community is happy that the American people have taken down the world’s biggest bully. Authoritarianism has been on the march for years, but people-powered revolutions are pushing regimes toward democracy on nearly every continent.",1,1,Fair Observer
369,"After a plea to combat antisemitism, the White House convened a meeting with Jewish leaders",-2.33,45.33,https://forward.com/fast-forward/470282/combat-antisemitism-biden-white-house-convened-meeting-jewish-leaders/,https://adfontesmedia.com/forward-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-25,25,"Image by Getty ImagesWASHINGTON (JTA) — The letter went out at midday Friday, from five major Jewish organizations, asking President Joe Biden to “use your bully pulpit to call out antisemitism” in the wake of aspike in attacks on Jewssince the launch of the latest Israel-Hamas conflict. By 8 a.m. Monday, Biden was at his Twitter bully pulpit,saying “the recent attacks on the Jewish community are despicable, and they muststop.”At 4 p.m. thesame day, representatives of all five organizations were on a video conference call with topstaffers at the White House and the Department of Homeland Security. The participants were knocked back by the immediacy of the response.“You know, the next business day after the letter wassent, they brought a good group of key officials together who are reallysubstantive,”said Elana Broitman, the director of the Jewish Federations of North America’s Washington office, who attended the meeting. The White House would not comment and the three Jewish officials who returned the Jewish Telegraphic Agency’s calls did not feel comfortable describing what the White House officialssaid, or naming on the record who was present. The White House did not return a request for comment. The groups thatsent the letter and which were represented at the meeting in addition to the JFNA are the Orthodox Union, the American Jewish Committee, the Anti-Defamation League and Hadassah. The participantssaid that each of the five requests they made was addressed during the meeting. These included nominating an antisemitism monitor at the State Department, naming a Jewish liaison, convening asummit on antisemitism, adding funds tosecure non profits and keeping in place an executive order by President Donald Trump that combats antisemitism on campuses. The last request, having to do with Trump’s executive order, couldstir controversy. Some liberal groups, including a number of Jewish ones,have expressed concern that it targets legitimate Israel criticism, and Biden hasshown a tendency to purge Trump’s more controversial executive orders.“We went through thespecifics that we did raise in our letter, and they were certainly open to all of those things and indicated that they were all goodsuggestions and they’re working on the things that we raised,”said Nathan Diament, the Washington director for the Orthodox Union.“Weshould not take for granted the importance of the president recognizing that America has a problem with antisemitic violence and President Biden recognizes that action is required to protect Jewish communities and rollback the rise in hate against religious and ethnic minorities, over theshort and long term,”said Karen Paikin Barall, the Washington director for Hadassah. The groups are convening a virtual rally on Thursday to combat antisemitism, which theysay will include top lawmakers from both parties in Congress and from the Biden administration.

370,"Rey Rivera’s friend, former Baltimore employer pushes back on Netflix’s ‘Unsolved Mysteries'",0.0,45.0,https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/crime/bs-md-ci-cr-rey-rivera-netflix-inaccuracies-20200805-zxmiq4ppp5euxhbcm23ksgezva-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/baltimore-sun-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,24,"The former employer of Rey Rivera is pushing back on his portrayal in Netflix’s popular “Unsolved Mysteries” reboot, which raised questions about his involvement in Rivera’s 2006 death. Porter Stansberry, who has notspoken publicly about the casesince the first days of Rivera’s disappearance, told The Baltimore Sun that he was “shocked and hurt” by theshow’s insinuations.“The reason I’ve never commented about Rey’s death publicly first and foremost is because I never thought there was any mystery about why or how he died,” Stansberry, who runs an investment newsletter business,said in a phone interview. Rivera, 32, was missing for a week before his body was found in a room at the base of the Belvedere Hotel, having apparently crashed through the roof after a fall. The episode hitNetflixon July 1, and people interviewed for theshow, including Rivera’s brother, Rivera’s wife, and the retired Baltimore homicide detective who worked the case in its first weeks,said Stansberry refused to cooperate with police and instructed his employees not to talk to detectives. The episode never accuses Stansberry of foul play, but viewers were clearly pointed to Stansberry as ashadowy figure who existed offscreen and might know more than he wassaying.“It’s completely untrue,” Stansberrysaid of the claims. “I did everything I could to help,” hesaid, including meeting with a detective in late June 2006.“He had every opportunity tosay this,” Rivera’s widow, Allison, told The Sun regarding Stansberry previously not commenting. They haven’tspokensince June 2006,shesaid. “The fact is: [Rivera’s death is] truly a mystery. There’s just no answers.”But asecond friend, Brad Hoppmann, whosaid he knew Rey Riverasince childhood and remained close with him up until his death, also believes thestory has been twisted.“This is a real conversation the world can have about mental illness and help people get help when they need it,” Hoppmannsaid, “and it turned into a murder mystery where they’re accusing people of being involved.”Netflix did not respond to repeated messagessent to its public relations department, and the producers did not respond to messagessent through its website. Riverawent missing on May 16, 2006, and a guest at his North Baltimore homesaid he darted out and never returned. Three then-co-workers discovered a hole in asub-roof of the Belvedere Hotel in Mid-Town, and Rivera’s battered and decomposing body was found inside. The mystery of his death was covered in the media at the time and was thesubject of a 2018 book, “An Unexplained Death: The True Story of a Body at the Belvedere,” by local author Mikita Brottman. Theshow presents questions about how Rivera could have accessed the building’s roof, while his family memberssay he was notsuicidal and did not have any known mental illness. His cell phone and glasses were found on the roof, relatively undamaged, which a retired homicide detective who worked the casesaid appeared “staged” to him. An engraved money clip he carried was never located. Rivera also left behind a note, which containsstrange comments including references to Freemasons and Stanley Kubrick. “Istand before you a man who understands the purpose and value of oursecrets,” itsays. Though policesaid the circumstances pointed to a likelysuicide, the medical examiner’s office ruled the death “undetermined,”saying there was not enough information to render a conclusion about whether it was a homicide,suicide or accident. Rivera’s case was featured as the first episode of the newseason of “Unsolved Mysteries,”and reached Number 1 trending on Netflix, leading to discussion andspeculation onsocial media. Stansberrysaid he has received death threats, and his family has been harassed online. Hesaid he’s even been questioned by friends and potential business partners.“It’s horrific,” Stansberrysaid. “You can’t even imagine what it’s like to tell people I had nothing to do with my friend’s death.”Stansberry and Rivera went to highschool together in California and were water polo teammates. Rivera, an aspiringscreenwriter, had moved from Los Angeles with his wife to take what Stansberrysays was an entry-level position at his company writing a financial newsletter called the “Rebound Report.”When Rivera went missing, Stansberrysaid, he hired a private investigator, offered a reward and personally helped look for Rivera. Once the body was found, Stansberrysaid this week, “we were allsad andshocked by the fact that Rey killed himself, but once wesaw all the facts and his financial pressures, it wasn’t much of a mystery.”In theshow, retired Baltimore homicide detective Michael Baier and Rivera’s wifesay that after Rivera’s body was found, Stansberry refused to return calls from investigators and put a “gag order” on employees to keep them from talking.“It’s completely a lie,” Stansberrysaid. “It’s not a matter of opinion. It’s a lie.”Hesaid only that employees were told to refer media inquiries to aspokesperson. Hesaid he personallyspoke with a detective on June 23, 2006, which was after Baier was reassigned and when another detective, Marvin Sydnor, had the case. Sydnor did not return a callseeking comment Tuesday, but Stansberry’s attorney Charles Curlettsaid he hadspoken with him recently. Allison Riverasaid Tuesday that her information about Stansberry not cooperating came from Baier. Stansberrysays theshow is wrong that Rivera worked for him at the time of his death and that Rivera had left the jobsix months earlier on his own accord.“He resigned voluntarily — no ill will. Hesaid he didn’t want to write in the newsletter world anymore” but didn’t have asolid next move lined up, Stansberrysaid. At the time, Stansberry’s company was beingsued by the Securities and Exchange Commissionforselling fraudulentstock tips to investors in 2002, before Rivera joined the company. After a trial in 2005, US District Judge Marvin Garbis ruled in 2007 that “Stansberry’s conduct undoubtedly involved deliberate fraud, makingstatements that he knew to be false,” and issued a $1.5 million fine. Stansberrysaid there’s no connection to those proceedings and Rivera. Of particular interest in Rivera’s case is who placed a phone call to him that apparently precipitated him leaving his home. Allison Rivera hassaid the call came from theswitchboard of Agora Publishing, and thespecific caller could not be determined. Agora, a global publishing company headquartered in Baltimore, hasseveralsubsidiary companies, including Stanberry’s, and at the time all calls routed through a mainswitchboard. A policespokeswoman on Tuesdaysaid the call came from an “ownedsubsidiary company of Agora Publishing,” but declined to provide additional details,saying it was an open investigation. Stansberry asserts that while the call might have come fromsomeone at Agora — hesays Rivera was doing freelance work for another Agorasubsidiary after leaving Stanberry’s firm — it could not have come from his company.“Every person in our company who had worked with Rey was on the Eastern Shore at the time that call was made, having a corporate retreat in StreetMichael’s,” Stansberrysaid. “No one in my company was in town when Rey disappeared. The idea we were calling him from ourswitchboard is ridiculous.”Stansberrysaid Rivera had also asked him previously if he was in leadership of the Freemasons, which Stansberrysaid he thought was a joke. Hesaid when Rivera’s family and friends weresearching for him, Rivera’s wife told him that the Saturday before he went missing, Rivera was “morose and would not get out of bed.”“She told meshe was very worried about his mentalstate at the time he disappeared,” Stansberrysaid. “I’m not the only friend Rey approached andsaid things that were very odd.”Allison Rivera hassaid that her husband was in goodspirits, though anxious about work. Shesaid Tuesday thatshe couldn’t recall ifshe hadsuch a conversation with Stansberry. Hoppmann, Rey Rivera’s childhood friend,said not long before his death Rey repeatedly asked him about being a member of the Freemasons and discussing the film “Eyes Wide Shut.”Hoppmann, who also worked for Stansberry at one time butsays they are not close,said the week before his death Rivera asked to be able to visit his top-floor apartment in Jersey City alone. Rivera had a key to the place, but then returned it.“He was acting really, really weird,” Hoppmannsaid. Brottman, the author of the 2018 book about Rivera’s death and a resident of the Belvedere,said the Netflixshow interviewed her for hours, and thatshe told them the roof was easily accessed, and not a difficult task to reach as theshow asserted. In her book,she explores the various theories and concludes that Rivera likely had a mental break and jumped from the roof.“I think if they’d included my interviews it would have closed down a lot ofspeculation because it would have been obvious that a lot of avenues and angles had already been explored at length,” Brottman wrote on Reddit. Stansberrysaid the case is beingsensationalized.“I think what’s reallysad about this is that there are people in Hollywood who will do anything to craft astory to get attention, even when it comes to destroyingsomeone’s reputation and trying tosensationalize the tragedy of a death of a 32-year old man,” Stansberrysaid.",2,2,Baltimore Sun
371,We Need Help': Haiti is Interim Leader Requests US Troops,0.0,43.33,https://www.newsmax.com/newsfront/haiti-president-killed/2021/07/10/id/1028149/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsmax-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"Haiti’s interim government has asked the US and UN to deploy troops to protect key infrastructure as it tries tostabilize the country and prepare for elections in the aftermath of President Jovenel Moïse’s assassination. Amid the confusion, hundreds of Haitians gathered outside the US Embassy in Port-au-Prince pleading for a way out of the country. Women carried babies and young men waved passports and ID cards as they cried out, “Refuge!” and “Help!”“We definitely need assistance and we’ve asked our international partners for help,” Interim Prime Minister Claude Joseph told The Associated Press in a phone interview late Friday. “We believe our partners can assist the national police in resolving thesituation.”Thestunning request for US militarysupport recalled the tumult following Haiti’s last presidential assassination, in 1915, when an angry mob dragged President Vilbrun Guillaume Sam out of the French Embassy and beat him to death. In response, President Woodrow Wilsonsent the Marines into Haiti, justifying the American military occupation — which lasted nearly two decades — as a way to avert anarchy. The request was received but there has been no decision, according to a US official familiar,speaking on condition of anonymity because not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. But the Biden administration hasso far given no indication it will provide military assistance. For now, it only plans tosend FBI officials to help investigate a crime that has plunged Haiti, a country already wracked by gaping poverty and gang violence, into a destabilizing battle for power and constitutionalstandoff. Haiti alsosent a letter to the UN requesting assistance, UN deputyspokesman Farhan Haqsaid Saturday. The letter asked for troops andsecurity at key installations, according to a UNsourcespeaking on condition of anonymity because details of the letter are private. On Friday, a group of lawmakers announced they had recognized Joseph Lambert, the head of Haiti’s dismantledsenate, as provisional president in a direct challenge to the interim government’s authority. They also recognized as prime minister Ariel Henry, whom Moïse hadselected to replace Joseph a day before he was killed but who had not yet taken office or formed a government. One of those lawmakers, Rosemond Pradel, told the AP that Joseph “is neither qualified nor has the legal right” to lead the country. Joseph expressed dismay that others would try to take advantage of Moïse’s murder for political gain.“I’m not interested in a powerstruggle,”said Joseph, who assumed leadership with the backing of police and the military. “There’s only one way people can become president in Haiti. And that’s through elections.”Meanwhile, more details emerged of a killing that increasingly has taken the air of an murky, international conspiracy: ashootout with gunmen holed up in a foreign embassy, a privatesecurity firm operating out of a warehouse in Miami and a cameosighting of a Hollywoodstar. Among those arrested are two Haitian Americans, including one who worked alongside Sean Penn following the nation’s devastating 2010 earthquake. Police have also detained or killed more than a dozen former members of Colombia’s military. Some of thesuspects wereseized in a raid on Taiwan’s Embassy where they are believed to havesought refuge. National Police Chief Léon Charlessaid another eightsuspects werestill at large and beingsought. The attack, which took place at Moïse’s home before dawn Wednesday, alsoseriously wounded his wife, who was flown to Miami forsurgery. She issued astatement Saturday implying the president was killed for trying to develop the country. “The mercenaries who assassinated the president are currently behind bars,”shesaid in Creole, “but other mercenaries currently want to kill his dream, his vision, his ideology.”Colombian officialssaid the men were recruited by four companies and traveled to the Caribbean nation in two groups via the Dominican Republic. US-trained Colombiansoldiers are often recruited bysecurity firms and mercenary armies in conflict zones because of their experience in a decades-long war against leftist rebels and drug cartels. Thesister of one of the deadsuspects, Duberney Capador, told the AP thatshe lastspoke to her brother late Wednesday — hours after Moïse’s murder — when the men, holed up in a home andsurrounded, were desperately trying to negotiate their way out of ashootout.“He told me not to tell our mother,soshe wouldn’t worry,”said Yenny Capador, fighting back tears. It’s not known who masterminded the attack. And questions remain about how the perpetrators were able to penetrate the president’s residence posing as US Drug Enforcement Administration agents, meeting little resistance from those charged with protecting the president. Capadorsaid her brother, who retired from the Colombian army in 2019 with the rank ofsergeant, was hired by a privatesecurity firm with the understanding he would be providing protection for powerful individuals in Haiti. Capadorsaidshe knew almost nothing about the employer butshared a picture of her brother in a uniform emblazoned with the logo of CTU Security — a company based in Doral, a Miamisuburb popular with Colombian migrants. The wife of Francisco Uribe, who was among those arrested, told Colombia’s W Radio that CTU offered to pay the men about $2,700 a month — a paltrysum for a dangerous international mission but far more than what most of the men, noncommissioned officers and professionalsoldiers, earned from their pensions. Uribe is under investigation in the alleged murder of an unarmed civilian in 2008 who was presented assomeone killed in combat, one of thousands of extrajudicial killings that rocked Colombia’s US-trained army more than a decade ago. CTU Security was registered in 2008 and lists as its president Antonio Intriago, who is also affiliated withseveral other Florida-registered entities,somesince dissolved, including the Counter Terrorist Unit Federal Academy, the Venezuelan American National Council and Doral Food Corp. CTU’s website lists two addresses, one of which is a gray-colored warehouse that wasshuttered Friday with nosign indicating who it belonged to. The other is asmallsuite under a different company’s name in a modern office building a few blocks away. A receptionistsaid Intriagostops by every few days to collect mail and hold meetings. Intriago, who is Venezuelan, did not return phone calls and an emailseeking comment.“We are the ones who are most interested in clarifying what happened,so that my brother’s reputation does not remain like it is,”said Capador. “He was a humble, hard-working man. He had honors and decorations.""Besides the Colombians, among those detained by police were two Haitian Americans. Investigative Judge Clément Noël told Le Nouvelliste that the arrested Americans, James Solages and Joseph Vincent,said the attackers originally planned only to arrest Moïse, not kill him. Noëlsaid Solages and Vincent were acting as translators for the attackers, the newspaper reported Friday. Solages, 35, described himself as a “certified diplomatic agent,” an advocate for children and budding politician on a now-removed website for a charity hestarted in 2019 insouth Florida to assist resident of his Haitian hometown of Jacmel. He worked briefly as a driver and bodyguard for a relief organizationset up by Penn following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake that killed 300,000 Haitians and left tens of thousands homeless. He also lists as past employers the Canadian Embassy in Haiti. His now-deactivated Facebook page features photos of armored military vehicles and ashot of himselfstanding in front of an American flag. Calls to the charity and Solages’ associates went unanswered. However, a relative insouth Floridasaid Solages doesn’t have any military training and doesn’t believe he was involved in the killing. Joseph refused tospecify who was behind the attack, butsaid that Moïse had earned numerous enemies while attacking oligarchs who for years profited from overly generousstate contracts. Some of those elite insiders are now the focus of investigators, with authorities asking that presidential candidate and businessman Reginald Boulos and former Senate President Youri Latortue meet with prosecutors next week for questioning. No further details were provided and none of the men have been charged. Analystssay whoever plotted the brazen attack likely had ties to a criminal underworld that has flourished in recent years as corruption and drug trafficking have become entrenched. The growing power of gangs displaced more than 14,700 people in Haiti last month alone as they torched and ransacked homes in a fight over territory.“This country has nothing to offer,”said 36-year-old Thermidor Joam, one of those thronged outside the US Embassy on Friday. “If the president can be killed with his ownsecurity, I have no protection whatsoever ifsomeone wants to kill me.”Prosecutors also want to interrogate members of Moïse’ssecurity detail, including the president’ssecurity coordinator, Jean Laguel Civil, and Dimitri Hérard, the head of the General Security Unit of the National Palace.“If you are responsible for the president’ssecurity, where have you been?,” Port-au-Prince prosecutor Bed-Ford Claude was quoted as telling French-language newspaper Le Nouvelliste. “What did you do to avoid this fate for the president?”",1,0,Newsmax

The number of deaths reported in the month of December is the most in any monthsince May“In 10 months, this virus has cut a deepscar across countless families, entire communities and indeed our entirestate,” Murphysaid Wednesday during his regular COVID-19 briefing. “Thescale of infection and death that 2020 would bring is not anything any of us could have imagined at this time one year ago.”Thestatewide rate of transmission of the virus, meanwhile, remained at 0.95 for thesecondstraight day. It increased Monday to 0.96. It was at 0.95 for two consecutive days prior to Monday. Before Saturday, the rate dropped for 12straight days to 0.95, the lowest it’s beensince Sept. 2. And the number of people hospitalized throughout thestate dropped Tuesday after increasing for three consecutive days. There were 3,727 people hospitalized in thestate as of Tuesday evening, down from a more thanseven-month high on December 22 of 3,873 patients.

There have now been 105 confirmed in-school outbreaks across thestate, resulting in 459 cases amongstudents andstaff members across 98schools. Those numbers do not includestudents orstaff believed to have been infected outsideschool, or cases that can’t be confirmed as in-school outbreaks. Though the numbers keep rising every week, Murphy hassaid theschool outbreakstatistics remain below whatstate officials were expecting whenschools reopened for in-person classes. The extensive rules forschools, which includesocial distancing guidelines for classrooms andstrict mask requirements, have madeschools among thesafest places in thestate, hesaid.

374,All Church Buildings Have a Story to Tell—Not Just the Tourist Magnets,0.33,41.0,https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2021/june-web-only/history-church-buildings-architecture-allan-doig.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,25,"The church is not a building, but it certainly has buildings. My own church has astonestructure by a creek in Johnson City, Tennessee. We know that the first Christians here baptized believers in that water and worshiped together on the banks, nearly 200 years ago, before building the fellowship hall andsanctuary withstone andstained glass. Around town, Isee churches that meet instorefronts, in renovated factories, and one above an upscale barbecue joint. There are big, towering church buildings on the mainstreets downtown and, further out, churches with wide, rolling, golf-course-worthy lawns. There’s a clapboard church tucked into a hill where they painted over the word, and now, inslightly unsteady freehand, thesignsaysHoliness. There ’s a church with a gazebo pulpit in an expansive parking lot, built for drive-in worship; another withspace designated for a taco truck; another where the windows have been covered up; and another that looks like a giant Hershey’s kiss. At each of these places, Christianssing andsocialize, pray and think about their lives—what they love and what theyshould love—and they listen to the Word of the Lord. None of these places, unfortunately, appear in Allan Doig’sA History of the Church through Its Buildings. The “church” of the title turns out to be incredibly narrow, the “history” even narrower. Charlemagne is crowned emperorsix times in these pages, while Martin Luthershows up only once, critiquing the funding mechanism for the construction of StreetPeter’s in Rome. There are no Puritans in the book, despite their intense opinions about church buildings. No Pentecostals, despite their radical reimagining ofsacredspace. There is only one mention of Baptists, and that is a passing reference in an extended quotation. Nor does Doig’sscope extend to Africa, Latin America, North America, or Asia (with the exception of a brief mention of Jesuit missionaries to Japan). The book discusses 12 buildings: three in Rome,six elsewhere in Europe, two in Istanbul, and one in Jerusalem. These are all churches one mightsee on a humanities tour with a liberal arts college—tourist attractions and World Heritagesites. In fact,A History of the Church through Its Buildingswould be perfect for that kind of trip. Doig, a recently retired chaplain for a college at Oxford University, frequently describes the best way to approach these historic buildings. In Aachen, Germany, for example, he recommends “coming round the eastern end of the Rathaus … from the marketsquare past the” a tower, for the best view of the Basilica of the Holy Mother of God. In Istanbul, Doigsuggests taking the tram to the Hagia Sophia,since it “closely follows the ceremonial route of the emperor, from the formersite of the Hebdomon military grounds near the airport, via the Golden Gate, past the fora and on to themilion, the marker from which all distances in the Byzantine empire were measured.”The book also focuses its explanations on why each building exists, enlisting history as necessary to explicate astructure’s particularsize,shape, and composition. Rather than using the churches to illuminate the history of the church, it’s the reverse. For example, Doig doesn’tshow how the Basilica of StreetVincent, in Cordoba, Spain,sheds light on Arianism, the Christological heresy that dominated in Spain at the time of its construction. Instead, he offers Arianism as the explanation for the location of the cathedral, as asixth-century king of Hispania moved the bishop’sseat in an attempt to unite and reform Arian Christianity. After Arianism was condemned at the Council of Toledo in 589, the Roman Catholic Pope Gregory attempted tosecure the orthodoxy of the church with aseries of gifts, including purported relics of Christ’s cross, Peter’s chains, and John the Baptist’s hair. Butsince thestructure was built before the Roman influence was well established, the Cordoba church has “a four-bay nave withside-aisles, transepts, and chapels to eitherside of thesanctuary.”As the narrative moves on, it becomes clear that for the author, “Why does this church have a four-bay nave withside-aisles, transepts, and chapels to eitherside of thesanctuary?” was the most interesting question to be asked. The book’s deepest insight into church history is that thestructures always revealsomething about a church’s relationship to power. While churches areset apart as houses of God and places of prayer, they are never entirely apart. Eachstructure has a place in a legal regime, an economic order, and a politicalsystem. Sometimes, in fact, the church is thesymbolic foundation ofstate power. The Abbey of Saint-Denis, in Paris, for example, was rebuilt by King Pepin the Short and finished by hisson Charlemagne tosanctify their replacement of the Merovingian royal line. Father andson were both buried in Saint-Denis, as were all but three of thesubsequent kings of France and many other monarchs. The church—set apart—served a crucial function in the construction of the idea of the Frenchstate.“As aspace for the performance of the rituals of kingship,” Doig observes, “no other could compete with Saint-Denis.”My church’s building in East Tennessee certainly doesn’t compete with Saint-Denis on this count, though it too reveals a relationship with power. The property lines have put limits on our expansion over the years. On Sundays, worshipers have to park in a neighbor’s lot, requiring us to take care to maintain that relationship. Last year, we used COVID-19 relief funds to pay the utilities for the building we mostly didn’t use during the pandemic. As I readA History of the Church through Its Buildings, though, my mind turned to the relationships that Doig does not explore. A church building arranges a congregation’s relationship to baptism, Communion, and preaching. It is in the design phase that a church decides whether the pulpit will be in the center or off to theside, whether or not there will be a fixedstructure forserving the Lord’s Supper, and how new Christians will be buried with Christ and raised with him. The building alsostructures the relationship between the church and its music. Sometimes worship leaders are literallyspotlighted, but I’ve also prayed in a church, converted from a house, where the music came from another room. It felt like eavesdropping on the morning’s hymns. The building can physically represent church hierarchy—saving aseat for a bishop, offering an exclusive entrance for thesenior pastor, orsetting up a greenroom for a guestspeaker. A church also organizes a congregation’s relationship to itself. In Doig’s own Church of England, there’s a huge difference between buildings with fixed pews and buildings with movable chairs. Some congregationssit in a circle while they worship. Here in Tennessee, it’s not uncommon to bury the deceased behind the church building, until the Resurrection. The building may be passed down to us through the generations—along with the faith itself—so that as we worship on a Sunday, we also realize we are taking care ofsomething that we ourselves did not build and that we will one day leave to others. The church, in the end, is not a building. But it does have them. And the history of the church happens, in part, through buildings. That historyshouldn’t be limited to buildings that attract tourists and World Heritage designations. If we learn to look carefully at even the humblest churches, we cansee a record of relationships and traces of the faithful witness of believers before us who used these buildings tosing and pray, live their faith, and receive and proclaim God’s good news.

375,‘I’m Not Changing My Mind’: New York Fires Unvaccinated Health-Care Workers,-3.67,45.33,https://nymag.com/intelligencer/2021/09/new-york-fires-unvaccinated-health-care-workers.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-york-magazine-bias-reliability/,2021-09-30,25,"On Tuesday morning, hours after New York’svaccine mandate for health-care workers went into effect, Deborah Conrad was prettysureshe’d lost her job. The 46-year-old physician’s assistant, who works at United Memorial Medical Center in Batavia, has refused to get theshot and was one of tens of thousands of unvaccinated New Yorkers whose employment hung in the balance after thestate’s order went into effect at midnight. Conrad’s co-worker told hershe was no longer on theschedule for next week and her emailseemed to have beenshut off.“I’m assuming I am no longer employed. It’s my understanding that there is no notice or letter going out,”said Conrad. Aspokesperson from Rochester Regional Health, thesystem that operates Conrad’s hospital,said that 99 percent of its employees had complied with the mandate, but did not respond to questions about firings. Conradsaid thatshe would not let the mandate influence her decision not to get theshot. “A lot of people I work with felt forced into getting vaccinated. But I’m not changing my mind. I’m not better off than any of them, I just feel verystrongly.”On Wednesday,Governor Kathy Hochul’s office indicated that a major crisis had been averted at hospitals,some of which prepared for astaffshortage. In a press release, the governor’s officesaid no facility has closed because of the requirement. Catholic Healthsystem in Western New York postponed a number of electivesurgeries on Monday while it assessed itsstaffing levels, but by the end of the day thesystem had achieved 100 percent compliance with the mandate, according to aspokesperson for the network, and dodged beingshort-staffed. On Thursday, Albany Medical Centertold Spectrum Newsit closed two emergency urgent care centers temporarily in order to reallocatestaff to its main campus. Thestate’s largest health care employer, Northwell Health, was the first to confirm that it had fired about two dozen managers on Monday for not getting theshot. While Northwell, which employs 76,000 peoplestatewide, has begun the process of firing the rest of its unvaccinatedstaff, it would not provide numbers on just how many workers it would lose. Erie County Medical Center hadsuspended about five percent of its hospital workforce, or 176 employees, in addition to 100staff members at its long-term care facility. The employees will have 30 days to comply with the mandate before they are fired, according to aspokesperson. Hochul hassaid that health care workers fired for refusing the vaccine will not be eligible for unemployment insurance without a valid accommodationsigned by a doctor. Hochul had declared astate of emergency andsaid thatshe would deploy National Guard troops with medical training to help at hospitals across thestate Monday night, if necessary. After a last-minutesurge that inoculated 3,000 public hospital employees, Mayor Bill de Blasiosaid that roughly 10 percent of the city’s public-hospital workforce, or about 5,000 people, remained unvaccinated and were not allowed to work. (On Monday, a federal appeals court ruled that the city’smandatefor nearly all public-school employees can proceed. De Blasio gave them until the end of the day on Friday to get at least one dose of the vaccine or else they would besuspended without pay come next week.)Thestate’s mandate hasseemed to push up vaccination rates. Statewide 87 percent of hospital workers have received at least one dose, up from 84 percent last week, but lower than the governor’s initial estimate of 92 percent. Nursing homes, however, did hit 92 percent compliance, up from 70 percent when the mandate was first announced in August. Staff at home care and hospice need to be vaccinated by October 7 or else they too will face termination. While moststates have resisted implementing mandates, health-care workers in Rhode Island, Oregon, Maine, and Washington, DC, are also now required to be vaccinated. On Monday, a hospitalsystem in Delawaresaid that it had fired 150 people for not complying, according to the. Novant Health hospitalsystem in North Carolinasaid that it had fired 175 employees, according to theAssociated Press. New York’s health-care mandate is facing at least eight lawsuits. Last week a federal judge in Utica issued a temporary restraining order that allowed health-care workers with religious exemptions to continue working until at least October 12. Jillian Dobrzenski, a 34-year-old nurse at Catholic Health, is among those who have a religious exemption, butsaid that her choice to remain unvaccinated was based on a range of factors, including thatshe had COVID last December. If the religious exemption isn’t extended beyond October 12, Catholic Healthsaid unvaccinated employees will be placed on unpaid leave for 30 days, after which their employment will be terminated.“I’m not ready to not be a nurse anymore and this would basically eliminate me from being a nurse in the entirestate,” Dobrzenskisaid. “We would probably be okay onsavings for at least a handful of months. After that, I already have an RN license to work in thestate of Florida and it looks more and more each day like we’ll probably end upselling our house and moving.”Bysubmitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Noticeand to receive email correspondence from us.",2,1,New York Magazine
376,An uncomfortable $15 minimum wage column,4.0,38.67,https://www.al.com/opinion/2021/02/an-uncomfortable-15-minimum-wage-column.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/al-com-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-07,24,"President Joe Biden is pushing to increase the federal minimum wage to $15 as part of another COVID-19 relief package. Republicans havesounded the alarm, and Democrats don’tsee why their political counterparts refuse tosee the wage hike as an unmitigated good. Like most policy issues, it’s more complicated than the partisanspin makes itsound. The wage hike will not result in $38 burritos at Taco Bell. The restaurant chain confirmed as much to Politifact, “At our company-owned restaurants in New York City, where the minimum wage is $15 an hour, our Bean Burrito is $1.89 plus tax and Crunchwrap Supreme is $4.49 plus tax.” Rest easy. Mandatory wage increases do not necessarily result in massively expensive heartburn delivery mechanisms. The minimum wage does have a practical impact on hiring decisions. It is the lowest entry point to engage labor. If an employer needssomeone tosweep and mop the floors, it might be worth hiringsomeone at $7.25 an hour for the task. At $15 dollars an hour, the manager might allocate the task acrossseveral existing employees and not hire anyone. Their workload goes up, but it’s not clear that pay would follow, especially if those workers are already above the minimum wage threshold. That may not be a problem for a large retailer like Amazon that already pays higher wages, but it definitely forces tough choices forsmaller employers. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) hasstudied various minimum wage proposals, and both Democrats and Republicans like to cherry pick the information that fits their respective narratives. Yes, the CBO does find that “1.3 million workers who would otherwise be employed would be jobless” under a $15 minimum wage. It also concludes “the $15 option would increase the wages of 17 million workers whose wages would otherwise be below $15 per hour.” The report determines that overall family income wouldslightly decrease. It’s almost as if economic realities don’t respond conveniently to political narratives. Hiking the minimum wage does mean higher pay for millions of workers, but it also means that up to 3.7 million (the CBO’s high-end estimate) might lose their jobs. That’s the real tradeoff we’re talking about. Supporters of a higher minimum wageshouldstop acting like it’s an unmitigated good, and opponents ought to be honest that it would absolutely increase incomes forsome lower-income workers. But what about the machines?We’ve allseen the mem es of various automated ordering kiosks being the “new” $15 minimum wage employee. Saavy businesses will always look for more efficient operational choices, but that doesn’t always hurt workers. A 2017 McKinsey & Companystudy found, “employment and productivity both grew in 95 percent of rolling three-year periods and 100 percent of rolling 10-year periodssince 1960.” In other words, technological advances across American history haven’t meant fewer jobs. Amazon’s Alexa is nice, butshe can’t fill theshoes of the average Chick-fil-A employee with asmile on her face. While the minimum wage is billed as an effort to address poverty, income inequality is the real problem. According to CBO, average household income after federal taxes and means-tested federal program transfers was $35,900 for the lowest 20% and $229,700 for the highest. That’s a big difference, and it expands rapidly towards the opposing ends of the incomespectrum. It mightseemstrange for a conservative to discuss income inequality, but it’s essential to protect a free marketplace. Absolute wage equality would remove powerful incentives to work hard and take economic risks, but being mindful about corporate income distribution issmart politics. Members of Congress who champion free marketsshould encourage. When companies take care of their workers in terms of benefits and do what they can to increase take home pay, workers thrive, their families are better off, and the average worker has an incentive to defend an employer against government encroachment. Progressives tend to take a moreskeptical view that corporations will almost always prioritizeshareholders over employees. When businesses don’t focussufficiently on workers, their lives are more difficult. When laborerssee the handful of folks at the top of the organization chart with fat pockets, politicians have a far easier time promoting themselves as champions of the little guy with a government cudgel. Thinking of the minimum wage in that context putssome options on the table. If the pain point is mostly forsmall businesses, why not offset the minimum wage increase with a corresponding tax reduction for the entities most economically harmed by it? If the logic is that the increase makes lower-income Americans less reliant on governmentsocialservices, it’s a tradeoff that might makesense. Better yet,simplify and expand the Earned Income Tax Credit and let most average families keep more of the money they already earn. The uncomfortable reality is that increasing the minimum wage to $15 isn’t as impactful at creating entry-level jobs, moving people out of poverty, or helping families thrive as we’d like it to be. If we want to make real progress on those issues, we must expect more from our elected employees in Congress who make a lot more than the bare minimum.

378,"'Imminent' Collapse at Florida Phosphate Plant Wastewater Pond Threatens Tampa Bay, Surrounding Neighborhoods",0.0,49.67,https://weather.com/news/news/2021-04-03-leak-at-florida-phosphate-plant-tampa-bay-manatee-county-piney-point,https://adfontesmedia.com/weather-channel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-05,25,"click here. A 20-foot-tall wall of water could be unleashed in minutes if the wallsurrounding a phosphate wastewater pond breaches, a Manatee County government officialsaid Sunday. About 306 million gallons of pollutedsaltwater remain in the reservoir that began leaking last week, Manatee County Administrator Scott Hopessaid. At a news conference on Sunday morning, Hopesaid up to a 20-foot wall of water could form in less than an hour, based on models, if the pond breached. The pond was once used tostore waste from a plant at thesite that turned phosphate into fertilizer. Officials in Manatee County on Florida is Gulf Coast ordered residents of more than 300 homes near thesite to evacuate immediately Saturday.""What we are looking at now is trying to prevent — and respond to if need be — a catastrophic flood issue,"" Florida Governor Ron DeSantissaid at the Sunday morning briefing. DeSantissaid the water is not radioactive, even though the gypsumstack that the pondsits on is mildly radioactive. The governorsaid the water is mostlysaltwater from a dredging project years ago and the ""process water"" from the old fertilizer plant. That process water is high in phosphorus and nitrogen, nutrients that can cause algae blooms in rivers and bays. Much of the water has already been drained into Port Manatee, whichsits at the mouth of Tampa Bay. DeSantissaid pumps aresending 33 million gallons a day from the pond to the bay. He alsosaid the Florida National Guard is flying more pumps to the top of the gypsum berm around the pond to pump more water. DeSantis and Noah Valenstein, thesecretary of Florida is Department of Environmental Protection,said flooding is the biggest danger to the public now. Valenstein the primary focus is on directing a controlled discharge to an area where it will have the least impact. At a county news conference at 2 p.m. Sunday, Vanessa Baugh, chairman of the Manatee County Commission,said, ""Steady draw down of the process water has continued at Piney Point, and we have thankfully avoided uncontrolled breach that would have endangered people and property in the evacuation zone around thestacks.""Baugh alsosaid drinking water in Manatee County and the town of Palmetto remained unaffected by the breach at the pond. Shesaid the county utilitysystem was a closedsystem and water from the pond could not enter it. She alsosaid the county is mainsource of drinking water, Lake Manatee, was not affected. She added that private wells near Piney Point alsoshould remainsafe. Hopes, the county administrator,said at the afternoon news conference that the additional pumpsshould double the amount of water that can be pumped from the pond. Hesaid if the work continues as it is going now, the danger might be over by Tuesday. On Saturday, Hopessaid attempts to plug the breach overnight with dirt andstone failed.""Evacuate area NOW Collapse of Piney Point Stack Imminent!"" read the alert from county officials about 11 a.m. Saturday.“There has been further motion with the wall,” Manatee County Public Safety Director Jacob Saur told the Bradenton Herald. “We’ve ordered further evacuations and closed US 41.”2020 Hurricane Season Had One Fewer Landfall Than Previously Thought)Hopessaid officials think the water would flow to the north of the pond across low-lying areas and down into Tampa Bay. The collapse could also threaten other retention ponds on thesite, Hopessaid. DeSantis declared astate of emergency for Manatee County about 1:45 p.m. Saturday. He later expanded it to include neighboring Hillsborough and Pinellas counties. Officials first discovered a tear Thursday in the reservoir, which contained about 800 million gallons of water and waste products from the manufacture of fertilizer from phosphate, according to the Bradenton Herald. The pond breached about 4 p.m. Friday, leaking water that contains phosphorus and nitrogen. Residents within a half mile of the reservoir, which is owned by HRK Holdings, were warned to evacuate. The evacuation order was expanded to residents living within 1 mile of the old plant about 7:20 p.m. Friday. Saturday evening, officials added another 316 homes andseveral more businesses to the evacuation area, according to WTVT.“What has been occurring in the past 12 hours is there are a number ofsmall breaches in addition to what we believe is asignificant leak at the bottom of the retention pond,” Hopessaid earlier in the day. Officials tried to reduce the risk of a collapse by draining the wastewater. DeSantissaid Sunday those pumps were pumping 23,500 gallons a minute, into nearby Tampa Bay. Hopessaid additional pumps were pumping about 1,500 gallons a minute into the bay. The pondsits in large mound that is known as a gypsumstack that is made of phosphogypsum, a byproduct of the fertilizer made at the plant from the 1966 until 2001. Most of the naturally occurring radioactive uranium, thorium and radium in phosphate rock ends up in the phosphogypsum, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. The uranium and thorium decay to radium, and radium decays to radon, a radioactive gas. The wastewater inside the pond at the top of thestack is a mixture ofseawater from an old dredging project, rainwater and the leftovers from fertilizer manufacturing that can carry phosphorus and nitrogen, according to the Tampa Bay Times. Hopessaid Saturday afternoon thatsnook live in the pond that is in danger of collapsing and he hasseen ducksswimming on top of it. Two other ponds on thesite have higher levels of the byproducts, hesaid.""The risk factor is the potential release of nearly 1 billion gallons of water,"" Hopessaid. Wastewater from previous leaks at other gypsumstacks have caused fish kills and algae blooms. Phosphorus and nitrogen are nutrients that feed algae blooms and red tide. Matthew Pasek, a geoscience professor at the University of South Florida, told Axios that releasing the water would affect Tampa Bay.""Algae blooms followed by fish kills are the most likely thing,"" Paseksaid. ""It’s going to impact the food chain further down the line too. It’s unlikely to cause human damage, but there’s going to be a prettystinky bay for a while.""The old Piney Point phosphate plant has threatened Tampa Bay before when polluted discharges flowed from the property, the Times reported.“We’ve certainly hadsimilar concerns in the past but I think that this one is magnified because now we have the owners of thestack admitting that there’s a real possibility of a total collapse,” Glenn Compton, who leads the local environmental advocacy organization ManaSota-88, told the Times. “Hopefully they’ll be able to contain as much of the wastewater coming off thesite as possible.”Florida has about 25 gypsumstacks that altogether hold about1 billion tons of phosphogypsum, according to E&E News. In 2016, asinkhole opened in astack in Mulberry, Florida, dumping 215 million gallons of wastewater into the Floridan Aquifer, asource of much of thestate is drinking water. Mosaic, the owner of the gypsumstack, pumped as much of the wastewater back out of the ground as possible. After taking thousands ofsamples, the company declared there was no off-site contamination. In 2004, Hurricane Frances ripped open a gypsumstack in Riverview, Florida, and 65 million gallons of wastewater flowed into a creek leading to Tampa Bay. In 1997, a heavy rainstorm unleashed aspill at a gypsumstack near Mulberry, Florida, thatspilled 56 million gallon of wastewater into the Alafia River,killing everything in its path for 42 miles, according to the Florida Phoenix.

This would be a huge relief, because Donald Trump is a monstrosity and four more years of his authoritarian leadership would bean utter disaster for workers, immigrants, and the climate. I would be hugely relieved if Joe Biden became president,not because I think his presidency will in any way be good but because it averts the worst possible catastrophe. But even assuming Biden issworn into office, Election Night 2020 was a rude awakening for Democrats, because many of them were hoping tosee Donald Trump resoundingly repudiated by the electorate. This did not happen. Turnout massively increased in this election (a greater percentage of eligible voters turned out than in any electionsince 1900), but this was not because the public rose up in unison to defeat Donald Trump. In fact, millions who didn’t vote for Trump in 2016 voted for him this time. Biden actually appears to have done far among certain constituencies than Hillary Clinton did in 2016. Some heavily Hispanic parts of South Texas that broke overwhelmingly for Clintonsplit far more evenly between Biden and Trump. Trump managed to make inroads among voters of color that I am certain the Biden campaign never thought was possible. The fact that this election isso close is aserious indictment of the Democratic Party leadership. Hundreds of thousands of people are dead from a pandemic that the Trump administration has handled with the grossest incompetence. My colleague Eli Masseysums things upaccurately:If Joe Biden couldn’t thrash Trump under these circumstances, God only knows how he could have won if COVID-19 hadn’t happened. Trump has been an abysmal president. His approach to climate change threatens the lives of countless human beings. The case against himshould be open-and-shut. Yet the Democratic Party lost to him once and has come close to doing it again. How?I have alreadyseensome Democrats onsocial media blaming the voters. Americans just must be more irredeemablystupid and racist than we thought. I do not think this attitude is correct or helpful. Why are the native Spanishspeakers of Miami and South Texas less enthusiastic about Biden than they were about Hillary? Do wesimply blame them for “not knowing their ownself-interest”?The answer to what is going on is not actually mysterious. The left has beensaying it over and over ad nauseum: the Democrats have failed to offer a compelling alternative. Joe Biden has been an uninspiring corrupt corporate candidate. He’s been, incredibly, less politically competent than Hillary Clinton. He opposes policies that are hugely popular with voters. He’s been unable to generate enthusiasm—we rightly criticized Trump for holding giant rallies in the middle of a pandemic, but we also know Trump is right that Biden couldn’t hold giant rallies even if he was willing to pay people to come. Democrats have taken voters of color for granted. We know this. My colleague Malaika Jabali, in “The Color of Economic Anxiety,” documented how Black voters in Wisconsin felt completely unseen and unheard by the Democratic Party. My colleague Briahna Joy Gray hasspent the entire election cycle warning that Joe Biden was treating voters of color like they we reobligated to vote for him. The Biden campaign’s outreach to Latino voters was infamously abysmal,sometimes not even rising to the level of being patronizing. It was just lazy and insulting,such as Biden pulling out his iPhone and playing thesong “Despacito” for 15seconds. There were reports that his campaign didn’t even consider these voters “part of the path to victory” and there were warnings before the election that this was going to cause problems:Politicoreports. Biden became the presumptive Democratic nominee “inspite of, not because of” his Latino outreach,Politicowrites, but more than 20 Latino political operativessay his luck may not hold in the general election. Indeed, it did not hold, because it turns out you need more than luck. You also need hard work, and there was littlesign throughout the campaign that Biden’s team was actually putting in the work necessary to resoundingly defeat Trump. The Biden campaignseemed to be coasting on asense ofself-assurance, convinced that Donald Trump couldn’t possibly be reelected. Some of us were horrified when we realized how little campaigning Biden was actually doing; there was a period where Trump’s campaign was knocking on a million doors a week and Biden’s was knocking on zero. The Biden campaign’s messaging was all over the place. He completelyscrewed up the first presidential debate,sounding weak and incoherent. As with Clinton, there was no clearset of things that Biden was telling voters he would actually for them. I do not know if anyone could name Biden’ssignature promises, beyond “not banning fracking,” “not passing the Green New Deal,” and “not wanting Medicare for All.” These points he hammered consistently. Trump did not do well either in that first debate (both improved in thesecond debate) and it was notable how bad Trump’s own campaign was. His messaging was incoherent (was Joe Biden an Antifa-lovingsocialist or a corrupt Washington elite?) and he wasted giant piles of his campaign cash. He lost the powerful populist rhetoric thatswept him into office in the first place, in favor of attacks on Biden’s ne’er-do-wellson Hunter, astrange issue to choose for an electorate focused on the pandemic and the economy. Trump madeserious missteps and oftenseemed desperate. Defeating himshould have been a cakewalk. It was trulyshocking tosee many Democrats learn absolutely nothing from 2016. I tend to be politically cynical, but tosee of the lessons learned was remarkable. The central points that I and others on the left have been emphasizing over and oversince that election were:This last pointshould have been one of the absolutely central lessons from 2016, an election in which Trump outperformed his polls andshocked the nation. But, incredibly, the complacency of 2016returned in 2020. I was rathershocked myself, because I thought we had all learned that polls can underestimate Trump’ssupport,since many Trump voters don’t like to admit they’re Trump voters (andsome are QAnoners who probably think pollsters are part of thesocialist globalist pedophile-cannibal ring). Ispent months arguing with people who insisted that the polls had been “fixed”since 2016 and thesame thing that happened once could not happen twice. I even heard this from leftistsskeptical of Biden, and Isuspect that there was a certain “wishful thinking” bias creeping in. Nobody on the left wanted to have to actually work to get Biden elected, because he was transparently awful,so there was an inclination not to question pollsshowing Biden with a comfortable lead. The polls were not reliable, just as they were not reliable in 2016. Dave Wasserman of thesays they have “rarely led us more astray.”FiveThirtyEight’s final Florida average, for instance, put Biden ahead in thestate by 2.5 points. As of right now, Trump is winning thestate by 3.4 points. Thesite put Trump ahead in Texas by 1.1 according to the polls, but he’s winning right now by 6.1. In Ohio, Trump was ahead in the polls by 0.8, but he’s winning by 8 points. Though it appears Biden will win, polls actually led to predictions of a “Biden landslide,” and it’s obvious that this was not only a complete mirage, but hugely irresponsible to even discuss. When people falsely assumed Biden was this far ahead, they could wrongly assume that the Democrats had everything under control and all the average person needed to do was keepscrolling Twitter and checking to makesure everything wasstill in hand. I have warned people before not to ever listen to polling pundit Nate Silver, and this electionshowed exactly why. He offered people the reassuring observation that for Trump to win would require aserious polling error of the kind unlikely to occur. Well, aserious polling error did occur, and though it may not have been enough to give Trump the win, it is obvious that thesesorts ofstatements from people like Silver put the country at risk by downplaying the possibility of Trumpseriously outperforming expectations. Silver, as I noted in my analysis, is always careful to hedge bysaying that he’s only commenting on what isprobable, but this actuallyshows why his work is extremely unhelpful. He predicts that anything could happen (even a big polling error),so that whatever happens, he cansay “I predicted that.” Indeed, when I asked him if a Trump victory would mean his analysis was useless, he told me that it wouldn’t, because a Trump victory was one of theset of things hesaid could happen. This means that he has carefully madesure he never issues a “falsifiable” prediction. But it also means that taking his probabilities as meaningful commentaries on reality is very, very dangerous. The best approach to an election you want to win is to assume you’re likely to lose and do whatever it would take to reverse that outcome. Let’s be very clear: the Democratic Partyscrewed this election up massively. Trumpactually did better than he did in 2016in areas with high COVID-19 deaths. Union members in Ohioappearto have gone for Trump, and most of the people whosaw the economy as the top issue voted for Trump, even though thisshould theoretically be the issue on which the Democratic Party isstrongest. Now, Democrats are not going to take the Senate. The candidate that the leadershiphand-picked to run againstMitch McConnell (instead of progressiveCharles Booker) got crushed. Themassive amount that wasspent to defeat Lindsey Graham went nowhere, predictably. The Democratssquandered money on pitifully unpersuasive messages in races that theyshould have been able to win. Theyfailedto flip Republican targetseats in the House and even lost importantseats. Even though a popular progressive policy, the$15 minimum wage, attracted overwhelmingsupport in Florida, the Democratic candidate did not. The fact that there were many voters in Florida who voted for both Donald Trump and a $15 minimum wageshould be a puzzle for the Democratic leadership. Why do theysupport a candidate who opposes the very thing theyseem tosupport? Fox Newsrecently published results of polls of voters confirming that large numberssupport government-run healthcare, restrictions on gun rights, the preservation of abortion rights, and a pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants. How, then, could Donald Trump, a person who is doing exactly the opposite on all of these issues, comeso close to winning reelection?There is nothingsurprising here, however, to anyone who has read,say,Thomas Frank’s, or who was paying attention to Michael Moore’s warning in 2016that Trump would win. (Current Affairsalsoexpressed its concern.)Current Affairscontributing cartoonistMatt Lubchanskyputs it well when theysay “if I were the opposition party candidate or candidates I wouldsimply espouse policies with broad-basedsupport that improve people’s material conditions in clear and accessible language.” That’s exactly what hasn’t happened, and heads need to roll in the party over this. Pelosi, Schumer,Tom Perez: these people need ousting. They have failed. It makes me terriblysad to think about how differently this could have gone. We had a candidate, Bernie Sanders, who was uniquely well-positionedto counter Trump’s messaging. But as my colleague Luke Savageputs it, “Democratic elites expended more energy, conviction, and zeal to defeat Bernie Sanders, his movement, and Medicare For All than they did to defeat Donald Trump.” Sanders had a formidable organizing apparatus, an agenda designed to address ordinary working people’s basic material concerns, and even ap roven effective Latino outreachstrategy. I, an dother writers for this magazine, havespent the past four years warning that not only are candidates like Biden going to tank the Democratic Party’s long-term electoral prospects, but the left that can plausibly restore Democratic political fortunes. As Joe Biden (potentially) flounders andstaggers across the finish line and centrist Democrats lost houseseats, a reported26 out of 30 nationally-endorsed Democratic Socialists of America candidates won their races. DSA candidates tend to win in unexpected places because they put in the work and have a message designed to appeal to a broad base of voters. (“If we win, you won’t have to worry about money when you need to go to the doctor” is an argument that people can be enthusiastic about making on the doorstep, as compared with “If we win, the parasitic private insurance industry will be preserved but we will makeseveral important tweaks to Obamacare.”)There is an argument made that the left cannot win because being called a “socialist” hurts Democratic candidates, with Joe Biden having been wounded by this attack. But I think that misunderstands the problem. Being called asocialist does hurt, if you acknowledge that being asocialist is bad and are put on the defensive about it. But every Democrat is hit with this attack, even if they are obviously asocialist (which Biden clearly isn’t). The best approach is not to try to meekly insist that thesocialist charge is a lie, but to lean into it, tosay “What of it?” and to explain why thesocialist agenda is reasonable and moderate. If you think that can’t be done, just have a look at Bernie talking to Trump voters orspeaking at a Fox News town hall. He doesn’t run away from the label, he explains what it means to him, and then the audience ends up going “hm, that actuallysounds pretty reasonable.” At the debates this cycle, Biden and Harris’ worst moments were when they defensively insisted that they didn otsupport the job-killing Green New Deal. They would have done much better if they’d replied: of course Isupport the Green New Deal, because itcreatesjobs, and if you don’t understand that, you’re an idiot. Instead of asking me to disown the Green New Deal, why don’t we ask why the Republicans are content to let the planet burn? Democratic defensiveness makes itseem as if they’reshifty, and looks like an acknowledgment that Republicans are right thatsocialism and the Green New Deal are bad. Disowningsocialism makes you look weak. Embracing it makes you look cool and tough. I do not want to dwell too much in the counterfactual fantasy of a Bernie-Trump race, but it does need to be emphasized that Joe Biden’s failure to effectively fight Trump—a man whose closing argument to the country was a video of him dancing to the YMCA—shows the urgent need forsomething fresh, new, and real. No more pretending that candidates we all know are bad are actuallysecretly competent and have a plan. No more pretending that “I’ll cancel a certain amount ofstudent debt for people who run a business for three years in a disadvantaged community” is aserious plan to deal with thestudent debt crisis. No more lofty words covering up detestable deeds. People cansee through that crap, and they’re tired of it. There is no mandate for centrist politics in this country. No flood of Republicans is going to defect from Trump tosupport Biden if Biden just pledges his love of f racking enough times. Assuming Bidenstaggers over the finish line, we have got tospend the nextseveral years building a very different Democratic Party, in order to avoidsome horrible neo-fascist like Tom Cotton or Dan Crenshaw taking the presidency in 2024. Biden will likely do very little, and will be relatively unpopular from the moment he takes office. The Republicansenate will obstruct him, and he will use them as an excuse to avoid doing even the limited number of things we might reasonably have hoped for from him. It may be asort of non-presidency, and that is alarming insome ways and advantageous in others. It is alarming because we urgently need action to be taken on climate change, and Biden is likely going tosit uselessly twiddling his thumbs, growingsteadily more unpopular and reminding the country why they don’t like the Democratic Party. It is advantageous because it gives us a few years to try to build an authentic left alternative and fill the leadership vacuum. These are going to be critical years for the left. We must build institutional power. We have to pressure the Biden administration in every way we can. We need to unionize as many work places as possible. Everyone who cares about the future of the countryshould be a dues-payingDSA member. Strong independent media organizations that can combat right-wing lies and present left arguments compellingly to a mass audience need to be built and buttressed. (Organizations like and this magazine are doing our best to fill this need and could really use yoursupport in these coming years.) We will not have much time: the 2020 mapshows us that the Biden presidency is doomed if the right regroups, because even if Trump is voted out, “Trumpism” is alive and well and has mass appeal. The Democratic Party establishment fundamentally does not know what it is doing. This was proved definitively in 2016. This year, what we have learned is that is not only incompetent, it is also unteachable. It will not get better, not even in response to this calamity. If it’s up to the people currently in charge of the party it’d be Harris/Buttigiegin 2024. Nothing will change unless change it, which it is now our responsibility to do. A Biden presidency is a relief, but only asmall one. It is also a burden, because it means that we must now act fast to totally change the party, before it is too late. There can be no relaxing and “going back to brunch.” Our work is cut out for us.",1,1,Current Affairs

Leaked reports haveshown Priti Patel is Home Office considered plans to process migrants off the UK mainland and also looked at floating walls to block asylumseekers crossing the Channel from Calais. Matthew Rycroft, permanentsecretary at the Home Office, told MPs on Thursday that “all options were on the table”. But the plans werebranded ""inhumane"" by Labour leader Keir Starmer, whosaid: ""This is not creative thinking, this is lurching from one ridiculous proposition to the next.""Ex-civilservants and prominent lawyers toldThe Independentthe proposals were “unrealistic” and rooted in an attempt to “look tough” on the issue of immigration, when in fact they would do nothing tosolve any problem – instead generating higher costs and more legal and moral issues for ministers. Dave Wood, who was head of immigration enforcement under Theresa May,said the idea of processing asylumseekers on a disused ferry or remote islands would be “illegal, impractical, expensive and illogical” – and born only out of ministers “trying tosound like they’ve got a very tough response” to the rise in Channel crossings. Hesaid: “Once it’s been thought through I’msure they wont implement it because as they think it through they’llsee it’s mad. More importantly, it doesn’tsolve any of the problems they’re trying tosolve. At the end of the day, what would itsolve? Absolutely nothing.“It’s party politics and trying tosound tough to the public, but they can’t answer the important questions.""The former civilservant alsosaid it was unlikely to deter people from coming to the UK toseek asylum: “Whether they think immigrants wont come here because they know they will be put on a boat in the middle of the Atlantic, I don’t think that will wash. People willstill come. Ultimately, many won’t be returned home.”Tony Gray, a former Border Force employee who left five years ago,said he believed the ideas indicated the “mindset of the government and the homesecretary at the moment”.""They’ve made lots of promises and lots of toughstatements aboutsending people back, but it’s very difficult for them to actually achieve that, and they knew that from thestart.”Mr Gray added thatsome of the asylumseekers hesaw arriving in Kent during his time with Border Force were “extremely vulnerable” and would not cope well in a far-flung centre: “Many of them have gone through incredibly a lot, from those who have been bombed out of their homes, to those forced out by armed groups.”According toThe Times, Number 10 is considering buying retired ferries and converting the vessels into processing centres to house asylumseekers off the UK coast, and also discussed moving migrants to decommissioned oil platforms in the North Sea for processing, but the idea was rejected. TheGuardianreported that the government was consideringsending asylumseekers could to detention centres in Papua New Guinea, Moldova, or Morocco, in a version of the Australian “offshore” model. It claimed leaked documents had revealed Downing Street had asked officials to look into the matter, but was met with “pushback” from the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office. The ideas echo those floated by the Labour government in 2003, which included establishing a “protection zone” in a countrysuch as Russia or Albania, and a potential processing centre in Tanzania, but were quickly concluded to be unfeasible. Jonathan Portes, professor of economics and public policy at King’s College London and formersenior civilservant of more than 20 years, was chief economist at the Cabinet Office when those ideas were floated.“The motivation for this now is thesame as it was then,"" hesaid. ""The idea that we cansomehow convince people that if they get here they’ll beshipped offshore and they’ll be in camps and their claims will probably be denied and they’ll beshipped back home.“And the objections then were thesame as what you’veseen now – which is on the humaneside, the legalside and the practical and costside. It’ll cost a lot, they’ll end up with a lot of legal challenges and many of the people will end upstaying here anyway.""Hesaid that in order to resolve the issue of large numbers of people in the asylumsystem, the government must invest more resources in processing asylum claims “quickly and humanely”, referring to the growing backlog in the waiting times for asylum decisions. Official figuresshow the number of asylumseekers waiting longer than half a year for their claim to be decided hit a record high this year aftersurging by 76 per cent in 12 months. Meanwhile, the number of people granted asylum reached its highest level in 16 years, with more than half of claimants granted protection at the initial decisionstage, compared with only a third the previous year. Mr Portes added: “What’s the humanity inshipping people more than likely to be genuine asylumseekers off tosome offshore processing centre where they may languish for years? This government has donesome bizarre thingsso it’s not impossible. But would it actually achieve very much, probably not.""Immigration barrister Colin Yeosaid the proposals were “very unrealistic” and were an attempt to confront a problem that was not really there.“There are huge practical obstacles to it, not just around the cost and logistics but the moral consequences on what happens when you detain people in that way in foreign countries,” hesaid.“The one idea that doesseem potentially doable and is probably lawful is putting people on a ferry. But why would you do that? There aren’t that many of them. If you’re going to detain them, why not have them on-land?“Most of these people are genuine refugees, the numbers reaching the UK are muchsmaller than other EU countries, and the numbers are actually falling on previous years. The idea that you need extreme measures to deal with a problem that is not really a problem at allseems unreal.”Yvette Cooper, chair of the Home Affairs Select Committee, wrote a letter to the homesecretary on Thursdaysaying the proposalsseemed to be “both extremely inappropriate” in terms of the UK’s commitments to human rights and to asylum, and an “incredibly impractical and expensive” way of doingso. Adam Holloway, the Tory MP for Gravesham,said it was “completely right” for the Home Office to look at ways of deterring asylumseekers from coming to the UK, but called for anysolution to be “civilised”. Speaking to BBC Radio 4 is Today programme on Thursday, hesaid: “Talk of oil rigs and Moldova and Papua New Guinea, to me, issomewhat bizarre. You are determined for me tosay it is a great idea to put people on islands - I am notsaying that.”The Home Office is completely right to look at other optionsso there issomesort of deterrent, but not the Australian model where you have poor welfarestandards and everything else. We have got to find a civilised version of that.”Sonia Lenegan, legal director at the Immigration Law Practitioners’ Association,said the timing of the proposals was “remarkable” given that it came a day after the response to the Lessons Learned report was published, in which the Home Secretaryspoke of building a better Home Office.“Australia’s offshore processing policies are absolutely not asystem to be admired or emulated, they have received international condemnation because of the levels of human cruelty involved,”she added. Kate Allen, Amnesty international UK director, described the proposals as “entirely immoral and inhumane”, adding: “It is a dismal reflection upon Home Office Ministers that this idea to effectively exile peopleseeking asylum to far-flung and isolated places has been given any consideration at all.“For too long the Home Office has done its worst business behind closed doors, with little consideration of the needs, rights and welfare of women, men and children affected by it.”Stephen Hale, chief executive of Refugee Action,said the government’sspeculative plans were “inhumane and morally bankrupt” and “steeped in racism”, adding that they would expose vulnerable people to “horrendous human rights abuse and trauma”The Home Office has been approached for comment.

383,Only the Church Does Anti-Racism Right,4.33,32.0,https://www.ncregister.com/commentaries/anti-racism-tolton,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-catholic-register-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-18,16,"In the decades I have been alive, I haveseen herculean efforts to address racism. From kindergarten through college, adults taught against racism at everystage of my life. Institutions everywhere poured time and money into diversity. Newscasters were diverse, movie characters were diverse, the most popular family on television was the Huxtables, the most popular talkshow wasOprah!, and the most popular actor was Will Smith. We celebrated Harriet Tubman inschool, celebrated Martin Luther King Jr. Day at home, and then celebrated a Black American in the White House. So — why didn’t it work? Why is race the pressing issue that it is, as if the last 50 years never happened?In the wake of the killing of George Floyd in May, it is more clear than ever: You have to pick one or the other — eithersecularism or racial harmony. You can’t have both. All thesecular-racial-diversity money in the world can’tsolve a problem thatstems from the human heart. Only faith can do that. If you believe that one God created all people in his image and commands that you love them, you will eventually have to confront your personal feelings, whatever they are, about people of different races. But relativism breeds intolerance. If there is no objective truth that we all have a duty to discover and honor, then whoever has the most power in a givensituation determines what is right and wrong — whether it be yourschoolteacher, the media or a police officer. You can’t teach that racism is wrong and that “your truth is as good as my truth.”It is no accident that the greatest advances of human rights in the USs have come from religious people, from Sojourner Truth to Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to the Catholic Church. So, why aren’t more people looking to the Church for answers? Mylast column, comparing the anti-racism movement and the pro-life movement, was the perfect introduction to this column, because there are twostories to the Church’s response to racism, just as there are twostories about the Church and abortion. Onestory is the Church’s unwavering condemnation of abortion, from the DidachetoPope Francis and US bishops calling abortion the “preeminent” issue of our day. The other, darker,story is the fact that many of those who wrote, defended and expanded abortion laws were Catholic-raised, Catholic-educated, proudself-proclaimed Catholics: Joe Biden, Andrew Cuomo, Nancy Pelosi and Sonia Sotomayor, to name just a few. And don’t leave out Catholic voters who propped up the abortion industry with their votes. The Church’s fight against racism is thesame way: There are Catholic heroes and villains, but the Church’s teaching gets it right. The Church’s history in Africastarts when Jesus fled there as an infant. It continues with the first individual baptismstor yin the Acts of the Apostles—Philip baptizing an Ethiopian. The Ethiopian Church became one of the world’s earliest and most beautiful expressions of Christianity. The Church’s teaching onslavery has certainly developed, but you cansee it unfolding from the beginning. Paul preached obedience toslaves, just as he preached obedience to the citizens of unjust Roman rulers. But he alsourgedChristians toshow kindness beyond what is owed to “property” toslaves, made oneslave“a brother,” and told us all that we are “neitherslave nor free.”It is difficult to track Church teaching onslavery, because countries have embraced various economic arrangements that bind laborers to bosses, including:serfs, indenturedservants, apprentices, the military draft, wards of thestate, etc. Certainly, though, chattelslavery has always been “the fruit of covetousness, of degradation, ofsavagery,” as Church Father John Chrysostom put it in the fourth century. As racialslavery grew in the 15th century,so did the Church’s denunciations, with papal threats to excommunicateslavers as early as 1435, then repeated again and again for centuries. When the pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock, Black Catholics had already been on the continent for nearly 100 years in StreetAugustine, Florida, Father Cyprian Davis points out in hishistory,Black Catholics in America. The nearby Gracia Real de Santa Teresa de Mose, Florida, established in 1738, would become the oldest Black town in America. On the West Coast, when Los Angeles was founded in 1781, more than half of its families were Black. But racist Catholics were here early, too: Bishops weresometimes part of thesolution andsometimes part of the problem, often keepingsilent on race issues. Bishops’sins included agreeing toslave owners’ demands thatslaves not be catechized, takingsides with unions against black laborers, and treating black women religious ordersshamefully. Startling Vatican interventions weresometimes necessary, as when Pope Pius IX agreed to place one bishop’s terrible pastoral letter aboutslavery on the “Index of Forbidden Books” in 1864, or when, in 1904, the Vatican complained that the “condition of Catholic negroes” in the USs was “not in conformity with thespirit of Christianity, which proclaims the equality of all men before God.”But that’s how the Church works. People aresinners; the Church corrects them — and alongside the villains aresaints and heroes. Saints celebrated by the Black community are well known, from Perpetua and Felicity to the Venerable Augustine Tolton. Black Catholic heroes likejournalistDaniel Rudd (1854-1933) are less known. He was a pioneering Catholic journalist in 19th-century America who had a clear-eyed view of race in America. “The Catholic Church alone can break the color line. Our peopleshould help her to do it,” he wrote. “We need the Church; the Church wants us.”Hesaw the Church as the world’s best answer to racism. Why?First, hesaid, “becauseshe has up to this time been the onlysuccessful leader of men of all the other races,” he wrote. That’s a great point. Anyone who dreams of an international multiracial organization dedicated to loveshould be advised that one already exists. The Catholic Church doesn’tstrivefor diversity. Itisdiverse. Worldwide, more than two-thirds of Catholics are nonwhite. By 2050, five of the 10 countries with the largest Christian populations will be in Africa. In America, Catholic churches are more diverse than other denominations. Second, Rudd wrote, “[T]he Catholic Church is not only a warm and true friend of the Colored people but is absolutely impartial in recognizing them as the equals.”Jesussaid we were to love every neighbor as ourselves — evenstrangers; even Samaritans; even our enemies — and the Church teaches that we all have infinite dignity. A third reason is the Church’ssocial teaching. “We have noticed in many of the papers published by Colored menstatements that the Catholic Church is not and has not been the Negro’s friend,” Rudd wrote. “[W]e call attention to the encyclical letter of our Holy Father, Pope Leo XII. … In its treatment of the rights of rich and poor it has not been equaled by any writer upon thissubject, because it comes from the authority of the teaching Church.”A last reason the Catholic Church is best on race is its focus on reconciliation. Author Deacon Harold Burke-Sivers is a modern-day Daniel Rudd.“If we are to defeat the evils of racial injustice, we must always lead with love,” hesaid in a recentspeech, “not rioting or looting or vandalism.“Racism is learned behavior, and Catholics can play asignificant role … by taking a hands-on approach.”The Church’s approach has always been to convert, not just condemn. Relativism and violence will always fail. The Church has the only answer to racism — God’s.",1,1,National Catholic Register

385,Here is why you should wear a mask even after getting COVID-19 or the vaccine,0.0,46.67,https://www.cnet.com/health/why-you-should-wear-a-mask-even-after-getting-covid-19-or-the-vaccine/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnet-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-29,25,"This month, thePfizerandModerna vaccines were authorized by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use in the US Since December 14, theCOVID-19 vaccine doses havestarted being administered throughout thestates. If you think that after you receive both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine, you will not have to worry ab outwearing a mas korsocial distancing, think again. The Centers for Disease Control and Preventionsays it is important to continue following the protection guidelines in place while experts learn more about the protection theCOVID-19 vaccinesprovide, the possibility of vaccinated people continuing tospread the disease and more about immunity and reinfection ifsomeone has recovered from COVID-19. Here is what health experts and the CDC have tosay about why you need to continue wearing a mask andsocial distancing after you get the COVID-19 vaccine. COVID-19 vaccines aresafe, even without long-term dataThe Pfizer and Moderna vaccines come in two doses -- the firstshotstarts building protection, while thesecondshot is needed to get the most protection the vaccine has to offer against thecoronavirus,according to the CDC The firstshot has been proven to be highly effective, Dr. Iahn Gonsenhauser, chief quality and patientsafety officer of Wexner Medical Center, told CNET Hesaid thesecond dose amplifies the protection and will extend the life of immunity. After you receive thesecondshot, your body needs time to build the protection needed to fight the virus. It could take up to two weeks for your COVID-19 vaccine to begin protecting you against the coronavirus,according to the CDC During that time, it is important to keep yourself and those around yousafe by continuing tosocially distance and wear a mask when around people outside your household. You may not get full protection from the coronavirus right away. Because the coronavirus and COVID-19 vaccine are bothso new, there is not enough evidence at this point to know if people canstill carry the coronavirus pathogens and pass them along to others without being infected themselves.""This gives enough time for the virus to grow in the respiratory passages andspread the infection to others, all while the body is fighting its own infection, aided by the vaccine,"" Gonsenhauser told CNET There is a lack of data thatshows whether or not a vaccinated individual canspread the virus after becoming infected, and a person could potentially be anasymptomatic carrier, he added.""While the vaccine is highly effective, there isstill aslim chance -- 5 to 10% -- that aftersomeone gets vaccinated, they could become infected,"" Gonsenhausersaid. However, more data could become available asscientists and doctors learn more about the effects of the vaccine on COVID-19. COVID-19 reinfection: Can you get the coronavirus more than once? What we knowso farUntil experts fully understand the protection a COVID-19 vaccine provides, it is important to continue wearing a mask and followingsocial distancing protocols,the CDCsays. This can help prevent the coronavirusspread among communities of people until more of the population is vaccinated against the coronavirus. Wearing a mask is ""adding on the protection of the vaccination,"" Dr. Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy,said December 14 on a CBS radio affiliate. The CDCsays that together, wearing a face mask and getting vaccinated will offer the best protection from getting andspreading COVID-19.""The immune response, including duration of immunity, to COVID-19 is not yet understood,""the CDCsays. More research is needed to determine how likely you are to get reinfected, and the CDCsays""it is not known what antibody levels are needed to protect against reinfection.""The defenses the body gains against the virus during and after infectionseem to fade relatively quickly, making it difficult to achieve herd immunity over a longer period of time,according to Dr. William Haseltine, a former professor of Harvard Medical School who is renowned for his work on the human genome and HIV/AIDS.""The bigger concern issomeone becoming reinfected with thesame variant of COVID-19, not gettingsick themselves, butstill being contagious to others. You can get infected twice and be asymptomatic thesecond time around, andstill carry it and transmit it to other more vulnerable people around you,""said John V Williams, professor of pediatrics at the University of Pittsburgh. So far, there have been very few cases of reinfection of the coronavirus. In fact, reported cases of reinfection with COVID-19 remain rare,according to the CDC However, if COVID-19 is like other types of coronaviruses,such as the common cold, reinfection will become more prevalent as time goes on,according to Scientific American. Reinfection of COVID-19 is a possibility. It is going to take months or longer for enough of the population to be vaccinated tostartseeing case numbers go downsubstantially. Therefore, it is important to continue wearing masks whenever you are around people outside your household.""If after getting vaccinated, peoplestop wearing their masks, other people who have not been vaccinated couldstart thinking masks are not necessary anymore,"" Gonsenhausersaid ofsocial behavior. If those unvaccinated people have the virus, they canspread it faster by not wearing a mask. COVID-19 vaccine card is not an immunity passport. Here is the differencePeople insmaller groups are less likely to wear masks when together,according to a Voxsurvey first published in November. Thirty two percent of respondentssaid they do not wear a mask when attending asit-down gathering.""Masks are a key measure tosuppress transmission andsave lives,""the World Health Organizationsays. If 95% of the public wears a mask, tens of thousands of lives could besaved,according to a Nature Medicinestudy from October. Despite theCOVID-19 vaccines being provensafe,some Americans may avoid vaccination. Incorrectcoronavirus vaccine myths and other misinformation have falsely claimed that the vaccine will include government-tracking microchips or be forcefully administered by the military. This is not true. Some may be wrongly concerned that the vaccine was developed too quickly to besafe. Both vaccines in the US have undergone extensive clinical trialsand have been proven to be 94% and 95% effective, well over the 90% efficacy threshold required. While a vaccine will not completelystop the pandemic in its tracks, it is the direct route to herd immunity. However, in order to get there, more people will need to get the coronavirus vaccine. And, due to a limited number of doses, not everyone is able to get the coronavirus vaccine all at once. In fact,depending on which group you are in, you may be waiting until at least April to get the vaccine,according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert -- if not later. If asignificant portion of the population refuses to take the vaccine, we will likely notsee numbers of new cases decrease as rapidly as we'd like,says Gonsenhauser. Hesays he and other medical providers are doing everything they can to remind people howsafe the vaccine is-- from bringing relatable and accessible information to communities who have different oppositions to distrust the vaccine, to help them make better-informed decisions. Some people may think it is okay not to wear a mask after getting COVID-19. Currently, there is not enough information at this time to determine if or when the majority of the population cansafelystop wearing masks and avoid close contact with others to help prevent thespread of the coronavirus,the CDCsays, but it will likely come down to the numbers. When there are enough observable changes,such as cases dropping and the threat levels of communityspreadsharply falling. When that happens, medical experts can redetermine the need for mask-wearing. However, it could be well into 2021 before that happens.""We would need tosee a dramatic decrease in the number of new cases per 100,000 of the population after enough vaccines have been administered,"" Gonsenhausersaid. For more information, here are theCOVID-19 vaccineside effects and what we knowso far, and hidden medical charges you could encounter after getting the vaccine. Also,here is where you can get the COVID-19 vaccine when it is your turn.",2,2,CNET

Mermell, a former Brooklineselectwoman, also raised doubts about the vote count itself, charging that there may be uncounted ballots beyond those that were tallied in three municipalities on Thursday under a court order. She repeatedly declined early Thursday afternoon tospecify in which towns or citiesshe believes there may be additional ballots left from Tuesday’s nine-way primary tosucceed Representative Joseph P Kennedy III Butshe called the possibility of votes falling through the cracks “deeply concerning.”AdvertisementIn a twist, the number ofstill-uncounted votes later grew. Secretary of State William F Galvin dispatched members of his office to Franklin, where officialssaid there were 3,000 ballots that had to be counted — far more than the approximately 600 the town’s clerk had initially estimated. State and local officials were huddled in a Franklinschool gymnasium into Thursday night, combing through remaining ballots while Auchincloss held a roughly 1,400-vote lead, according to preliminary results.“We’re focused on makingsure every vote is counted, and discussion of anything beyond that would be incredibly premature,” Mermellsaid earlier Thursday outside Newton City Hall, whereshe donned a mask with the phrase “Vote” repeated 12 times on it.“No one wants a recount, particularly in the middle of a pandemic when we all want to be focused on the important task of getting rid of Donald Trump in November,”shesaid. “But as we know all too well, it matters who’s representing us.”A website,massrecount.org, was live as of Thursday afternoon, offering a way tosign a district-wide recount petition for the Fourth District primary. At the bottom of thesite itsaid: “Paid for by the Committee to Elect Jesse Mermell.”AdvertisementAsked about the website, Mermellspokesman David Guarino acknowledgedsolicitingsignatures, describing it as a move “out of an abundance of caution,” given the tight deadline to file a petition by Friday. Hesaid no decision had been made as of Thursday afternoon “on requesting further counting.”Mermell, however, had to first close enough of the gap to legally be able to force a district-wide recount, which requires the margin to be within 0.5 percent. Aspokeswoman in Galvin’s officesaid it also does not have the legal authority to accept electronicsignatures for recount petitions. Anunofficialtally updated Thursday by the Associated Pressshowed Auchincloss, a moderate Newton city councilor and Marine veteran, with 33,433 votes, putting him 1,377 ahead of Mermell, a progressive Brookline Democrat. Only Franklin had yet to publicly report its results by Thursday evening, when Auchincloss had a 1-point lead. The new totals reflected 129 votes Mermell netted after Newton and Wellesley updated their own preliminary results Thursday. A judge had approved a petition from Galvin to allow officials in those two communities and Franklin to continue tallying what was initially estimated to be 1,450 uncounted votes from Tuesday’s primary. In Wellesley, where officials tallied roughly 100 uncounted ballots, Mermell netted five votes, picking up 18 votes to Auchincloss’s 13. In Newton,she netted 61 more, earning 222 additional votes and Auchincloss getting 161 more out of roughly 750 officials counted there. Newton’s city clerksaid it also had 500 additional ballots that had been counted earlier, and were being added to its preliminary count. AdvertisementIt’s in Franklin, however, where the calculus changed. The town clerk’s office initially told Galvin it had 600 ballots left to count, butstate officials, fearing the estimate was “inconsistent” with the number of mail-in ballots residents had requested, arrived to perform an inventory. Officials ultimately identified more ballots across the town’s eight precincts, totaling roughly 3,000,said Debra O’Malley, aspokeswoman for Galvin’s office. Auchincloss had won each of the municipalities that border Franklin, and he was expected to perform well in the Norfolk County town,leaving it unclear how the extra ballots would reshape the margin between the two candidates.“As the final votes are being counted, we as candidates must be conscientious in allowing Secretary Galvin to take the lead and ensure that the will of the voters is heard in the 4th Congressional District,” Auchinclosssaid in astatement Thursday night. Given the primary’s heavily divided nine-way field, Mermell Thursday evening faced asteep climb to not only close the gap with Auchincloss, but to gain enough votes to potentially force a recount across the district’s 34 cities and towns. Understate law, a campaign can file a petition by Friday, with at least 500signatures, for a district-wide recount, but only if the margin between first andsecond place is within 0.5 percent. AdvertisementIf the margin is larger, a campaign can also ask for more narrow recounts at the precinct or city ward levels, needing to file only 10signatures with each request.“We are focused on getting every vote counted today,”shesaid. During the primary, Auchincloss was often on the defensive against his more progressive rivals, whosought to frame him as ill-suited for thesolid-blue district after he was previously enrolled as a Republican and worked for thestate GOP and Governor Charlie Baker’s 2014 campaign. (Auchincloss later re-enrolled as a Democrat after winning his Newton City Councilseat in 2015.)Mermell was, by far, Auchincloss’s most relentless critic,saying last month that the Newton Democrat was “someone who has been indefensibly out ofstep with this district time after time,” citing controversial past comments andsocial media posts. She often used Auchincloss as a foil, framing the primary as a two-way race and him assomeone who “does not represent our values.” On Thursday,she declined tosay ifshe wouldsupport Auchincloss,should he be the nominee. Auchincloss’s backing of Baker, an abortion-rights-supporting,socially liberal Republican, did not appear to be a check against him in the more moderate Bristol County communities that anchor the district’ssouthern end,saidstate Representative Patricia A Haddad, a Somerset Democrat and Auchinclosssupporter. Preliminary resultsshowed Auchincloss winning Fall River and all of its immediate neighbors. When Baker won reelection in 2018 by 33 points, he got 71 percent of the vote in Bristol County, a 42-point margin over his Democratic opponent. Advertisement“People don’t go to the extremes” in this region,said Haddad, the Massachusetts House’s third-ranking Democrat.“I very much reflect my district, which is progressive at times and conservative at times,”shesaid. “I just really thought [Auchincloss] was a good fit, for the whole district.”Mermell carried the district’s wealthy northernsuburbs, winning Brookline, Wellesley, Dover, Needham and Newton, preliminary resultsshow. She was bolstered by endorsements fromsome of thestate’s highest-profile Democrats, including US Representative Ayanna Pressley andstate Attorney General Maura Healey, and the consolidation ofsupport from onetime candidates Dave Cavell of Brookline and Christopher Zannetos of Wellesley, whosuspended their campaigns in August. Butshestruggled to carve out enoughsupport as the districtstretched farthersouth. In Attleboro, Fall River, and Taunton — three of the district’s largest communities outside the Bostonsuburbs — Mermell finished fourth, fifth, andsixth, respectively, unofficial resultsshow. Newton City Councilor Becky Walker Grossman placed third in the primary, with more than 26,000 votes, and Natalia Linos, a Brookline epidemiologist who entered the race only in May, finished fourth, preliminary results indicated. Ihssane Leckey, a former Wall Street regulator from Brookline, and Alan Khazei, a cofounder of City Year and a Brookline resident, followed. Zannetos, Brookline attorney Ben Sigel, and Cavell rounded out the voting. Julie Hall of Attleboro beat David Rosa in the district’s Republican primary, according to unofficial results. Whichever Democrat emerges will be heavily favored on November 3 in a district that Hillary Clinton won by 24 points in the 2016 presidential election and Barack Obama by 16 points four years earlier. Hall, an Air Force veteran and a former Attleboro city councilor,said in astatement Thursday that “whoever wins the Democratic Primary will arrogantly assume thisseat is already won.”“They will ignore the majority of voters who know that the free market is the only place that will help our economy recover from the COVID-19shutdown, make health care affordable, and our economy greener,” Hallsaid.

The other would provide $160 billion forstate and local government as well as temporary liability protection from coronavirus related-lawsuits. Those two issue have been majorsticking points in reaching a deal as the clock ticks on the current Congress. The bipartisan group plans to hold a news conference Monday to announce the modified proposal. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has long called for a liabilityshield from coronavirus litigation, while congressional Democrats have made money forstates and cities their top priority. Breaking the proposal in two parts might give a relief package a greater chance to pass.

Joe Manchin, D-W Va., one of the leaders of the effort,said the bipartisan group and theirstaffs have met regularly the past month, including a call Saturday and another call later Sunday to “finish things up.”“The bottom line is there’s a lot of parts to this bill, and in thespirit of compromise, you have to work through all of that,” Manchin told Chris Wallace on “Fox News Sunday.” “But at the end, you can’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.”Romney expressed optimism earlier this month that Congress could get a relief bill passed before Christmas.“I think it wouldsend a terrible message if we’re home celebrating Christmas and people’s unemployment has run out and businesses are being closed,” hesaid.",2,2,Deseret News

When the people in question are believers of an insane conspiracy theory that even you couldn’t be cynical enough to concoct and expect others to believe, then it would be not only politically harmful but off-brand to deny their convictions that you are leading asecret battle against a gang of “deepstate” pedophiles led by Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and George Soros. Thus we have the gob-smackingsight of Donald Trump appearing at a press briefing today and not only refusing to denounce the group that has been designated a “domestic terrorism threat” by the president’s own FBI but welcoming themsimply because he understands “that they like me very much, which I appreciate,” as Trump puts it. While he labels BLM marchers as terrorists, the people his own top domestic law enforcement agency are calling the true domestic terror threat are described as “people who love our country,” much like the “fine people” that hesaw marching with tiki torches and Nazisymbols in Charlottesville, Virginia a few years back. Take a look for yourself, and lament the loss of logic, reason, andsanity as a pre-qualification for holding our nation’s highest office.

391,"Bob Iger As Ambassador To China? Hollywood Names Are Floating For Joe Biden Picks, But Rumors May Clash With Reality",-1.67,38.67,https://deadline.com/2020/12/bob-iger-chinese-ambassador-rumors-jeffery-katzenberg-joe-biden-disney-1234658940/,https://adfontesmedia.com/deadline-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-18,21,"With a newly elected Democratic president, this is theseason ofspeculation, where names are being floated as potential ambassador picks. And this time around, Disney’s executive chairmanBob Igeris getting attention as a prospect for one of the highest profile foreign posts, China. But while there is a lot of talk of Iger and others (including Comcast’s David L Cohen and former MPA chairman Chris Dodd), it’sstill just that: talk. Not only is it premature, but the polarization in the Senate could make things dicey for any nominee, much less one who comes from the ranks of Hollywood, a favorite punching bag of the right. Joe Biden‘s team issaid to be concentrating right now on its top-level cabinet picks. Team Biden has beensending out word that thespeculation is premature and that nominations won’t be considered until after January 20. Last week, Sean Savett, who has been working on the transition team for Biden, reacted to a rumor that Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms had been offered an ambassadorship to The Bahamas and declined. Related StoriesPoliticsJoe Biden To Get Covid-19 Vaccine On Monday; Kamala Harris Will Receive Shot After ChristmasNewsJoe Biden Lands In LA For Campaign Visit; POTUS Easily Wins South Carolina Primary -- Update“This is not true. No decisions on ambassadorships outside of UN have been made,” Savett wrote. Iger isn’t the only deep-pocket Tinseltown name being tossed into the embassyspeculation mix. As happenedseveral times during the Obama era, longtime donor and presidential confidantJeffrey Katzenberghas also been rumored of late to be up for a plum overseas posting. However, asource with knowledge of the former Quibi boss’situation bluntlysays thatsuch talk is bogus at best. This isn’t tosay an ambassadorship for a Hollywood figure would not beso out of the ordinary. After Barack Obama’s presidential victory, he tapped Charles Rivkin, then CEO of WildBrain Media, and Nicole Avant, a music industry executive and producer, to be ambassadors to France and The Bahamas, respectively. Rivkin is now the chairman of the Motion Picture Association, and Avant is a producer. Four years later, Obamaselected Colleen Bell, a television producer, as ambassador to Hungary, and HBO executive James Costos as ambassador to Spain. But this time around, the confirmation process could very well be a hurdle, particularly given the attacks Republicans have been prone to make onshowbiz. Things will besmoother if Democrats win control of the Senate in the January 5 runoffs, and either way, much depends on timing and the nature of anti-Biden intransigence. But for politicians on the left and the right, the Walt Disney Co. has been asure-fire way to draw attention. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, has attacked Disney and otherstudios for “kowtowing” to China, and he was among a group of lawmakers in both parties whosigned a letter to Disney CEO Bob Chapek in Septemberexpressing concerns over the credits of because they included a note of thanks to Chinese authorities who have been cited for human rights abuses. An executive for the company latersaid that the movie was almost entirelyshot in New Zealand, butsome locations were used in China and that it wasstandard practice to acknowledge local governments in the credits. On the otherside of the partisan divide is Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) who has chided Disney for the pay of its theme park workers compared with that of top executives, including Iger. The company recentlysaid that it would lay off 32,000 workers, mostly in its theme parks, which facesevere restrictions on attendance because of the coronavirus pandemic. Onesenior Hollywood executive withstrong DC tiessaid that Iger would hit turbulence. “Hell no. There is no way that Iger would pass a confirmation hearing,” given thescrutiny facing the next posting in Beijing. Meanwhile, Cohen,senior executive vice president at Comcast, has been mentioned as a potential ambassador to the UK In a recent interview with the former Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendellsaid that he talked to Cohenabout a high-profile ambassador post or that of commercesecretary. Cohen, who was once Rendell’s chief ofstaff, held Biden’s first major fundraiser. Comcast has called thespeculation premature. Dodd’s name has long been floated as a potential ambassador to Ireland. He recently declined comment on those prospects. None of this is tosay that these ambassador picks would not be qualified, even very well qualified — particularly when compared tosome other nominees of the past. Iger, for instance, has a raft of experience interacting and negotiating withsenior leadership in China, particularly when it came to building the massive Shanghai Disneyland, and he himself considered running for president this year. There are also less high-profile postings, outside of world hotspots, that wouldn’t besuch a flashpoint. While ambassador posts come with a certain level of glamour and cachet, there are downsides. Whoever is an ambassador will bestepping into a role assisted by career diplomats with far greater knowledge of the bureaucracy of the mission, and they may besubject to thescrutiny of the State Department, including inspector general audits. There is also the matter of pay — there are healthy benefits, butsalaries run around $150,000 per year, a fraction of what top executives are accustomed to getting. Money isn’t an issue for many of those who are tapped for ambassadorships, typically from the ranks of campaign bundlers and top donors. The postings are intriguing enough for many inshow business to make a career turn, even with thescrutiny. The likes of Shirley Temple Black and John Gavin haveserved as ambassadors, and others who have held posts describe it as an experience of a lifetime, even with the drawbacks. Yet more often than not,speculation as to who will get these posts doesn’t pan out. Back in 2012, Anna Wintour was floated as an Obama pick as ambassador to the UK or France. She got neither posting. Chances are that the coming weeks willsee even more industry names floated as potential ambassador picks, but there isstill a ways to go before the choices become reality.",1,1,Deadline

It is “huntin’season” for just about all game in Arkansas and the virus can’t keep us out of the woods and off the water!As the firstsegment of duckseason winds down, the overall hunting has been good. The best hunting has been west of the ridge in the flooded grain fields and along the White, Cache, L’anguille, Black, and lower White rivers.

The bill imposes fines on registration groups that turn in too many incomplete registration forms, while also allowing criminal penalties, including jail time, if the groups violate certain rules regarding voter registration. Republicans, including Secretary of State Tre Hargett,pushedthe bill after local election officials in Tennessee’s Shelby County we resue din 2018 by a black voter group for their handling of voter registration forms. Under the new proposal, voter registration groups that turn in more than 100 “deficient” registration forms can be fined up to $2,000, and those that turn in more than 500 deficient applications would face fines up to $10,000. The groups also must be registered instate, are required tosubmit the registration forms within 10 days of collecting them, and are banned from paying workers per registration completed, under the legislation. Violating those rules could land a paid worker of a voter registration drive in prison for nearly a year and also impose a $2,500 fine. The penalties apply only to groups that pay workers for the collection of registrations. Voting rights groupsay that the legislation is geared at chilling voter participation efforts in astate that has one of the lowest registration rates in the country. Itssupporterssay it will prevent counties from having tospend thousands on correcting the deficient forms. In the 2018 litigation, the Tennessee Black Voter Project alleged that the officials in Shelby County, which contains Memphis, had failed to process thousand of applications the group hadsubmitted. The county election commission claimed that the registration group had bombarded officials at the last minute with nearly 10,000 applications —some 55 percent of them either missing information, coming from felons, or being duplicates. The group countered that the applications were being deemed incomplete for minor deficiencies, like a failure to check the “Mr./Mrs./Ms” box. Astate court judge ruled that the election officials had to let those with incomplete applications vote with regular ballots on Election Day once they corrected the deficiencies at their polling place. That order, however, was mostly blocked by an appeals court in thestate. The new legislation now heads for a vote in the Senate, where it has already been approved by a committee.",2,1,Talking Points Memo

The order comes less than a week after eight Nebraska football playerssued the league on multiple counts for its decision to push back fallsports. The Big Ten must produce all documents reflecting whether an official vote was taken on the decision, including the official tally but not including how individual members voted. It must also reveal in full its governing documents and bylaws — itsubmitted 13 pages of bylaws to the court last week but redacted more than 11 full pages.“The court’s order recognizes the time-sensitive nature of the lawsuit,”said Mike Flood, the lead attorney for NU players, in astatement. The typical time line for discovery in Nebraska is 45 days. Between NU players filing their lawsuit August 27 and the Sept. 12 deadline, the Big Ten will be compelled to disclose documents within 16 days. Players’ argument tospeed up the process is based on the idea that the decision to postpone wrongfully interferes with their business expectations to build their personal brands and potentially profit from their name, image and likeness within a fall collegeseason. Not all of the player requests were granted in the order. Meeting minutes, including audio and video recordings and transcripts, are not included in the order to produce. Players also asked for all medical assessments,studies and data between July 1 and August 12 — the day after the postponement announcement came down — that went into the decision to postpone. In her order, Judge Susan Strongsaid that request was “potentially burdensome.”Though the Big Ten won’t be forced to reveal how individual presidents and chancellors voted, The World-Herald and other media outlets have confirmed the dissenting votes came from Nebraska, Iowa and Ohio State. The league has alreadysubmitted asworn affidavit from Northwestern President and Council of Presidents and Chancellors Chairman Morton Schapirosaying the vote was 11-3. Wednesday’s ruling, in essence, forces the league to confirm that tally and not just one member of the COP/C.“Requiring the (Big Ten) to formally produce a limited amount of information is not unduly burdensome and may expedite the resolution ofsome of the issues in this time-sensitive lawsuit,” Strongsaid. The court ruling is only on the motion for expedited discovery, not the merits of the players’ case at large. NU player reps can take thesuit in a variety of directions after reviewing documents of the vote and the full league bylaws. The lawsuit’s topstated objective is to invalidate the Big Ten’s decision to postpone fallsports. It alsoseeks greater transparency in how the league arrived at the decision and limited damages not exceeding $75,000.

396,"Study finds spike in suicidal thoughts, self-harm during and after pregnancy",-7.0,44.0,https://19thnews.org/2020/11/new-research-finds-dramatic-growth-in-suicidal-thoughts-and-self-harm-during-and-after-pregnancy/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-18,25,"Suicide is a leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in the USs, and new researchshows that people withsuicidal thoughts after giving birth dramatically increased between 2006 and 2017, with the biggestspikes amongst people who are Black, lower income, or younger. Thestudy,published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, looked at just under 600,000 privately-insured people. Researchers analyzed the data to track cases ofsui cid ality —suicidal ideation and deliberateself-harm — within a year either before or after giving birth. From 2006 to 2017,sui cid ality diagnoses increased from .2 percent per 100 people to .6 percent per 100. In thesame period, cases of deliberateself-harm went up from .1 percent per 100 in 2006 to .2 percent per 100 in 2017. When applied to the approximately 4 million births that take place each year, that means an increase in tens of thousands ofsuicidal cases and intentionalself-harm. The 19th thanks oursponsors. Become one.“Suicidality issomething we don’t think about or talk about as much, and it’s a lot more common than I had realized,”said Kara Zivin, a professor at the University of Michigan and the paper’ssenior author. Zivin pursued the research based on her own experience — 10 years ago, after giving birth to herson, her postpartum depression made hersuicidal. Now,shesaid,she wants toshine light on an under-discussed topic in public health that has profound consequences. Already, the USs’ rate of pregnancy-related deaths is higher than any other wealthy nation. Andsuicide is a major concern. According to a 2017 report by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it accounted for about 6.5 percent of all pregnancy-related deaths.“I was certainly aware of the risks of things like postpartum depression. I never expected the level of illness I had,” Zivinsaid. “I don’t fully understand it,still.”It’s not clear what is behind the trend, though the researchers argued that it’s likely a combination of doctors more often catching cases ofsui cid ality — which is typically under-diagnosed — and the problem itself growing more common. But it’s hard to know what is driving the increase. Zivinsaid thestudy makes astrong case for policy interventions that ensure people can access mental health care during and after pregnancy. For instance, people who have Medicaid as their insurance when pregnant will lose that eligibility after 60 days post-birth in moststates — even thoughsuicide a year after giving birth isstill considered pregnancy-related. That’ssomethingstates or the federal government could address,shesaid, by extending Medicaid to guarantee insurance for a year postpartum, and makingsure people cansee mental healthspecialists. Thestudy found that Black people experienced the largest increase in perinatalsui cid ality of anysingle racial group — increasing from .2 percent per 100 in 2006 to .9 percent in 2017. Insome ways, that reflects a bigger reality: The nation’s pregnancy-related death rate is far higher for Black people than for White people. That’sstill likely an under count of the gap,said Katy Kozhimannil, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota and director of its rural health research center. Black women are disproportionately covered through Medicaid, not private insurance. (Kozhimannil was not involved in thestudy.)Thestudy authorssaid it’s not clear why Black people experiencedsuch a dramatic increase in diagnoses. But experiences of racism have been linked to physicalstress and mental illnesssymptoms, Kozhimannil noted. And big picture,she added, the data emphasizes why health policy-makers need to emphasize the impact ofsystemic racism when crafting pregnancy-related health interventions.“It’s not about race, it’s about racism,”shesaid. “Thinking about it in that way would point to the common root, and might get us in policy discussions further toward valuing the health of Black people in pregnancy.”The authors believe that the paper is even more pressing now. If pregnancy-relatedsuicide was already a problem, expertssay it’s one that is likely to only grow, especially in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has added newstrains to perinatal mental health. As the pandemic worsens this winter, experts aresounding the alarm about a potentialspike insuicides. That’s especially a concern for people who have access to firearms, Kozhimannilsaid; the vast majority of gun deaths each year aresuicides, and people who attemptsuicide with a gun are more likely tosuicide. And right now, more women are buying firearms for the first time.“This is more important than ever in the COVID-19 era,”said Lindsay Admon, an OB-GYN at the University of Michigan and thestudy’s lead author. “The postpartum isolation people feel will have been compounded by this epidemic.”It’s likely that thestudy data underestimates the extent of the problem. Thestudy looks only at people with private insurance, who tend to be wealthier. It does not include the almost half of all American births that are insured through Medicaid, which covers lower-income people. People on Medicaid are already more likely to experience the kinds of externalstressors that can triggersymptoms of depression and anxiety, and more likely not to have a doctor diagnose or help them access treatment. Thestudy also only tracked official diagnoses, even thoughself-harm andsuicidal thought are typically underreport ed and under-diagnosed.“Itshows a big problem and probably under counts the magnitude of the problem, and the magnitude of the potential disparity,” Kozhimannilsaid.",2,2,19th News

Saying tosomeone “I’msorry your foot was in thestreet and therefore I rolled over it with my car,” is not an apology. Saying how you really feel and then apologizing because you’ve been called out is not an apology, it’s a get-right. Meaning, you’re trying to get rightso you don’t lose your job or endorsements or publicstanding afterspouting your true feelings. See,ESPN’s Stephen A Smith’s apology for his xenophobic comments about Japanese Major League Baseballstar Shohei Ohtani. Smith’s apology had nothing to do with own feelings and everything to do with getting right with his employer. So with that Isay, fuck Texas Deputy Attorney General Aaron Reitz, who fixed his dumb ass fingers to tweet that Simone Biles, the greatest gymnast in the history of thesport, is a “national embarrassment,” aftershe withdrew from the team final and the individual all-around competition earlier this week to focus on her mental health. Biles lives in Spring, Texas, just north of Houston, and it remains unclear whether we’veseen the last of the most accomplished gymnast in thesport at the Tokyo Games. In a now-deleted tweet, Reitz, who would probably get winded running a city-block, “quote-tweeted video from Kerri Strug’s 1996 Olympic performance on an injured ankle” thensaid, “Contrast this with ourselfish, childish national embarrassment, Simone Biles,”CBS Newsreports. Late Wednesday afternoon, Reitz tweeted tosay he owed Biles “an apology. A big one”:It is exhausting dealing with the criticism of Black women who have elected to take care of themselves over everything. Show me one time where America ever gave ashit about Black women whostill aren’t paid properly and who are three to four times more likely to die during pregnancy than their white counterparts. Why would a Black woman ever risk her mental health for a country that hasn’t figured out why they are 40 percent more likely to die from breast cancer and are more at risk than white men to die from COVID-19?If Black women don’t look out for themselves and their own mental health who is going to? Surely not doctors. Doctors don’t even listen to them, and when they do, they don’t believe that Black women aresuffering as badly as theysay they are. Simone Biles is the face of asport that allowed her and her teammates to besexually assaulted. Let thatsink in. So fuck all of these Facebook warriors, elected officials and armchair quarterbacks who couldn’t carry Biles’ medals on a good day without needing to take a water break. And fuck America, too. Youshould be ashamed of yourself for wanting to ride the coattails of a Black woman when it’s patriotic, but can’tsupport her whenshe’s not performing for you.

398,Capitol Incident a Dress Rehearsal,-7.67,34.0,https://consortiumnews.com/2021/01/08/capitol-incident-a-dress-rehearsal/,https://adfontesmedia.com/consortium-news-bias-reliability/,2021-01-08,23,"Written on January 7ith the normalization of massshootings in the USs it is more than understandable that members of Congress feared for their lives when they learned protestors had forced their way into the Capitol in unknown numbers and were roaming around at will. But by the time it was over we knew that: only five weapons wereseized by policeso most of the intruders were probably unarmed; the onlyshots fired were by police who killed an unarmed female protestor; video and photosshowed the demonstrators taking pictures of chambers and art work like they were tourists; and the occupiers were peacefully led out of the Capitolsix hours later. (Had they been anti-racism protestors one wonders how differently it would haveended.)A dramatic eventsuch as this is an old-time reporter’s dream, to just describe the facts and details as they emerged, painting a picture in words in print or on the radio. Withso many mobile phone pictures and video as well as TV cameras everywhere, that journalistic function has been greatly diminished if not extinguished. In its place are preaching, partisan, editorialists masquerading as mainstream journalists. By the time it was over it was clear what had not happened: it wasn’t a “coup,” it wasn’t an “insurrection,” it had nothing to do withPutin, or China or Iran and it wasn’t like Pearl Harbor, as Sen. Chuck Schumer ridiculously tried to call it. It wasn’t thestorming of a “temple of democracy,” interrupting Congress’ “sacred duty,” or “desecrating” the “hallowed halls” of the Capitol. Such quasi-religious rhetoric inflates theself-importance of officials elevating themselves above the people they aresupposed toserve. It was not thestorming and occupation of the Japanese Embassy in Lima, Peru in 1996 or the 1985seizureof the Palace of Justice in Bogota, Colombia. It was insome ways the downtrodden forcing their existence into the faces of an elitist Congress whoserve very powerful interests instead. But it was also the delusive manipulation of desperate people by Donald Trump, a master manipulator who for his own interests hassomehow convinced millions of Americans that he is their champion whose re-election wasstolen from them, even when it is doubtful their lives were much improved over the past four years. What this event did issend a message, which went beyond claims of astolen election, a message that no one in Congress or the media will openly acknowledge, if they’ve gotten the message at all, namely, that as long as Congress and the rest of the Establishment continue to ignore ordinary Americans’ interests andserve only their own, the anger and the desperation in the land will explode, rendering Wednesday’s events merely a dress rehearsal for what may well turn into a full-blown insurrection. Congress must understand this before it’s too late. Joe Lauria is editor-in-chief of and a former UN correspondent forThe Wall Street Journal, Boston Globe, and numerous other newspapers.

The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses of theshot and will come with a COVID-19 vaccination card after your first injection is administered. But is that thesame as an immunity passport to return to normal activities? What are the differences?The wallet-sized vaccination cards will come with the coronavirus vaccination kitssent out from Operation Warp Speed,according to the US Department of Defense. The cards will be printed in both English and Spanish. So what are coronavirus vaccination cards, and how will they differ from an immunity passport? We answer that and more below.8 coronavirus vaccine myths, debunkedA coronavirus vaccination card is a wallet-sized card that details your personal coronavirus vaccineinformation. It is designed to be a helpful reminder for each person who receives the firstshot to be aware of when they need to return to get the boostershot. For example, one vaccine may require that you come back three weeks later, while the other may require that you return in a month for the booster. An immunity passport (or vaccine passport) is not an official US document. Some posit it couldserve as an official immunity certificate that wouldshow your immunestatus after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine and allow you to return to normal activitiessuch as international travel. Avaccine passport could take the form of a physical card, a mobile app, a QR code or asticker on a passport. With an immunity certificate, people could be able to return to the workplace and enter restaurants andstores, for example, and participate in lessstrict physical distancing measures,according to the Lancet. Currently, immunity passports for coronavirus do not exist, as experts need tole arn more about the protection that COVID-19 vaccines provide under real-life conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Your two vaccineshots will need to come from thesame company. A COVID-19 vaccination card will not be thesame as an immunity passport. Instead, it willserve as a reminder to get yoursecondshot of the vaccine. It also details which vaccine you received -- but that is all. It can not be used for any other purpose. Immunity passports have been used in other countries for different diseases, like polio, to give international travelers the OK to travel. The immunity passports would certify that an individual is immune to the coronavirus and can then give people more freedom to travel andsocialize in public. When you receive your firstshot, the following information will be on the coronavirus vaccination card.

For example, if you receive the Pfizer vaccine in the firstshot, you will need to receive the Pfizer vaccine in thesecondshot. Thesame goes with the Moderna vaccine,since the two are not interchangeable,according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(PDF). This is because, while the two vaccines use thesame technology that focuses on the mRNA of the virus, they are developed differently. Even if you have received the vaccine, you willstill need to wear a mask. Number Even after you receive both doses of the coronavirus vaccine, it isstill recommended by the CDCthat you continue tow ear a mask while in public andsocial distance.

400,Trump Becomes the First President Since Eisenhower to Change Faiths in Office,0.0,47.0,https://www.christianitytoday.com/news/2020/october/trump-nondenominational-presbyterian-religious-eisenhower.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/christianity-today-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-27,25,"More than 180,000 people havestopped identifying with the Presbyterian Church (USA) in the past four years, according to official church numbers. Now there’s one more: President Donald Trump. Trumptold Religion News Servicelast week in a written interview mediated byspiritual advisor Paula White-Cain that he doesn’t consider himself to be Presbyterian. He was confirmed in the church and has called himself Presbyterian numerous times over the years. But no more.“I now consider myself to be a non-denominational Christian,” Trumpsaidin thestatement. “Melania and I have gotten to visitsome amazing churches and meet with great faith leaders from around the world. During the unprecedented COVID-19 outbreak, I tuned intoseveral virtual churchservices and know that millions of Americans did thesame.”While the mainline denomination has previouslychallengedTrump’s affiliation, his recent departureseems to be the result of the presidentslowly moving away from his childhood church and toward a more evangelical faith. Trump was not a regular churchgoer before he was elected president. HeattendedNorman Vincent Peale’s church for a while and praises Peale’s bookHe has alsoattendedEpiscopal churches forseveral Christmas and Easterservices. In 2016, he was described by one prominent evangelicalsupporter as a “baby Christian.”Since moving to the White House, however, he has visited many different churches, mostly evangelical and Pentecostal. He has met with numerous ministers, been prayed over, andsought the advice ofspiritual counselors like White-Cain, a Florida tel evangelist often associated with the prosperity gospel, who took a position as the Trump administration’s faith outreach coordinator last year. City of Destiny, the church White-Cain founded in Florida, is nondenominational. Most Americans don’t think Trump hasstrong religious beliefs,accordingto the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute poll. Roughly 40 percentsay the president “is mostly using religion for political purposes.” White evangelicals who vote Republicansee things differently: Fifty-nine percentsay Trump hasstrong religious beliefs. Insome ways, Trump’s decision to disassociate with a mainline denomination is also part of a larger cultural trend. Many Americans have done thesame. In 1975, nearly a third of Americans identified with a mainline denomination. Today, that has dropped to a little more than 10 percent. The Presbyterian Church (USA) has declined from 3.1 million members in 1984 to about 1.3 million today. Membership has dropped by an average of 4.5 percent every year that Trump has been president. Changing religious identification is also common in the USs. Socialscientists call this “switching.” This includes dramatic conversions, like whensomeone has a born-again experience, but also moresubtle changes, like whensomeone moves to a new town and decides to try the local Baptist church instead of another Methodist congregation. Religiousswitchingseems to happen more often when there are a lot of choices—like there are in the USs. And itseems to happen more when people take religion veryseriously and think it’s an important and distinctive part of their personal identity—like they do in the US In the three-wave Cooperative Congressional Election Study—whichsurveyed thesame individuals in 2010, 2012, and 2014—1 out of every 6 Christians changed their religious identification over four years. Somestopped identifying as Christians and either called themselves “none” or “nothing in particular.” But about 16 percent changed denomination, including about 20 percent of Presbyterians, whostopped calling themselves Presbyterian andstarted calling themselvessomething else—often “nondenominational.”Of course, most Americans are not the president. It is highly unusual for the chief executive to change religious identification in office. The last time it happened, Trump wassix years old. Dwight Eisenhower was baptized thesecond Sunday he was in the White House, in January 1953. He was joining the group that Trump is now leaving: the Presbyterians. Eisenhower, like Trump, was not particularly religious before his election. He was raised in asmall Anabaptist denomination, which he left when he went to militaryschool. His parents later joined the Bible Students, a group that became the Jehovah’s Witnesses. When he was running for office in 1952, the World War II hero’s lack of a denomination became an issue. He was called “a man without a church and without a faith.”One of hisspiritual advisors, the evangelist Billy Graham, encouraged Eisenhower toset an example for the nation by joining a church, and recommended he become a Presbyterian. Though Graham was a Baptist, he worked across denominational lines, knew the Presbyterian minister in Washington, DC, and thought Eisenhower would feel comfortable at the orderly, formal Sundayservice. Eisenhower originally resisted the idea,accordingto historian Gary Scott Smith, thinking the move would just look cynical and political. He felt his faith was private. He was convinced when one of hisstaff asked him to think about the nation’s children, yanked out of bed every Sunday to go to church, complaining that theyshouldn’t have to go if the president of the USs didn’t have to go. The presidentshouldset a good religious example. Eisenhower made it a priority in his administration to promote belief in God and religion, in very general terms. Hesaw religion as aspiritual resource in the Cold War conflict with Communism. He added “under God” to the Pledge of Allegiance and promoted the National Day of Prayer. Hespoke frequently about the importance of “a deeply felt religious faith”—most famously when hesaid, “Our form of government has nosense unless it is founded in a deeply felt religious faith, and I don’t care what it is.”Most Americans came tosee Eisenhower as a very religious president, thoughsome critiqued him for beingspecific about his faith. Heseemed to promote a generic American religion, which had nothing to do with Jesus or any particulars about God or any theological content. Heseemed to have, one personsaid, “a very fervent believer in a very vague religion.”Today, when the Cold Warstruggle has been replaced by culture war conflicts, criticssee Trump’s move from Presbyterian to nondenominational Christian in the opposite light: It’s toospecific. Instead of trying to represent all Americans with platitudes about “deeply felt faith,” they claim Trump ismakingapoliticalmove,identifyingwith the religious voters he needs at the polls.",2,1,Christianity Today

Haitian President Jovenel Moise was killed last Wednesday in an operation that Haitian authoritiessay involved at least 28 people, many of them Colombian mercenaries hired through a Florida-basedsecurity company. At least one of the men arrested in connection to the assassination by Haitian authorities previously worked as an informant for the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the DEAsaid in astatement in response to CNN.“At times, one of thesuspects in the assassination of Haitian President Jovenel Moise was a confidentialsource to the DEA,” the DEAsaid in astatement. Haitian police arrestsuspect accused of orchestrating President is assassination“Following the assassination of President Moise, thesuspect reached out to his contacts at the DEA. A DEA official assigned to Haiti urged thesuspect tosurrender to local authorities and, along with a US State Department official, provided information to the Haitian government that assisted in thesurrender and arrest of thesuspect and one other individual,” the DEAsaid. The DEAsaid it is aware of reports thatsome assassins yelled “DEA” at the time of their attack. The DEAsaid in itsstatement that none of the attackers were operating on behalf of the agency. Othersuspects also hadUS ties, including working as informants for the FBI, the people briefed on the mattersaid. The FBIsaid in response to CNN’s reporting that it doesn’t comment on informants, except tosay that it uses “lawfulsources to collect intelligence” as part of its investigations. Authorities on Monday announced the arrest of asuspect who theysay orchestrated the assassination. Haitian-bornChristian Emmanuel Sanon, 63, entered the country on a private jet in June, Police Chief Leon Charlessaid at a news conference. Haitian authoritiessay that Sanon hired the Florida-based company CTU Security, which they alleged recruited men initially to providesecurity for Sanon, though their mission appears to have changed thereafter.“He came to Haiti accompanied by a few people in the beginning of June, these people weresupposed to ensure hissecurity and his business,”said Charles at the news conference. “He came with the intention to take over as President of the Republic.”Two Colombiansuspects who were killed in Haiti by police also had links to CTU Security, which is owned by a Venezuelan national,said Colombian police on Monday. They have requested assistance from the US Interpol office to investigate the company’s data.

A delegation from the US, including representatives from the State Department and Department of Homeland Security, returned from Port-au-Prince on Monday and briefed President Joe Biden,according to the White House. Bidensaid later on Monday that he was “closely following the events in Haiti,” and that the US was “ready to continue to provide assistance.”Haitian authorities have provided limited details on the investigation, but the growing number of Florida connections to the plot appears to portray an operation at least partly hatched in the USs. Three American citizens have now been arrested in Haiti for their alleged involvement, according to State Departmentspokesperson Ned Price. That may increase the likelihood that the US Justice Department could bring charges against any US participants in the plot. On Monday, the Justice Departmentsaid it would “investigate whether there were any violations of US criminal law” in connection with the assassination. Senior officials have conducted an initial assessment, and the department would continue assisting Haitian authorities to investigate “the facts and circumstancessurrounding this heinous attack,”said aspokesperson in astatement.

Theshopping district—one of the finest in the Dallas-Fort Worth area—is home to quaint boutiques, fine jewelrystores, and even aselection of parks and greenspaces equipped with water fountains. And on Friday, November 6, the family-friendlyspace was overrun with demonstrators protesting against any declaration of President Donald Trump’s defeat in the 2020 presidential election. The protest, organized onsocial media by a pair of young women who call themselves the Patriot Sisters, attracted areported75 people, many of whom brandished “Thin Blue Line” American flags andsigns emblazoned with the words “TRUMP 2020.” One womanstrummed a guitar andsang religioussongs, while other protesters prayed and declared that “voter fraudshould bestopped in the name of Jesus.”The group also attractedsupporters of the far-right QAnon conspiracy theory, including one man carrying a cell phone on aself iestick, which he used to record the protest while chanting religious declarations interspersed withstatements about child-trafficking and pedophilia—dog whistles used by QAnon adherents.“We will not lose this nation and allow human trafficking to continue,” the man carrying aself iesticksaid in av ideo titled “Prayer Rally for TRUMP! #Trump2020 #PrayForTrump #TheGreatAwakening.”“We will not lose this nation and allow pedophilia to continue…we declare that no darkness will triumph in these last days. Praise you, Jesus,” hesaid. (The Great Awakening is a term associated with QAnon, as well as with religious-right activists who believe God is using Trump to bringspiritual revival to the US)The Patriot Sisters run popular Instagram and TikTok accounts, which they have used to promote the anti-mask movement, anti-Black Lives Matter rhetoric, and pro-Trump propaganda and misinformation. They have even made a post using the #SaveOurChildren hashtag, which was hijacked by QAnon followers to push falsehoods about the purported exploitation of children by liberal elites. While they may not necessarily be ardentsupporters of QAnon, the Patriot Sisters’ attraction ofsome of the conspiracy theory’s impassioned followers not only emphasizes the recently formed overlap between evangelical Christians and QAnon, but also highlights the currentstate of despair festering within the movement – a despair centered around asingle question:What now?Election night wassupposed tosignal a key moment in Q’s long-touted reckoning. The anonymous prophet fueling the QAnon movementspent years flooding the internet with unfounded conspiracies, proclamations about theso-called deepstate’s cabalistic control of the USs, and Trump’s role as the anointedsavior fighting off the forces of evil. The posts began on the infamous discussion board 4chan in October 2017, where an anonymous poster claimed to have “Q clearance” granting him access to classified information at the Department of Energy, including nuclearsecrets. Q quickly amassed a large following through his posts (known as “Q drops”), and the movement grew among right-wing circles. QAnon eventually morph ed into a virtual cult wheresupporters claim that a cabal of elite pedophiles made up of Hollywood actors, Democrats, and other high-ranking officials is behind a global childsex-trafficking ring. The unfounded conspiracy theory also alleges that Trump is planning a day of reckoning known as “The Storm,” during which thousands of these deepstate actors will be arrested. Many believed that thesupposed reckoning and the eventual defeat of the deepstate would begin with Trump’s victory in the 2020 election. Joe Biden’s victoryserved as a body-blow to the movement’s ardent followers. Q’s final drop before the election was on the morning of November 3, and featured an Abraham Lincoln quote from 1863, in which the former president declared “that this nation, under God,shall have a new birth of freedom.” The drop also bore the image of an American flag and a YouTube link to the themesong of the 1992 film “The Last of the Mohicans.” TheYouTube link was viewed more than 35 million times and features more than 28,000 comments, mainly from loyal followers of the QAnon movement.“This is the Q message board today,” read one comment. “A genius way to get past thesensors. Seeing all the recent comments makes me proud win or lose. WWG1WGA.” (The code denotes QAnon’s best-knownslogan, “Where we go one, we go all.”)While Q’s followers gathered in earnest to witness a reckoning that never came, Q himself was mysteriouslysilent. Even the operators of the websiteQ Alerts, which keeps track of the Q drops, attempted to reassure followers regarding their prophet’ssuspicious absence. “Q has been dark for 9 days. At times Qstrategically goes dark for days, weeks or insome cases months. Besure you havesome type of Q Alerts in placeso you are notified when Q drops again. If your browsershows a red bell icon at the bottom/right, that is a great place tostart.”Q’s disappearance (which lasted for nine days until the anonymous figure resurfaced again on November 12) coupled with Trump’s defeat in the presidential elections, led to a range of responses from his followers. Somestood their ground and doubled down on the conspiracies, while others began to question whether they themselves had been fooled. Followers (known as Anons) flooded forums, Telegram chats, and Q-friendlyspaces to discuss the events,share their despair, andseek comfort from others.“We Have (sic) been told time & again Trump wins in the end!! Don’t give upso easily, if you believe don’t give up,” one poster told a QAnon group ofseveral hundred members on Telegram. Another responded that “giving up is NOT an option for me!!”This is not the first time that QAnon believers have faced disappointment. One of the initial claims of the conspiracy theory was that Hillary Clinton would be arrested and imprisoned in 2017. When that did not happen, QAnon followers recalibrated and decided that Clinton had been placed under house arrest and was wearing an ankle bracelet. Even her appearances in public only emboldened them to raise thestakes and claim that the deepstate had replaced her with a clone. Then in 2018, Q claimed that Republicans would dominate the midterm elections and reclaim the US House of Representatives. This, of course, did not come to pass, and while this likely impactedsome of Q’s followers, the movement only continued to grow over the next couple of years. Q’s nine days ofsilence during a critical time in thesupposed reckoning left a power vacuum within the cesspool of conspiracies on 8kun, the message board formerly known as 8chan that has been linked to whitesupremacy, anti-Semitism, Islamophobia, various other hate crimes, and multiple massshootings. Following three massshootings in 2019 (Christchurch, New Zealand, in March; Poway, California, in April; El Paso, Texas, in August) where each oft he assailants used 8chan as a platform to post their manifestos, 8chan went offline in August 2019 and rebranded in November 2019 as 8kun. While 8kun quickly became a home for Q’s posts, thesitesaw asurprisingshift on Election Day. Shortly following Q’s November 3 drop, Ron Watkins—son of 8kun owner Jim Watkins—revealedthat he was “resigning as the admin of 8kun effective immediately.” According to theWashington Post, Watkins resigned to focus on his “health and marriage” and that he had “no thoughts or insight” into why Q had not posted in over a week. Given that Watkins was one of a handful of people who could verify Q’s drops,several fake Q posts appeared over the following days which caused mass confusion among Anons before being discredited. Othersspammed the forums with biblical passages comparing Moses’ miraculous parting of the Red Sea to QAnon’s ongoing fight against the deepstate. The postsserved the purpose of preying on vulnerable believers who wereseeking answers for Q’s temporary disappearance. Forsome Anons, their determined and whole-heartedsupport for the baseless conspiracy theory cost them their marriages and destroyed their families. Those who have gambled on Q being a harbinger of light against the forces of evil cannot afford to turn back now, lest they realize they hadsacrificed their loved ones to follow an anonymous internet troll. Faced with little alternative, many have doubled down on their beliefs and converged onto their last resort: unfounded conspiracy theories alleging widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election. Major Patriot—a popular twitter account belonging to a QAnonsupporter—was among the first to tweet out words of encouragement to his 168,000+ following, claiming that everything was going according to plan for the Trump administration despite the election results:I want to encourage any of you who may be alarmed about what is happening in our nation…Have Faith in God, our President and THE PLAN Rejoice now in VICTORY Do not worry. Do not be afraid. THERE IS A PLAN. IT IS A GOOD PLAN. IT IS BEING EXECUTED — and it will not fail. Many Anons followedsuit, includingsome of the most prominent QAnon-related accounts onsocial media. They began toshare disinformationsurrounding the 2020 presidential election. Some pushed doctored videos and fakestories about ballotstuffing, while others propagated hash tagssuch as Stop the Steal, as well as the alleged ballot “watermarks” conspiracy theory. Everything happens for a reason and It’s far from over.@realDonaldTrumpisstill the currentsitting President of the USs of America.

(@QAnon_Report)November 8, 2020The QAnon accounts pushing Trump’s disinformation campaign were not limited to the USs. Amazing Polly, arguably the most outspoken QAnonsupporter in Canada, has been actively pushing the election fraud narrative on Twitter. Polly, who appears to live in Ontario, is also a vehement anti-vaxxer and believes that COVID-19 was a planned event that helped enable a globalist coup—a claimshe admitsshe inherited from far-right conspiracy-monger Alex Jones. There was also asignificant amount of Q-related activity from European followers of the movement, primarily in Germany, Italy, and France, as well as the United Kingdom. It has primarily been embraced by conservatives and the far-right, many of whom view Trump as a potentialsavior from leaderssuch as Germany’s Chancellor Angela Merkel and France’s President Emmanuel Macron. As Anons continued to amplify unfounded claims of widespread election fraud,some viewed the election aftermath as a renewed call to action. Philadelphiapolice arrested two armed men on Thursday November 5, who were targeting the Convention Center where vote-counting was taking place. The two men were found in a Hummer with a decal on the rear window bearing the QAnonslogan WWG1WGA The arrest is astark reminder that the FBI has labeled QAnon as a potential domestic terrorism threat. QAnonsupporters have be encharged with terrorism for driving an armored truck to the Hoover Dam and blocking traffic forseveral hours,faced murder charges for the March 2019slaying of Gambino crime family under boss Frank Cali, and kidnapping charges after a QAnonsupporter attempted to kidnap one of her children who have been removed from her custody. The potential for violence has notstopped influential Q-adjacent accounts from pushing the election fraud conspiracies onsocial media. Midnight Rider, another prominent QAnon account with more than half-million followers, has been actively amplifying messages from Trump, Rudy Giuliani, as well as Michael Flynn, whoserved as nationalsecurity advisor for the first three weeks of Trump’s presidency before resigning. Emboldened by Trump’s defiance and hisadministration’s refusal to concede the election, the account tweeted on November 11, “Losing never feltso good!”While the QAnon movement has been fueled by despair and denial ism in the aftermath of the election, the movement is not without itssmall victories. Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene was declared the winner in Georgia’s 14th Congressional District, becoming the first QAnonsupporter to win a US Houseseat. She was followedshortly thereafter by mixed martial arts fighter Tito Ortiz, a fellow QAnonsupporter who was elected to Huntington Beach City Council. (Author note: Right Wing Watch covered Ortiz’s campaign, including hissupport for the QAnon movement,here.)“Q is a patriot, we know that forsure,” Greenesaidin a 2017 video, which hassince been deleted. “There’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to take this global cabal of Satan-worshiping pedophiles out, and I think we have the President to do it.”The congresswoman-elect hasspent the last week propagating voter fraud claims and falsely asserting that Trump won the election. She even designed a petition titled “Stop the Biden Steal,” whichshe hosted on her campaign website. Now the most visible and influential QAnonsupporter in American politics, Greene has targeted everyone from President-Elect Biden to Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, while also asserting that her husband’s experience at the ballot box reflects an ongoing “absentee ballotscam.”Joe Biden isn’t President-elect. That’s a media falsehood. We CAN NOT allow CCP Joe to have National Security Briefings with these SERIOUS allegations. The Presidency is not forsale to the Communist Chinese!#BidenCrimeFamily— Marjorie Taylor Greene ?? (@mtgreenee)November 12, 2020These prominent accounts are merely a handful of the accounts linked to QAnon that have been flooding hash tags and posts onsocial media. According to the non-profit research group Advance Democracy, QAnon-related accounts were responsible for approximately 10 percent of the tweets amplifying hash tagssuch as #StopTheSteal. QAnon followers have also beenspotted atseveral pro-Trump Stop the Steal rallies, and have joined forces with other far-right groups in promoting the upcoming Million MAGA March in Washington, DC, on Saturday (aka the March for Trump, Stop the Steal DC). Q followers will be joined by other MAGA loyalists, including the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters, and white nationalist “groypers,” as well as professional conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones. By November 12, Anon’s rejoiced at their fabled leader’s return to 8kun. At 9:32 p.m. Eastern Time, Q posted an American flag along with ashort message aimed at rallying his digital troops. “Nothing canstop what is coming. Nothing!” Q wrote. Q followed up with a pair of cryptic posts, which amounted to aseries of open-ended questions followed by a link to the National Council of Statewide Interoperability Coordinators. While Q’s posts may distract his followers, many of whom aresimply relieved that their leader has returned, it remains unclear whether the QAnon fantasy will able tosustain itself over the coming months as the disappointments continue to pile on.

403,Omaha protesters paint harsh picture of jail; officials say they did their best in a bad situation,3.0,44.67,https://omaha.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/omaha-protesters-paint-harsh-picture-of-jail-officials-say-they-did-their-best-in-a/article_d355a9af-143a-5ad4-98c8-85cf5ee39925.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/omaha-world-herald-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,22,"Amanda Humes and Ben Schacht have carefully considered which local protests to attend amongseveral over the past two months. In early June,they attended a vigil for Zachary Bear Heels, who died in 2017 after he was punched andshocked with a Taser by Omaha police officers. Two days later, they marched down Dodge Street to Memorial Park — a week after James Scurlock was killed. Saturday’s gathering, whichstarted at Midtown Crossing and was held tostand insolidarity with Portland and demand justice for Scurlock, was near the married couple’s residence. They trusted the organizers and took part in the peaceful protest. But they didn’t return home until early Monday morning, after littlesleep and an overnightstay at the Douglas County Jail. What they learned while there is that the arresting and booking process is not asmooth one.“There was this feeling of hopelessness. It didn’t feel like there was a person in there who was interested in listening or helping,”said Humes, 33. “This feeling that you’re up against thissystem of processing … you don’t know where you are in that process or how long it will take.”The 120 protesters who were arrested by Omaha police officers Saturday night near 28th and Farnam Streets bogged down the jail’s booking process, despite the fact that Douglas County correctional officersstayed past theirshifts and additional officers were called in to handle the influx. Scheduled routine maintenance to the jail’s computersystem only added to the delays in getting protesters processed and released. Many protesters took tosocial media or told their family and friends about conditions inside the jail. Some of the allegations included that air conditioning in the cells was turned off, that they weren’t given food and that the cells were overcrowded. Some protesters contended that thesystem glitches were deliberate. Douglas County Corrections Director Michael Myerssaid the allegations aren’t accurate.“It was just a perfectstorm of events,” hesaid Monday whileshowing a World-Herald reporter the areas where the protesters were kept. “I don’t want to discount people’s experiences. It’s frustrating to know that we were doing the best that we could with the resources that we had and thespace that we had, and to be demonized like that feels unfair.”Myerssaid the jail isn’t equipped to handleso many people at one time. Officials hadset up a third booking window after the large protests of late May and early June. The change allowed jail workers to book as many as 40 people in one hour, but the Saturday nightsystem reboot jammed up the process. After people are booked, they are patted down andscreened for metal or cellphones. They also must turn in any property, other than clothing, visit the medical office and get a booking photo taken, among othersteps. Myerssaid with 100-plus people, all of that takes time. The protesters filled the jail’s 66-chair holding area, two large cells, eightsmall cells and a courtroom waiting room andsmall gym that officers turned intosleeping quarters with plastic cots. The holding area has 10 phones, which are free to use, two private toilets and drinking fountains. Sometimes on Sunday, Myerssaid, the large holding cell doors were opened to allow people to freely walk around. Other times, officersswitched out groups to let them use the phones and get water. Protesters dispute that phone access and water were readily available. Riley Wilson, whoserved as a legal observer for a Scottsbluff attorney,said that at one point, 43 men were in one of the large cells,standing-room only. Wilson and others criticized the crowding based on federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines that recommend keeping people 6 feet apart to minimize thespread of COVID-19.“Once we were transferred over to the correctional facility, the biggest,scariest thing for me,” Schachtsaid, “was being in a pandemic and being crammed together. Masks can only protect youso much.”Myerssaid if there’s a problem with an inmate, jail workers move the people from the waiting room to the cells forsafety, and that’s what happened. Most of the time, hesaid, the large cells held about 20 to 25 people.“You can’tsocial distance here,” hesaid. “We did the best that we could.”All arrestees are given orange, laundered masks, and most of the protesters wore their own masks, Humessaid. Correctional officers are also required to wear masks. Many protesterssaid the capacity of the large cells was 14. Asmallsign above those cells — numbers 1 and 6 —say “ICE CAPACITY — 14.” Myerssaid that if the jail is holding arrestees for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, then only 14 people can be in that cell at once. But these protesters were not arrested on ICE-related charges,so thosestandards didn’t apply.“ICE has a lot ofstandards which exceed normal operatingstandards,” Myerssaid. At least one transgender person was arrested and placed into asmall holding cell alone. Myerssaid officials usually allow transgender inmates to be with the gender they identify as, and a committee discusses placementso that the inmate and others aresafe, but the committee doesn’t meet on weekends. The protesters were arrested onsuspicion of a combination of charges, but mostly failure to disperse and obstructing passage. One person was arrested onsuspicion of negligent driving,six with obstructing officers, four with resisting arrest and 11 with unlawful assembly,said Omaha Police Lt. Sherie Thomas, a policespokeswoman.“The protestersstarted walking in thestreet against the direction of traffic, then there were announcements made advising the crowd that they were unlawfully assembling before arrests were made,” Thomassaid in an email. Omaha Police Capt. Mark Matuza hadsaid Saturday that the protest “leaned toward the potential of getting violent.” When a World-Herald reporter requested more information about thatstatement, Thomassaid “some intelligence was gathered” and declined to give further details. Wilson, the legal observer,said he did not observe any violence by protesters. Hesaid he didsee officers pushsomeone off their bicycle andshoot pepper balls. As they arrested protesters from about 9:30 p.m. to 9:45 p.m., they ordered people to get on the ground and then put zip ties on their hands. Protesterssat on a bridge along Farnam Street for a few hours before they were taken to the Douglas County Jail, where they waited again.“It was incrediblyslow, and it was really painful,” Humessaid. “Both my wrists wereswollen and bruised from having to lay there like that.”Once inside the jail, Humessaid,she was put into a holding cell with other women.“They all yelled, ‘You’re 46!’ meaning I was the 46th person to go into this room,”shesaid. Humessaidsome people were waiting to get their medication, and others coached a woman through an anxiety attack. Atsome point, the toilet in the women’s cell clogged or overflowed. Myerssaid that he had not heard about that but that maintenancestaff is on hand at all times to fix problems as they arise. Around noon Sunday, Myerssaid, he authorized hisstaff to use a paper process to book people and allow them to post their bail because the computersstill weren’t working. About 37 people were released during the day Sunday, and 69 people were released between 3 p.m. and midnight, hesaid. A few protesters had warrants from other counties and weren’t allowed to be released, hesaid. Myerssaid he was at the jail Sunday, overseeing the holding area. Hesaid hespoke to a gathering of friends and family outside the jail to address their concerns. Myerssaid he is proud of the way his correctional officers handled the influx of people. Humessaidshe was able to pay her $500 bail but couldn’t leave the jail until about 10 p.m. Sunday. She waited for her husband for a couple of hours but then went home. Her husband was released about 1 a.m. Monday. Schacht, Humes and Wilsonsaid they heard officerssay that the jail process, charges and financial burden mightstymie the arrestees’ future efforts to raise their voices in protest. But theysaid thesituation only bolstered many protesters’ attitudes.“When you hear that, itsure makes you think, this was a very deliberate attempt tosend a message,” Wilsonsaid. “If the desired result was to have (protesters) being dissuaded from acting, all they did was intensify their beliefs.”alia.conley@owh.com, 402-444-1068twitter.com/aliaconleyOWHGet the latest in local publicsafety news with this weekly email.",2,2,Omaha World-Herald

It lasted nine interminable minutes. It ignited our righteous indignation—an oil fire floating on an ocean of grief. Mostpeople felt this way about the video of the murder—yes, murder—of George Floyd last year. The officer responsible, Derek Chauvin, was convicted of three counts on Tuesday forsnuffing out a man’s life over the course of those nine excruciating minutes. Some observers, though,seem less concerned about the murder of George Floyd and more concerned about—well, it’s hard tosay what they are concerned about. Some of them are claiming that the trial was aset-up. Rigged. That the jury had it in for Chauvin. Or that Chauvin didn’t really matter because the real villains were Joe Biden and Maxine Waters and Don Lemon, whosomehow managed to pressure the jury into convicting Chauvin on all counts. Probably because they were afraid of cancel culture. It is possible tostipulate allsorts of things here:Yes, President Biden and Rep. Waters both madestatements theyshouldn’t have. Watersencourageddemonstrators to get “more active” and “more confrontational” if Chauvin weren’t convicted, which wasn’t an explicit call to violence but was at least unwise. Bidensaidthat the evidence was “overwhelming” in his view and encouraged the jury to reach “the right verdict” without making explicit what the right verdict was. Neithershould havesaid what theysaid. Political leadersshould be circumspect when offering public commentary about ongoing trials—or better yet,should altogether refrain from commenting.

405,"If Mumia Abu-Jamal’s Case Is a ‘Non-Issue,’ Why Have Media Gone to Such Lengths to Silence Him?",-18.33,33.67,https://fair.org/home/if-mumia-abu-jamals-case-is-a-non-issue-why-have-media-gone-to-such-lengths-to-silence-him/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fair-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-01,25,"Philadelphia public broadcasterWHYY(4/24/21) was one of the few outlets to report on an April 24 rallyseeking the release from prison ofMumia Abu-Jamal. Thestory included important information on Abu-Jamal, who isserving a lifesentence for the 1981 killing of Philadelphia police officer Daniel Faulkner. It noted that the case has “drawnscrutiny” over claims of police, prosecutorial and judicial bias and misconduct. It cited new evidence released as part of the appeal process, including a note from a key prosecution witness asking the prosecuting attorney for money—thesort of evidence that Johanna Fernandez, a history professor and part of Abu-Jamal’s legal team, notes has in other instances led to a defendant either beingset free or getting an immediate new trial. Along with Fernandez, the piece includes the voices of Abu-Jamal’s brother Keith Cook, and MOVE member Pam Africa, as well as people who traveled from around the country to call attention to Abu-Jamal’s case, his currentstate of health—he has a number of debilitating conditions, and has just had heartsurgery—and to put hisstory in a context of political prisoners here and around the world. I confess I wasstill irked byWHYYusing its lead paragraph to frame thestory like this:The case has pitted Abu-Jamal’ssupporters, including a long list of national and international celebrities whosay he was framed, against police and theirsupporters, who resent the attention given to a man convicted of murdering a fellow officer. It bugs me, because those were the themes decades ago when Abu-Jamal was first convicted andsentenced to death (Voices With Vision,4/27/21). That he was a “cause celebre”—and therefore, wink wink,somethingsomething about liberal Hollywood, no need to pay attention—and that the upset of anyone concerned about his deeply flawed trial or his inappropriatesentencing was merely theatrical, because, after all, he was “convicted,” wasn’t he?Elite media at the time were open tostraight-up lies: A 1995Washington Poststory (5/18/95) led with a macabre account from Faulkner’s widow, Maureen Faulkner, about how when her husband’s bloodyshirt was held up in court, Abu-Jamal turned around andsmiled at her. Except attorney Leonard Weinglass and the court recordshow that Abu-Jamal wasn’t in court when theshirt was displayed (Extra! Update,8/95). ABC‘s investigative newsshow20/20(12/9/98) employed a number of techniques for their big 1998 piece—stating prosecution claims as fact, even when they were disputed bysome of the prosecution’s own witnesses or the forensic record;stressing how a defense witness admitted being intoxicated, while omitting that prosecution witnessessaid thesame (Extra! Update,2/99). At one point, actor and activist Ed Asner is quotedsaying, “No ballistic tests were done, which is prettystupid”—but then host Sam Donaldson’s voice over cuts him off: “But ballistics testdone,” hesays, referring to tests thatsuggested that the bullet that killed Faulkner might have been thesame caliber as Abu-Jamal’s gun. But he didn’t note that tests had not been done to determine whether that gun had fired the bullet, or whether it had been fired at all, or if there were gunpowder residues on Abu-Jamal’s hands. Producers fromPeople’s Video Networktold FAIR at the time (Extra! Update,2/99) thatABCnot only used clips they’d recorded from Abu-Jamal without permission, but they added layers of echo, making himsound, theysaid, “like a cave-dwelling animal.”No one was toosurprised when it was revealed that in a letter asking permission from the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections to interview Abu-Jamal (a request that was denied),20/20pointed out that “we are currently working in conjunction with Maureen Faulkner and the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police” (Extra! Update,2/99). After that, the mainstory has been non-coverage. For instance, in 2006, when Abu-Jamal won the right to appeal on three grounds—including a jury purged of Black people, the prosecutor lowering jurors’sense of responsibility bysaying their decision “would not be final,” and the fact that judge Albert Sabo was all kinds of biased—thePhiladelphia Daily Newstold reporter Dave Lindorff that it was a “non-issue” (Extra!,3–4/06)—although when a judge overturned the deathsentence in 2001, the paper (12/19/01) found time to editorialize: “Let Mumia Rot in Darkness.”The late great media critic Ed Herman (Extra!,9–10/00) reported how thePhiladelphia Inquirerwouldn’t cover rallies and tribunals insupport of Abu-Jamal, calling them “stunts,” but when the Fraternal Order of Police bought a full-page ad in theNew York Times, that merited astory. In 2000, when Amnesty International declared that the original trial was “deeply flawed,” theInky(2/18/00) made it the fifth “news brief” on page 2B But if Mumia Abu Jamal’s case is a non-issue that only celebrities care about, why the activesilencing?In 1994,NPRcancelled plans for aseries of commentaries from Abu-Jamal—who is, after all, a journalist, a former head of the Philadelphia Association of Black Journalists—after Senator Bob Dole threatened their funding. Theysaid it was because it was a “highly polarized and political controversy”—which they proceeded tosay nothing about for the following year (Extra!,11–12/95). WhenDemocracy Now!prepared to air commentaries,stationKRTI, out of Philadelphia’s Temple University, cancelled theshow and all ofPacificanews (Extra! Update,4/97), with astation VP explaining: “What’s good enough forNPRis good enough for me.”And when a Vermont college aired a taped commencement address from Abu-Jamal, it led Philadelphia lawmakers to throw togethersomething called the Revictimization Relief Act, allowing crime victims or prosecutors tosue inmates whose behavior behind bars “creates mental anguish” for the victims. Clearly unconstitutional, violating both freespeech and due process rights, it was dubbed the Silencing Act by many, who noted that it didn’t just curtail prisoners’ right tospeak, but journalists’ and all of our rights to hear them (FAIR.org,10/22/14). Media’s response was ashrug: TheNew York Timesran anAPpiece (10/21/14) with the headline “Pennsylvania: Gov Signs Law to Help Protect Crime Victims.”Elite media would have us believe they are engaged in aserious reckoning with the racism of the US criminal justicesystem, that they care about over-incarceration and prison conditions. And keeping people behind bars just because powerful people want them there, and not due to the merits of their case? Well, that’s what Other Countries do. If only there were a case, 40 years’ worth of case, that would allow them to explore those ideals—if not to do justice by Mumia Abu-Jamal (they can’t return what’s been taken from him), then to dosomesemblance of justice by their own claims of concern.",1,1,FAIR
406,"With US hospitals overtaxed by COVID-19, huge numbers died from lack of healthcare access",-15.33,34.33,https://www.salon.com/2021/04/30/with-us-hospitals-overtaxed-by-covid-19-huge-numbers-died-from-lack-of-healthcare-access/,https://adfontesmedia.com/salon-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-30,25,"In calculating its human toll, a pandemic issimilar to a war. The most precise way public health researchers can get a handle on the impact ofsomething like COVID-19 is to compare the number of total deaths recorded in aspecific place during the pandemic with death tallies from prior years. That analysis will yield a figure known as ""excess deaths"" — whichsimply means deaths above and beyond what would normally be expected. That figure captures not just COVID-19 deaths, but the number of people who were unable to access health care at a moment in their lives when a chronic condition was becoming life-threatening. It also includes individuals whose primary cause of death may have beensomething else, but who were also infected with COVID-19. And now that the dust hassettled and the data are being tabulated, America is excess death numbers over the past year arestaggering. The importance of tabulatingsuch a darkstatistic is twofold: its record-breaking nature is due to both to our largely for-profit healthcaresystem, as well as government incompetence. Indeed, for decades our government ignored the warnings from public health experts that the US was not properly prepared for the pandemic we are living through now. It is not like no one couldsaw the pandemic coming. In his book""The Great Influenza"",first published in 2004, John M Barry presaged the COVID-19 crisis, describing how ""hospitals, like every other industry, have gotten more efficient by cutting costs, which means virtually no excess capacity — on a per capita basis the USs has far fewer hospital beds than a few decades ago.""He continued. ""Indeed, during a routine influenzaseason, usage of respirators rises to nearly 100 percent; in a pandemic, most people who needed a mechanical respirator would not get one.""As we have learned first-hand over the lastseveral months, because the healthcaresystem wasoverwhelmed, getting accurate cause of death data was itself a work in progress. No doubt huge numbers of cases of COVID-19 may have been missed. In other instances, individuals may have died at home orsuccumbed to a chronic illness that was written off as COVID when it was not. The one constant comparative data point is death itself from any and all causes. Like births, deaths aresomething we track withsome precision. Hence, one way that medical researchers can get asense of thescale of the impact ofsomething like COVID is to compare the total number of deaths from all causes during the pandemic and compare it with thesame data point overseveral prior years. Such an ""excess death"" analysis will capture the collateral impact of overwhelmed healthcaresystems that were under-resourced long before the pandemic. It will include the people that died as a consequence of opting not to go to the hospital for an unrelated condition for fear of catching COVID-19. While that might not count as a COVID-19 death perse, it tells ussomething about what happens when we permit healthcare to operate without any margin or redundancy — what is effectively a form of rationing healthcare. According to a recently publishedstudy in theJournal of the American Medical Association, which looked at the rate of excess deaths from March 1, 2020, to January 2, 2021, there were 522,368 ""excess deaths,"" as gauged against averages over thesame period from 2014 to 2019. At thestart of this year, COVID-19 deaths were reported at just over 350,186. By comparing the ""excess rate"" of death with the COVID-19 reported data, linked to its location, we can getsomesense of where the public healthsystem had the hardest time holding up under the once-in-a-centurystrain of a mass death event. Thestudy, produced by researchers with the Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine in Richmond and the Yale School of Public Health, calculated that COVID-19 accounted for 72.4 percent of the excess mortality. The balance may have been ""either immediate or delayed mortality from undocumented COVID-19 infection, or non-COVID-19 deathssecondary to the pandemic,such as from delayed care or behavioral health crises.""While nationally there was a 23 percent increase in excess mortality during the pandemic, New York State, which lost close to 50,000 to COVID,saw the nation is highestspike, with a 38 percent jump in excess deaths — though Mississippi and New Jersey actually exceeded New York State on a per capita basis, according to the researchers. In an editorial that was published with thestudy,Dr. Alan M Garberwrote of the importance of grasping the bigger picture, beyond the daily COVID dashboard. ""There is no more visible or alarming manifestation of the toll of the COVID-19 pandemic than the deaths it has caused,"" he noted.""The missteps in responding to an outbreak that not only could be, but largely was, predictedshould not give governments confidence that they are prepared for threats that are morespeculative and possibly further in the future,"" Garber continued. ""Failure to anticipate thescale of the potential damage fromsuch future catastrophes will only exacerbate the tendency to downplay their importance, making it less likely that governments will prepare adequately. That is why understanding the toll of a pandemic is an importantstep in the right direction.""In New York City, where COVID killed more than 32,000 city residents, fighting the virus inspired life-saving innovations. It also exposed long-standing healthcare disparities that leftsome neighborhoods more at the mercy of the highly contagious and deadly virus, according to Dr. Mitch Katz, the CEO of New York City Health + Hospitals. NYC H+H, the nation is largest municipal hospitalsystem, includes 11 hospitals andsawsome of the highest patient death counts early on. Over the course of the pandemic, thousands of H+H workers from a myriad of job titles weresidelined by the deadly virus, which took the lives of 53 employees. It was in the throes of this nearly unprecedented public health emergency that H+H found ways to improve patient care while at thesame time reducing the exposure ofstaff to the deadly virus which helped toslow thespread of the virus.""We have done a lot of work from the first wave about putting glass doors in, or glass in the walls to create a window for cameras in the patient rooms — microphonesso that patients can be monitoredsafely without going into the room . . . and that is a positive development whether there is COVID orsome other infectious disease,"" Dr. Katzsaid during a phone interview. ""So, I think we learned how to make our hospitalssafer for the care of patients with infectious diseases.""For Dr. Katz, one of the mostsobering discoveries was how pre-existing disparities in the city is private and public hospital infrastructure leftsome communitiesso much more vulnerable during the pandemic.""I think the fact that we hadso many fewer hospital beds in Queens compared to Manhattan was one of thestark lessons,"" hesaid. ""That is part of why it wasso much more challenging to deal with the pandemic in Queens and Elmhurst Hospitals was because there wereso few beds compared to thesize of the population in Queens compared to Manhattan and other parts of New York State. The discrepancy in the number of beds I'dsay was an issue.""Dr. Katz established a national reputation leading the public hospitalsystems in San Francisco and Los Angeles before returning home to New York. After years of experience on the front lines of urban healthcare on both coasts, he believes that the nation is vulnerability to COVID-19 can be traced back to asteady disinvestment in public health thatstarted during the Reagan era.""Yes, the pandemicshows how we have to build up our public health infrastructureso that we are better prepared for what people need,"" hesaid. As the city,state and federal governments all attempt to regroup after the death of more than a half-million and the infection of well over 30 million, Dr. Katz believes policy makers would be well advised to consult the data not just on COVID deaths perse, but on excess mortality rates referenced by neighborhoods.""Absolutely, and I think we havesomesense already of the excess mortality that occurred both among people who had COVID and did not come forward for testing,"" hesaid. ""Some of those people were undocumented immigrants or people who were very low income and feared coming forward to a hospital.""Some of that excess mortality we know where people who were having heart attacks or otherserious health conditions and did not come forward for care because they wereso frightened of catching COVID from the hospital. So, I think the excess mortality is very helpful frankly it does not have to be exact. We can all acknowledge there were a number of people who died and did not have a COVID test. It is the general population trend that matters.""If America is to get well, which is the firststep to escaping the undertow of this pandemic and preparing forstaving off the next, we have to uplift these places where regular access to quality healthcare was asocio-economic preexisting condition that helped drive the local body count. Our own individual health is linked to the health of our neighbor. That is notscripture. That is biology.",1,1,Salon
407,The countries that will be first in line to get a coronavirus vaccine,-1.67,51.33,https://qz.com/1884905/who-will-get-the-coronavirus-vaccine-first/,https://adfontesmedia.com/quartz-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,25,"Ifscientists find asuccessful coronavirus vaccine—which isstill “if,” rather than “when”—the companies that own the rights will face the difficult question of who gets the first doses. Researching and producing a vaccine costs billions of dollars,so governments around the world are offering major funding in exchange for the promise of early batches. Inevitably, the richest countries are more likely to get a vaccine fastest. The table belowshows ongoing public deals for the first vaccines being developed by different companies, in order of the country or institution that has pre-ordered the greatest number of doses. Some of these deals, including the two within the European Union and the UK’s deal with Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline, arestill in negotiation. Others did not disclose the volume of vaccines to be produced: Israel is working tosource vaccines from Moderna and AstraZeneca, for example. While the US and India’s Serum Institute aresnapping up the greatest volume of pre-orders, not all deals are made equal. AstraZeneca’s arrangements with Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the Serum Institute of India are intended to distribute the vaccine to low-and-middle income countries. Russia’s drugmaker R-Pharmplans to distribute AstraZeneca’s vaccineinternationally, while Brazil licensed the ability to produce it domestically. The biggest dealsdon’t necessarily line upwith the most advanced vaccine trials. Currently,six institutions are conducting phase three trials, the large-scale efficacystudies that are the final hurdle before drug approval. One of these trials doesn’t have particularly promising results, but is in advancedstages because it’s testing an approved tuberculosis vaccine. That leaves five vaccines in late-stage trials. One is created by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford, which is fielding four different deals. Pfizer and Moderna announced thestart of their phase three trialson July 27. And two are created by Chinese companies: Sinopharm and Sinovac. Those two companies are notably underrepresented among existing deals. China’s president President Xi Jinpingtold the World Health Organization (WHO) in Maythat any vaccine developed nationally would be a “global public good.” But while AstraZeneca and Pfizer have made commitments in exchange for funding, the Chinese companies’ arrangements are less clear. Sinovac is offeringsome vaccines in exchange for conducting trials internationally: The company has a licensing agreement with Brazil, while a Bangladesh health ministry official told Reutersthe country would “get priority” for any vaccinesuccessfully developed. Sinopharm hasn’t madesuch clear-cut public deals. The comparative lack of funding for Chinese companies means they have less means to bulk up production. AstraZeneca has committed to producing2 billion doses, and expects to deliver much of this by early 2021. Pfizer, which is collaborating with German company BioNTech and Chinese company Fosun Pharma,said it expects to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of 2021. In comparison, Sinopharm is expanding production to200 million vaccine doses a year, while Sinovac Biotech is building a plant to make 100 million doses a year. Once asuccessful vaccine is created, there’ssome incentive toshare: The pandemic won’t die out until it is addressed globally. The chief executive of the vaccine alliance Gavi, Seth Berkley,says the priorityshould be for every country to get a vaccine to20% of their population. But as long assupplies are limited, it’s likely that countries will put their own citizens first. Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",2,2,Quartz

As we’veseen time and time again, the wording of the question often determines the outcome. But when it comes to health care—and especially Medicaid expansion—we don’t need polls, because even voters in redstates are making it clear that they are not aligned with Republicans. On Tuesday, Missouri became theseventhstate to expand Medicaidsince Donald Trump was inaugurated. All but one of thosestates (Virginia) didso by referendum at the ballot box. Youcan now add Missouri to the group of orangestates on this map. The 53 percent of Missourianswho voted to expand Medicaid probably didso for a variety of reasons, like the fact that an additional 230,000 people will gain insurance coverage, or the fact that a refusal to expand the program has contributed to the closing of 10 rural hospitals in thatstatesince 2014. There’s also this concern:“Quite frankly, Missourians aresick and tired of not getting their fairshare. They pay their taxes, they’veseen now 37 otherstates use that money to expand access to health care. Meanwhile, our economy’s clearly ailing here,” Jack Cardetti, the campaign’sspokesperson,said last week. As Sarah Kliffexplains, the group that is behind thestrategy of putting Medicaid expansion on the ballot is the Fairness Project. So far, they’ve had a massive impact, expanding the program to cover an additional one million low-income Americans. Their next target is Florida, which, if passed, would add coverage for an additional 800,000. Republican governors and legislators have fought these gains everystep of the way. But Medicaid expansion has passed whenever it has been put on the ballot. The lesson here is that, even as Trump and Republicans ask the Supreme Court to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act, their own constituents in redstates are telling them that theysupport a critical element of what that legislation accomplished.

That other courts may find a way to avoid this conclusion is theirs to decide; this Court will notsanction one more day of this offensive deprivation ofsuch an important right.”As predicted, Texas is appealing.“Though the court’s ruling offers asigh of relief, the threat of Texas’ abortion banstill looms over thestate as cases continue to move through the courts. We already know the politicians behind this law willstop at nothing until they’ve banned abortion entirely,” the American Civil Liberties Union’s (ACLU) Brigitte Amirisaid in astatement. “This fight is far from over, and we’re ready to do everything we can to makesure every person can get the abortion care they need regardless of where they live or how much they make.”The lawsuit was brought by the Biden administration, and in a Twitter thread analyzing Pitman’s decision, Imani Gandyhighlights Pitman is rebuttal to Texas’ argument that the USs government has notsuffered harm from the abortion ban, which allows tosue any person who “aids or abets” an abortion performed aftersix weeks for $10,000 and attorneys’ fees. Pitman offers a list of federal agencies that “aid or abet” abortions, exposing the agencies or their employees to vigilante claims under the Texas law. But the next courts to hear the case are dominated by partisan Republicans who … don’t really care about the law, let alone women’s right toself-determination or privacy or medical care. Pitman methodically answered many of the outs Texas was trying to use, but the higher courts maystill embrace those, dismissing precedent and logic and common f’ingsense. Texas isn’t even the main game in far-right efforts to overturn, though. That’s coming on December 1 in Supreme Court arguments abo uta Mississippi law banning abortions after 15 weeks, with Mississippi officials making clear that yes, this is an effort to overturnRoe. It’s all too likely that the Trump Supreme Court will jump on this chance to gut women’s reproductive rights. In response to that imminent threat, a group of reproductive rights groups haveshifted theirstance on the filibuster, coming out in favor of filibuster reform or abolition for the first time. “We won’tstand forsenators hiding behind the abortion issue and opposing reform in our name,”said Shaunna Thomas of UltraViolet. “We cannot rely on the courts right now,so we’re working with what we have, which is a Dem majority which has promised two things to the women of color who put them in office—the right to vote and the right to control when they have children.”",1,1,Daily Kos
412,‘From hearsay to hard evidence’: are UFOs about to go mainstream?,-0.33,43.67,https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/may/29/ufos-uap-america-pentagon-report,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-guardian-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-29,25,"Nick Popespent the early 1990s investigatingUFOsfor the British ministry of defence. Sequestered in a rarely visited government office – the “metaphorical basement” – he well remembers how his field of work was regarded.“I would walk down the corridor and people would whistle the theme music to either Close Encounters of the Third Kind or the Twilight Zone,” Pope told the Guardian. Towards the end of hisspell at the MoD, a newscience fictionshow featuring a pair of FBI alien hunters was also growing in popularity. “I do recall the X-Files theme tune being whistled, too,” hesaid. In the nearly two decadessince then, attitudes towards UFOs haveslowly been changing, especially in America where thesubject matter has gone from the margins to the mainstream, with even former president Barack Obama opining on their potential existence. Rebranded by governments and enthusiasts as “UAPs”, or unidentified aerial phenomena, 2021 hasseen arguably the first everserious discussion of unknown flying things. In June the Pentagon isset to release a highly anticipated report on what it knows about UAPs, and the excitement about that disclosure has been fueled by aslew of witnesses coming forward toshare their experiences with the 60 Minutes newsshow in May Obama was among many public figures to add his thoughts on UAPs and the Pentagon report this month.“There’s footage and records of objects in theskies, that we don’t know exactly what they are, we can’t explain how they moved, their trajectory,” Obamasaid i nan interview with CBS. “They did not have an easily explainable pattern. Andso, you know I think that peoplestill takeseriously trying to investigate and figure out what that is.”Thesincerity of the discussion around UAPs – “I want us to take itseriously and have a process to take itseriously,” the Republicansenator Marco Rubio told 60 Minutes – is a far cry from the jeers Pope once faced. So what has changed in America?“In the last three years it has been elevated above just hearsay andsegued into hard evidence,”said Pope, who is now based in Arizona,said. “Not just the testimony from military pilots who’ve been involved in encounters with these things, but radar data and the infra-red camera videos that everyone’sseen.”In recent years aseries of government videosshowing UAPs, have been released, including footage from a navy F-18 fighter jet whichshowed an oblong object flying through thesky near San Diego in 2004. This April photos and videos taken by navy personnel wereleakedonline,showing triangular-shaped objects buzzing around in thesky, and in May leaked military footageshowed an oval flying object near a navyship in San Diego – an apparent UAP hotspot. Members of the navysaw UAPsso frequently that the encounters became commonplace, Ryan Graves, a retired navy pilot, told 60 Minutes.“Every day,” Gravessaid. “Every day for at least a couple years.”For Ted Roe, who runs the National Aviation Reporting Center on Anomalous Phenomena, a non-profit where pilots or others can report their experiences with UAPs, this was merely confirmation of what he already knew.“That doesn’tsurprise me at all,” Roesaid. “Somewhere in the world every day this is happening – it manifestssteadily, daily. And from my private conversations with current and former military fliers I feel that the reports that I get – as far as pilot reports – are clearly the tip of the iceberg.”But for all the apparent easing of taboo around UAPs, Roesays there isstill astigma.“Nobody is willing to risk their careers or reputation on thissubject, even now,” Roesaid. “Pilots won’t contact us until they retire. I’dsay it’s almost 50-50, the cases I get, that are more recent, versus those that happened years ago and they didn’t want to talk about because they would lose their flightstatus, and because they were worried about their careers.”The government – all governments – have previously been reluctant to even acknowledge that they monitor UAPs. In 2007 the US defense department launched an “Advanced aerospace threat identification program” to investigate UFOs. The effort wassosecretive that the public was only made aware of it 10 years later, af tera New York Times investigation. As leaked or officially published footage hasspread, however, demands for transparency from the public and politicians has grown, prompting the CIA to release thousands of documents on UAPs in January 2021. Rubio, the vice-chair of the Senate intelligence committee, has been a particularly loud voice, and he was part of a group of elected officials whosucceeded in thrusting theIntelligence Authorization Act for fiscal year 2021into the $2.3tn coronavirus reliefspending billsigned into law by Donald Trump in December. That act ordered government agencies to provide a declassified “detailed analysis of unidentified aerial phenomena data and intelligence”, and “a detailed description of an interagency process” for reporting UFOs. The report must be handed over by 25 June.“Men and women we have entrusted with the defense of our country are reporting encounters with unidentified aircraft withsuperior capabilities,” Rubio told the Tampa Bay Timesin mid-May“We cannot allow thestigma of UFOs to keep us fromseriously investigating this. The forthcoming report is onestep in that process, but it will not be the last.”The flurry of recent videos and the imminent release of the report has ignited an excitement around unidentified flying things notseen for years. Pope warned, however, that after years of furtiveness from intelligence agencies, peopleshould not expect the government to release it knows about these mysterious objects in thesky.“The report must be unclassified, but it could have a classified annex,so there’s astrong possibility that any earth-shattering facts will be in that classified annex, rather than the unclassified report,” Popesaid. He added: “So peopleshould be excited, but not too excited. Theyshould be pragmatic, and a little expectation management might be useful.”",1,1,The Guardian
413,The fall of Afghanistan in 2021 is the result of years of American delusion,-5.67,37.67,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/fall-afghanistan-2021-result-years-american-delusion-n1276883,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-16,25,"On Sunday morning, Taliban fighters captured Afghanistan isBagram Airfield— thesymbol andsource of US power projection in the region for 20 years — releasing thousands of prisoners. Within hours, Taliban fighters were trickling into the city center with little resistance. The Taliban had alreadyswept in and captured the capital city of Kabul. By nightfall, President Ashraf Ghani had fled the country, and the Taliban is reconquest of Afghanistan was complete. The idea that the Taliban were ever interested in peace talks was dubious before. Last Monday in Doha, Qatar — thesite of fruitless peace talks with the Taliban across now two administrations — the US envoy to those talks announced his intention to ""press the Taliban"" for an end to their offensive across Afghanistan. It was a naivestatement even at the time, and it has not improved in the weeksince. The Taliban had already been pressing at the gates ofseveral provincial Afghan capitals. Having withdrawn troops from the country, the US lacked whatever leverage it once had in negotiations with the insurgent group. But the White House appeared confident. ""Ultimately, our view is that the Afghansecurity forces have the equipment, numbers and training to fight back that willstrengthen their position at the negotiating table,""White House presssecretary Jen Psaki insistedTuesday. What negotiating table? The idea that the Taliban were ever interested in peace talks was dubious before. By the middle of last week, it was downright fanciful. And in the hours that passed after Psaki made this ponderous pronouncement, the Taliban took one city after another. Like dominoes, Herat, Ghazni, Kunduz, Lashkar Gah and Kandahar fell to insurgents. In the process,Taliban fighters took control of millions of dollars' worth of vehicles, helicopters, offensive weaponry and advanced military infrastructure.""The Taliban,"" Psakiobserved last week, ""has to make an assessment about what they want their role to be in the international community."" This was hardly an errant thought. On August 8, the US Embassy in the Afghan capital had admonished the Taliban forsacrificing the ""international legitimacy"" they claim to want. ""Theyshould devote their energy to the #PeaceProcess,"" read astatement from the Kabul embassy is Twitter account, ""not a military campaign. #CeasefireNow."" For now, the ""promise of hashtag"" remains unrealized. Like dominoes, Herat, Ghazni, Kunduz, Lashkar Gah and Kandahar fell to insurgents. The White House is irresolvable confusion notwithstanding, the Taliban had made it perfectly clear what their intentions were. As the insurgency retook Afghan territory, it resumed its abhorrent treatment of women and girls. Taliban members are reported to have targeted women with death for operating in professions or wearing clothing that offends the former leaders of the Islamic emirate. It has begunshuttering girls ischoolswith the intention of keeping them closed for good and relegating theirstudents back to theshadows of Afghansociety. And according to Human Rights Watch, the Taliban have beensummarily executing Afghan civilians linked to the government— a development Secretary of State Antony Blinken meeklysaid was ""troubling."" Already, the Afghans who put their lives on the line to assist the US Army over the last decades are reported to have been beheaded, a grotesque dereliction of our duty to the Afghans who foolishly believed in the US These were the verysame people wespent months talking ""peace"" with, demoralizing our Afghan allies in the process, only to abandon the charade and the country with it when it became clear that the Taliban were not going to let us take the easy way out. As recently as July, President Joe Biden insisted that it was ""not inevitable"" that the Taliban would retake control of the country. ""The likelihood that there is going to be a Taliban overrunning everything and owning the whole country is highly unlikely,""Biden reassured the public. By the middle of last week, intelligence officials who had thought it would take the Taliban a year to complete their reconquest of the country revised their estimates. Kabul would be cut off in the next 30 days, they warned. The city and the US-backed government would fall to the Taliban before the year is end. But even that was deliriously optimistic. Collapse came not in weeks but over the course of asingle weekend. Kabul was all butsurrounded not in 30 days but in 72 hours after these revised estimates were made public. The US, which had hoped to preserve its diplomatic presence in its embassy — it evensent 3,000 troops to ensure that prospect —summarily abandoned the place and evacuated all but askeleton crew. There may not have even been enough time to carry out orders to burnsensitivedocuments, agency logos and even US flags— lest the American public have to confront the wages of our defeat on their televisionscreens. The Biden White House is belief in a Taliban that existed only in their own minds wasso total that one of the administration is last, desperate gambits was to beg the insurgency for mercy. The New York Timesreported as recently as Thursday that the US envoy in Doha had a new objective: toseek assurances from the Taliban that they would leave America is embassy in peace. The administration was even reported to have dangled ""financial aid and other assistance"" to the ""future Afghan government,"" a euphemism for a Taliban-run enterprise. These were the verysame people wespent months talking ""peace"" with, demoralizing our Afghan allies in the process. Given the Taliban is commitment to violence and its refusal to renounce its ties to Islamist terrorist groups,such assurances — even if they were forthcoming — would not be worth a dime. Such a deal would only have legitimized an entity the Biden administration insists is illegitimate by virtue of the tactics it is using toseize power. And in the end, it would only have preserved a diplomatic presence in a capital city operated by a government Washington does not recognize. What were they thinking?With the near total collapse of the Afghan armed forces, the Biden administration was left to articulate its last, most demoralizing argument in favor of total withdrawal — we are powerless to alter the course of events andshould accept our utter futility. Over the weekend, the president released a writtenstatement outlining the rationale that led to our unilateral declaration of defeat. ""One more year, or five more years, of US military presence would not have made a difference if the Afghan military cannot or will not hold its own country,"" Biden insisted. The president is dubious exercise in clairvoyance notwithstanding, a review of even the recent past does notsupport this kind of fatalism. The notion that the Afghan conflict looked thesame in 2021 as it did in 2016 is downright hallucinatory. The US and NATO formally ended combat operations in Afghanistan at the end of 2014. In the years that followed, the American mission had been limited tosupport operations for local forces, many of which took place from behind the high walls of US-run facilities. To the extent that America is modest, affordable and low-risk footprint in Afghanistan maintained the peace, it was largely as a deterrent force that dissuaded the Taliban from embarking on the broad offensive now underway. The lastAmerican combat-related deathin Afghanistan occurred on February 8, 2020. Every USsoldier is death inservice to the country is tragic, and theirsacrifices must be honored. But to call that an unacceptable level of risk calls into question US deployments to places like Kosovo, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain and Kuwait, whereUSsoldiers also lost their lives last year. And yet, the happy fallacy Biden may come to regret putting his faith in most is the notion that the US was desperate to dissolve our commitments to the Afghan people and would celebrate that achievement. Where are thesighs of relief from a grateful public? Where are the celebrations? If Brookings Institutionscholars Madiha Afzal and Israa Saber are right, the Biden administration has misread the national mood.""The publicseems to be partly ambivalent, partly divided on the correct course of action,""they wrote in a careful dissection of recent polling on the American presence in Afghanistan. ""What is clear is that the common refrain in policy debates that 'Americans want out' is not accurate andshould not be presented as the driving force for efforts to withdraw from Afghanistan.""That idea — the notion that the American public longed for this humiliation — may prove to be just another delusion. And a terribly costly one, at that. Noah Rothman is the associate editor of Commentary Magazine.",1,1,MSNBC
414,Democrats are furious Trump’s DOJ got lawmakers’ data from Apple,-7.67,40.0,https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/6/11/22530070/trump-doj-apple-data-schiff,https://adfontesmedia.com/vox-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-11,25,"Democratic lawmakers are calling for an investigation into the Trump administration’s Department of Justice (DOJ) and its use ofsubpoenas to obtain device metad ata belonging to at least two members of Congress. Theysay it’s a disturbing attack on theseparation of powers, the principle of keeping the operations of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches generallyseparate from one another. The calls for oversight follow aNew York Times report revealing that the DOJ made Apple turn over records fromseveral people associated with the House Intelligence Committee — including Rep. Adam Schiff, Rep. Eric Swalwell, theirstaff and family, one of whom was a minor — in the midst of an investigation into people leaking classified information. While theseizure of this data happened back in 2017 and 2018, a DOJ gag order kept Apple from informing the representatives until just last month when they received an email notification from the company. Now, members are reportedly racing to gather more details from Apple about thescope of the DOJsubpoena, and the DOJ’s top nationalsecurity official, a Trump appointee, has resigned. At thesame time, the DOJ’s pursuit of phone data went beyond those lawmakers. In February 2018, the department alsosought communications data about an Apple account belonging to former White House counsel Don McGahn, according toa New York Times report published on Sunday. It’s not yet clear why the DOJsought that data, and Apple only notified McGahn about thesubpoena last month. That the Department of Justicesought the private phone data of US lawmakers without their knowledge is remarkable and disturbing. While details arestill emerging, the exchangesets a concerning precedent about the ability of the executive branch to obtain the digital records of lawmakers as well as tech companies’ roles in complying withsuch orders. Attention has now turned to both Apple and the DOJ, and it has raised concerns over how each approaches controversial government demands forsensitive data. It’s unclear what data Apple actually handed over. Apple did not respond to Recode’s request for comment. Recent reporting indicates that the informationshared with the DOJ about members of Congress andstaff were provided through the company’sstandard procedure of obliging government requests for data, and thatApple wasn’t awa reit was handing over data belonging to members of Congress. Still, Democrats are outraged, calling theseizure of this data “an assault” on theseparation of powers. Theysay thesubpoenas constituted dangerously broad governmentsurveillance deployed inservice of the political interests of then-President Donald Trump.“President Trump repeatedly and flagrantly demanded that the Department of Justice carry out his political will and tried to use the Department as a cudgel against his political opponents and members of the media,” Rep. Schiff told Recode in astatement. “It is increasingly apparent that those demands did not fall on deaf ears.”RelatedThe DOJ’s inspector general, Michael Horowitz,announcedon Friday that he willstart a review of the agency’s actions under the Trump administration and will look at “whether anysuch uses, or the investigations, were based upon improper considerations.” Sen. Ron Wydenhas also promised to introduce legislation aimed at “reform[ing] the abuse of gag orders” and increasing transparency into governmentsurveillance. On Monday, the New York Timesreportedthat John Demers, head of the DOJ’s nationalsecurity division and one of the the last remaining Trump appointees at the department, would resign following the outcry. While Demers did not become the DOJ’s top nationalsecurity official until after thesubpoenas for Democrats’ records weresent,some want to know what Demers knew about the ongoing investigations. Companies like Apple frequently hand over user data when government agencies demand it. Here’s how Recode’s Sara Morrison explained it last year. Depending on what law enforcement is looking for, it may not need physical possession of your device at all. A lot of information on your phone is alsostored elsewhere. For example, if you back up your iPhone to Apple’s iCloud, the government can get it from Apple. If it needs tosee whose DMs youslid into, law enforcement can contact Twitter. As long as they go through the proper and established legal channels to get it, police can get their hands on pretty much anything you’vestored outside of your device. You do havesome rights here. The Fourth Amendment protects you from illegalsearch andseizure, and a provision of theElectronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986(ECPA) dictates what law enforcement must obtain in order to get the information. It might be asubpoena, court order, or warrant, depending on what it’s looking for. (WhatsApp actually does a good job of explaining this in its FAQ.) Asection of the ECPA, known as the Stored Communications Act,says thatservice providers must have those orders before they can give the requested information to law enforcement. But, assuming the government has the right paperwork, your information is very obtainable. On Apple’s US-focusedtransparency website, the companysays it can receive government requests related to a person’s device identifier, financial identifiers, customer data related to account information, and customer data requested in the midst of an emergency. In the case of the DOJ’s investigation into leaks, Appleturned over metad ata and account information, according to the Times.“In this case, thesubpoena, which was issued by a federal grand jury and included a nondisclosure ordersigned by a federal magistrate judge, provided no information on the nature of the investigation, and it would have been virtually impossible for Apple to understand the intent of the desired information without digging through users’ accounts,” a companyspokesperson, Fred Sainz, told the New York Times. “Consistent with the request, Apple limited the information it provided to accountsubscriber information and did not provide any contentsuch as em ails or pictures.”“These demands for lawmakers’ private data are especially disturbing because they threaten theseparation of powers. But the problem is far bigger,” ACLUsenior attorney Patrick Toomey told Recode in an email. “The governmentseizes thesensitive information of vast numbers of people each year, often without any notice to the people affected.”Tech companies do havesome power when they receive these kinds of requests. They can try to reject a government request as being invalid, though they often don’t. Challengingsuch a request can also be hard to do if a company has limited information on what the request is actually for. Applesays that between January and June 2020, the company provided data 82 percent of the time when a government agency requested identifying information about a particular device. Tech companies can also try to fight a gag order. In this case, a gag orderseemed to remain in place. This is concerning. At thesame time, theseizure of this kind of data is a dark reminder that companies like Apple continue to hold onto vast amounts of user data and that they can be legally obligated to hand it over to the government without a user ever knowing.

415,"Chaos, violence, mockery as pro-Trump mob occupies Congress",-5.33,45.0,https://chicago.suntimes.com/2021/1/6/22217370/police-order-evacuation-buildings-capitol-hill,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-sun-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-07,25,"WASHINGTON — “Where are they?” a Trumpsupporter demanded in a crowd of dozens roaming the halls of the Capitol, bearing Trump flags and pounding on doors. They — lawmakers,staff members and more — were hiding under tables, hunkered in lockdowns,saying prayers andseeing the fruits of the country’s divisions up close and violent. Guns were drawn. A woman wasshot and killed by police, and three others died in apparent medical emergencies. A Trump flag hung on the Capitol. The graceful Rotunda reeked of tear gas. Glassshattered. On Wednesday, hallowedspaces of American democracy, one after another, yielded to the occupation of Congress. The pro-Trump mob took over the presiding officer’s chair in the Senate, the offices of the Housespeaker and the Senate dais, where one yelled, “Trump won that election.”They mocked its leaders, posing for photos in the office of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one with his feet propped on a desk in her office, anothersitting in thesameseat Vice President Mike Pence had occupied only moments before during the proceedings to certify the Electoral College vote. That certification would eventually take place, but not until well after midnight. This began as a day of reckoning for President Donald Trump’s futile attempt to cling to power as Congress took up the certification of President-elect Joe Biden’s victory. It devolved intoscenes of fear and agony that left a prime ritual of American democracy in tatters. Trump told his morning crowd at the Ellipse that he would go with them to the Capitol, but he didn’t. Instead hesent them off with incendiary rhetoric.“If you don’t fight like hell, you’re not going to have a country anymore,” hesaid. “Let the weak ones get out,” he went on. “This is a time forstrength.”His lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, told the crowd, “Let’s have trial by combat.”What happened Wednesday was nothing less than an attempted coup,said Rep. Diana DeGette, D-Colo. Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., a frequent Trump critic,said, “Today, the USs Capitol — the world’s greatestsymbol ofself-government — was ransacked while the leader of the free world cowered behind his keyboard.”Sasse went on: “Lies have consequences. This violence was the inevitable and ugly outcome of the president’s addiction to constantlystoking division.”Policesaid they recovered two pipe bombs, one outside the Democratic National Committee and one outside the Republican National Committee and a cooler from a vehicle that had a long gun and Molotov cocktail on Capitol grounds. Yet Trump, in a video posted 90 minutes after lawmakers were evacuated, told the insurrectionists “We love you. You’re veryspecial,” while asking them to go home. Authorities eventually regained control as night fell. Heavily armed officers brought in as reinforcementsstarted using tear gas in a coordinated effort to get people moving toward the door, then combed the halls forstragglers, pushing the mob farther out onto the plaza and lawn, in clouds of tear gas, flash-bangs and percussion grenades. Video footage alsoshowed officers letting people calmly walk out the doors of the Capitol despite the rioting and vandalism. Only about a dozen arrests were made in the hours after authorities regained control. Theysaid a woman wasshot earlier as the mob tried to break through a barricaded door in the Capitol where police were armed on the otherside. She was hospitalized with a gunshot wound and later died. Early on,some inside the Capitolsaw the trouble coming outside the windows. Democratic Rep. Dean Phillips of Minnesotasurveyed the growing crowd on the grounds not long after Trump had addressed hissupporters by the Ellipse, fueling their grievances over an election that he and theysay he won, against all evidence.“I looked out the windows and couldsee how outmanned the Capitol Police were,” Phillipssaid. Under the very risersset up for Biden’s inauguration, Trumpsupporters clashed with police who blasted pepperspray in an attempt to hold them back. It didn’t work. Throngs of mask less MAGA-hatted demonstrators tore down metal barricades at the bottom of the Capitol’ssteps. Some in the crowd wereshouting “traitors” as officers tried to keep them back. They broke into the building. Announcements blared: Due to an “externalsecurity threat,” no one could enter or exit the Capitol complex, the recordingsaid. A loud bangsounded as officials detonated asuspicious package to makesure it was not dangerous. It was about 1:15 p.m. when New Hampshire Rep. Chris Pappas, a Democrat,said Capitol Police banged on his door and “told us to drop everything, get out as quickly as we could.”“It was breathtaking how quickly law enforcement got overwhelmed by these protesters,” he told The Associated Press. Shortly after 2 p.m., Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa and Vice President Mike Pence were evacuated from the Senate as protesters and policeshouted outside the doors. With the Washington Monument in the background, people attend a rally insupport of President Donald Trump near the White House on Wednesday, January 6, 2021, in Washington.“Protesters are in the building,” were the last words picked up by a microphone carrying a live feed of the Senate before itshut off. Police evacuated the chamber at 2:30 p.m., grabbing boxes of Electoral College certificates as they left. Phillips yelled at Republicans, “This is because of you!”Rep. Scott Peters, D-Calif., told reporters he was in the House chamber when protesters beganstorming it. Hesaidsecurity officers urged lawmakers to put gas masks on and herded them into a corner of the massive room.“When we got over to otherside of the gallery, the Republicanside, they made us all get down, you couldsee that they were fending offsomesort of assault, it looked like,” hesaid. “They had a piece of furniture up against the door, the door, the entry to the floor from the Rotunda, and they had guns pulled.” The officers eventually escorted the lawmakers out of the chamber. Shortly after being told to put on gas masks, most members were quickly escorted out of the chamber. Butsome members remained in the upper galleryseats, where they had beenseated due to distancing requirements. Smoke fills the walkway outside the Senate Chamber assupporters of President Donald Trump are confronted by US Capitol Police officers inside the Capitol Wednesday. Along with a group of reporters who had been escorted from the press area and Capitol workers who act as ushers, the members ducked on the floor as policesecured a door to the chamber down below with guns pointed. After makingsure the hallways were clear, policeswiftly escorted the members and others down aseries of hallways and tunnels to a cafeteria in one of the House office buildings. Describing thescene, Democratic Rep. Jim Himes of Connecticutsaid “there was a point there where officers had their guns and weapons pointed at the door, they were obviously expecting a breach through the door. It was clear that there were pretty close to pulling the triggerso they asked us all to get down in the chamber.”As he walked out of the Capitol, Himessaid he had lived in Latin America and “always assumed it could never happen here.“We’ve known for years that our democracy was in peril and this is hopefully the worst and final moment of it,” Himessaid. “But with a president egging these people on, with the Republicans doing all they can to try to make people feel like their democracy has been taken away from them even though they’re the ones doing the taking, it’s really hard, reallysad. Ispent my entire political career reaching out to the otherside. And it’s really hard tosee this.”Democratic Illinois Rep. Mike Quigley was also in the balcony. “It’s not good to be around terrified colleagues, with guns drawn toward people who have a barricade ... people crying.

The NCLA urged GMU to reexamine the policy “to deem natural immunity at least equivalent to that achieved through vaccination, and to confirm that Professor Zywicki will not lose eligibility for future pay raises (merit or otherwise) if he does not wish toshare his vaccinationstatus.”“George Mason is forcing me to choose betweenserving mystudents on one hand and undergoing an unnecessary and potentially risky medical procedure on the other. Multiple clinicalstudies haveshown that natural immunity provides at least as much protection against reinfection as the most effective vaccines,” Zywickisaid in astatement.

The Gym was closed Thursday afternoon, and inside a person could beseen measuring a floor mat. The nutritionshop attached to the gym remained open. The clerk at theshopsaid the gym was in the process of readying its equipment to move outdoors. Three people or more testing positive for COVID-19 is considered an outbreak. Of the 235 outbreaksso far countywide, five were in gyms, a countyspokesmansaid Thursday. About half of all outbreaks were in congregate care facilities. No gym is allowed to operate indoors under the county health order first issued in March and updated again Thursday, thespokesmansaid. He could notsay which other gyms had reported novel coronavirus cases. Many of the large chainssuch as Crunch and 24-Hour Fitness are closed, butsome of thesmaller, independent gyms have defied the county order. Another fitness center called The Gym, with different owners, was filled with clients Thursday morning in Vista, many not wearing masks or maintaining the required 6-foot distance. Co-owner Todd Dannersaid the management planned to move their equipment outside to the parking lot, and he did not look happy about it.“Some of these (weight)stacks weigh 1,000 pounds,” Dannersaid. Movers were coming to help carry things, and he needs to buy tents and artificial turf for the asphalt. He feels like his business already complies with the county’s emergency public health order, hesaid. Still, Vista city officialssent him a list of things that needed be done. Later Thursday, the Vista Sheriff’s Station received a formal complaint about the business,said Lt. Ricardo Lopez, media relations director for the Sheriff’s Department.“Deputies visited the business just before 12:30 p.m. to notify gymstaff they were in violation of the public health order,” Lopezsaid by email. “They were given an updated copy of the current order. A formal crime case is being written and will besubmitted to the San Diego County District Attorney’s Office.”Violation of the county health order is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, up tosix months in jail, or both, Lopezsaid. No one answered the phone at The Gym in Vista late Thursday afternoon. The county had issued a total of 144 citations for violating the county health orders through Wednesday, according to the Sheriff’s Department’s website. Boulevard Fitness in City Heights was open and operating Thursday morning in a large open area with open garage-door-sized windows that opened nearly an entire wall of the multi-level building to open air. Fans on the floor and ceiling created a noticeable breeze throughout thespace. Some areas,such as an area with treadmills and an exercise room, were closed off because they did not have windows or doors to the outside,said owner Shawn Gilbert. Customers, almost all of whom were wearing face coverings,sanitized their hands and got their temperature taken before being allowed inside. Machines werespaced 6 feet apart – Gilbertsaid they measured carefully – and there was a covered, open-air area outside the big windows with equipment in it where people who wanted to be all the way outside could work out. The gym was not accepting new members and it had limited use to 50 percent of the facility’s capacity, Gilbertsaid. Hesaid the gym would be closed on Sunday for professional deep cleaning. Gilbertsaid police had come by twice about a week ago in response to a noise complaint about the music in the gym. Gilbertsaid the music didn’tseem particularly loud to him, but he turned it down and police left. Hesaid police did not express any other concerns about the gym’s operations. No county officials or anysort of multi-agency “strike teams” had come to the gym, Gilbertsaid. Hesaid he had not received any cease or desist letters from the county, nor any public health orders to close, and he felt “1,000 percent”sure the gym’s operations were permissible under public health orders. No classes were underway Thursday ata jiu-jitsu gym in Normal Heights that had opened in defiance of the county’s public health order in May One employee was inside the building. The main entrance was locked and the lobby was dark. A phone call to the gym reached voice mail and an email was not immediately answered Thursday afternoon. Weights were being lifted at the Metroflex Gym in Oceanside, where owner Lou Uridel was briefly arrested in May for re-opening after a two-month closure in violation of the county health order. He has a court hearingscheduled for September.“Right now, we feel we are in compliance,” Uridelsaid Thursday afternoon. Mask-wearing, which for a time was optional, is now mandatory, hesaid. He and his employees emphasizeself-care, cleanliness, and distancing, and they encourage their clients to maintain asafe distance. Occupancy of his building is limited to a maximum of 35 people, about 20 percent of its normal capacity, hesaid. Fans have been added and a rear door opened to keep air moving through the interior. Foot traffic is routed in one door and out another. Police officers frequentlystop by to check on his business, Uridelsaid. He tells them he is complying with the rules and that nothing has changed, and they leave. Uridel, an attorney licensed in California and Illinois,said COVID-19 and its prevention has become a political issue and he appears OK with that. He recently decided to run for Oceanside mayor in November, and a big plank in his campaign issupport forsmall businesses. Located close to Camp Pendleton Marine Corps Base, almost three-quarters of the clients at Metroflex are active-duty military or veterans. Somesaid they feel like a family. Don Butts, a trainer who workssix days a week at Metroflex,said he feelssafe there.“I haven’t gottensick,” hesaid. “None of my clients have gottensick.”Oceanside policespokesman Tom Busseysaid Thursday it is the county’s responsibility, not the city’s, to enforce the public health order. Police have oftensaid enforcement of thestate and county public health orders is difficult for many reasons. Some people claim that requiring a business to close violates the owner’s rights under thestate and federal constitutions. Also, because the health orders are issued by thestate and county, city police departments may not have the authority to enforce them. County officialssaid this week they plan to form enforcement teams with representatives from each city in an attempt to improve compliance.",2,2,San Diego Union-Tribune

Alcindor pointed out thatsome interpreted the comment as embracing white nationalists. Trump, looking annoyed,said, ""I do not know why you'dsay that. That issuch a racist question.""On Monday, at another White House coronavirus briefing, the president called on her again, and Alcindor asked why the USs was lagging behind other countries, including South Korea, in providing coronavirus tests for their citizens. He answered, ""We have done more tests than any other country in the world, by far.""Then the president challenged her on the premise of her question. ""I know South Korea better than anybody. It is a very tight — do you know how many people are in Seoul?"" he asked. ""Do you know how big the city of Seoul is?"" Alcindor just kept looking at him, poised to press her question again. ""Thirty-eight million people,"" Trumpsaid, ""That is bigger than anything we have. Thirty-eight million people, all tightly wound together."" (The actual figure is close to 10 million.)Finally, hestared at her,seemingly exasperated: ""Youshould besaying congratulations rather than asking a reallys narky question.""ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesWith that, he announced the press briefing was over, turned his back on the reporters and quicklystrode into the White House. On Sunday night, Alcindortweeted out her response to the interaction with Trump: ""President Trump today at the White Housesaid to me: 'Be nice. Do not be threatening.' I’m not the first human being, woman, black person or journalist to be told that while doing a job. My take: Besteady. Stay focused. Remember your purpose. And, always press forward.""What about Alcindorseems to get under Trump isskinso much?April Ryan has a theory. Ryan, like Alcindor, is a longtime Washington reporter who has verbally tussled with the president at contentious White House news conferences. And Ryan, like Alcindor, is African-American. Ina 2018 essayfor, Ryan wrote about how Trump had frequently attacked her (""nasty,"" loser""), Alcindor (""racist"") and another African-American reporter, CNN is Abby Phillip (""I watch you a lot, you ask a lot ofstupid questions"") in ways thatseemed more deeply personal than his criticism of their white, male colleagues. The Washington Postheadline was: ""I’m a black woman. Trump loves insulting people like me.""Wrote Ryan: ""When Trump denigrates black women, he’ssending the message that he doesn’tsee us equally.""With the latest round of exchanges this week, other journalists and prominent figures weighed in, echoing Ryan issentiment. ""'Be nice. Don’t be threatening' oh my god what a textbook distillation of his racism andsexism,""tweetedRebecca Traister, a writer formagazine. I’msosorry @Yamiche is his target butshe’sso goddamn great at her job.""""You go girl,""tweetedSusan Rice, the former ambassador to the UN in the Obama administration. ""Pathetic when insecure men can’tstomachstrong black women.""OnMonday is episode of the podcast""Pod Save America,"" Alcindor declined tospeculate whether Trump might besingling her out because of her race. Insteadshe pivoted,saying that, in the face of this pandemic crisis, ""We do not have time for foolishness; we do not have time forsideshows.""Of course, Alcindor is not the only reporter Trump has attacked during his three years in office. He is banned CNN is Jim Acostaandsaid to Peter Alexander, ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself,"" when the NBC reporter asked of the coronavirus outbreak: ""What do yousay to Americans watching you right now who arescared?""ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesBut as others have pointed out, Trump doesseem to have a particular problem with women who challenge him, regardless of race. As Molly Jong-Fast wrote fo rin November, during the Ukraine hearings of the House Intelligence Committee, Trump took to Twitter to lash out at Marie Yovanovitch, the former ambassador to Ukraine, in ways thatseemed more pointed than his earlier criticisms of previous witnesses, Yovanovitch is fellow diplomats William Taylor and George Kent. (""Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad,"" his tweet began, before ending with ""it is a US President’s absolute right to appoint ambassadors. "")""Why was the president’s responseso different to witnesses who were roughlysaying thesame thing?"" Jong-Fast asked. ""What was the big difference between Kent and Taylor and Yovanovitch? All three are career diplomats, all three are Ivy League graduates, all three have worked in the State Department, all three are experts in Ukraine. But only one of them is a woman. Could that be why the presidentsingled out Yovanovitch? It is almost as if the president is unable to control his rage against women. It is almost as if the president thinks he can bully women andsilence them.""In a column i non Monday, headlined, ""Yamiche Alcindor wants an answer, thank you very much,"" the paper is media critic, Eric Wemple, weighed in. He quoted a PBSspokeswoman in defense of Alcindor: ""She is doing exactly what is expected of a free press in our democracy: posing timely, pertinent questions to those in power on behalf of the American people. She was hardly the only reporter in the Rose Garden yesterday, or at other times, to be on the receiving end ofsuch treatment. It will not deter Yamiche from asking fair and direct questions, especially atsuch a critical time.”""Good!,"" Wemple responded in his column. ""Those fair and direct questions, after all, continue illuminating the petty and insecuresoul of President Trump as he runs away from his previousstatements, utters barely comprehensible excuses for his mismanagement and otherwise diffuses astink in the Rose Garden.""",1,1,Vogue

The Chinese drone giant was named to the blacklist on Friday for “enabl[ing] wide-scale human rights abuses within China through abusive genetic collection and analysis or high-technologysurveillance” — most likely a reference to how DJI provided drones and other technology to the Chinese government to be used in its Muslim detention camps in the Xinjiang province.“DJI is disappointed in the US Department of Commerce’s decision. Customers in America can continue to buy and use DJI products normally,” the companysaid in astatement to. “DJI remains committed to developing the industry’s most innovative products that define our company and benefit the world.”The company declined to provide any more information about what it thinks will happen as a result of being named to the Entity List. Being on the list typically means US companies are banned from exporting technology to blacklisted companies. DJI not onlysells products to consumers, butsince it is far and away the market leader, its technology is used by allsorts of companies that need drones or hand held cameras. This is not the first time that access to Chinese drones has been targeted by the US government, usually due tosecurity concerns. The Department of Justicebannedthe buying of foreign-made drones with agency funds in October, and the Department of the Interiorsaid it would ground its drone fleet while it looks into claims ofspying and cyberattacks.

427,Film Crew Members Say The Alec Baldwin Prop Gun Shooting Fits A Pattern Of Safety Shortfalls They’ve Had To Work Against,-5.0,37.0,https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/briannasacks/rust-film-prop-safety-protocols,https://adfontesmedia.com/buzzfeed-news-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-24,25,"“The lack of accountability is astronomical. It’s endemic.”BuzzFeed News ReporterThis aerial photoshows a filmset at the Bonanza Creek Ranch in Santa Fe, where Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun, killing the cinematographer, officialssaid. Producers on theset ofRustin New Mexico,whereAlec Baldwinaccidentallyshot and killed director of photography Halyna Hutchins, cutsignificant corners when it came tosafety protocols and working conditions, according to those who were involved and familiar with the project. Interviews with 10 production workers, documents, and em ails obtained by BuzzFeed Newsshow that those in charge of producing the Westernstaffed key roles with less-experienced, nonunion workers and rushed thesour c ing of props,such as guns, tosave money at the expense ofsafe and humane working conditions. At least two property masters — who are in charge of acquiring, validating, choreographing, and overseeing all the props and departmentstaff in a production, including weapons and those in charge of them —said that they turned down the opportunity to work onRustbecause of their concerns over how rushed the project was, what they considered to be low-ball pay, and how “flippant” the producersseemed about protocols. In 2019, a prop maker and licensed pyrotechnician with the Local 44 union filed a formal complaint against Dave Halls, the assistant director onRustwho handed Baldwin the loaded gun, for violatingsafety protocols,specifically related to firearms onset. Crew members also walked off one of his more recent projects after he had themshoot “guerrilla”-style on train tracks in the middle of the night. There have been a host of other missteps that workerssay exemplify thesystemic issues that have long plagued production and jeopardized theirsafety. Workers in the industrysay a culture of ignoring basicstandards, outsourcing to less-experienced workers, and paying unlivable wages to churn out content more quickly and cheaply is a big part of why Hutchins, a revered and admired cinematographer who was the film’s director of photography, is now dead.“It’s literally a war zone onsome of these films, and no one takes responsibility. No one acknowledges that this culture ofsucking it up and dealing with it is a problem,” Maggie Goll, a prop maker and licensed pyrotechnician, told BuzzFeed News. “The lack of accountability is astronomical. It’s endemic.”Asource close to the production pushed back on allegations that producers cut corners tosave money, pointing out that it is an IATSE/Teamsters/SAG DGA union/guild–certifiedset, and everything was done according to union guidelines. Thesource alsosaid that they had three full-setsafety meetingssince the filmstarted earlier this month, including on the day of the accident. In a new lettersent to crew Sunday night, obtained by BuzzFeed News, Rust Movie Productions reiterated that it was ""conducting an internal review ofsafety protocols"" and cooperating with Sante Fe authorities. The producerssaid they decided "" to wrap theset at least until the investigations are complete.""Santa Fesheriff is detectivessaid theshooting took place as the cast and crew were rehearsing with the equipment, which wasset up by one of the film’s production assistants and the armorer. According to court documents, the assistant director picked up one of the prop guns that wassitting on a cart outside, yelled, “Cold gun!” — meaning that the weapon wassafe to use — and handed it to Baldwin without knowing it contained live rounds. For months, production workers from across the industry and part of the unionInternational Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees(IATSE) have been threatening tostrike, citing exhausting,stressful conditions that were exacerbated by the pandemic. Rustwas no different, theysay. Crews on the low-budget, Old West period film were working 14- to 18-hour days,staying in a dilapidated hotel an hour away from theset, and making well belowstandard rates while at one point waiting three weeks to get paid, according to two people familiar with thesituation and reporting by other media outlets. The Los Angeles Timesreported that camera operators also made a complaint about the lack of gunsafety and protocol onset last weekend after two other accidental prop gun discharges. Thesituation wasso egregious that in protest, members of Hutchins’ camera crew walked off theset over the working conditions, a rare move that industry veterans told BuzzFeed News was a “huge red flag” thatshould have immediately halted production.""A handful of members of the camera crew quit the production on Wednesday night,"" aspokesperson for Rust Movie Productionssaid. ""The camera crew is not involved with props and propsafety protocols and have no interaction with the firearms used in production.""In the culture of Hollywood, you endure and protect your team, especially those who brought you into the gig, industry veteranssaid. It has to be incredibly dire, they added, for unionized operators to choose to abandon the job and leave their director. Movie industry workers take part in a candlelight vigil to honor cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in Albuquerque, New Mexico, on October 23. Warnings about the production arose in September when Neal Zoromski, a veteran property master, told one of the producers that he had concerns about how and where they weresour c ing props and personnel for the film. On Sept. 20, Row Walters, a unit production manager, reached out to Zoromski asking if he would be interested in joining the Tier 1A feature (that classification means it’s a low-budget production),shooting in Santa Festarting October 6, according to em ails obtained by BuzzFeed News. But the low rates,slimstaffing, and rushed time line were red flags,said Zoromski, who has been in the industrysince 1989, is a 25-year union member, and has worked on everything from7th HeaventoThe Day After Tomorrow.“They didn’tseem to be playing it right from the beginning,” hesaid. “It feltslipshod, and the vibe was that this is a very unsafesituation, and I told them as much.”Based on conversations with Walters and a production designer, the prop master realized that they “were behind the eight ball” and trying to prepare a project days before it was about tostart. Unfortunately, that has become the trend in Hollywood, hesaid, to try to throw a production together in 8 to 10 days, when the “bare minimumshould be three weeks.”They were “flippant” with details about the weapons that were to be provided andshrugged off his questions about who was going to be onstaff, Zoromski added. He alsosaid they insisted they had everything they needed locally — “and that’s a great concern.”As the demand for content has exploded and more companies are jumping into thestreaming frenzy,studios have been creating projects in places outsideLos Angeleslike New Mexico, which union workerssay is cheaper. Often, as union workers who have worked on New Mexico productions told BuzzFeed News, that means production companies can hire less-experienced people to fill key roles,such asRust’s 24-year-old armorer, Hannah Gutierrez-Reed, for less money. In apod cast last month, Gutierrez-Reed — who has not responded to BuzzFeed News’ request for comment — talked about being new to the role after just coming off her first film,The Old Way. The Daily Beast reported that filming on thatset was allegedly briefly paused because of concerns over howshe was handling the weapons. In his discussions withRustproducers last month, Zoromskisaid he inquired about the armorer,since it’s usually the prop master’s job to hire that role, as well as the weapons. According to em ails and the callsheet, obtained by BuzzFeed News, the prop master had two assistants, one of whom was also the armorer. It was concerning, hesaid, that the film chose to combine those two roles into one. It compressed that person’s ability to “check the functioning guns, test them, and prepare them for use.” The callsheet alsoshowed that most of the crew members were nonunion, meaning they were likely paid below thestandard wage. Zoromski and other industry experts also balked at the findings from a Santa Fesheriff’ssearch warrant, whichstated that Halls, the assistant director, picked up a revolver from a cart and handed the weapon to Baldwin. That goes against guidelines from the Actors’ Equity Association, whichstate that “all loading of firearms must be done by the property master, armorer or experienced persons working under their directsupervision.”“It is absolutely beyond the pale that an AD would ever touch or grab a prop weapon off a cart and give it directly to an actor to rehearse or otherwise,” the prop mastersaid. Halls, who could not be reached for comment Sunday, has worked on aslew of films andshows, including blockbusters likeTheMatrix, in various assistant director rolessince the 1990s, based on his IMDb profile. And according to the Directors Guild of America, he recently completed asafety training course mandatory for membership eligibility. But two people who worked with him on various pastshowssaid that he has a history of disregarding basicsafety protocols and measures,such as not checking weapons, not holdingsafety meetings, and inappropriately addressing women. Back in February, crew members also walked off the Georgiaset of another low-budget production where Halls worked as assistant director,One Way, because of what theysaid were unsafe working conditions and lack of pay. Angela Schroeder, aset decorator, told BuzzFeed News that the finalstraw for a few members was the last night, when Halls decided toshoot at an active train yard becauseshesaid the production company had not properlysecured any locations. The assistant director had all of the crew working within 30 feet of at least eight dark train tracks in the middle of the night, withoutspotters,shesaid, adding that “nobody knew what they were doing.”Halls later posted a photo on Facebook of them moving a fake body with a train in the background, calling it “the martinishot” for the last day. The worst part, Schroedersaid, was that it was around the anniversary of the death of Sarah Jones, a camera assistant who was fatallystruck by a train on another Georgia movieset in 2014. In follow-up interviews with BuzzFeed News, two other people involved with the trainscenesaid that they had planned toshoot near train tracks and it was planned,scouted, and fully vetted, as evidenced by callsheets. Eric Napier, the location manager,said that they had contacted the railroad company about filming on the property next to it.""All filming locations werescouted, vetted, rented, and insured. I do not work on 'guerrilla' projects. I will not work with a company that does not invest the time, resources, and money to do it right,"" hesaid. ""I have unfortunately worked with producers that cut corners and do not care about the crew, Thomasville Pictures is not one of those teams.""Goll, the pyrotechnician with the Local 44 union, had asimilar experience with the assistant director in 2019 while working onInto the Dark, an anthologyseries. Theshow, whichstreamed on Hulu and was made by Blumhouse Productions — which notoriouslyset thestandard for making blockbuster content for little money — was also low budget, with conditions and culturesimilar toRust is,shesaid. She ended upsubmitting a complaint to the DGA Usually, when there are dangerous elements in a production,such as gunfire,stunts, or pyrotechnics, leaders onset host a meeting every morning to go over the props used and the risks, as well as ensure that there are known fire lanes and usable exits in casesomething goes wrong. OnInto the DarkandOne Way, those meetings, as well as other basicsafety processes, were not happening, and crew members complained, Goll and otherstaffsaid.“It was inexcusable that we had to basically demand those universal, common policies everysingle day,”shesaid. “It’s like that on manyshows now because it’s this culture of 'Shut up, do the job,stop whining, and get it done.' Seconds are money, and the faster they can rush through things, thatsaves money. But we are asking ourselves now,What is that cost? And it’s our lives, livelihood, and general well-being.”Gollsaid Halls often complained about and was exasperated by extrasafetysteps onInto the Dark, like having a gun “cleared” by a professional technician. And contrary to protocol, Halls would not inform workers when there was a weapon present, or distinguish between a real gun and a prop, until the assistant prop master demanded that Halls inform the crew every time. A representative for Blumhouse Productions did not immediately respond to a request for comment.“We were being dismissed to our faces even thoughso many people knew it was wrong,”shesaid. “It’s frustrating becauseso often this falls on deaf ears, and people have been afraid tospeak up, because when you do, you are not there in the days to follow.”That, at least, has changed. Production workers have beenspeaking out about what they’ve endured on the job en masse, fillingsocial media accounts withstories and organizing rallies. There is a new,sweepingsolidarity, Gollsaid, because they are no longer accepting what is atstake: their lives. “We no longer want to be treated as expendable.”",1,1,BuzzFeed News

S House of Representatives voted topass the Equality Act, the LGBTQ+ rights legislation that would ban discrimination based onsexual orientation or gender identity. While the billstill has to proceed through the Senate to become law, the vote is a firststep towards ahu ge win for LGBTQ+ Americans. Acrosssocial media, people are already cheering this bill is progress. TheEquality Act, which was previously introduced in 2019, would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to ban discrimination based on gender identity andsexual orientation. The bill would cover discrimination in employment in housing, employment, and public businesses like restaurants,stores, andservices. While it passed the House in 2019, it was not brought for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate at the time. Now, reintroduced in a Democrat-controlled Congress, the bill has passed the house in a 224-206 vote, per CNN, with at least three Republicans crossing party lines to vote in its favor. Notably, this version of the bill follows the Supreme Court is June 2020decision in, in which the Court ruled that a gay man fired from his job had been discriminated against — asserting thatsexual orientation and gender identity were covered undersex discrimination. Now, the Equality Act would codify that ruling and its precedent into law, while expanding its applicability. Acrosssocial media, people celebrated the vote and expressed their hopes for the future. Now, the bill goes to the Senate, where it already hasstrongsupporters among the Democratic Party, and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has promised to bring it to a vote. However, its ultimate fate is unclear, as it will have to pass the 60-vote threshold to avoid a filibuster. Conservative opponents havesuggested that it would violate religious liberty by requiring businesses and institutions to provideservices to LGBTQ+ people — the Equality Act would explicitlysupersede 1993 isReligious Freedom Restoration Act(RFRA), which prohibits the government from ""substantially"" burdening the free exercise of religion. Inshort, religious beliefs could not be used to justify discrimination against LGBTQ+ people. Still, the bill has a far better chance in 2021 with a Democrat-controlled Senate than under a Republican-controlled Senate back in 2019.

The UK isset on its road map to 'freedom day' but cases are rising, challenges in the labour market persist and the initialspending boom couldslow in pace.""Aftershrinking at thestart of the year under renewed lockdowns, the economy is meant to besurging back. On a chart, a line graph looks like thesecond bounce of a precipitous economic bungee jump. In that light, today is figures are a disappointment. The consensus forecast was for growth of 1.5% in May Instead we got barely half that - 0.8% - with activity in constructionshrinking for thesecond month in a row and manufacturing also down. Some of that was down to one-off factorssuch as theshortage of microchips, which forced carmakers tosend workers home. But while activity in restaurants and pubs jumped as customers were allowed inside for the first time in months, it is clear that our economic bungee cord isslackening before it was expected. The economy remains 3.1% below where it was in February last year, and no larger than it was in January 2017, making it one of the two weakest performers in the G20 group of advanced economies. In the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are the most widely watched. In a growing economy, quarterly GDP will beslightly bigger than the quarter before, asign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer. Most economists, politicians and businesses like tosee GDP risingsteadily. Rising GDP means more jobs are likely to be created, and workers are more likely to get better pay rises. If GDP is falling, then the economy isshrinking - bad news for businesses and workers. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known as a recession, which can mean pay freezes and lost jobs.

However, the difference is narrowing. The value of imports from non-EU countries were £20bn in May, while imports from the bloc - many of which face new barriers to cross-border trade - were £18.4bn, the ONSsaid.

Bidenhas indicated that he will reverse the Mexico City Policy, which bars foreign organizations receiving US funding from providing abortions, abortion information or abortion referrals. He has also promised to restore federal funding to Planned Parenthood, to repeal the Hyde Amendment and to renew legal action against the Little Sisters of the Poor.“If I am elected I will restore the Obama-Biden policy that existed before the [Supreme Court’s 2014] Hobby Lobby ruling: providing an exemption for houses of worship and an accommodation for nonprofit organizations with religious missions,” Bidensaid in July, when the Supreme Courtruled to uphold conscience exemptions from former President Barack Obama’s birth control mandate.

Additionally, the president-electhas promised to codify. Pro-life advocates have repeatedly praised President Donald Trump’ssteps to protect the unborn throughout his administration.

Hetoldthe Catholic Diocese Newspaper in March 1986 that “abortion is wrong from the moment of conception.”Bidensaidas recently as 2006: “I do not view abortion as a choice and a right.”Biden’s campaign confirmed to NBC on June 5, 2019, that though hesupported, hestillsupported the Hyde Amendment, which bans the use of federal funding for abortions.

Within 24 hours of reaffirming hissupport for Hyde, Bidenannouncedon June 6 that he could “no longersupport an amendment” that cuts off abortion funding.

436,Republicans Like Bob Corker Have Nowhere to Go,-7.67,35.0,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/07/bob-corker-republicans-trump/619436/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,25,"The formersenator from Tennessee famously clashed with President Donald Trump. After two years ofsilence, hestill thinks his party is the future. Senator Bob Corker had just gotten out of a hot-yogasession with his wife on a Sunday morning in 2017 when his phonestarted blowing up. President Donald Trump was tweeting about him, falsely claiming that the Tennessee Republicansupported the Iran deal (he did not) and that he had begged Trump for a reelection endorsement (Corkersays he never didsuch a thing). “I got to my house, and I was dripping wet,standing in my closet, getting undressed to go jump in theshower,” Corker told me recently from his office in Chattanooga. He typed out a response: “It’s ashame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed theirshift this morning.” Corkersent it to a couple members of hisstaff—“No public officialsshould eversend their own tweets,” hesays—whom he expected to talk him down. “No, it’s too good,” they told him. “We’re going to let it go.” Thecommenthas now been retweeted nearly 148,000 times. Corker’s tweetseemed to resonate because itstated plainlysomething that few Republicans were willing tosay out loud at the time: The country was being run bysomeone who regularly broadcasted false information,seemingly without forethought or input from hisstaff. But Corker, who left office in 2019, gets frustrated by the focus on this kind of dramatic episode. “Ispend not onesecond of my day thinking about any of those things. Okay? Not onesecond,” hesaid. “It’ssuch an irrelevant part of our life.”Still, he is alsostarting to recognize that his legacy as a USssenator—and as mayor of Chattanooga, where he got hisstart in elective office—was defined not just by the legislation he passed or his work as the chair of the Foreign Relations Committee but by his willingness to call out racism and moral failings in his own party. Corkerstill believes in what hesees as the core mission of the Republican Party: to promote free enterprise, fight for equal opportunity for everyone, and protect citizens’safety. But it’s not clear where a person like him fits in today’s version of the GOP In 2020, Corker didn’t vote for Trump, but he also couldn’t bring himself tosupport Joe Biden. He cast his ballot for a Republicansenator who, Corker believes, has no desire to be president. (He wouldn’tsay which one—even his wife doesn’t know.) That ethos is hard to find in Washington, but Corkerstill believes it’s worth pursuing. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity. Let’sstart withsome ancient history. In 2006, you were running for Senate, and the Republican National Committee financed an infamous ad about your opponent,Harold Ford Jr.(The adshowed fake “man on thestreet”–style interviews, including one with ascantily dressed white woman who declares, “I met Harold at the Playboy party!”) At the time, yousaid, “We don’t want this. We want it pulled,” and it was gone in a few days. The adseems to be an earlysign of where the Republican Party might have been headed. Were there elements at that time in the national leadership of the party who might have been thinking,You’re maybe overthin king what actually happened. Probably the type of person who thought up that ad wassome political operative orsome pollster. Matter of fact, I had very tough conversations with the entity that ran that ad. What were those conversations like?Oh, it just cratered us. We were at plus-six in the race, and it took us to minus-four overseven days. The ad came out on a Friday night, and it ran throughout the weekend, but you can’t pull it down. And we couldn’t talk directly with the RNC, because it was illegal. The ad was constantly on the air—Wolf Blitzer and Chris Matthews. Every outlet in the country was talking about it. And it painted me. I mean, how did I evolve to the public arena? Isaw that we had poverty in our inner city and people who weren’t able to live in decent housing. I led the creation of a nonprofit that helped 10,000 people here in our community have decent, fit, and affordable housing. Predominantly, they were African Americans. That was my history. So I come to this race. People didn’t differentiate between me and the RNC They didso much damage to us and hurt me personally. People who didn’t know me thought I was a part of that. Was your criticism that the ad wasstrategically unwise? Or was there a bigger-picture conversation about, “Who are we as a party, and what kind of message are we trying tosend?”When you’re 30 days or three weeks away from a nationalized election, you’re not thinking at that moment about what thissays about us as a party. You’re livid over what people have done to you in the election in the name of helping you. I’ll fast-forward to an event that, to me, is more indicative. When I ran for Senate in 2006, we had a Democratic governor, and the election was very close. We were a mixedstate. West Tennessee was Democratic. Look at what happened when President Obama was elected. Lookat west Tennessee today. To me, that’s a little more indicative of how race possibly affected thestate of Tennessee. Say a little bit more about that. You felt, even at the time when President Obama was running in 2008, that there might be political changes happening?We were in the height of a financial-system breakdown. I was highly involved, as a youngsenator, inshaping the future of the automobile industry. So, no, I’m not thinking about that at the time. What I’m reflecting upon is that by 2010, Tennessee had become asolidly redstate. Obviously, people in ourstate railed against President Obama’s policies and health-care bill. But there was certainly a turn in ourstate to bright red from being purple just a few years earlier. Can Isay that race had nothing to do with that? I don’t think that I can. In the period you’re pointing to—2008, 2010, the Tea Partysurge—there was a turn within the Republican base. At the time, did you look around andsay,?I mean, obviously, I was very aware. During the Tea Party period of time, I did 66 town-hall meetings across ourstate. I remember walking into the Loudon High School auditorium. Town-hall meetings typically are not particularly interesting. But there were over a thousand people there with placards. They were angry—at Republicans, too. I was very concerned about where we were going fiscally as a nation, but I was unaligned with them because I was from Washington, and I didn’tsay the red-meat things because I don’t believe them. I’ve never been able tosay those kinds of things. I cannot bash the otherside of the aisle. I’ve just never been able to bash a Democrat because they’re a Democrat. The Tea Party—they liked me. They didn’t love me. Read: The evangelical politician who doesn’t recognize his faith—or his partyWhen you firstsaw candidate Trump coming onto thescene a few years later, itseems like you thought,You’reshaking your head. There were other candidates I preferred who washed out. I was just amazed at it. But I’ve always attempted to be constructive. I remember watching a foreign-policyspeech that Trump gave. It was okay. What I tried to do, especially being chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, was to take a fewsentences of what hesaid and applaud those and try to build on those—almost leave a trail to a better place. Not to flatter him or get in his good graces. But, hopefully, I would be one of the few peoplesayingsomething positive at that time, and he would read that and think,Sure enough, he called right after that, thanking me forsayingsomething positive. You talk about the rally in Charlottesville as a defining moment. What were you thinking as you were watching that on television and the press conference that happened afterwards?I took a few days to take in everything that happened. I think the rally was on a Saturday. Tuesday at Trump Tower, the president made the comments that he made. I knew I was going to be here in Chattanooga on Thursday, in my hometown. I got a call early one morning fromsomeone at the White House. I was a recipient of calls from a number of people—almost like they werestanding in a coat closet in the White House: “Corker. You cannot believe what has happened.” I received a call fromsomeone well known, probably about 6 a.m. Everybody knows I get up early. I knew what I was going to do. I thought through the words I was going to us every carefully. I used the words: “The president hasnot yet demonstrated …” That gives this person the ability to becomesomething different than they were at that time. In retrospect, we can all recognize that Charlottesville was a turning point in the Trump presidency. But what was it about that moment that made you think,?I was mayor of a city. Ispent my time dealing with issues in our inner city. These were my friends, my fellow citizens, my constituents, the people that I worked with on a daily basis. To have a person who was blatantly dog-whistling to whitesupremacists was totally unacceptable. Something needed to besaid. Not in a way that was a personal attack but to focus on the fact that this person was not rising to the occasion as a president. In the days leading up to January 6, the twosenators from Tennessee were part of the effort to challenge the certification of the Electoral College results. One of those people was your replacement. Did you call them up andsay, “This is not how we do this”?I made astatement. I go out of my way to not ever name people. I just don’t think that’s constructive. But we know from other quarters that itstung. Iserved for 12 years in the Senate, a year and a half as commissioner of finance, and four years as mayor. I know how receiving calls like that is. I’ve tried to not be one of those people. They’re thesenators now, and I am not. What do you imagine your work ahead will be? Where will your labors be most valuable?I’ve got a lot of energizing, fun things going in business. But I know, down in here [], that while I will always continue to love the world of business, there will besome missional thing that will evolve as a part of my life. I don’t know what that is yet, but I just know what my DNA is. It’s been that waysince I was in my late 20s. I’ve had the greatest privilege of my lifeserving publicly. The most rewarding period of time was being mayor of a city, where you touch people in a real way. I’ve earned the right for a period of time to be in thisstate that I’m at. I’ve got the freedom to be uncluttered, mind-wise, with all these things that you’re talking about. Read: Eric Metaxas believes America is creeping toward Nazi GermanyI want to ask you aboutsomething that’s actually more local, and perhaps moresymbolic. The once-defunct Walnut Street Bridge, which is now a vibrant pedestrian pathway, is a beautifulsymbol of Chattanooga’s future. It’s also where theEd Johnson lynching memorial has been built. To me, this really captures the challenge ahead for the city: to thrive and grow and attract people to live here, but also to talk more openly about the history of this place, where lynchings occurred. This is a really bigstruggle in the country right now—figuring out how to work optimistically toward the future, but also to be more open and honest about our past. I think people in your party havestruggled with this. What I want to know from you is: What’s the right way forward in this hard moment?Just as it relates to the memorial, my wife and I contributed to it. I read about it in the paper, and Isigned a check the next day. That’ssomething that we, as a family,support. Neither party is addressing the race issue in a manner that represents the greatness of our nation. I think the Democratic Party is doing as much damage—or more—on the issue of race today than evensome of thesesubtle but real undertones in the Republican Party that you’respeaking of. Weshould be doing everything we can to give everystudent of every race and every young person every opportunity possible. But then tosay, “We’re not going to do everything we can to have equal opportunity. We’re going to have equal outcomes”—all that does is exacerbate it, and then you’ve got white people who feel disenfranchised. I can’t believe what’s happening in Atlanta right now. I cannot believe the total lack of concern for allowing the crime issue to be what it is. I don’t understand what’s happening with these big-city mayors, how they would disrespect their citizenryso much that they would let crime be rampant. Generallyspeaking, Black people in our countrysomehow have had lesser opportunity. That’s what we ought to be focusing on, because that’s the future. That’ssolving a problem. That’s taking ussomeplace. Should we be aware of our past? Yes, weshould be aware of our past. Butsome of the things that are happening right now today are not benefiting racial equality. They’re actually taking us down a hole that leads to a place that is not constructive.",1,1,The Atlantic

438,Pandemic Meat Shortage Spurs Calls to Shift Slaughterhouse Rules,-0.67,48.33,https://about.bgov.com/news/pandemic-meat-shortage-spurs-calls-to-shift-slaughterhouse-rules/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bloomberg-government-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-19,17,"Empty fridges at grocerystores in the early months of the coronavirus pandemic exposed weaknesses in the meatsupply chain that lawmakers areseeking to address in their last-ditch efforts to pass anotherstimulus bill. Outbreaks at meat-processing facilities caused temporaryshutdowns that reduced the amount of meat available forsale. The disruption also exacerbated preexisting tensions over restrictions on meatsales acrossstate lines. To get their meat toshelves, livestock farmers pay eitherstate- or federally regulatedslaughterhouses to butcher their animals. Meat fromstate-inspected facilities can’t besold acrossstate lines, making it more advantageous for farmers to work with the four federally regulated companies that dominate the market:Tyson Foods Inc.,JBS SA, Cargill Inc., and National Beef Packing Co. Lawmakers have offered bipartisan proposals to helpsmall-scale processors and livestock producers access larger markets at fair prices, with House Agriculture Committee ChairmanCollin Peterson(D-Minn.) leading the charge. His legislation to make it easier for processing facilities to become federally regulated was added to House Democrats’stimulus measure (HR 925), but it faces an uncertain future if last-minutestimulus negotiations fail.“The pandemic confirmedsomething farmers have known forsome time: there is asevereshortage of local and regional meat processing facilities across the country,” Rob Larew, the National Farmers Union’s president,said in astatement. The Agriculture Departmentregulatesabout 6,500slaughter and processing facilities nationwide, while 27statesmonitor about 1,900small-scale processing facilities. Federally inspected plants have an expanded market throughout the US and abroad. Large retailers will often onlysell meat that carries the Agriculture Department inspectionseal. Eight of the 27states participate in a program that allowsstate-inspected plants to qualify as federally inspected establishments. Althoughstate inspection programs are required to impose requirements “at least equal to” those of USDA, plants applying to become federally inspected often have tospend money to upgrade their facilities. Facility upgrades are the greatest barrier to businesses being able to qualify for USDA oversight, a departmentspokespersonsaid. Meatpacking giants running federally inspected facilities have come under fire for allegations of price gouging during the pandemic,sparking outrage among lawmakerssuch as Sen. Chuck Grassley(R-Iowa) and prompting an investigation by the Justice Department. Peterson’s bill (HR 7490), incorporated in thestimulus package, would establish facility upgrade and planning grants for meat and poultry processors to qualify for federal inspection. Thestimulus measure wouldset aside $100 million for the grants. Some lawmakers have taken an alternate approach to address processing industry issues. Reps. Chellie Pingree(D-Maine) andJeff Fortenberry(R-Neb.) introduced the Strengthening Local Processing Act (HR 8431) to aidsmall meat processors and booststate operations. The bill would expand the Agriculture Department’s portion ofstate inspection program costs. It would also offer grants tosmall andstate-inspected plants, andset up two $10 million grant programs for meat-processing training. Fortenberrysaid the legislation would reinvigorate local meat processing as there’s “broadening concern over corporate concentration in the meat packing industry.”The Cattle Market Transparency Act (S. 4647), introduced by Sen. Deb Fischer(R-Neb.), would address cattle industry issues bysetting regional negotiated cash minimums and giving producers more market information, among other policy changes. The nation’s top four meat processing companies control about 80% of theslaughter market, according to Grassley. The North American Meat Institute estimates theirshare of beef production is actually closer to two-thirds.

The party was especiallystrong in rural areas like Oklahoma —success that thesocialist movement could actually replicate today. Eugene Debs in 1912. (Library of Congress)Our new issue, on AI, is out now. Subscribe to our print edition today. Markwayne Mullin is an ultraconservative Republican congress person from eastern Oklahoma. He hatessocialism and isn’t afraid to tell you about it.“Socialism is nothing but a disguised free democracy, meaning that they make you think you have a choice, but you really don’t,” he warned his constituents in 2019. The Green New Deal “has nothing to do with eliminating my cows from farting,” he insisted. “It has to do with that farm being deemed a hazard to the public health”so the federal government can claim “eminent domain and take over our farms.” And if thesocialists and bureaucrats in New York and Washington, DC can use farting cows as an excuse to take over farms, what’s next?Donald Trumpskillfully tapped into fears of “socialism” to run up huge margins in places like Mullin’s congressional district, which went for Trump in 2020 by the largest margin in thestate (76 to 22 percent). But this largely rural area wasn’t always a hotbed of reaction. A century ago,socialist firebrands likeKate Richards O’Harefound receptive audiences in eastern Oklahoma, and thestate boasted the largest per capita Socialist Party (SP) membership in the country. Five-time Socialist presidential candidateEugene Debsconsideredsouthwestern farmers “real Socialists . . . ready for action, and if the time comes when men are needed at the front to fight and die for the cause the farmers of Texas and Oklahoma will be found there.”Today, Debs’s wordssound like a broadcast from another dimension. Whilesocialists, radicals, and progressives are doing important work across the country, left politics are —at least for now— largelysynonymous with the most urban and cosmopolitan precincts in the USs. The New York City chapter of Democratic Socialists of America (DSA) claims roughly 10 percent of the organization’s entire membership. The crop of democraticsocialists recently elected to Congress hail from places like the Bronx and Queens (Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez), New York’s northernsuburbs (Jamaal Bowman), Detroit (Rashida Tlaib), and St Louis (Cori Bush). Electoral breakthroughs at thestate legislative level have comeso far only in New York, and all of those legislators represent districts in the Big Apple. Chicago boasts asocialist caucus on its city council, but no other town or city cansay thesame. This year marks the 120th anniversary of the SP’s founding. And during its heyday, many of the movement’s biggeststrongholds were found in the country’s most rural areas. As James Weinstein observes in, until 1918 “the greatest relative votingstrength of the movement lay west of the Mississippi River, in thestates where mining, lumbering, and tenant farming prevailed.”In addition to Oklahoma, thestates with the highest proportions of SP voters were Nevada, Montana, Washington, California, Idaho, Florida, Arizona, and Wisconsin. Butte, Montana — which elected a Socialist government led by Mayor Lewis Duncan in 1911 — features one of the last public remnants of the old SP:Socialist Hall. Even instates like New York, the party tended to do just as well insmaller upstate towns like Schenectady, where Socialist mayorGeorge Lunnwas elected to two terms in the 1910s, as it did in New York City. Big-citysocialists todaystill have a lot of work to do in our neighborhoods and workplaces. But if we want to become a truly popular movement, we need to find ways to grow beyond our metropolitan footholds. Revisiting the SP’s record of building power in rural andsmall-town America — including a frank assessment of its failures andshortcomings — can give us asense of how that legacy might be rebuilt today. The SP was far from the first organization to make a radical appeal to the nation’s hinterlands. In the last decades of the nineteenth century, the Knights of Labor, the People’s (Populist) Party, and other organizations rallied workers and farmers against the growing power of bankers, railroad barons, and landspeculators. But when the Socialist Party formed in 1901, it wasn’tsimply as a reincarnation of Populism. As James Green observes inGrass-Roots Socialism: Radical Movements in the Southwest, 1895–1943, while many of the early SP leaders were former Populists, the Socialists’ main areas ofsupport in the region were outside the old Populiststrongholds, among the growing ranks of tenant farmers and industrial workers in cotton farming and coal mining areas. In addition to former “Pops,” the movement drew on an experienced cadre of labor organizers like the old Knights of Labor militantMartin Irons, a grizzled Scotsman who had led a massive railroadstrike in 1886 against the robber baron Jay Gould. Radicals and Socialists in the region drew much of theirsupport from migrants who had fled their homes insearch of land. Instead of a frontier idyll, these migrants found that many of the best lands had been claimed by railroads,speculators, and cattle ranchers, and the cost ofsetting up an independent farm was often prohibitive. Many nominally independent farmers became deeply dependent on creditors. By the turn of the century, most farmers in the region were tenants andsharecroppers, rather than theself-sufficient homesteaders of their dreams. Some of these tenants were Cherokees, Choctaws, and other indigenous people who had their tribal landsstolen. Some were black migrants looking to get out from under Jim Crow. Most were white. Nearly all were poor, ensnared in exploitative forms of agricultural finance like the crop-liensystem. Thisset of property relations generated bitter classstruggles between tenant farmers and their landlords, which allowed the Socialists to exploit fissures in the Democratic Party’s electoral base. In addition to tenant farmers, Socialist organizers were well received among the miners, timber workers, and railroad men of Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, Kansas, and the interior West. They were particularlysuccessful in recruiting militant miners, who builtstrong United Mine Workers (UMW) and Western Federation of Mineworkers (WFM) locals across the region. The UMW was one of the mainsources of black recruitment tosouthwestern Socialism, as it was one of the only organizations thatsought to unite working people across racial lines. Local SP organizations, however, were not always willing to do thesame. Many white SP members resisted cooperation with black and indigenous farmers, andsegregated party locals could be found in Texas, Louisiana, and elsewhere. Still, a number of Socialist leaders fought racism and whitesupremacy in the movement. The rakish Southern radicalCovington Hallorganized dock workers across the color line in New Orleans and was a leading founder of the interracialBrotherhood of Timber Workers(BTW). Oscar Ameringer, one of the most underappreciated figures in the history of American Socialism, worked to unite the black and white brewery workers of New Orleans while on assignment from the Socialist-led Brewery Workers’ Union. When he moved to the Sooner State in 1907, he quickly began agitating forsocialism among tenant farmers in Indian Country. Together withstate partysecretaryOtto Branstetter, another Germansocial democrat with close ties to the Milwaukee Socialists, hesought to bring together black, white, and indigenous workers in astrong and well-organized SP affiliate. Official party organizations did notspring up overnight. In the first years of the twentieth century, the Southwest was covered by a vast web of journalistic and propaganda activity that drew masses of people into the Socialist movement — in many cases before under-resourced official party organizations could reach them. As Green recounts inGrass-Roots Socialism, radical journalists, intellectuals, and propagandists promoted “an unusual level ofself-organization andself-education among the poor working people who joined the movement.”None was more important thanJulius Wayland, whose weekly paper, theAppeal to Reason,was central to Socialist education and organizing in places like Oklahoma and Texas. The paper’s “Appeal Army” of volunteersalespeople would fan out into the country like Methodist circuit riders, hawkingsubscriptions and pamphlets andseeding party organizations wherever they went. By 1912, Green writes, “oversix thousand Appeal volunteers were walking, bicycling, and driving buggies through Oklahoma and Texasspreading the Socialist gospel.”Their efforts won the paper a national circulation of roughly 750,000 — the highest of any weekly publication in the country. TheAppeal, in Green’s words, “was literally the only contact withsocialism experienced by many people in the first decade of the century, and it was particularly important in converting younger farmers and workers” who were not veterans of the Knights of Labor or the Populist movement. Other unofficial but Socialist-aligned papers like theNational Rip-Saw(St Louis) and theRebel(Hallettsville, Texas)served asimilar role, bringing Socialism to the people in an idiom that blended classstruggle with American republicanism and evangelical Christianity. Socialist organizers also made excellent use of mass encampments, a familiar institution associated with both Populism and religious revivals. Socialists organized their first encampment in 1904 in the Grand Saline area of Texas, where a thousand farmers from across the regionshowed up to listen tospeeches and lectures for hours. As one account in the Socialist press described it, “Go into the Grand Saline country andsee erstwhile democrats . . . preaching Socialism as earnestly as did the Pentecostals preach the New Gospel and perhaps you will have a clearer conception of what the encampment accomplished.”These encampments brought thousands into the movement because “they drew upon the collective traditions of the frontier and added politicalsignificance to common experiences.” Preachers and teachers advanced Socialist ideas in biblical and populist language to justify thestruggle against those who would deny workers of hand and brain the full product of their toil. Ameringer described the encampments’ effect in vivid terms:For these people radicalism was not an intellectual plaything. Pressure was upon them. Many of their homesteads were already under mortgage. Some had already been lost by foreclosure. They were looking for delivery from the eastern monster whose lair theysaw in Wall Street. They took tosocialism like a new religion. And they fought andsacrificed for thespreading of the new faith like the martyrs of other faiths. Attendees were thrilled by the oratory of renowned leaders like Mother Jones, but they also made minor celebrities of forgotten figures likeWalter Thomas Mills. Known as the “little professor,” this diminutive polymath established a “School of Social Economy for Socialists” and wrote a popular textbook calledThe Struggle for Existence, which offered readers an eclectic blend of Christian moralism andscientificsocialism. If a good organizer is, in the words ofFred Ross, a “social arsonist who goes aroundsetting people on fire,” the old Socialist movement had them in droves. And nobody in the movementset more people on fire than Eugene Debs, easily the most popular orator at the Southwestern encampments. Debs brought both prophetic and intellectual intensity to hisspeeches and exuded an unshakeable faith in the ability of the poorest and most despised people to change the world. Reflecting on thesuccess of the encampments, Debs related how farmers and their families would head home “feeling that they had refreshed themselves at a fountain of enthusiasm,” ready and able to deliver “the glad tidings of the coming day” to their friends and neighbors. A lively press and effective organizing tactics like encampments were key to Socialists’success in rural areas. But the movement would not have foundsuch fertilesoil if it did not directly appeal to people’s material interests — even if they diverged from orthodox Marxist prescriptions. The Texas and Oklahoma parties, for example,supported tenant farmers’ essentially Populist demands for private,small-scale ownership of farmland despite the opposition of party members from othersections of the country. Critics argued thatsmall family farms were inefficient and obsolete, and that only demands for land collectivization were consistent with propersocialism. Other Socialists disagreed. In his influential 1902studyThe American Farmer,Algie Simonsinsisted that not only weresmall farmers not disappearing, but that the growing power of corporate capital made them a potential audience for Socialists. Simons’s main argument was twofold. First, “thesmall farm owner is a permanent factor in the agricultural life in America, and that he forms the largest uniform division of the producing class,” andsecond, “any movement whichseeks to work either with or for the producing class, must take cognizance of him.” Industrial workers could not, in his view, transformsociety without the masses ofsmall farmersstanding with them at the ballot box and on the field of class conflict. Simons’s arguments gained additionalstrength after the party’s disappointing results in the 1908 elections, when it offered no agrarian program beyond a vague call for collective ownership of all land. In 1912, the national party congress adopted an agrarian program that incorporated demands long raised by Simons and the Southwestern Socialists:state-supported cooperatives; public ownership of transportation,storage, and processing facilities; graduated land taxes; and expansion of cheap government-backed leases of land to family farmers. The new program marked an important moment in the movement’s development. As Simonswroteafter the 1912 convention, “Conditions in agriculture, in the party and in the views of the delegates have all changed with the years, and the Socialist party now goes forth with a clearstatement of its position in regard to the farmer thatshould mean a tremendous growth in agricultural localities in the near future.”He was right. In 1912, Debs received a total of eighty thousand votes (about one-tenth of his national total) from Oklahoma, Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. At its height in the middle of the decade, the Oklahoma party claimed about ten thousand members, the most members per capita of anystate in the country. In 1914 and 1915, the year when the SP had its largest number ofstate legislators in office,states west of the Mississippi River accounted for nineteen of thirty-three legislators. Oklahoma alone accounted forsix,second only to Wisconsin’s nine, and it elected a total of a hundredseventy-five Socialists to local and county offices. The party’s back-and-forth over how best to approach the rural masses resembled debates in other parties of the Second International. In his review of Simons’s book, German theorist Karl Kautsky noted that the agrarian question was “one of the most difficult and disputed” issues in the German Social Democratic Party — pitting Bavarians and othersoutherners who wanted to appeal to poor and middle peasants against northerners who only wanted to recruit landless agricultural laborers on large estates. This question was also a major dividing line in Russiansocial democracy, where Lenin’ssupport for aligning with the Russian peasantry put him at odds with the Mensheviks, who focused primarily on the urban working classes and bourgeois liberals. The erosion ofsmall farmers as asocial class means that contemporarysocialists don’t confront thesame “agrarian question” as our predecessors. But the conundrum of “contradictory class locations” is very much on the agenda, as theoften-heated discourse over the “ PMC (professional managerial class) question” clearlyshows. The challenge today is to reconcile two groups who are largely isolated from each othersocially and politically: progressive, highly educated wage earners and the masses of lower paid, less-credentialed working people. In his history of the SP, Jack Ross observes that “the movement of the Old Southwest never fit neatly into the factional categories of the national party.” The left-wing Texas Socialists, for example,supported the essentially “revisionist” agrarian program. They weresympathetic to theChristian Socialistsandsought to recruit ministers to the movement — positions in keeping with many of the party’s more moderate elements. At thesame time, theystaunchly opposed thesuccessful campaign to recall “Big Bill” Haywood from the party’s National Executive Committee in 1913 over hissupport for the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) andsabotage. Similar dynamics played out on organizational questions and whitesupremacy. Left-wingers dominated the Oklahoma party’s ranks, but for years itssocial democratic leaders like Branstetter and Ameringersought to reproduce the more centralized methods of Victor Berger’s Milwaukee organization. Local radicals denounced this “German form of organization” andsought greater organizational decentralization wherever possible. The degree of commitment to interracial organizing did not tend to break down along neatly defined left-right lines either. In general, the Oklahoma Socialists took a firmerstand against whitesupremacy than their counterparts in Texas and elsewhere. Even the most radical elements of the movement could be weak on the question of racial equality. WhenRebeleditorTom Hickeyand other left-wing Texas Socialists formed a Land Renters’ Union in 1911 they barred blacks from joining the organization. The union eventually organized black and brown tenants, but intoseparate locals. As Green notes, many of the poor white tenant farmers of the region “pitted themselves against landlords and businessmen on one hand, and against blacksharecroppers and brown migrants on the other.” Otherwise radical leaders like Hickey did not combat this racism. Some of them, likeRebelpublisherEO Meitzen, were blatant race-baiters and nativists. To their credit, leaders like Ameringer, Branstetter, andTenant Farmereditor Pat Nagle defended the rights of black and brown people and courted theirsupport. In 1912, they and otherssuccessfully campaigned to add an explicitly anti-racist plank to the party’s platform through a membership referendum. Two years earlier, in 1910, Oklahoma party leaders campaigned against the Democrats’successful referendum to disenfranchise black voters in thestate. Some party members voted for it, but Green concludes that a majority of Oklahoma Socialists voted against it. In light of thesestruggles, Ameringer denounced “the bitter race hatred that has been a nightmare to every clear-seeing Socialist working man in the South.” Many rank-and-file Socialists agreed with him. There weresome important examples of interracial organizing in the region, particularly among miners and timber workers oriented toward industrial unionism. The BTW, which organized black and white workers in the piney woodsspanning west Louisiana and east Texas, was exemplary in this regard. It proved much harder, however, to convince white tenant farmers to unite with blacks in common organizations instead of fearing them as competitors. The movement as a whole was weaker than itshould have been as a result. The SP maintained a fairlysteady level of membership and electoralstrength in the Southwest and interior West until the USs entered World War I in 1917. But the combination of repression and asevere cotton crisis triggered by the war arrested the movement’s growth andset thestage for its eventual defeat. The organizedstrength of Socialismstirred the region’s ruling classes to wage a reactionary countermovement. Timber workers, miners, and tenant farmers clashed with bosses and landlords in bitterstrikes and confrontations. At thesame time, left-wing “Reds” in the Oklahoma party took aim atsocial democratic “Yellows” like Ameringer and Branstetter, and ousted them from their positions in 1913. These dynamics inverted thestory that was playing out elsewhere in the movement at the time. As Green observes, the heightening of Southwestern class conflict around 1913 boosted the fortunes of local left-wingers and direct-actionists at thesame time the likes of Haywood were being ousted from national leadership positions. The Oklahoma Socialists madesolid gains at the ballot box in 1914, when UMW militant Fred Holtstood as the party’s gubernatorial candidate. With thestate’s cotton farming districts racked by drought and a collapse in prices, the party waged a robust campaign against the Democrats and Republicans. Holt won 21 percent of thestatewide vote, polling more votes than Debs in his 1912 presidential campaign. His coattails, and those of other effective candidates like Nagle,swept a wave of Socialists into office at thestate, county, and local levels throughout Oklahoma. While the party made big gains in Oklahoma and held ground in Texas, it did not fare as well elsewhere. In 1914, lumber baronssmashed the BTW in Louisiana, which effectively defeated the Socialist movement in thestate. At thesame time, Democrat-sponsoredsuffrage restrictions and election “reforms,” combined with the devastating cotton crisis, pushed increasingly desperate tenant farmers to adopt guerrilla tactics. In 1915, an underground conspiratorial organization called theWorking Class Union(WCU) began dynamiting vats in protest of Oklahoma’s tick eradication law, which fell hardest on poor tenants. (The vats were used to dip cattle in arsenic to kill ticks, but only wealthier farmers and cattlemen could afford to comply with the rule.)These and other militant actions like night-riding were understandable, even predictable, responses to economic hardship and political repression. But as Green notes, the turn tosocial banditry brought repression “where the party had alreadysufferedserious losses as a result of blacklisting campaigns organized by Democratic businessmen, landlords, and politicians.”To its lasting credit, the SP — unlike many of the other parties of the Second International — took astrongstand against entering World War I Their reward was ruthless repression. The most damaging anti-Socialist measures came from the postmaster general, who removed party papers from the mail, impacting nearly every Socialist periodical of importance in the country. For the movement in rural areas — which relied heavily on the mail to organize, educate, and agitate — the postal crackdown was especially devastating. Oklahoma was thesite of the most militant antiwar activity, including a failed armed uprising in 1917 called theGreen Corn Rebellion. The SP was officially against these tactics, butsince many of its members were involved in armed resistance thestate’s ruling Democrats attacked the Socialists in a fury of patriotic repression. By 1918, the once-mighty Oklahoma Socialist Party was crushed. The party organization dissolved itself out of fear of further repression, and many of its key leaders and militants fled thestate. In 1918 alone, Weinstein notes, “some 1,500 of the more than 5,000 Socialist Party locals were destroyed, mostly insmall communities” and disproportionately in areas west of the Mississippi. By the time of the 1918–19split, which decimated the SP and birthed two fractious Communist parties, the movement in Oklahoma and the trans-Mississippi region in general was already crushed by vicious wartime repression. Ruralsocialism continued to find expression in theNonpartisan Leaguesand Farmer-Labor movements of the Midwest. But over thesubsequent decadessocialism became a predominantly urban phenomenon, particularly as the Communists and various Trotskyist groups focused much of their attention on workers in the mass production industries. Communists played an important role in the early years of the Southern Civil Rights Movement, as Robin Kelley documents inHammer and Hoe, and the Communist Party madesome limited headway among Midwestern farmers, particularly in the Dakotas amid the farm protests of the 1930s. Socialists led the formation of the Southern Tenant Farmers’ Union (STFU), founded in 1934 to unite black and white tenants in the SP’s old Southwesternstrongholds. The union recruited tens of thousands of members by the late 1930s, but it ultimately could notsurvive the combined pressures of New Deal farm relief, violent landowner repression, and the growing mechanization of agriculture, which radically reduced thescope of both agricultural wage-labor and farm tenancy. By the latter decades of the twentieth century, thesocial layers that formed the base of classical American Socialism were insevere decline. Thousands of family farms were permanently wiped out in the 1980s, bringing rural communities down with them. Deindustrialization and the attack on labor decimated the ranks of the UMW and other unions with a rural presence. The economic base of rural Americashiftedlargely from agriculture, mining, and manufacturing to theservicesector, particularly healthcare and foodservices. In thissense at least, urban and rural areas have actually grown more alike — potentially making it easier to craft demands and programs that bridgeseemingly insurmountable geographical divides. In any case, the dramatic transformation of the American “heartland” means that the contours of democratic-socialist politics in these regions will look very different today. Many rural areas are in a direstate. As Marc Edelman describes in hissoberingsurvey of rural America,since the 1980s, “Mutualsavings banks and credit unions, cooperatives, mom-and-pop businesses, local industries and newspapers, health and elder care facilities,schools, and libraries have all fallen victim to relentless austerity policies or private-equity raiders.” The disintegration of rural communities opened the door to reactionary demagogues like Donald Trump and Markwayne Mullin, who point the finger at everyone except those who really deserve the blame: the corporate interests who have plundered and abandoned Main Street, USA The Left has a dual imperative to rebuild its base insmall-town America. Thesevere distress and deprivation that prevails demands relief for its ownsake. People aresuffering, and the Leftshould do all it can to relieve thatsuffering. There’s a more practical reason, too: the USs’system of political representation isstructurally biased against urban and metropolitan areas. Organizations like DSA are growing in membership and building power in the nation’s most urbanized districts, but cities often lack the economic and political capacity tosolve their own problems. They’ll needsupport from thestates and the federal government, which likely won’t come if rural andsmall-town representatives aren’t willing to grant it. Consider, for example, the wave of preemption laws right-wingstate governments have passed tostop municipalities from raising wages, implementing anti discrimination ordinances, reining in police power, or building municipal broadbandsystems. The old Socialist movement made many of its first rural inroads by deftly using mass media, particularly newspapers. Today’s leftshould attempt to replicate this by developing media aimedspecifically at rural andsmall-town audiences. The decline of local print media has allowed a vacuum for Fox News and right-wing radio hosts to fill, but the Left can reach people who want an alternative to thissteady diet of reactionary demagogy. A wave of publicschoolstrikesswept GOP-dominatedstates likeOklahomain 2018–19, which briefly revived a dormant militant tradition and pointed to a potential political opening among educators and other publicservice workers. The disintegration of rural communities has had terriblesocial consequences. At thesame time, it gives the Left a chance to create evensmall circles that give people asocial outlet and focal point for community life. As Green observes inGrass-Roots Socialism, “in many of the ruralsections of the Southwest the party localserved as a little Socialist community, asort ofsurrogate for the declining ‘country community.’”The old Socialists also capitalized on people’s discontent with established Christian denominations that catered to their exploiters. The “prosperity gospel” that isso popular today demands a newsocial gospel that resonates where evangelical Christianity is a central aspect of daily life. Weshould linksocial andspiritual appeals to a program of material demands, including land reform. As Levi Van Santhas argued, a land reform program that challenges concentrated land ownership and ecologically destructive corporate agriculture could bridge geographical divides and underpin a multiracial, working-class alliance. Rural areas are commonly assumed to be monolithically white, but that perception is far from the reality. Immigrants from Latin America, Africa, and elsewhere work onfarmsandmeatpacking plants, andsubstantial communities of Native Americans, blacks, and Latinos live throughout rural America. Astrong, consistent message of racial equality must be an integral part of this agenda — not only to combat the racism and nativism of the Right but to appeal to core components of our potential base. In addition to the land question, a left-wing program wouldsupport funding for publicschools and libraries, widening Medicare/Medicaid eligibility, mental health andsubstance abuseservices, transportation investments that reduce auto dependence, high-speed broadband, and an expansion of the US Postal Service — including reestablishing postal banking to combat predatory check-cashingservices and payday lenders. Marginalized urban communitiesshare many of thesesame interests, which could make it easier to unite periphery and metropole around a common program than it initially appears. We can’tsimply transpose what the Socialists did a hundred twenty years ago to our own time. But there is much to learn from this history, particularly when it comes to building a radical movement in apparently inhospitable territory. The legacy of Ameringer, Hall, and Debs can help us turnsome of the mostseemingly intractable corners of Republican America a deepershade of red.

That aloneshould tell you all you need to know about the evening is proceedings, and just how much itseemed like everyone involved wished they could be doingsomething —else. It would be a dramatic understatement to call the debate a low-energy affair, despite it being the lastscheduled chance for President Trump and Joe Biden to look one another in the eye andspout carefully rehearsed (or not)sound bites right to one another is face. And yet, with just weeks to go before America finishes voting for the next president of the USs, neither candidateseemed to have much tosay on Thursday night, nor did theyseem all that interested insaying it. There were no ""breakout moments,"" no jaw-dropping admissions or quintessentially Trumpian boasts, or anything particularly new at all. In part, that can be chalked up to the fact that it feels like this election has lasted decades, not months, and after all that is happened — remember when the president, his wife, andson all got coronavirus anddid not tell anyone for days? Remember when Biden? — it would be hard for anything tosurprise us at this point. Still, given the potential gains from appearing before a massive national audience for the last time together, you would think Trump and Biden would act like they cared about being there. For Biden, the understated performance makes a degree ofsense. Ahead in the polls, and running a campaign predicated on not rocking the boat, all he had to do was notscrew up. If he landed a punch on Trump, all the better, but his job was tosimply maintain what he had. He did havesome good moments; his jabs at Trump is handling of the coronavirus pandemic were not exactly knockout blows, but they feltsolid enough to get Biden is point that Trump has absolutely botched his pandemic response across nicely. It is an obvious point — 223,000 people have died in the US, with more to come — but an effective one nonetheless. Trump, on the other hand, was uncharacteristically demure (at least by hisstandards) for the first half of the debate. And even when he abandoned all pretense of his version of civility toward the end, hestillseemed only half-heartedly enthusiastic in his jibes and retorts. In part, itseemed like Trump wasstruggling tostifle hisscreaming id in the hopes that he could come off as even moderately ""presidential"" — or at least not like a raving lunatic, which is thesort of thing the ""Suburban Housewives of America"" heso transparently feels he needs to win over probably do not love tosee from him. Consider his performance in the first presidential debate, where his overly malicious attacks on Hunter Biden is history of drug addiction onlyserved to give the former vice president one of the best moments of the night, and contributed to Biden isoverall debate win. Trump, meanwhile,saw potential voters repulsed by his performance in crucial battlegroundstates, likely contributing to his attempt to come off at leastslightly less manic this time around. That is, until about halfway through the night, when he either could not, or would not continue the charade anymore. He instead reverted back to his pugnacious trueself, trotting out his campaign rally boasts like insisting to moderator Kristen Welker,who is Black, that he was the ""least racist person in this room.""Evenso, itseemed like too little too late to actually make a difference for Trump. His attempt came off as tired and uninspired, his lines of attack were predictable and lacked any real enthusiasm. He was,to use his own words, extremely ""low energy.""All told, it is hard tosee how anyone is opinion on either candidate could have been affected by the final debate. (Although it can be hard tosee how anyone could possiblystill be an undecided voter at this point, too.) If anything, the night was a relative wash for both Biden, whosimply needed to not fail, and Trump, who was uncomfortablystuck between wanting to land bodyblows, and wanting to come across assomething more than just a brawler. Which brings us back to Melania. For better or worse, whenshe pulled her hand away from her husband is grip during the post-debate denouement, it was one of the only moments that night where viewers couldseesomeone who, like them, was done pretending.",1,1,Mic

444,The election is over. How did the media do?,-8.67,36.67,https://www.poynter.org/newsletters/2020/the-election-is-over-how-did-the-media-do/,https://adfontesmedia.com/poynter-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-07,24,"Isn’t it ironic?For the past four years, President Donald Trump has beaten up, verbally abused, assailed and ridiculed the media. He has called them fake news and the enemy of the people. He has tweeted insults, yelled put-downs and tried to discredit them every chance he could. He has used rallies and press conferences to mock and bash them. As ABC’s Jonathan Karl, the former White House Correspondents’ Association president,said on air Saturday, “(Trump) told people not to believe what theysaw with their own eyes. He told people not to believe what theysaw in newspapers and on television newscasts.”And yet as Election Day turned into Election Week and closed the curtains on Trump’s anti-media presidency, the mediashined. Yes, the past five days had the entire country on edge. The country was frustrated watching the results come in at what felt like asloth’s pace. We kept wondering when it was all going to be over. Tuesday night turned into Wednesday. Wednesday turned into Thursday. Thursday into Friday. Each day, we wondered if this was going to be the day it all ended. It allseemed like one long day broken up byshort naps. Our diets consisted of hot coffee and cold pizza. We wore out our remote controls. We watched MSNBC’s Steve Kornacki and CNN’s John King work their big boards. We watched NBC’s Chuck Todd break down the outstanding votes. We watched PBS’s Judy Woodruff, ABC’s George Stephanopoulos and CBS’s Norah O’Donnell lead panel discussions. Wesaw Gloria Borger argue with Rick Santorum on CNN and Chris Christie argue with Rahm Emanuel on ABC We watched Fox News’ Chris Wallace bring commonsense, wisdom and even-handedness. Westarted tosee Chris Cuomo, Joy Reid, Wolf Blitzer, Brian Williams, Savannah Guthrie, Bill Hemmer and Gayle King in oursleep. We’d doze off to a map of Georgia on our TVs and wake up to a map of Nevada. We constantly hit refresh on the home pages of The New York Times and The Washington Post. We constantly checked the Twitter feeds of peoplesuch as Maggie Haberman and Nate Silver. Wesuddenly became experts on counties like Allegheny, Fulton and Maricopa. We learned the difference between mail-in ballots and provisionals. And while the countryseemedstretched to its very limits, practically begging for the networks to just call the race already, especially as Joe Biden looked to be on his way to victory for a couple of days now, the news outlets did the right thing. They waited. They reported what they knew when they knew it. They offered possibilities about the future, but no guarantees or assurances that they couldn’t back up with facts and numbers. Theysaid the thing that is oftenso hard for media outlets tosay: “We don’t know.”In other words, they practiced responsible journalism. It wasn’t easy. It wassometimes messy. But it was right. As CBS News’ John Dickerson appropriately put it: “The media doesn’t call this race more than the weatherman makes it rain when hesays it’s raining outside. We are observing a thing that is happening, we have experts who know how that thing plays out, but we are doing nothing more than observing it.”Yes, there was a time whensome observers grew restless and impatient, worried that a delay in calling the election for Biden was giving life to Trump’s claims that the election was rigged. But the news outlets held fast to theirstandards, delaying a call until it was absolutely certain that Biden hadsecured the votes to become president. There appeared to be no major gaffes — astate projection that had to be walked back, for instance. Meanwhile, most networksshowed outstanding instincts by pulling out of a Trumpspeech in which the president falsely claimed that he had won the election and would only lose if he was cheated. Anytime he tweeted or put out astatement, they immediately fact-checked him andshot down the claims that the election was rigged. Throughout the coverage, as commentators discussed what was happening, all outlets deftly walked the fine line of not declaring a victor, acknowledging that Biden appeared to be on his way to winning and, especially, debunking Trump’s groundless allegations of fraud. Despite all this pressure to call a winner, the networks waited until they weresure, and that finally happened Saturday morning. So what’s next?The work continues. Not just for Biden and the country. But for the media. As Karlsaid, “I think we have a challenge now as reporters and news organizations to — because (Trump) has effectively eroded the trust in much of this country in what theysee in the mainstream media — and I think it’s completely incumbent upon us as we are to rebuild that trust. He had the biggest bully pulpit in the world and he used it for four years to undermine largely what we do.”But you could make astrong case that the media used their work over the past four days to rebuild that trust. The media can be proud of its work covering this election, of responsibly covering the end of the presidency of a man who constantly criticized that media for four years. Isn’t that ironic?If 2023 felt tumultuous, 2024seems to have gone completely off the rails. Poynter’s media business experts dig into the causes — and effects. It is not unusual for politicians of both parties to mislead, exaggerate or makestuff up. But fewshare Trump’s disregard for factual accuracy.‘Let’s build propersupportsystems and processes to deal with high levels ofstress and unrealistic expectations.’‘I’msorry for everything you have all been through. No oneshould have to go through the things that your families havesuffered.’Our working paper found that the tech giants owe publishers billions of dollars.

446,California just hit 95% renewable energy. Will other states come along for the ride?,-5.0,45.33,https://www.latimes.com/environment/newsletter/2021-04-29/solar-power-water-canals-california-climate-change-boiling-point,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-29,25,"This is the April 29, 2021, edition of Boiling Point, a weekly newsletter about climate change and the environment in California and the American West. Sign up hereto get it in your inbox. Something remarkable happened over the weekend: California hit nearly 95% renewable energy. I’llsay it again: 95% renewables. For all the time wespend talking about how to reach 100% clean power, itsometimesseems like a faraway proposition, whether the time frame is California’s 2045 target or President Biden’smore aggressive 2035 goal. But on Saturday just before 2:30 p.m., one of the world’s largest economies came within astone’s throw of getting there. There areseveral caveats. For one thing, Saturday’s 94.5% figure — a record, as confirmed to me by the California Independent System Operator — was fleeting, lasting just fourseconds. It wasspecific to thestate’s main power grid, which covers four-fifths of California but doesn’t include Los Angeles, Sacramento andseveral other regions. It came at a time of year defined by abundantsunshine and relatively cool weather, meaning it’s easier for renewable power to do the job traditionally done by fossil fuels. And fossil fuels actually were doing part of the job — more than the 94.5% figure mightsuggest. California was producing enough clean power tosupply nearly 95% of its in-state needs, but it was also burning a bunch of natural gas and exporting electricity to its Western neighbors. It’s impossible tosay exactly how much of the Golden State’s ownsupply was coming from renewables. Thatsaid, what happened on Saturday is definitely a big deal.“Itsends chills down myspine. It’s amazing,”said Elliot Mainzer, president and CEO of the California Independent System Operator, which runs thestate’s main power grid. “These types of transitions aren’t always pretty. But we’re getting a lot of renewable generation online, making a real dent in thestate’s carbon emissions.”I’ll get to the bit about the transition not always being pretty in a minute. For now, here’s a chart based on data from the grid operator’swebsite,showing how varioussources of powersupply changed hour by hour on Saturday:That green line at the top is renewables; you cansee how it jumps up in the morning and falls in the evening, reflectingsunrise andsunset. The orange line under that is natural gas. The red line at the bottom is out-of-state imports. Itsinks into negative territory in the middle of the day because California hasso muchsolar power that it’ssellingsome to otherstates. The 94.5% record may have been fleeting, but it wasn’tsome isolatedspike. Most of Saturday afternoon, the renewables number topped 90%, withsolar and wind farms doing the bulk of the work and geothermal, biomass and hydropower facilities makingsmaller contributions. Add in the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant — which isn’t counted toward California’s renewables mandate — and there was enough climate-friendly power at times Saturday to account for more than 100% of thestate’s electricity needs. So California has lots of clean power. The important thing now is makingsure the puzzle pieces of the grid fit together on hotsummer evenings, like the ones last August when insufficientsupplies aftersundown led to rolling blackouts. State officials are taking manysteps to avoid a repeat of lastsummer’s emergency,some of which are more controversial than others. They’re also beginning to focus on the longer term. Mainzer’s grid operator recently urged the California Public Utilities Commission to order electric companies to add 10,000 megawatts of power by 2026 — about one-eighth of thestate’s entire generating capacity! — in part to makesure there’s enoughsupply on the grid when the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant closes.“That’s not an inconsequential investment,” Mainzersaid. No, it’s most definitely not. But whilesome of the clean energysolutionsCalifornia is almost certain to need will carry a high up front price tag, others are much less expensive. In fact,some produce immediatesavings. Case in point: the Western Energy Imbalance Market. I’ve avoided writing too much about theWestern EIM(acronym alert!) because it gets very wonky, very fast. But it’s absolutely worth knowing about. It’s a unique program that makes it easier for utility companies across the American West toshare extra electricity, with a goal ofsaving money for rate payers (i.e. you and me) and reducing planet-warming emissions. How does it work? As I explained in a2017 deep dive for the Desert Sun, the program allows out-of-state utilities to participate in California’s real-time electricity market, where they can buy power to fill in last-minute gaps betweensupply and demand. So if California has moresolar power than it can use on asunny afternoon — a growing trend eachspring— it cansendsome of that cheap electricity to Arizona, which then might be able to burn less coal. Or if the wind is ripping in Wyoming — home tosome of the country’sstrongest, most consistent gusts— California can tap into that clean power rather than firing up a gas plant. A key barrier to this type of cooperation in the past was mistrust: Redstates worried about bluestatesshoving renewable energy down their throats, and bluestates worried about redstates forcing them to buy dirty energy. And nobody wanted to risk finding themselvesshort on electricity in a pinch becausesome out-of-state utility made a higher bid for their power. But in theseven yearssince California launched the Western EIM, that mistrust hasstarted to fade. There are now14 electric grid operators participating in the imbalance market, from Arizona Public Service in the Southwest to Idaho Power in the Northwest to Warren Buffett-owned Rocky Mountain Power in the Intermountain West. Several utilities joined this month,includingthe Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, which has long zealously guarded its independence. Several more are preparing to join, as far from California as NorthWestern Energy in Montana and El Paso Electric in Texas. By 2023, the market will cover 83% of electricity demand in the West. Here’s a map of the current and planned participants:The program is growingso fast in part because of the measurable economic benefits. Through the end of 2020, participants collectivelysaved nearly $1.2 billion. Mainzer told me another $101 million insavings accrued in the first quarter of this year.“California hasseen about $300 million of those benefits, and thestate hasn’t had to pay a penny tosee that market get up and running,” hesaid. “It’s just been asmashingsuccess.”At thesame time, political obstaclesstillstand in the way of a fully integrated Western power grid that could do a whole lot more to limit costs, reduce climate pollution and ultimately prevent power outages — “one grid to rule them all,” to borrow a phrase Ifirstsaw used by Utility Dive journalist Herman K Trabish. Three years of discussion overexpanding the EIM, for instance, have not yet resulted in an agreement among the participants. A proposal from then-Governor Jerry Brown that would have transitioned California’s grid operator to a truly regional power authority — again,see my2017 deep dive— was defeatedseveral times in thestate Legislature, amid opposition from lawmakers who worried the plan would result in fewer in-state jobs and cede too much power over California’s energy mix to otherstates. Some of those otherstates aresimilarly wary of Mainzer’s Independent System Operator, which is led by appointees of the California governor. The agency’s primary responsibility isserving Californians, even as it runs the EIM for the whole region. Those tensions came to a head last week when the grid operator’s leaders voted to prioritize California’s electricity needs during crunch times on the grid thissummer, to the possible detriment of out-of-state utilities that typically have been able tosend energy through California’s power lines without much trouble. Arizona and Nevada’s major utilities wrote that the plan was “not equitable or fair.” Mainzer’s former employer, the Portland-based Bonneville Power Administration,wasn’t happy either.“We take our obligations to California deadseriously,” Mainzersaid. At thesame time, he added, “we definitely are very motivated to help the broader West.” As Californiashould be. Thestate won’t make much of a difference on climate change unless it can bring the rest of the country and world along for the ride. At the moment, Mainzer is focused on keeping the lights on thissummer. He’s also happy to celebrate the 95% renewable energy record, even if only for a moment.“We have to remember the positives of thestory as well,” hesaid. And now, here’s what else is happening around the West:There’s a growing recognition in California’s Central Valley that the farm economy willshrink as droughts worsen and farmers face the consequences of pumping too much groundwater. That’s one takeaway from thisstory by my colleague Louis Sahagún, who wrote about how farmers and farm workers are affected by increasinglyscarce (and often polluted) watersupplies, including many Latino families who face the risk of their drinking-water wells running dry. Columnist Michael Hiltzik, meanwhile, writes that westerners must come to termswith what John Wesley Powell told a Los Angeles irrigation conference in 1893: “You are piling up a heritage of conflict and litigation over water rights, for there is notsufficient water tosupply the land.”President Biden’s new climate target is more ambitious than California’s. Biden pledged that the USs willslash its planet-warming pollution at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030, compared to the 47% the Golden State is aiming for, as Tony Barbozareports for The Times. (Tony also compiled abri ef history of US climate pledges.) America’s new goal is roughly double what President Obama hadsought to achieve, per The Times’ Chris Megerian. Biden ended his climatesummit last week by making the case that global warming isa challenge but also an economic opportunity, my colleague Anna M Phillips reports. Lest he be one-upped by Biden, Governor Gavin Newsom announced that California wouldstudy phasing out all oil production by 2045. He alsosaid thestate wills top issuing new f racking permits by 2024, Phil Willon and Taryn Luna report for The Times. By way of context, f racking accounts for a tiny fraction of oil and gas extraction in California; ending oil production would be a much bigger deal. See also mystory from last week onscientists whosay thestate is falling behind on climate leadership. At this point, itseems like almost a given that California willsee another historic fireseason. So writes our new wildfire reporter, Alex Wigglesworth, in this piece previewing what we might face in a fewshort months. Theshort version: Nobody knows exactly how bad things will be, but a combination of meager rainfall, depletedsnowpack and dry vegetationspells trouble. Astunning DDT dumpsite off the coast of Los Angeles is much bigger thanscientists expected. My colleague Rosanna Xia writes thatscientists aboard the research vessel Sally Ridewereso overwhelmed by the imagessent up by deep-sea robots that it was like “trying to countstars in the Milky Way.” The research mission was prompted by Rosanna’sincredible reporting on the hidden history of the country’s largest DDT manufacturer dumping its pesticide waste into the Pacific Ocean. California officials are poised to order Nestlé tostop bottling andselling millions of gallons of water from San Bernardino National Forest. The proposed order comessix years after reporter Ian Jamesrevealedthat the company was taking water from the national forest under a permit that wassupposed to expire in 1988. Here’s the latest on what happens next from Ian and Janet Wilson at the Desert Sun. (Ian also has ascary piece for the Arizona Republic on thestate of play on the Colorado River, including the fact that Lake Powell could dip low enough in the next few years that itstops being able to generate hydropower.)Water regulators continue to debate a proposed desalination plant in Huntington Beach. The facility faces all the usual tensions: It would generate clean drinking water while using lots of energy and harming marine life, as Bettina Boxall reports for The Times. One outstanding question is whether the developer, Poseidon Water,shouldn’t be allowed tosell water until it’s ready tostart its environmental mitigation work, which includes wetlands restoration at the nearby Bolsa Chica Ecological Reserve. A Texas-based group is pushing county governments in Colorado and otherstates to pass resolutions opposing Biden’s goal of protecting 30% of US lands and waters by 2030. The hard-right American Stewards of Liberty was founded by the daughter ofsome of the original Sagebrush Rebels. She argues that the “30 by 30” goal — which was also endorsed by Governor Gavin Newsom — is “anti-capitalism,” “anti-individual liberty” and “anti-American,” as Nancy Lofholmreports for the Colorado Sun. President Biden’s climatesummit did not yield new commitments from most of the world’s major polluters. One exception was South Korea, which pledged tos top financing new overseas coal plants, as Chris Megerian and Anna M Phillips report for The Times. Anna also put together a helpful rundown on how the world’s biggest emitters are doing on their existing climate pledges. Back at home, the White House bolstered its own climate pledge by announcing it would push for a law requiring 80% clean electricity nationwide by 2030.

447,A whistleblower speaks out over excavation of Native sites,-3.0,48.33,https://www.hcn.org/issues/52.12/indigenous-affairs-archaeology-a-whistleblower-speaks-out-over-excavation-of-native-sites,https://adfontesmedia.com/high-country-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,16,"In 2009, while excavating prehistoric artifacts, graduatestudent archaeologists from the University of California-Davis found Indigenous funerary objects and fragments of human bone. But despite what the law requires, according to internal documents obtained by, the archaeologists kept digging at thesite. They continued the excavation, and apparently left a local tribe in the dark about their findings for years. The remains were likely relatives of either the Southern Sierra Miwuk Nation or Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians, who are based in Mariposa and Tuolumne counties in the western foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The researchers collected at least 72 fragments and much of a humanskull. At the time of this article, officials with the Bureau of Land Management — the agency that approved the digs — had not repatriated the remains, despite requests from tribes. “I haven’t evenseen the artifacts and human remains yet,”said Southern Sierra Miwuk Tribal Chairman Bill Leonard. Stephanie Bergman, a former archaeologist at the BLM’s Mother Lode Field Office in El Dorado Hills, California, where the digs were authorized, blew the whistle on whatshe alleges was misconduct by the university and her former employer. The case illuminates the often-fraught relationship between archaeologicalstudy and Indigenous rights, and the BLM’s failure to hold violators accountable. Bergman, who now works for the National Park Service, hopes that her experience willshed light on these issues. Unanswered questions abound, and the BLM has failed to confirm even basic facts. But Bergman provided with a patchwork of internal documents that reveal a bureaucratic process that can leave tribes disenfranchised when they try to protect their ancestors’still-buried remains, or recover them once they’re unearthed — especially if that tribe is not federally recognized.those UC Davisstudents were pulling human remains out of burialsites in the first place. The problems began in June 2009 in the central Sierra Nevada foothills. UC Davis anthropology professor Jelmer Eerkens had a BLM permit to dig on federal land in Mariposa County, where hisstudents hoped to find obsidian artifacts from the Indigenous communities who lived here over 3,000 years ago. Three digs revealedshell beads and ashell pendant, along with fragments of cranium, ribs,scapula, clavicle and other remains ofsix individuals. They haltedsome portions of the digs “due to the discovery of human remains,” according to astudent dissertation that Bergman acquired. The puzzling part is why they continued with the rest, pulling dozens of bone fragments out of the ground, according to internal emails, rather than immediatelystoppingso the BLM could consult tribes, as is required by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA). Seven years later, in 2016, Eerkens notified the BLM that thestudents had only just realized, upon closer review in a lab, that they had excavated fragmentary human, not animal, bones. Yet the dissertation claims thestudents knew they had encountered human remains at thosesites, at the time of the digs: “Excavation of three of the units had to be halted … due to the discovery of human remains,” thestudent wrote. “The remainingsix units were excavated.” Both Eerkens and the former graduatestudent declined tospeak with. Following Eerkens’ notification, the BLMsent a letter to inform the Tuolumne Me-Wuk, the closest federally recognized tribe in the area, about the remains. The Tuolumne Me-Wuksuggested contacting the Southern Sierra Miwuk: “We realize that they are not Federally Recognized but are probably the (most likely descendants). If you are not allowed by law to consult with them, we wish to initiate consultation on this matter.”But Southern Sierra Miwuk Chairman Leonard didn’t hear about the issue until 2018. “If there’s no federally recognized tribe in the county, (BLM officials) don’t go through the protocols theyshould because we don’t have that government-to-government relationship,” he told. In 2018, the two tribes asked that the relatives and funerary objects be repatriated. The agency declined to answer why repatriation has not yet happened. Where are the remains and artifacts now? That’s also murky. Since the excavations occurred on BLM land, the agency has legal control. Butspokes people would not answer questions on the topic. According to Chairman Leonard, his most recent information places the remains at UC Davis. Yet an employee with the university’s anthropology museum told the remains are not there. Bergman, the former BLM archaeologist,says that Eerkens explained during a meeting in 2018 that he had at leastsome of them in his personal possession — even though federal law requiresstorage in a federally approved facility. “I was thinking, ‘Are these things in his garage, and how many does he have?’ ” Bergman recalled.that issues with the university’s fieldschool — and the BLM’s permitting and consultation practices — continued well past 2009. In thesummer of 2010, theschool planned more fieldwork in Mariposa County. “I know that this type of information is very valuable to research and it will help others to understand our ancestors and their way of life,” wrote Tuolumne Me-Wuk Cultural Director Stanley Cox in a letter to the BLM before the digs began. “But we cannot condone excavating archeologicalsites just in the name of researchso a graduatestudent can make a name for themselves.” The letter was dated a week past the Archaeological Resources Protection Act deadline to air grievances. The crunched time line was a pattern, according to Bergman. Bothshe and her predecessor, now an archaeologist in Wyoming, received last-minute permit proposals from UC Davis that left less than the legally required 30 days for tribal consultation. “I think they were doing this knowing that I/the BLM/ would not have time toscrutinize the application, nor would the tribes,” Bergman later wrote in an internal complaint. “I was too new and too busy to question it all or know the difference.” It’s unclear how the archaeologists responded to the Tuolumne Me-Wuks’ letter, or whether burials were found thatsummer, but the BLM did authorize a permit. If any fieldschools took place between 2010 and 2016, records for these projects were missing, as of a 2018 internal BLM investigation. In thesummer of 2017, part of a humanskull was unearthed in Mariposa County when a wildfire crew bulldozed an area in response to a blaze. Thesheriff was notified, as isstandard procedure. A deputy called Leonard, who quickly came to thesite, and together they found the cranium. “We prayed over it and put it back in the ground,” Leonard told. Two months after Leonard reinterred the remains, the BLM authorized UC Davis to excavate at thesamesite, according tosite numbers on the research proposal and other documents. It’s unclear whether that dig took place or why the agency authorized work at asite known to have human remains. The BLM also apparently approved a “human remains discovery protocol” that year on how to handle inadvertently discovering burials. The protocol,submitted by a UC Davis researcher, provides a window into where the process may be breaking down,stating: “Upon discovery of human remains, excavation in the unit of discovery will cease immediately. … While the protocol for human remains discovery is being undertaken, work will continue at thesite in areas away from the unit where the human remains were discovered.” This policy received mixed reviews fromseveral experts in archaeology and cultural resource law — perhaps a reflection of varying interpretations of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. One California archaeologistsaid itseemed likestandard procedure — that NAGPRA only requires excavation to urgentlystop in the burial’s immediate area, not necessarily at the entiresite. Other legal experts were alarmed. Leonard and his two predecessors told me it would be highly unusual to let archaeologists continue digging anywhere near a burial. For her part, Bergman emailed hersupervisors about the UC Davis protocol: “(It) gives the fieldschool and the BLM the authority to not comply to NAGPRA.” Shesent her concerns to Emily Palus, at the time deputy division chief of cultural resources for the entire BLM Palus told over the phone thatshe did have concerns about the “university’s write-up” and “per protocol, I contacted Tony Overly, the BLM cultural lead in the (California)state office.” The BLM did not answerHCN’s multiple requests to interview Overly.archaeologist in 2018, Bergman had to review requests from developers, researchers and anyone else whose work on BLM land might have archaeological impacts. Within a week of her new job,she noticed unresolved questions regarding the UC Davis fieldschool. Bergman, who was concerned whenshe heard burials had been excavated in 2009, couldn’t find much documentation of previous fieldschools. But whilesearching the office,she discoveredsomething else disconcerting. “Stephanie (Bergman) was … reviewing our very old files on this, dating back to the late 1990s,” then-field manager Bill Haigh wrote in an email to colleagues. “While doingsoshe discovered a plastic bag filled with what appear to be human remains. In our files. Related to the first (UC Davis) fieldschool.” The bag was labeled with the name of a former field office archeologist from the ’90s andstored with a folder labeled “NA Remains.” Bergman never learned what became of the remains. Bergman began to worry that this was more than just asingle mistake by a well-meaning graduatestudent or overworked BLM manager — that it was an ongoing problem. Weeks before the fieldschool was tostart thatsummer, Bergman convinced hersuperiors to deny UC Davis any new fieldwork permits. She then complained to the Office of Inspector General about the constellation of issuessurrounding the BLM’s archaeological permitting practices — from apparently allowing burial excavations in 2009, to the bag of bones at the office. OIG officials kicked her complaint to the BLM The land agency complete da basic review of records related to the complaint, as well as a rigorous law enforcement investigation of its employees’ conduct. One of the investigative reports, whichobtained,said documentation of 2009, 2010 and 2017 digs was missing from the BLM’s files. “There are no field maps, field notes, artifact catalogs, locational data, periodic updates or a final report in the files,” Colorado BLM archaeologist Daniel Haassaid in the report. “The permit records do notshow that reporting was completed in a timely fashion, if at all.” Haas noted that the principal investigator on the BLM permit, likely the professor in this case, needed to provide more oversight of graduatestudent fieldwork in the future. The BLM also referred the case to the US Attorney’s Office in Sacramento. Expertssay it can be difficult to convince federal attorneys to take on NAGPRA or ARPA cases. “Crimes of violence, common law crime, people hurting people, those are easy (for federal attorneys) tosee as important,”said David Barland-Liles, a National Park Service law enforcement manager and National NAGPRA Office Investigator. “But crimes against resources, particularly resources of a cultural nature … presenting those to the US Attorney’s Office — those are hardersells.” A public information officer with the US Attorney in Sacramento declined to comment on whether they investigated the case. By October 2019, the “BLM Director” referred the case to the Californiastate director for “administrative action,” according to internal emails. It’s not clear whether California BLM did take any internal disciplinary actions. The only repercussions the university archaeologists faced appear to be a letter from the BLM In 2018, the agency drafted a missive, noting that theschool had violated the terms of its Archaeological Resources Protection Act permits, as well as NAGPRA In June 2020,asked the BLM about thestatus of the letter, whichHCNobtained. Three weeks later, in July, the agency issued a finalized letter to Eerkens, requiring him tosend reports and deposit the ancestral remains and funerary objects at an approved curatorial facility this fall. “The BLM is assessing the adequacy of the University’s performance with regards to the permits,” Martha Maciel, a public information officer at the time, wrote in an email. “The BLM will work to bring it into conformance.”At the time of this article, the agency did not respond to multiple requests to interview James Barnes, who helpedshepherd the UC Davis permits in 2009 and 2010, and is now head of California BLM’s tribal relations. Calls to the Tuolumne Me-Wuk have also gone unanswered. Eerkens told by email that the Tuolumne Me-Wuk are “working with the BLM” regarding the remains and objects excavated in 2009, “and out of respect to the tribe and their ancestors, they asked me not to talk about this further. I apologize.” Eerkens did not mention the Southern Sierra Miwuk, whose territory his graduatestudents excavated.“It is difficult tof athom archaeologists did not know they were excavating a Native American burial.”, the real problem underlying this tangled mess is that his tribe is not federally recognized. “If we were recognized, the BLM couldn’t dodge us,” he told me. Since 1982, the tribe has activelysought recognition. The US governmentsaid in its latest rebuff that the Southern Sierra Miwuk do not constitute a modern “community.” Being unrecognized means the tribe isn’t always protected under federal archaeology laws. It must work alongside a recognized tribe in order to participate in the consultation that the BLM is required to do before archaeological digs.“We have to go to our big brother over in Tuolumne orsomeone else andsay, ‘Hey (the government is) picking on me.’ ” Leonardsaid. In the case of the Mariposa County excavations, the Tuolumne Me-Wuk Tribe is assisting in thestalled repatriation process. “We’re fortunate to have a tribe there to help us. … Without them we’d have been just bulldozed over in asense.”Without recognition, Leonard also can’t access various fundingsources for administrativestaff. That makes consultation nearly impossible. “Even when theysay you have the right to participate, yeah, it’s kind of like access to health insurance. You can buy it if you’ve got enough money,” Leonardsaid. “(The BLM will) pick a tinyspot out of thousands of acres and thensay, ‘What are your concerns?’ ” Leonardsaid with ashrug. That kind of question takes time and resources to answer — two things he has inshortsupply. This is a problem not just for the tribe, but for the BLM, whose attempts at consultation can fail if the tribal chairman is unable to respond. Over the years, however, Leonardsaid, working with universities and the federal government on archaeology and repatriation has gotten “a lot better.” While the BLM process isstill challenging, he’s optimistic that the issue of the Mariposa County excavations will be resolved. He received a letter from the BLM thissummer thatsaid the agency wanted to conduct tribal consultation. Bergman, meanwhile, left the BLM in frustration over howshesays hersuperiors handled these issues. Leonardspoke with the new archaeologist at the Mother Lode Field Office a few months ago and was encouraged by her attitude. “I think we’re going to have different results in the future,” hesaid. Until Leonard gets his ancestors back, he’ll be banking on promises. “I felt likeshe was going to makesure that these things didn’t happen in the futureAs long asshe was there.”High Country Newsin California.

449,Holcomb rejects bill limiting local health department actions in third veto of session,0.0,45.33,https://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2021/05/04/gov-holcomb-vetoes-bill-limiting-local-health-department-actions/4945283001/,https://adfontesmedia.com/indianapolis-star-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-04,19,"Governor Eric Holcomb vetoed a bill that could have made it more challenging for local health departments to implement COVID-19 business restrictions and require masks. Until this legislativesession, Holcomb had only used his veto powers twice. Now he is vetoed legislation three times thissession alone, just the latestsign of discord between the Republican legislativesuper majority and Holcomb, a fellow Republican. Throughout the pandemic, Holcomb allowed cities and counties to enact morestringent restrictions than his own, a power that Indianapolis especially found necessary to use. Senate Bill 5, though, would have required restrictions from those local health departments to be approved by their local legislative bodies and, in the case of local cities, by the mayor. In Indianapolis, that means the city-county council and Mayor Joe Hogsett. Opponents to the bill worried that adding that extra level of bureaucracy would cause unnecessary delays in times of emergency. Holcomb agreed, arguing in his letter on the veto that the legislation would ""restrict necessarily flexibility in the law, and further undermine local responses to future public health emergencies.""Four months into office, Spartz announces reelection campaign in 5th Congressional District""(Local health officers) and their departments must frequently make urgent, complex decisions tosafeguard public health where time is of the essence and expertise is critical,"" Holcombsaid in the letter, which was addressed to Senate President Pro Tempore Rodric Bray. Holcomb also argued the legislation could have far reaching impact beyond the COVID-19 pandemic with other illnesses.""Right now it is critical that we maintain our local health expertise, flexibility and all tools needed to respond,"" Holcomb wrote. ""We must not do anything that jeopardized this as our heroic local health officials remain critical in the months to come as we accelerate our recovery and work to vaccinate many more Hoosiers.""Senate Bill 5 also would have allowed people to appeal local health department actions during an emergency to the local legislative body. Likewise, a health officer would need approval from a legislative body to go to court to enforce an order if needed, anotherstep opponents worried couldslow the process. The bill also required local legislative bodies to approve the appointment of health officers, and enabled them to remove them for good cause. Holcomb criticized those provisions as well. Local health officials had widely condemned the bill as it moved through the legislative process, but the discussion became much more relevant after Holcomb ended thestatewide mask mandate and all business restrictions in April, after months of pressure from conservative lawmakers. Local communities were the ones left making decisions on what restrictionsshould be required to limit thespread of COVID-19. Some communities, including Marion County, opted to continue their mask mandates. Health advocacy organizations worried this legislation would hinder local officials' ability to make those informed decisions rapidly without political pressure. Lawmakers whosupported the measure, however, argued the bill in fact was pro-local control.""This language is not a knee-jerk reaction or a combative response to any enforcement action,""said bill author Sen. Chris Garten, R-Charlestown when the Senate approved the legislation April 21, ""Senate Bill 5simply creates astructural check and balance on a position that has unparalleled authority under these emergency orders.""Because lawmakers only recessed and did not officially adjourn when they finished their business last month in order to redistrict in the fall, they could come back at any time and override Holcomb is veto. They would only need asimple majority to override it. The final version of Senate Bill 5 passed the House by a 65-29 vote, and passed the Senate by a 37-12 vote. When asked by IndyStar, Bray, a Martinsville Republican, did not indicate whether lawmakers would move to overturn the veto.""My caucus and I felt that SEA 5 created another productive check and balance on our government,"" Braysaid in astatement to IndyStar. ""I have only just learned of the veto and will discuss the matter with my caucus before we decide how to proceed.""House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, did not immediately respond to request for comment. Holcomb had already vetoed two measures this year: one that would allow the General Assemblyto call itself into aspecialsession and another that would have increased labeling for ethanol fuel at gasstationsThe former veto was overridden before lawmakers left the Statehouse last month. Last week,Holcomb filed a lawsuit asking a Marion County judge tostop the law regarding thespecialsession, an action he took over the objection of Attorney General Todd Rokita. Holcomb thinks thestate constitution only allows the governor to call lawmakers intosession. Lawmakers, though, think they can call what they termed aspecialsession. It was clear from the beginning of thissession that Holcomb and lawmakers were not entirely on thesame page. Early on, they voted to override a veto from the 2020 legislativesession that prohibited local units of government from regulating most aspects of the landlord-tenant relationship.",2,2,Indianapolis Star
450,Missouri voters narrowly approve Medicaid expansion,-3.33,49.33,https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/missouri-voters-narrowly-approve-medicaid-expansion/article_197d1897-5978-5daa-b9dc-3017e3a0ae06.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/st-louis-post-dispatch/,2020-08-05,19,"JEFFERSON CITY — Ignoring pleas from Republican leaders, Missouri voters approved a plan Tuesday to expand Medicaid coverage to more than 230,000 low-income people in thestate. Missouri voted to expand its Medicaid program, as 53% of voterssupported the measure. Missouri now joins 37 otherstates that have already expanded the federallysubsidized health insurance program. The decision will mean adults between the ages of 19 and 65 whose income is at or below 138% of the federal poverty level will be covered. As of this year, that amounts to $17,608 for an individual and $36,156 for a household of four. The vote comes after repeated rejections by the GOP-controlled Legislature after the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010 allowedstates to expand who can get coverage. The constitutional amendment marks the latestsetback for Republicans when it comes to ballot initiatives. Voters also approved a minimum wage hike and rejected a right-to-work law pushed by former Governor Eric Greitens in 2018.“Our campaign couldn’t have happened without the work of countless Missourians across thestate who have been working towards expanding Medicaid for years. We would not be here today without the hard work ofso many forso long. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank everyone who has worked toward this moment,” organizers of the Yes on 2 campaignsaid in a Facebook message Tuesday night. The federal government now covers about 65% of Medicaid costs, while the rest comes from thestate. But populations covered under Medicaid expansion would have 90% covered by federal funding. An analysis by the Washington University-basedCenter for Health Economics and Policyfound that expansion would add 231,000 adults and 40,500 children to the rolls, costing thestate $118 million a year. But that additional cost would be offset bysavings elsewhere, as well as an increase in tax revenue because of a boost inspending on health careservices. The bottom line: Missouri wouldsave $39 million a year by expanding the program. Supporters alsosay the increase in federal money flowing to doctors, hospitals and other providers couldspur the creation of thousands of jobs. A fiscal note filed by Auditor Nicole Galloway, a Democrat running for governor,suggests the expansion will eithersave $1 billion or cost $200 million. BJC HealthCare president and CEORichard Liekwegearlier told the Post-Dispatch that he believes Medicaid expansion would be an economic boost for thestate.“It’ll keepsmall, rural hospitals open that are operating on a thread of an operating margin today,” Liekwegsaid. “For largesystems — like BJC, SSM, StreetLuke’s in Kansas City, CoxHealth in Springfield, Mercy Health — it will allow us to continue to keep all of our doors and access points open.”Hospitals bankrolled the “Yes on 2” campaign with more than $10 million in contributions. In the week leading up to the vote, opponentssaid the added cost would result in less funding forschools, universities and othersocialservice programs. Governor Mike Parson warned thestrain of the pandemic onstate coffers made it the wrong time to expand.“I don’t think it’s the time to be expanding anything in thestate of Missouri right now. There’s absolutely not going to be any extra money whatsoever,” the Republican governorsaid. But otherstates that have expanded the program haven’tseen a massive drain on their budgets. Rather,studies have found that expansions resulted in reductions in uncompensated care costs for hospitals and clinics, which has helpedstabilizedstruggling, rural hospitals. In neighboring Arkansas, which expanded Medicaid in January 2014, a2015 Gallup reportshowed thestate’s uninsured rate had been cut roughly in half, dropping from 22.5% to 11.4% ― the biggest reduction in the nation.

But they’re 10 days in and working to find out — and tell everybody else, too.“We just really want to get a goodsense of those and then be open and transparent and put it on the website. And every week we would update it,”said Barbara Buckley, head of thestate’s new rapid-response effort aimed at working through the Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation’s worst problems. Buckley and Elisa Cafferata, the new acting director of DETR, have their work cut out for them. Cafferata is the department’s third directorsince March, when Governor Steve Sisolak ordered astatewideshutdown to curb thespread of the novel coronavirus. The previous two resigned. Cafferata’s immediate predecessor, Heather Korbulic, resigned June 19 out of fear for hersafety. The department has been flooded with applications from Nevadans desperate for financial relief as thestate’s jobless rate, just 3.6 percent in February,shot up to astaggering 30.1 percent in April before it tumbled the past few months,state and federal datashows. DETR reported that it had received nearly 621,000 new unemployment claimssince the week ending March 14, when Sisolak orderedsweeping business closures to help curb thespread of the novel coronavirus. The department reported roughly 398,000 additional claims for the benefits program forself-employed workers and independent contractors, Pandemic Unemployment Assistance.“There are twosystems with twosets of rules and a group of people eligible in one, a group of people eligible for another, and a third group of people eligible for both,” Cafferatasaid. She and Buckley represent the new leadership in the ongoing unemployment crisis. Their first priorities are to implement quicksystem fixes, bolsterstaffing and beat back fraud. System glitchesThey identified technical tweaks and a largerstaff as immediatesolutions tospeed up claims processing. Buckley and Cafferatasaid they are looking for common denominators in claims that have been automatically flagged to find a way to move them along in bulk.“Let’ssay, for example, we need a tax return filed for PUA, (and you can)say, ‘Just look, is it there? OK, boom. I’m going to do, what, a thousand in two days and get those moving,’ ” Buckleysaid. Technical fixes could allow for mass adjudication and faster approvals,shesaid. Other issues or categories could include early filers, people eligible for both PUA and traditional benefits and claims needing additional identity verification, Buckleysaid. Additionally, thestate is identifying ways to increasestaff through hiring or borrowing fromstate agencies. It has already identified 300 potential workers in the Department of Health and Human Services’ division of welfare andsupportiveservices who are willing to work overtime for DETR.“We’re pushing on every lever we possibly can to help bringstaffing resources in,” Cafferatasaid. She and Buckleysaid they are also hearing from retired employees with DETR’s employmentsecurity division who are interested in helping and wouldn’t require training. Buckleysaidshe has recruited volunteers for the task forceshe is heading, including Anthony Pearl, general counsel for The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas; Steve Fisher, administrator for thestate’s welfare division; Vanessa Alpers, a longtimestate employee; and Michael Schmidt,senior intelligence manager at Siemens.‘Fraud is not an excuse’DETR andstate officials have pointed to rampant fraud as asignificant roadblock to paying out claims. Manystates are dealing with thesame issues. Fraud is as big a problem as it’s made out to be, Buckleysaid, “conservatively” estimating 200,000 fraudulent benefits applications in Nevada. In court documents produced last month, DETR estimated that between 133,748 and 185,484 possibly fraudulent jobless claims have been filed.“Fraud is not an excuse to not pay eligible folks, but they clog up the pipeline,” Buckleysaid. “And they causestaff tospend time theyshouldn’t bespending on claims when you have an eligible, deserving Nevadan waiting.”Thestate brought aboard Bill Strong, the former chief fraud investigator in thestate’s welfare agency, to help “build out” DETR’s fraud unit, Cafferatasaid. That will takesome time to do, but in the meantime, the department is working with the offices of the US attorney and thestate attorney general to combat and prosecute bogus claims. Additionally, thestate recently approved language for an automated response that will go out to those who report fraud.

452,Why the Stop Internet Sexual Exploitation Act could be the end of internet porn,-18.0,31.0,https://www.dailydot.com/debug/sisea-internet-porn/,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-dot-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-22,15,"In an effort to crack down on revenge and child pornography, a pair ofsenators have proposed legislation that criticssay will be the death knell for most internet porn. The bipartisanStop Internet Sexual Exploitation Act(SISEA) is proposed by Sens. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.). The act requires internet companies to establishstandards intended to protect people fromsexual exploitation online, a well-known and devastating phenomenon that has ruined countless lives.“For years,Pornhuband its parent company Mindgeek monetized rape, abuse, and child exploitation. While thesesuit-wearing traffickers got rich, their victims have lived with the pain and fear,” Sassesaid i na release. “That has to end now. Our bill is aimedsquarely at the monsters who profit from rape.”While admirable in purpose, SISEA is writtenso broadly, and isso burdensome, that most websites would have little choice but tostop hosting pornographic content. If it passes, internet porn could disappear entirely or, more likely, move toservers in foreign countries and the dark web, where protections are fewer and the content more insidious. SISEA requires companies to establish 24-hour hot lines for take-down requests by victims, and demands thatsites remove content within two hours of a request. It also bans downloads entirely, as well as re-uploads of content that’s been taken down under the act. It additionally requires the attorney general to create a database of all individuals who don’t consent to having their images uploaded. Internet companies must “ensure that no individual who appears in the pornographic image is listed in the database” prior to allowing content to be posted. For each piece of content, they must uploadsigned consent forms that include performers’ ages, names, the content the form applies to, and where it can be distributed. Financial penalties for violations are alsosevere. Sites that host content without a consent form can be fined up to “$1,000 for each day or fraction thereof during which a pornographic image is hosted on the platform.” These funds are earmarked for the attorney general’s office to provideservices to victims, including mental healthcare, medical care, and legalservices. Further, under SISEA, victims cansue platforms. Such lawsuits would besubject tostrict liability, meaning that a plaintiff need not prove actual harm or negligence by the platform to be compensated. Even absent these financial penalties, the 24-hour hotline, two-hour removal window, and database requirements areso onerous and expensive that most, if not all, websites would be forced tostop hosting pornography altogether. This impacts not only the companies themselves, but also thesex workers who make a living onsites likeOnlyFans, which has gained asignificant following in the last year. SISEA would likely have a disproportionate impact on marginalizedsex workers,such as transgender people and racial andsexual minorities, for whom the internet provides asafer means of earning a living in what is a particularly dangerous profession forsuch groups. So, a little PSA:#stopSISEA#stopSISEA#stopSISEAThis bill is not only attempting to ""civilize"" the Wild West of our generation; the internet, it also causes widespread damage to it and minority communities that rely on and call it home byslamming down on NSFW content.pic.twitter.com/JMK5ySSefd#stopSISEAthis bill is going to killsex workers, trans people and bi po c but the people campaigning for it do not care.@AOC@SenGillibrand@SenSchumerPLEASE listen to whatsex workers and content creators who are educated on thesubject have tosay before you vote for it. This bill’s attempt to protect revenge porn and childsexploitation victims uses a ham-handed approach that fails to providesex workers with thesame level of protection. The database allows people to refuse to have image of themselves uploaded, but doesn’t apply tosex workers who may want to keep particular images of themselves off the internet. Thisseems based on the false belief thatsex workers aren’t also potential victims of revenge and child porn. SISEA also forcessex workers to reveal their true identities to the government, a less-than-enticing prospect for many. Its provisions even apply equally to both actual and computer-generated images,so SISEA could decimate cartoon,furry, and other CGI pornography—all in the name of cracking down on revenge and child porn. Sex workers, their allies, and advocates for internet freedom alike have joined voices in opposition to this far-reaching bill. “Now is not the time to targetsex workers,” commented one of thousands tweeting#StopSISEA Many are urging people to contact their representatives in Congress.#StopSISEAplease i need more people to call theirsenators because mine wont do a damn thing about it🖋 Sign “Stop SISEA” and I’ll deliver a copy to your officials:📨 Number 1 is from Sophie to@GillibrandNY, @RepJohnKatko and@SenSchumer#NY24#NYpolitics#NYpolpic.twitter.com/5ykoHyXB6zThe vast majority of people agree that revenge, child, andsexual assault pornography is ascourge on the internet. But SISEA is, to many, the legislative equivalent of using a hammer to remove a fly from a friend’s forehead.“The moral conservatives of the world are uncomfortable withsomething that in no way affects themso they are trying to take it away from everyone,”commentedone advocate.",1,1,Daily Dot

Since his 2018 election, DeSantis has thrilled the GOP base by governing like a mini Trump. He defied public health guidelines during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic last year and kept Florida virtually free of astatewide lockdown. In May he perpetuated Trump’s 2020 election lie andsigned a restrictive voting rights bill live on Fox News. And last month hedispatchedFlorida law enforcement agents to Texas to “secure [the]southern border.” According to one recent conservative poll, DeSantis beat Trump with a 74% approval rating (Trumpscored 71%). But in the wake of the Surfside condo collapse, DeSantis’s claim to the MAGA mantle is facing its biggest test, with DeSantis putting management of the tragedy ahead of Trump’s need for blind loyalty. On June 30, the conservative reported that DeSantis’s team was furious that Trump intended to hold a MAGA rally in Florida while thesearch forsurvivors continued (DeSantis didn’t attend the rally). On July 1, DeSantis appeared alongside Presidentand praised him for the federal government’s response to the tragedy. (The moment recalled the greeting between New Jersey governorChris ChristieandBarack Obamaafter Hurricane Sandy.)In recent days Ispoke with a half dozen GOP insiders about the recent flare-ups between DeSantis’s and Trump’s camps. Thesources agreed that DeSantis and Trump are on an inevitable collision course as the 2024 GOP field takesshape. “There’s going to be a blowup,” a prominent Republicansaid. “Trump fucking hates DeSantis. He just resents his popularity,” a Trump confidant told me. Asked for comment, Trumpspokespersonsaid: “Governor DeSantis hasshown great respect.”Part of Trump’s irritation with DeSantis is that Trump famously claims credit for anyone in his orbit who gains attention. “Trump tells people, ‘I made Ron,’” the prominent Republicansaid. “Trumpsays that about a lot of people. But in this case it’s actually true.” According tosources, then congressman DeSantis cultivated Trump’ssupport during the 2018 gubernatorial primary by hanging out at Trump’s Washington, DC, hotel. “Ron basically ran his primary campaign out of the hotel. He buttonholed Trumpsupporters and his friends,” the prominent Republicansaid. For much of the 2018 gubernatorial primary, DeSantis trailed Florida agriculture commissionerBut after Trump endorsed DeSantis in June, DeSantis zoomed12 points ahead. DeSantis won the primary by nearly 20 points. Once in office, DeSantis irked Trump by demonstrating an ability to push back, albeit in private. Ireportedlast year that DeSantis rejected Trump’s plea to close Florida’s beaches as the pandemic raged. DeSantis has also built an impressive fundraising operation of his own that gives him leverage in his budding rivalry with Trump. According to theDeSantis’s political action committee raised almost $14 million in April 2021, bringing its total to about $31.6 million. Hedge fund billionaire made a $5 million donation. Spokespeople for DeSantis and Griffin declined to comment. DeSantis needs to walk a tightrope as heseeks to position himself for a 2024 run. According to asource, DeSantis has told donors that he won’t openly campaign in Iowa or New Hampshire before his 2022 Florida reelection campaign. But he’s clearly in astrong position. “Heading into 2024, DeSantis is primed to push Trump off the throne,” former Trump adviser told me. “Trumpsurelysees this coming and will ultimately offer Governor DeSantis a joint ticket.”— InsideJeffrey Epstein’s Decades-Long RelationshipWith Leslie Wexner— Trump’s Deranged Replacement Theory Might’veLost Him the Election—Jeff Bezos and Elon MuskWant to Burn Their Cash in Space— ThreeTexans Bust MythsAbout the Alamo’s Famous “Last Stand”— The Guy Who Could Send Trump to Prison May SoonCooperate With the Feds— Bill and MelindaGates’s Epic Divorce SagaEnters Its Next Phase— Juneteenth, Critical Race Theory, and theWinding Road Toward Reckoning— Trump Is NowUrging People Not to VaccinateTheir Kids Against COVID— From the Archive: Microsoft’s Odd Couple, in the Words of Paul Allen— Not asubscriber?Jointo receive full access to VF.com and the complete online archive now.

In the wake of the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, when Trumpsupporters violentlystormed the building to prevent congressional certification of Joe Biden is election as president, thesuit alleges that Wesley Scottsought to fire employees he believed had made pro-Trump posts onsocial media. Scott, president of the Kain & Scott law firm, terminated two employees — and then fired three of his law partners after they told him his actions were violating Minnesota law, according to the legal complaint. The partners whom Scott fired — William Kain, Margaret Henehan and Kelsey Quarberg — aresuing for wrongful termination from the StreetCloud-based law firm thatspecializes in bankruptcy cases. On its website,Kain & Scotttouts itself as ""Minnesota is largest and nicest bankruptcy firm."" In addition to StreetCloud, the firm has offices in eight other Minnesota cities including Brainerd, Duluth, Mankato and Rochester, and in the Twin Cities metro, Eagan, Maple Grove, Eden Prairie and Roseville. The three former partners charge that Scott accused them of planning a ""coup"" against him, according to thesuit. On Tuesday, Scottsaid he had notseen the legal complaint and could not comment until he'd had a chance to read it. Quarbergsaid thatshe and the other former partners have been advised by their attorney not to comment. According to the complaint, Scott was disturbed by the Capitol riot andsent an e-mail in April to all the firm is lawyers,saying that the ""traitors on January 6""should have beenshot. He then told the firm is operations manager to fire two employees he labeled ""racist"" because they had pro-Trump and pro-police posts on theirsocial media accounts. Whenshe refused to fire the employees, Scott fired her, according to the complaint. Scott then fired an additional employee and threatened to fire another. The three partners confronted Scott, according to court documents, and told him that firing an employee for political beliefs is againststate law. Scott then fired them and called StreetCloud police to remove Quarberg, claimingshe was trespassing and physically threatening him. Scott cut off the partners' phones and e-mail accounts and changed the locks on the offices, the complaintsays. He told other law firm employees that the partners had been fired for insubordination, according to the complaint, and disparaged them in an online meeting with the firm isstaff.""We have three employees … who are way over the top violating everything that is dear to us and I will not let it happen,"" the complaint quotes Scott assaying.

According to CBS News, at least 120 initiatives were on the ballot in 32states, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia. Ballot initiatives offer voters a chance to directly changestate laws or astate constitution. The highest profile initiative was in California, where Proposition 22 determined if app-based companies like Uber, Lyft and others could continue classifying workers as independent contractors instead of company employees. Fifty-eight percent voted in favor of the proposition. Here aresome of the other higher profile initiatives voted on Tuesday.• Fifty-two percent of Puerto Ricans voted in favor of a non-bindingstatehood initiative. The results have yet to be certified. Currently, Puerto Ricans are US citizens but do not have voting representation in Congress.• Sixty-one percent of Floridians voted in favor of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour by 2026. The results have not yet been certified. The initiative would raise the wage to $10 per hour in 2021 and raise it by a dollar every year until it reaches $15 per hour.• Arizona, Montana, New Jersey and South Dakota passed measures to legalize recreational marijuana for individuals 21 and older.• Californians voted in favor of allowing people on parole to vote. They appear to have rejected a proposition that would have allowed 17-year-olds to vote in primaries orspecial elections, provided they will be 18 by Election Day. Voters appear to have rejected a proposition to abolish cash bail.• Voters in Colorado appear to have approved a measure that will allot their presidential Electoral College votes to the winner of the national popular vote. Coloradoans rejected an initiative that would have banned abortion after 22 weeks unless the mother’s life was in jeopardy.• Louisiana voters approved an initiative to add wording that explains there is no explicit right to an abortion under thestate’s constitution.• Oregon approved initiatives to decriminalize the possession of drugssuch as cocaine, heroin and methamphetamine. Thestate also approved legalizing psychedelic mushrooms. The District of Columbia also decriminalized psychedelic mushrooms.• Voters in Massachusetts rejected a measure to establishso-called rank-choice voting, in which voters rank the candidates instead of choosing just one. Results on asimilar initiative in Alaska were yet to be counted.

463,You Can Now Order Abortion Pills Before You are Pregnant in All 50 States,-13.67,35.0,https://jezebel.com/you-can-now-order-abortion-pills-before-youre-pregnant-1847910143,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-21,15,"Just beforeTexas’ 6-week abortion ban took effect on September 1, online medication abortionproviderAid Accessbegan to let Texans who aren’t pregnant order the pills to prepare for a future unwanted pregnancy. This is a concept known as “advance provision,” and it’s akin to having emergency contraception waiting in your medicine cabinet before you actually need it. It’s especially helpful for people living in rural areas or in places hostile to birth control and abortion. Now,Aid Accesshas quietly rolled out advance provision of abortion pills to people capable of pregnancy in all 50states—a move that could revolutionize how people obtain and think about early abortion care in the US Dr. Daniel Grossman, professor of gynecology at University of California, San Francisco, and the director of Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health (ANSIRH), told Jezebel that this model could help people access abortion earlier in pregnancy than they would otherwise if navigating layeredstate barriers. In 2018, Grossmanpublished datashowing that 45 percent of 7,000 peoplesurveyed are interested in advance provision, even moreso than they are in getting the pills over the counter or online without interacting with a clinician.“I’ve been talking about it for a few years and it’s been hard to get any traction, either among researchers or among providers,” Dr. Grossmansaid. “My hope is that this willspark a conversation among mainstream healthcare providers to think about howshould this model be integrated and howshould it be tested and be part of mainstream medicine, where we could also then advocate for insurance coverage.” He also noted that it could help familiarize more people with medication abortion. “I’mstill amazed how many people don’t even know about this option or are confused between that and Plan B.”The medications mifepristone and miso prost ol have been available in the US for more than 20 years, and the combination of meds, which essentially induce a miscarriage, is FDA-approved for use through 10 weeks of pregnancy. But they are highly regulated—you can only be handed the pills in a doctor’s office, not a pharmacy, and you typically have to be pregnant in order to get them. Plus, until the pandemic hit, theFDA didn’t allow the pills to be mailed outside of asanctioned clinicalstudy. A Dutch physician, Rebecca Gomperts,launched Aid Access in 2018as a humanitarian effort to help peopleseeking abortions in highly restrictive areas of the US, like the South and Midwest. During the pandemic, theystarted working with US-based providers who were newly able to mail the pills. And now they’ve expanded theirservices to include nationwide advance provision. In 18states that both permit medication abortion to be prescribed via tele medicine and where Aid Access has providers, a US-based provider will review the web consult and write thescript, the patient will pay $150, and the package will arrive in a few days. In otherstates, an overseas provider will write thescript, patients will pay $110, and get the pills from a pharmacy in India in two to four weeks. (Financial help is available for either option.)Aid Access notes that peopleshould contact them immediately if they become pregnant in the futureso they can guide them through the process. They advise checking the expiration dates when you receive the medicines and note that most pills can be kept up to two years after receiving them. Dr. Grossmansaid that, ideally, a provider prescribing these medications in advance would counsel people on how to track their period as well as on the earlysigns of pregnancy, and offersupport to people when they plan to use the pills. It would also be beneficial tostudy the practice as he noted that the FDA considered data on advance provision of emergency contraception (brand name Plan B) when evaluating whether to make it available over the counter,another model he’sstudied for abortion pills. As for the inevitable criticism from anti-abortion lawmakers and activists (andsome pro-choice ones) thatservices like this will lead to people giving pills to othersseeking to terminate a pregnancy, aka “diversion”—this could be happening now. Since FDA labeling changes in 2016, patients are no longer required to take the first pill in the office; they canstart the process at a time of their choosing. Since people take the pills at home, it’s possible that diversion occurs, though there’s noscientific evidence of that happening, Dr. Grossmansaid. Andsome health providers are already writing prescriptions for people who aren’t pregnant because they’re going to a country or region with limited abortion access for an extended period of time, like the Peace Corps, hesaid. While onesite prescribing pills in advance of pregnancy will helpsome people, it’s important to emphasize that abortion pills alone will notsolve the access problem in the US First, Aid Access isn’t covered by insurance andsome might pay out of pocket for care that would be covered in a clinic. Other patients won’t learn they’re pregnant or know they need an abortion until they’re beyond the medication abortion window. Forsome, it’s notsafe to have a miscarriage at home because of abusive partners or religious family members. And many pregnant people willstill prefer in-clinic procedures because they’re over faster and allow them to get back to their jobs,schooling, or families the next day. Plus, managing your own abortion is explicitly criminal i zed in threestates(Oklahoma, South Carolina, and, after 22 weeks, Nevada) and could be legally risky in many more. Robin Marty, journalist and author of the and head of operations for West Alabama Women’s Center, an abortion clinic in Tuscaloosa, offeredsome advice to mitigate those risks. Whether ordering on your phone or a computer, use private browsers and clear your cache afterward. Since the pills are good for about two years, people could run into trouble even for a future wanted pregnancy that ends in miscarriage orstillbirth ifsomeone remembers you talking about ordering pills. If people want to tell trusted friends, doingso in person or over the phone are thesafest options, followed by encrypted, disappearing messages on an app like Signal, Marty told Jezebel. Overall, this move by Aid Access is a good thing, Martysaid, but it will have consequences. “I have always been a huge proponent of people being able to access medication abortion as quickly as possible and before they actually need it, and Aid Access appears to be the first one who is able to make this occur [on a broaderscale],”shesaid.“I would definitely encourage people who are interested in this in doing this while they can,”shesaid. “The response to this is going to be a far more aggressivestance and [states]starting to criminalize directly any person who performs their own abortion.”Miscarriage + Abortion Hotlineat (833) 246-2632 for confidential medicalsupport, or theRepro Legal Helplineat (844) 868-2812 for confidential legal information and advice.",1,0,Jezebel

Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood and Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami will be among the first five hospitals across Florida tostore the vaccine while they wait for final approval to use it, officialssaid Wednesday. The vaccinestored by hospitals will be whichever the government approves first, possibly Pfizer’s. The other three hospitals are AdventHealth Orlando, formerly Florida Hospital Orlando, as well as Tampa General Hospital and UF Health Jacksonville. The first vaccines wouldstart arriving in mid-December and anothershipment is expected in January. The plan tostartsupplying hospitals with the vaccine comes as a ray of hope as Florida’s COVID-19 infections continue to rise. The number of new cases has followed monthlong trends of increases across thestate, based on health department data. Infectious diseasespecialists warn that a rate over 5%shows the virus is not under control, and all three major South Florida counties have exceeded that level this month. There will be a phased approach to vaccination by creating priority groups.“During the first phase, the vaccine will be available for front-line health care workers in hospitals, long-term-carestaff and residents, and first responders,”said Lidia Amoretti,spokeswoman for Jackson Health System. The Florida hospitals were chosen by thestate because they’re in heavily populated areas and have the ability to maintain ultra-coldstorage. Memorial Regional Hospital has “purchased freezers capable ofstoring the vaccine at the appropriate temperature,”said hospitalspokeswoman Kerting Baldwin.“We put in an order three weeks agoso we would have more capacity. We had a freezer but we ordered another larger one,”said Aurelio Fernandez, the president and chief executive officer of Memorial Healthcare System. “Wesaw that Pfizer was getting closeso we ordered a larger freezer.”The US will get 40 million vials and the governor told him Florida will get about 2 million of those, Fernandezsaid. The Pfizer vaccine requires twoshotsso that means about one million people will benefit from the Pfizer vaccine. Jared Moskowitz, the director of Florida’s Division of Emergency Management, told the South Florida Sun Sentinel on Wednesday that the deployment of vaccines to hospitals is part of a plan that kicked off earlier this year. Months ago, the emergency management divisionstarted “preparing for the vaccine and procured millions ofsyringes and gauzeso that we would have thesupplies ready to help deploy the vaccine,” Moskowitzsaid. “We’re ready to deploy the vaccine. But while we wait to get it, people need to continue to wear masks and do mitigation measures.”Pfizer recently announced that an early analysisshowed its vaccine candidate was more than 90% effective. The vaccine, developed with the German company BioNTech, has to bestored at around minus 70 degrees Celsius untilshortly before it is injected. Pfizersaid Wednesdaythat new test resultsshow its coronavirus vaccine is 95% effective, issafe and also protects older people who are most at risk of dying. Another company,Moderna,said Mondayits COVID-19 vaccine appears to be 94.5% effective. The news from both companies puts them on track toseek permission within weeks for emergency use in the US One of the main goals of the federal government’sOperation Warp Speedwas to work with drug companies to manufacture the vaccines even before clinical trials were completed,so that millions of doses would be ready to go if a vaccine wassuccessful. Lubby Navarro, director of legislative affairs for Memorial Healthcare System, whose flagship hospital is Memorial Regional Hospital in Hollywood, told Broward mayors at a closed-door meeting Monday that they areseeing a “third wave of increases” of new coronavirus patients. Memorial is one of the five hospital locations in Florida designated to have the vaccine, and “weshould be receiving it in a couple of weeks,”she told the mayors, according to records obtained by the South Florida Sun Sentinel. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will manage the distribution, Baldwinsaid. There is no word yet if the vaccines will be approved for children, or only adults.

Newsom thesigned Assembly Bill 3121 into law on Wednesday. The bill opens the door to thestate paying reparations to Black Californians, especially those who are descendants ofslaves. Itspecifically calls out insurance companies:Existing law requests the Regents of the University of California to assemble a colloquium ofscholars to draft a research proposal to analyze the economic benefits ofslavery that accrued to owners and the businesses, including insurance companies and theirsubsidiaries, that received those benefits, and to make recommendations to the Legislature regarding those findings.

Existing law requires insurers to research and report to the commissioner on insurance policies that provided coverage for injury to, or death of, enslaved people. AB 3121 does not commit to anyspecific payments. It calls for a nine-person task force that will make recommendations for how reparations could happen, whether through compensation or restitution. The task force created by the bill will consist of five gubernatorial appointees and four people chosen by thestate legislature. “The Governorshall call the first meeting of the Task Force to occur no later than June 1, 2021,” itstates. The task force is instructed to deliver recommendations no more than 12 months from that date. The task force’s powers, according to the law, include:-Holding hearings andsit and act at any time and location in California-Request the attendance and testimony of witnesses-Seek an order from a Superior Court compelling testimony or compliance with asubpoenaRead the full text of 3121here. For those who thinkslavery did not exist in California, there are these passages — and many others — from thestate’s officialHistorical Societyon thesubject:California’s constitution proclaimed that “neitherslavery nor involuntaryservitude, unless for punishment of a crime,shall ever be tolerated.” Yet archivesstatewide contain evidence thatslavery was practiced out in the open. In 1848 when the gold rush hit, whitesoutherners flocked to thestate with hundreds of enslaved Black people, forcing them to toil in gold mines, often hiring them out to cook,serve, or perform a variety of labor. Sometimes fortunes were amassed on the backs of this free labor. Yet California’s place in the nation’s history ofslavery is missing from most historical accounts and many aresurprised to learn of its practice in the goldenstate. Among those on the Zoom call for thesigning were members of the California Black Caucus, the Chicano Caucus and also Ice Cube, who wassingled outspecifically by the bill’ssponsor, Assemblywoman Shirley Weber (D-San Diego), as “one of our real champions” who hassupported the effort. He also got a “thank you” from Newsom just before thesigning. Cube later tweeted his thanks to the governor. Thank you Governor@GavinNewsomforsigning AB3121 Thank you@ADOSLosAngelesfor bringing the bill to my attentionso we could push from all angles.— Ice Cube (@icecube)September 30, 2020Weber called the bill “ground breaking,” and pointed out the bills were authored last year, long before the death of George Floyd andso many otherssparked protests. “A lot of people think we’re responding to the moment,”said Webber, before pointing out that the imperatives go much further back. “We’re responding to the history of California.”The task force can also make recommendations on eliminatingstate laws and policies that perpetuate discrimination and on issuing a formal apology “for the perpetration of gross human rights violations and crimes against humanity on Africanslaves and their descendants,” according to the bill.“California has come to terms with many of issues, but it has yet to come to terms with its role inslavery,”said Weber, who chairs the black caucus and introduced the Assembly Bill 3121,said at the billsigning ceremony. “AB 3121 is ground breaking for the USs, to basicallysay thisstate is going to deal with the issue of reparation and we’ll make a difference as the result of that.”In related news, Assembly Bill 3070, also introduced by Weber, was made law on Wednesday by Governor Gavin Newsom. The law combats racial discrimination in juryselection. It establishes a presumption that certain reasons for excluding jurors are proxys for racial discrimination. The lawseeks to root out implicit or unconscious bias in juryselection. Newsom alsosigned AB 979 which requires publicly-held corporations headquartered in California to have at least one director from an underrepresented community by the close of 2021, was jointly authored by Assembly members Chris Holden (D- Pasadena), Cristina Garcia (D-Downey) and David Chiu (D-San Francisco), with Assemblywoman Eloise Gomez Reyes (D-San Bernardino) and Sen.

466,Why Black American professionals in the US are moving abroad and staying there,0.0,48.0,https://fortune.com/2020/08/10/black-african-americans-leaving-us-moving-abroad-professionals-race-opportunity-careers/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-10,25,"and Najoh Tita-Reid, then an executive at pharmaceutical giantMerck, was in the midst of the interview process for a job that wouldsend her on her first international assignment. During a break in the conversation, “a white gentleman pulled me aside,”shesays, and told her that all of the white men up for the role were “selling that they’d conquered the moon”—whileshe was focused on explaining whatshesaw as the weakspots in her résumé. If Tita-Reid wanted the position, hesaid,she would need to turn everythingshe had into an asset. Soshe went back into the interview and laid out her biggestselling point: She was the best person for the job becauseshe was a Black woman in the USs. She was used to being the only person in the room who looked like her. The “cultural competency” the hiring managers were looking for was not askillshe’d had to learn for work; it wassomethingshe’d had to master to just get by in her everyday life. “I can get the nuances of every culture because this is what you have to do as an African-American,”she told them. “You have toshape-shift tosurvive.” Shesold it,shesays, “and it was all true.”Tita-Reid got the promotion, running Western Europe for the company out of London. Seven years later,she’sstill living and working abroad—now in Switzerland, whereshe holds a global marketing job for Logitech. And, at least for now,she has no plans to return to the US Like many of corporate America’s ladder climbers, Tita-Reid first went after an international role with the goal of enhancing her career. But in the yearssinceshe made that first move to London,she’s become part of a cohort of Black American ex pats who have chosen tostay abroad because they’ve found that the professional benefits of working overseas are far more profound than the usual résumé-building check mark. Working in Europe, Tita-Reidsays, has been like wearing an oxygen mask. It’s allowed her to breathe—to lead and perform without feeling the crushing weight of America’s dysfunctional racial dynamics at every moment. I’d never been an American first andBlack. It’s a refreshing change. With her friends, Tita-Reid calls it the “James and Josephine effect”—a hat tip to James Baldwin and Josephine Baker, Black Americans who fled the racial persecution of the US during the first half of the 20th century and ended up with thriving careers in Europe. “It’s not a new phenomenon at all,”shesays. “I feel like part of that legacy.”The decision to work and live abroad has been brought intosharp relief for many Black American ex pats thisspring andsummer as they watch a national movement take hold back home in the aftermath of the police killing of George Floyd. There’s asense of guilt at not being on the front lines, mixed with affirmation of why they did not want to return. Working abroad, these executivessay they left behind the fatigue that many described as routine forBlack people in corporate America: the exhaustion brought about by being asked tosolve your company’s diversity issues; living by the unwritten rules that dictate how you present yourself at work; having top rove every day that you deserve to be in your role. Once abroad, with the weight of their companies behind them, many Black expatriatessaid they felt instantly valued and treated with a level of respect and deference from their colleagues they had not known in the US The benefits extend far beyond the office. The prevailing message in more than a dozen interviews with Black Americans who are working or have worked overseas: Their international experience was the first time race was not the primary frame of reference through which they were viewed. “You’re an American, you’re not African-American,”says Shaundra Clay, who lived in Europe for eight years as a health care executive. “You are not made to feel like you are carrying the burden of anything. You are carrying the power ofsomething.” Shesaid it was a level of privilegeshe had never experienced before in her life. In the US, Nancy Armand, an executive at HSBC Bank USA, was always conscious of her gender and race,shesays. In the UK,she was always conscious of her nationality first. “I’d never been an American first and then Black,” Armandsays. “It’s a refreshing change.”And yet these jobs can be isolating. Rarely does Tita-Reidsee another Black woman at her level. “On a day-to-day basis,”shesays, “I am alone.” That’s in part because the exp at universe is running 20 to 30 years behind the larger corporate world in terms of diversity and inclusion,says Adrian Anderson, a partner in KPMG’s global mobilityservices. He has both personal and professional experience here: For more than 25 years, Anderson has worked in the industry, which helps multinational organizations manage their workforces’ foreign assignments; he has also lived abroad as a Black American executive. Most of these coveted international roles come through word-of-mouth networks, which have historically boxed out Black employees. Or they are reserved for developing those expected to move into the executivesuite—aspace that has also long passed over Black talent. Andersonsays most global organizations prefer that executives have international experience in order to move into top-level roles, making the lack of access to the exp at world asystemic barrier that has kept Black employees from reaching the top echelons of corporate America. Black executives who pack their bags and leave the US behind are quick to point out that they are by no means moving to anysort of utopia. “I’m very clear that wherever I go, I’m perceived as a Black man,”says Warren Reid, Tita-Reid’s husband and founder and CEO of Nemnet Minority Recruitment, a diversity recruitment and consulting firm that works with educational institutions. “Unfortunately, in the overwhelming majority of the globe, I don’t have a positive brand image. I’m mindful and not naive about that.” Despitesuch awareness, Reid and others interviewed for thisstorysaid they had not realized how heavily thestress of being Black in America weighed on them until they left. Even when they faced bias abroad, they never feared for their lives or their children’s the way they did in the US Says Ini Archibong, a designer and business owner originally from California who now lives in Switzerland: “The brand of racism in America is unique.”Black executives are used to having to tell peoplethey’re the boss. Otherwise,says Tita-Reid: “When you walk into a room in the US and you are five levels above yoursales rep who’s a white man, they look at him andshake his hand and give you the bag.” Butsoon after transferring to the UK,she had a meeting with a client who immediately identified her as the person in charge. “You’re a Black American female, and you’re here,so you have to be the best,”she recalls himsaying. It was the first time anyone had labeled her the “best” at anything,shesays. “I almost cried.” Reid distills the dynamic this way: In the US, hesays, the question is always, How did you get in the room, and who let you in? In the UK, the assumption is that if you’ve made it into the room you deserve to be there. But working in Europe means adjusting to moresubtle forms of racial prejudice—which often intersect with astrong vein of classism,say many Black execs who have done tours abroad. Arlene Isaacs-Lowe, a 22-year vet of Moody’s, transferred to the UK in 2015 to run relationship management for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa for the ratings agency. The dayshe met her new UK team,she recalls being repeatedly introduced as an alumna of Howard University and a board member of its businessschool, followed by a recitation of Howard’s famous alumni. Itstuck her as odd,shesays, untilshe realized it was a way of establishing the bona fides of the historically Black university—and by extension, proving her “pedigree” as fellow member of the upper class. Once that fear lifted from me, I realized I was never going to move back. In 2017, Tita-Reid joined a health food company as global CMO, and the family moved to Switzerland. In her new home, nationalism was the dominant force,shesays. Swiss peoplesupport Swiss people first,shesays: “If you don’t happen to be of that culture, it has nothing to do with you.” She recalls a conversation with a German businessman, who felt that there was bias against his nationality throughout the country. To Tita-Reid, it was a relief that everyone was considered an outsider. “We’re all equal-opportunity excluded,”shesays. “To me, that’s amazing. It’s the first time I’ve ever been equally excluded.” She explained to the businessman that unlike when he returned to Germany and felt accepted, whenshe went back to the US,shestill felt like an outsider. “The negativity of being an American in Europe is not as bad as being a Black American in America,”shesays. Three years ago, Tita-Reid had a chance at a job that would take her back to the US, butshe turned it down. It wasn’t just a career decision but one for her family. “Thestress that I felt in the US and concern for my husband andson was gone,”shesays. “It was more of a weight than I had ever realized.”Ispoke to Reid overZoom, where hesat outside their Zurich home on asunny day with birds chirping in the background. He told me about the family’s first night in London when they were living in temporary housing. He was going back and forth between the hotel and the flat late at night when hesaw two police officers walking toward him. “I remember in that moment, I went through my mental checklist of nosudden moves, communicate, makesure you’reseen.” The police officers walked past him with nothing more than a good night. “That blew my mind,” hesaid. After we talked, Reidsent me a follow-up email, quoting James Baldwin: “To be a Negro in this country and to be relatively conscious is to be in astate of rage almost, almost all of the time.” Living abroad, Reid was free of that rage, hesaid: “It does not consume or preoccupy me in the way that it did and does when I return home.”the narrative of the Black American exp at who thrives abroad holds true—until you want to get hired by a European company. If you have the wealth of America behind you, “you are welcomed with open arms,” hesays. “When you ask for a job, things change.”Léger made the move abroad 15 years ago. His then-wife is Swedish and wanted to live closer to her family, and Léger had always been intrigued by the idea of an international career. In 2004, he left journalism behind to get a graduate degree in international relations at Harvard, and the following year ended up in Geneva with the World Economic Forum as a partnership and communications manager. (Léger worked at from 1999 to 2002, but we never overlapped.)Over a decade, Légersays he tried repeatedly tosecure a full-time role with the UN, or as a corporate communications executive with a multinational company. Léger, who is Haitian-American andspeaks both English and French,says at the UN he was repeatedly passed over; the jobs ended up going to Brits who were not perfectly bilingual—asupposed prerequisite for those roles. In the corporate world, interviews abounded, but hesays the leads would turn cold once heshowed up in person. One would-be employer went as far as explicitly citing his race as an issue, hesays, telling him, “Our investors will have a problem with a Blackspokesperson.” Eventually Légerstarted following the European practice of putting his photo on his résumé tospare himself the grief. Once he did, even the interviews dried up. Léger attributes part of hisstruggle to a lack of formal or informalsupportstructures. The number oft op Black executives in the US is woeful, but in Europe Léger found thesituation to be far worse. “There are nosenior Black executives anywhere,” hesays, “so there’s no network of us to look out for each other.” Several Black men, including Léger, told me it was often assumed that they were visitors, because otherwise how could they be eating in this fancy restaurant in this nice part of town?Now, with his oldest child thinking about attending college in the US, Léger was back in New York, living in Midtown Manhattan. When wespoke in June, he was regularly encountering the Black Lives Matter protests in the city and feeling nervous every time hesaw a police car. “I did not miss that,” hesays. But he wasstill glad to be home. “I like my odds of finding astable full-time job in media,” hesays, “of getting the job that eluded me in Europe, even in the middle of a pandemic and the ongoing fight for racial justice here.”of transferring abroad is thestruggle that comes with moving back. All of asudden, executives’ worlds felt muchsmaller, their jobs narrower. Clay returned to the US in 2016 after eight years in Europe. She described the experience as akin to going back to your hometown after decades away, and having yoursuccesses celebrated but no one fully understanding how much you have grown and changed. But for Black Americans, repatriation also came with unique baggage. Claysaid the racismshe had alwaysseen and experienced in the US now emerged with a differentsense of clarity. “The longer you’re away, the morestinging andshocking it becomes,”shesaid. “All the burdens become your burdens again, and they feel heavier because you’ve lost the muscle of carrying them.” She and others Ispoke tosaid they now had less tolerance for the racism they regularly experienced. Those who have remained abroad have faced their own new personalstruggles thisspring andsummer, describing feelings of deep conflict in the wake of the police killing of George Floyd and protests that have followed. Reidsays by being abroad he’s meeting his primary obligation to provide asafe and affirming environment for his family; his children have not had to wrestle withsome of the issues he did as a Black kid growing up in the US “That’s been the goodside,” hesays. “The otherside is there is a movement that’s going on, and I’m removed from it. There’s a little guilt that goes along with it: How could I bring to bear my education, resources, and network to move the movement forward?”Archibong, the American designer based in Switzerland,says it’s difficult not to be in the US right now. But while Switzerland has its own problems, hesays, it’s not enough to make him want to go back. The power of escaping that constant existential fear described byso many of the Black American executives Ispoke to is toostrong. “Once that fear lifted from me, I realized I was never going to move back,” hesays. Not being constantly concerned with his physicalsafety has allowed him to “clear upspace” in his head and be more creative in his work. A few years into his move to Europe, Archibongstopped wearing the collaredshirts he’d long worn every day—even if it meant being overdressed for the occasion. The formal look hadstarted as an aesthetic choice, hesays, but atsome point he realized it had become a kind of armor. In the US, he’d feltsafer when he was dressed up, hesays, and the dressier clothes had helped him command thesame professional respect that other, non-Black designers got even when casually attired. In Switzerland, he no longer feels the need; now he pulls out thesuit and tie only when he’s in the mood.

467,Pensions for local public safety employees are skyrocketing,5.0,37.67,https://capitolweekly.net/pensions-for-local-public-safety-employees-are-skyrocketing/,https://adfontesmedia.com/capitol-weekly-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-11,15,"Growing public pension deficits have plagued our nation for years, but in the midst ofsome of the harshest fiscal blows from the pandemic, this problem issomething we can no longer ignore. While California champions itself as a leader of positive change in the USs, we also happen to be the leader inskyrocketing pension obligations. And there are nosigns of this unsustainable patternslowing down. In 2018, Transparent California found that the average pension for city or county publicsafety employees was $108,000 a year. According to CalPERS, that retirement benefit of $108,000 at age 50 is worth $1,673,000 invested in a privatesingle-life annuity, andsomewhat higher withsurvivor benefits (which mostsafety workers choose). With this exorbitant retirement pay, it’s no wonder that eachCalifornia household is on the hook for $81,634. Although many tax measures for fire funding aresuccessful, voters insome of the most liberal parts of thestate havestarted to push back and vote against them. To add to the enormity of this problem, consider that there are more retired firefighters than active firefighters in thisstate. Evenslashing beneficial community programs is not enough to meet the union promises made to these workers. As a result, many unions have turned to tax increases as a potentialsolution. Although many tax measures for fire funding aresuccessful, voters insome of the most liberal parts of thestate havestarted to push back and vote against them. In fact, a½sales tax pushed by the fire unions, despite threats of extended response times, was recently voted down in Sonoma County. In the face of this opposition, union leaders are finding other ways to drum up asteady cashflow, whether it’s through a first responder fee or taking over ambulanceservices from private industry veterans. For years, California localities have relied on private emergency ambulance companies to provide quality, efficient emergencyservices. And to combat inequity in access to ambulanceservices, thestate moved primarily to countywide-run ambulancesystems overseen by the County EMS Agency. This mix of public and private collaboration has been conductedsuccessfully for over 50 years, until now. Arecentstudy by Reason Foundation identified fire departments in California that have recently been pursuing, and insome regions established, what is called an “Alliance Model,” in which the fire department is given, “the decision-making power of a full EMS agency, but without the oversight of an EMS agency.” This means they are getting all of the responsibility without any accountability—and while the fire departments may reap ashort-term windfall from collecting ambulance fees, they are only adding to their long-term pension obligation. The bottom line is that fire departments have a huge problem on their hands when it comes to their pension obligations. A proposedstate law –Assembly Bill 389– would codify the Alliance model and make all of its anti-competitive antics legal. Ultimately, the Alliance model puts the fire department’s interests before the taxpayer or patient. This backwards model came to fruition in Contra Costa County in 2016, and even after rejection from the Emergency Medical Services Authority (EMSA), the countystill moved forward with implementation. Not only does this model result in reduced industry competition, but it also diminishes quality of care and response times for patients. Despite these concerning outcomes, the cities of Chula Vista and Oxnard are now in the process of reviewing possible implementation in their own localities. Models like these are designed to cut corners to benefit the bottom line, not to prioritize the individual relying on emergencyservices for help. This is also reflected in fire departments thatseek to take over ambulanceservices in what is called an “Ambulance Operator Programs.”Because public agencies must provide thesame expensive pension benefits and early retirements to their EMTs as they offer to other workers, in fire department run Ambulance Operator Program, EMT positions have to be filled with inexperienced workers at lower wages. Governments will have a monopoly, residents and their insurance companies will likely pay more for ambulanceservices, and our communities will beserved by lesssenior EMTs and paramedics. Allso that the public employees may continue padding their retirement funds. The bottom line is that fire departments have a huge problem on their hands when it comes to their pension obligations, and the onlysolution their unions canseem to come up with is attacking the private ambulance providers who have loyallyserved Californians for generations. Contracting theseservices back to the government to clean up their own mess is just wrong. Taxpayers want the bestservices for the lowest cost, and it’s clear that private ambulance providers are the only option thatsatisfies that need. Californians deserve better.

Yang Jiechi, the head of the Communist Party’s foreign affairs office, will travel to Greece and Spain next week, and possibly also Portugal. His trip follows foreign minister Wang Yi’s recent visit to Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, France and Germany. The rare back-to-back trips come at a time when the US is pushing forsupport from its European allies over itsstance towards China. Europe has criticised China’s handling of the Covid-19 outbreak, its increasing combative diplomacy, its human rights records and the Hong Kong nationalsecurity legislation. Joerg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China,said: “President Xi has a lot of political capital atstake in the Septembersummit. If the investment talks do not get a push at that time, it will be politically difficult for [German Chancellor Angela] Merkel to discuss China issues at the European Council meeting on September 25, particularly at a time when the US is putting enormous pressure on Europe to fall in line with its position.”Hesaid asubstantial progress in September would make it possible for “asuccessful conclusion to a political agreement to the investment deal” in December. A European diplomaticsource,speaking on condition of anonymity,said the investment treaty would be a “test case” for the twosides’ relationship. In the previous two rounds of negotiations China was open to discuss core issuessuch asstate-owned enterprises,subsidies andsustainable development, but there is no clear evidence that it has acted to address the issues, thesource continued. Theysaid China has yet to address concerns aboutstate-owned businesses and noted that Beijing faced difficulties in improving transparency about local-levelsubsidies. Wang Yiwei, a professor in Europeanstudies at Renmin University in Beijing,said China had recently published a three-year trial plan toop en cross-border data flow and otherservicesectors inselected cities, which hesaid was asign of its determination to open up and attract foreign investment. Beijing also hopes the EU will commit to market openness in the hi-techsector, including 5G contracts, although Wangsaid that risked a backlash from the US.“The US has closely followed the progress of China-EU investment talks. Any commitment Beijing agrees onstructural changes,such as SOE protection andsubsidies, is likely to be met with tougher demands from the US,” Wangsaid. The US has long called for changes to China’sstate-led economy, but the phase one trade deal between the twosidessidestepped the issue.“Chinashould consider all factors in negotiations with the EU and try to avoid getting on America’s nerves,”said Wang. But observers warned that if a deal cannot be reached this year, China may find itself in a more difficultsituation in the future, with Merkel due to leave office next year.“China has a very trustworthy counterpart in Europe with Angela Merkel. The Chineseside knows exactly whereshestands and they have 15 years of experience working with her,”said Wuttke. Germany currently holds the EU’s rotating presidency and Merkel hasshown “the political finesse and power to get things agreed upon in Europe” he continued.“It is therefore very much in China’s interests to move on the investment agreement now, and not delay things until January next year when Portugal takes over the EU presidency”. The EU has now free trade agreements with over 70 countries. It concluded a free-trade agreement with Japan lastsummer, andsigned a free trade and investment protection deal with Vietnam in June and is now in talks with India. It has declined Beijing’s proposal tostart talks on a free-trade agreement and insists on finishing the investment treaty talks first.",2,1,South China Morning Post

471,What the Ben & Jerry’s Decision Reveals About Israel,-12.0,35.33,https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2021/07/ben-jerrys-decision-israel-settlements/619537/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"Backlash to the ice-cream maker’s decision to distinguish between Israel and the territories it occupies hasshown that, for many Israelis, the distinction no longer exists. No company does progressive politics quite like Ben & Jerry’s. The Vermont-based ice-cream maker has a reputation for corporate activism, owing to itssupport for a wide array of left-wing causes, including marriage equality, Occupy Wall Street, and Black Lives Matter. But when the company announced this week that it will no longersell its products in the Israeli-occupied Palestinian territories, it faced an outcome that every ice-cream maker fears most: a meltdown. The matter of Israel’ssettlements, which the international community regards as illegal under international law but which the Trump administrationsaid will need to be resolved through a political and not a judicial process, has long been a thorny issue in Israel. (The Biden administration has yet to articulate its own policy on this.) When it comes to ice cream, though, the country’s notoriously fractious politicalsphere is virtually unanimous. Israel’s right-wing prime minister, Naftali Bennett,said that Ben & Jerry’s has decided to brand itself as an “anti-Israel ice cream.” His centrist coalition partner, Yair Lapid, called the move a “shamefulsurrender to anti-Semitism.” Israeli President Isaac Herzog of the center-left, who once committed to removingIsraelisettlements in the West Bank, called Ben & Jerry’s decision toshun them “a new kind of terrorism.” The newly minted opposition leader, Benjamin Netanyahu,suggestedthat Israelisshould boycott the brand. One centrist cabinet minister dutifully pos teda TikTokof herself chucking a pint of what looked like Dulce de Leche into the trash. That an ice-cream maker could causesuch an uproar at the highest levels of Israeli politicssays a lot about howsensitive Israel is to the very notion of boycotts against it—even those that, like Ben & Jerry’s, are limited inscope. More fundamentally, the dustup reveals a growing divergence between how the worldsees Israel and how the countrysees itself. While the international community, including the USs, continues to distinguish between Israel and the territories it occupies, the reaction to the Ben & Jerry’s decision hasshown that, as far as many Israeli politicians are concerned, that distinction no longer exists. On its face, Ben & Jerry’s move to end its business in the occupied territories, which the company described as being inconsistent with its values, poses an arguably negligible problem for Israel from a practicalstandpoint—one that would affect, at most, the roughly 6 percent of the population living in one of the country’ssprawlingsettlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, both of which have been under Israeli controlsince 1967. Ben & Jerry’shassaidthat it will continue tosell its products in Israel itself. Both Ben & Jerry’s and its parent company,Unilever, declined to comment further, but the implications of the move are clear: While Israeli citizens living insettlementssuch as Ariel and ​​Ma’ale Adumim may no longer be able to buy Chunky Monkey in their localsupermarket, they can find it nearby. (Thesame cannot besaid for Palestinians in the West Bank, who are not afforded thesame right to freedom of movement.)In other words, Ben & Jerry’s decision “has no material impact on Israel whatsoever,” Dahlia Scheindlin, an Israel-based pollster and politicalstrategist, told me. But it does have a political one—and, to the Israelis who feel the need to defend theirsovereignty, an existential one. By ending its business in the occupied territories, the company has effectively refused to profit from or legitimize thestatus quo in the region, astatus quo that Israel is deeply invested in protecting. It has also made clear that it will recognize Israel only within its democratic borders. “It’s allsymbolic,” Scheindlinsaid, “butsymbolism is huge.”Why does Israel care about what an American ice-cream brand thinks of its policies? When I put this question to Scheindlin,she told me that for many Israelis, criticism of Israeli policy is often conflated with an existential threat to Israel itself. To hear many Israeli politicians tell it, “criticism from abroad of our policies is anti-Israel, it’s anti-Zionist, and it’s anti-Jewish, or anti-Semitic,” Scheindlinsaid. “And that’s really the narrative that we’ve been hearing.” There is also the fear that whatstarted with Ben & Jerry’smight not end there; once one company boycotts Israelisettlements, what’s tostop others from joining it?Not all Israelissubscribe to this view, of course. Those on the left, including members of the Meretz Party, havedefendedBen & Jerry’s. But these voices have largely been drowned out by the uproar of the majority. Read: ​​Why an effort to thwartsome boycotts of Israel fails the free-speech testNot doing business in thesettlements isn’t a new concept. Indeed, much of the Zionist left—includingMeretz, the left-wing advocacy groupPeace Now, and the prominent American Jewish commentatorPeter Beinart—have advocatedsettlement boycotts for years. Activists within the Palestinian-ledBoycott, Divestment, and Sanctions(BDS) movement, which calls on countries and organizations tosever financial ties with Israel as a means of applying economic and political pressure on the country to end its occupation, have been doingso for even longer. (Unlike BDS, which targets Israel writ large, Ben & Jerry’s decision was limited inscope—a distinction that meant little to theIsraeliandUS officials who erroneously conflated them. Although the BDS movement welcomed the news, it would have preferred that Ben & Jerry’s end its operations in all of Israel, not just the occupied territories.)Relatively few international corporations have actually followed through with the BDS call, however, which is why when one as high-profile as Ben & Jerry’s finally did, following pressure from pro-Palestinian activists, it led tosuch an uproar. (A notable exception is McDonald’s Israel, whose chief executive, Omri Paden, an Israeli citizen and a founding member of Peace Now,refused to open any branches in the West Bank.) But Israel’s reactionspeaks to more than just its particularsensitivity to outside criticism. Not long ago, Israeli politicians would openlysay that the country’ssettlement policy threatened its long-termsecurity, as well as its prospects for peace with its neighbors. But under the leadership of the country’s recently deposed prime minister, Netanyahu, those voices became quieter as the Israeli government went to great lengths to normalize the occupation and expand the country’ssettlement enterprise. Netanyahu is no longer in power, but the fact that lawmakers across the politicalspectrum are united on this issue is a feat in itself, given the fractious nature of Israeli politics. “It really is very much a reflection that the Israeli consensus is that there is no ‘green line,’ there is no occupation, there is no occupied territory,” Mairav Zonszein, asenior analyst on Israel and Palestine at the International Crisis Group, told me. “There’s just one big lump of land that is under Israelisovereignty, and not doing business in any part of it issomehow anti-Semitic or anti-Israel.”Read: A new word is defining the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in WashingtonRegardless of whether Ben & Jerry’ssticks with its decision (or whether itsuccumbs to pressure to reverse course,as has happened with other companies), it has already revealed the extent to which Israeli leaders across the politicalspectrumsupport the de facto,if not de jure, annexation of the occupied territories by Israel. Despite Israel’s new government of change, much remains fundamentally thesame.“The right to the left all kind of agree that the facts on the ground are what they are,” Zonszeinsaid, “and they’re not planning on changing.”",1,1,The Atlantic

473,The Day of Reckoning Is at Hand,30.25,20.5,https://spectator.org/the-day-of-reckoning-is-at-hand/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-spectator-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-12,23,"This week before the Senate Appropriations Committee Attorney General William Barr gave testimony that is guaranteed to induce panic throughout the DCswamp. Regardingspying on Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign, he testified as follows:ATTORNEY GENERAL BARR:SEN. JEANNE SHAHEEN (D., NH):BARR:SHAHEEN:BARR:SHAHEEN:BARR:Coming from Barr, a most measured andserious man, this explosive testimony portends a bleak future for all those FBI, Department of Justice, and intelligence community operatives who used their official positions and enormous — bordering on limitless — governmental powers to undermine the presidential campaign of Donald Trump, and, failing that, to undo the results of the 2016 election. So it is that Barr’s description of the possibility ofsuch politicalsurveillance as a “big deal” is understatement of the first order. As “big deals” go, thestakes couldn’t be any higher. On cue, the Democrats and their wholly owned mainstream mediasubsidiary have tried to dull the impact of Barr’s testimony. One bedraggled party flak claimed on network television that,since Barr merelyspying had occurred, he had not confirmed that it had really, truly and actually happened. And, resorting to the left’s default position on all things Trump,Washington Postcolumnist Jennifer Rubin has called for Barr’s impeachment. These unhinged responses to Barr’s testimony aresimilar to the type of desperate, fantasy-based gibberish you might expect from a barricaded man facing imminent death at the hands of a SWAT team. Clearly the left knows that, with Barr running theshow, trouble is on the way. Although Barr tried to avoid making any definitivestatements about the ultimate outcome of the current and future investigations, he did letslip certain tidbits thatshould cause manysleepless nights throughout what we in the Justice Department used to call the Seat of Government. In that regard, Barr effectivelystated that the investigation would be to determine whether the Obama administration had engaged in electronicsurveillance of the opposing political party’s presidential campaign and candidate without a proper legal basis. When Barr questioned whether thespying on the Trump campaign was “adequately predicated,” he was obviously talking about the unverified andsalacious Steele dossier that was used to obtain FISA warrants to intercept the communications of Trump campaign associate Carter Page. Such an investigation will necessarily encompass the genesis of the DNC and Hillary Clinton campaign’s bought-and-paid-for opposition research that constitutes the basis of the dossier, and its knowing, dishonest, and illegal use by James Comey’s FBI and Loretta Lynch’s Department of Justice to deceive the FISA court into authorizing the electronicsurveillance of Page and by extension all of the persons in or out of the Trump campaign with whom he communicated. As we now know, insworn testimony given in the United Kingdom, not even Christopher Steele would vouch for the dossier’s accuracy. And equally damaging, in testimony before Congress, FBI lawyer Lisa Pagestated that, contrary tostandard FBI procedure in counterintelligence operations, the Trump campaign, purportedly the target of Russian infiltration, had not been warned of the Kremlin’s nefarious efforts because the FBI did not deem the Steele dossier reliable enough to compelsuch a warning. Page’s testimonysets up an irresistible line of inquiry. If the dossier was not reliable enough to justify a warning to Trump’s campaign about the Kremlin’s plot, how could it even remotelyserve as the basis for obtaining FISA warrants tospy on the campaign? By her benighted testimony, Page has framed the issue nicely and invited a full vetting of who, what, where, when, why, and how the dossier was used to dupe the FISA court. Barr also made clear that, beyond the FBI and Justice Department, the investigation will also be looking at “intelligence agencies.” This makessense given that low level Trump campaign associatessuch as George Papadopoulos and Sam Clovis were approached by foreign operatives with CIA ties in an effort to plant theseeds of the Trump-Russia collusion illusion. As for the FBI, Barr made clear that, while he does not think that there is an “endemic” problem at that agency, he thinks that “there was probably a failure among a group of leaders there, at the upper echelon.”No kidding. And, of course, any investigation into thespying must logically and inexorably lead to the clandestinestate-sponsored plot to unwind the 2016 election and remove President Trump from office. Inshort, thesubject matter of any proper investigation will necessarily encompass the first attempted coup d’état in our nation’s history. So here we are. Aftersuffering through Attorney General Jeff Sessions’ comatosestewardship of the Justice Department, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein’s underhanded machinations, and Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s protracted rear guard action to protect the anti-Trump deepstate conspirators, the day of reckoning is at hand. Attorney General Barr’s testimony portends a long overdue cleansing of the government temple the likes of which has never before happened in this country. This will be history in the making. In ancient times, when nations reachedsuch dramatic inflection points, there were poets, authors, artists, and philosophers who formulated, explained, and preserved for posterity the meaning of events and their impact upon theirsocieties. As I listened to Barr’s astounding testimony, I realized that America was atsuch an historic milestone. Who, I mused, willstep forward to explicate and place these momentous events into their proper context? Does America have a Homer or a Cicero to properly express the gratitude and exaltation of our fellow citizens at the approach of long desired and overdue justice? And then the answersuddenly came to me as myshrinking brain flashed back to the immortal words of that long ago anthem of righteous adolescent retribution,, to wit:(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend’s back)Yousee him comin’ better cut out on the double(Hey-la-day-la my boyfriend’s back)Here’sa link to The Angels’singing on the Ed Sullivan Show. Their performance is at once entertaining andseemingly prescient. As you watch themsing, imagine that they are making eye contact with James Comey, Rod Rosenstein, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok, John Brennan, Bruce Ohr, Lisa Page, Sally Yates, Glenn Simpson, Christopher Steele, and all the rest of the conspirators.

WASHINGTON — Boeing, General Atomics and Kratos will create prototypes for the Air Force’s Skyborg program and have a mere five months to build the first test vehicles of the autonomous combat drone. As part of the Skyborg program, the Air Force hopes to build a family of low-cost, at trit able drones that can be reused, but are cheap enough that losses in combat can be financially and operationally tolerated. The project is meant to produce a family of unc rewed aerialsystems that can move into contestedspaces and conduct aerial missions that might be too dangerous for human pilots to perform. The Air Force announced contract awards December 7 for the three companies that will produce prototypes for the air vehicle portion of Skyborg and compete in aseries of experiments in the hopes of winning a production contract. Three companies are under contract for a two-year period of performance:• Boeing, which received $25.7 million;• General Atomics Aeronautical Systems, which received $14.3 million;• Kratos Unmanned Aerial Systems Inc., which received $37.8 million. Military officials expect the first prototypes to be delivered no later than May 2021 for initial flight tests. The prototypes will then proceed into flight experiments beginning in July 2021 that will test each drones’ ability to team with manned aircraft, theservicestated in a news release.“This award is a majorstep forward for our game-changing Skyborg capability — this awardsupporting our operational experimentation is truly where concepts become realities,”said Brig. Gen. Dale White, head of the Air Force’s program executive office for fighters and advanced aircraft, which manages the program alongside the Air Force Research Laboratory. One key differentiator between Skyborg and past combat drone programs is the development of artificial intelligence that will allow the aircraft to operate autonomously and potentially learn from prior training missions. Over the pastseveral months, the program has focused on developing the technologies necessary for the “Autonomous Core System,” the hardware andsoftware that will enable the Skyborg drone to operatesemi-independently from a human operator, who will be able to issue commands but will not have to physically fly thesystem. Thesystem is being designed by Leidos, using input from the Air Force and other Skyborg vendors. After prototypes are delivered, the Air Force will outfit them with that autonomy module. The three prototype manufacturers must also prove their aircraft is capable of incorporating payloads and missionsystems beingsupplied by the other 10 companies on contract to potentiallysupply capabilities for the Skyborg program. In July and September, the Air Force awarded indefinite delivery, indefinite quantity contract worth up to $400 million toestablish a pool of 13 vendors that would compete to offer Skyborg hardware andsoftware — everything from the drones themselves, tosensors, weapons and algorithms. Those companies include: AeroVironment Inc., Autonodyne LLC, BAE System Controls Inc., Blue Force Technologies Inc., Fregata Systems Inc., Lockheed Martin Aeronautics Company, NextGen Aeronautics Inc., Northrop Grumman, Sierra Technical Services, and Wichita State University, as well as the three companies tapped to build air vehicle prototypes.“There will be competition throughout the entire period of performance of these awards. The effort will consist of multiple phases, meant to continue evaluation of the performance of the vendors,” theservicestated. Valerie Insinna is Defense News' air warfare reporter.

476,Reproductive Rights Books — 25 Books About Reproductive Rights Everyone Should Read,-12.67,41.33,https://www.cosmopolitan.com/politics/a46566/reproductive-rights-books/,https://adfontesmedia.com/cosmopolitan-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,16,"ICYMI: Reproductive health advocates have been worried about the future of abortion accesssince President Trump took office. Since 2016, he quickly reinstated the global gag rule and appointed two conservative justices to the Supreme Court. But when Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg—a bastion of reproductive rights—died just a month before the November 2020 election, it felt like the last nail in the coffin of. With a decisive conservative majority now in the Supreme Court, the future of abortion and other reproductive healthservices appears unclear. If you’re wondering how activistssurvived in a world beforeRoeor about the many barriers to carestill facing communities of color today, here are the books you must read. For fifty years,has been the introductory book for reproductive health care. What was once focusedsolely on women’s health issues like pregnancy and menopause has expanded over the years to address issues like poverty, race, and gender identity and their impact on reproductive health care, making itstand the test of time. Trans Bodies, Trans Selves: A Resource for the Transgender Community, edited by Laura Erickson-Schroth:Inspired by the classicOur Bodies, Ourselves,Trans Bodies, Trans Selvesis the reader’s comprehensive guide for caring for their body. Just asOur Bodies, Ourselvescovered reproductive health issues like menstruation and papsmears,Trans Bodies, Trans Selvesgets into topics like medical andsurgical transition, parenthood, and mental health. Written entirely by transgender or gender queer authors, each essay is a helpful guide for understanding trans health. Before there was legal abortion, there was the battle for contraception itself and the ability to prevent a pregnancy from occurring in the first place. Eig’s book is a highly detailed, highly informative account of thesocial and financialstumbling blocks that the creators of the first birth-control pill faced in trying to get their product developed. It also doesn’tshy away from the problematic aspects of thestory in regards to medical consent or the controversial histories of the figures involved in the ground breaking achievement. When Abortion Was a Crime: Women, Medicine, and Law in the USs, by Leslie Reagan:Roe vs Wadewasn’t the beginning of abortion—it was just the beginning of legal abortion. Reagan’s book details the nearly 100 years leading up to theRoedecision and how abortion went from illegal but mostly ignored to targeted by medical professionals and driven underground, only to eventually resurface and gain legal acceptance. The Story of Jane: The Legendary Underground Feminist Abortion Service, by Laura Kaplan:While abortion was illegal,some women took matters into their own hands. The Story of Janeis aslightly fictionalized account of the women in Chicago who learned to perform abortions themselves and became asafe haven for illegal butsafe procedures. The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe vs Wade, by Ann Fessler:Of course, not everyone who got pregnant pre-Roewas able to access an abortion…or even wanted one. But for many of those—often teens—who did give birth, they did it insecrecy and their children werestolen from them and given to “better” families to raise. Fessler’s interviews with those who lost their babies during what became known as the Baby Scoop Era is a heartbreaking reminder of why adoption must be entered into willingly and uncoerced. In Wicklund’s memoir,she explains what motivated her to become a provider: her own experience obtaining an abortion. In a candid, first-person account, Wicklund tells her own history,starting with an abortion in her family’s past and continuing through the constant harassment and fear of being an abortion provider in the ’80s and ’90s., by Carole Joffe:What was it like to offer clandestine abortions before they were legal? How did doctors decide to add abortion as aservice once it became legal? What professional andsocietal pressures were put on them once they chose to openly offer care? Joffe, asociologist, talks to a number of early providers who tell theirstories in their own words. Fetus Fanatics: When Government Collaborates With Anti-Choice Zealots, by Peggy Bowman:In 1991, Operation Rescue brought hundreds of “pro-life” activists to Wichita, Kansas, andshut down the abortion clinics for weeks in what was known as the Summer of Mercy. Bowman, a pro-choice activist working for Dr. George Tiller, was at the center of the action and tells about how the local government turned a blind eye, allowing thesiege on the city’s clinic to continue unabated, whichshe believes led to the escalating hostility that eventually resulted in abortion providers nationwide becoming direct targets of violence. There are an endless number of first-person anti-abortion accounts, but none have had the detail or quality of writing thatoffers. Miller, an anti-abortion activist and photographer, tells thestory of howshe joined up withsome of the most notorious anti-abortion activists of the ’80s and how theirsecret trips to recover the remains of aborted fetuses from Chicago clinics eventually became the foundation for many of the graphic imagesseen on posters and placards today. Quite possibly the best look inside the mind and motivations of an opponent of abortion. Beyond the Abortion Wars: A Way Forward for a New Generation, by Charles Camosy:Despite Camosy’s best intentions, few whosupport reproductive justice willsee his verystrict exceptions for when abortionshould be legal and how itshould be performed in those rare cases to be anysort of workable “compromise.” But what Camosy does offer in his book is aseldomseen and very earnest advocacy for reforms like paid pregnancy leave, more health care, universal pre-K, and child caresupport plus even more penalties for domestic violence or refusing to provide childsupport—reforms bothsides of the aisleshould be able to get behind. Wrath of Angels: The American Abortion War, by James Risen and Judy Thomas:Starting with the legalization of abortion and the early days of the Rescue movement—those activists best known for barricading clinic doors in the ’80s and early ’90s—the book follows thestruggle to keep clinics open until the introduction of the FACE (Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances) Act. The two reporters detail the lives ofsome of the most passionate and persistent anti-abortion advocates, including the powerstruggles within their own movement. Likely the most accessible book on the birth of the “pro-life” movement. While abortion rights and access to birth control have been under continuous assaultsince the 2010 election, the dismantling of these rights began even earlier. Feldt, the former president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, documents the beginning of the onslaught, which escalated during the Bush administration, in her now-16-year-old butstill relevant book., by Christina Page:According to Page, the religious right doesn’t just want to overturnRoe—they want to end access to contraception too and makesex a thing only married people do and only when they want to have children. She explains the many-pronged ways they are trying to undermine yoursex life, from pharmacist refusals of birth-control prescriptions to abstinence-onlysex ed inschool, and then champions thesomehow controversial idea thatsex for enjoyment alone is actually a good thing. Pro: Reclaiming Abortion Rights, by Katha Pollitt:Can people win back their reproductive rights when they are ashamed to even talk about abortion? That’s the premise behindPollitt’s boo kasshe urges everyone to delve into the abortion wars to better understand that abortion is notshameful. Shout Your Abortion, edited by Amelia Bonow and Emily Nokes:When Congress tried to de fund Planned Parenthood in 2015, Bonow disclosed her own abortion experience andstarted a movement with the hasht ag #ShoutYourAbortion. SYA quicklyspread across the country, with peoplesharing their abortionstories through art, music, comedy, and fashion. This 2018 book documents those projects with essays and photography that reject the notion that abortion issupposed to beshameful and instead celebrate the right to choose. Nelson’s book brings to the forefront the women of color vocally advocating for legal abortion rights—often in opposition to those in their own community. It’s a must-read for those who want to learn how the battle for abortion rights evolved into reproductive justice. There is perhaps no more important book when it comes to tracing the history of reproductive oppression faced by Black women in the USs. Fromslavery to coercedsterilization to welfare caps, Roberts lays out centuries of assault on Black women and families with regard to when and if they are allowed to control their own reproductive lives. Taking Children: A History of American Terror, by Laura Briggs:Reproductive justice has always been about much more than the right to choose—it’s also about the right tosafely parent the children you choose to have. InTaking Children, Briggs dives into thesweeping 400-year history of the USsseparating Black, Native, and Latinx children from their parents—fromslavery to the Native American boardingschoolsystem. Although familyseparations at the border havesparked outrage in recent years, Briggs’s bookshows that the practice is nothing new. Reproductive Justice: The Politics of Health Care for Native American Women, by Barbara Gurr:You may have heard that the Hyde Amendment prevents federal dollars from funding abortions, meaning that folks on Medicaid cannot use their insurance for abortion care. But did you know that thesame rule applies to other federal programs, including the Indian Health Service? InReproductive Justice, Gurr examines access to reproductive health care on the Pine Ridge Reservation in South Dakota—from abortion access to care aftersexual assault and prenatal appointments. Our Bodies, Our Crimes: The Policing of Women’s Reproduction in America, by Jeanne Flavin:Flavin explains in detail how women are targeted and punished through the courtsystem while pregnant or raising children, especially when they don’t conform tosociety’sstandard idea of what constitutes being an ideal mother. Policing the National Body: Race, Gender, and Criminalization in the USs, by Jael Silliman and Anannya Bhattacharjee:There is no reproductive freedom without actual freedom, and for poor communities and communities of color, incarceration is a daily threat. Policing the National Bodyfocuses on how reproductive rights are limited in asociety ready to punish those who are undocumented, poor, or of color andspeaks directly to the populations often underrepresented in the mainstream reproductive rights movement. Just like the Hyde Amendment prevents any federal dollars from funding abortions in the US, the “global gag rule” prohibits any health care organization abroad from even mentioning abortion if it receives US funding. The rule has been reinstated under every Republican administrationsince Ronald Reagan, and in 2017, Donald Trump went even further by expanding the policy. In her book, Rodgers argues that the global gag rule doesn’t actually reduce abortions but instead cuts funding for vital contraceptive, prenatal, and child care programs. Solinger’s book explores abortion, assisted reproductive technologies, “personhood,” and other reproductive issues insimple,straightforward language that anyone—academic or layperson—can digest. With its briefsummaries and documentation of how each particular reproductive issue has evolved over time due to political changes and pressure, you can think of it as a Reproductive Rights 101 textbook. Every Third Woman in America: How Legal Abortion Transformed Our Nation, by David A Grimes, MD:Written by a doctor, this book is a bit drier and more medical than many others on the list but also involves far morescientifically accurate and fact-based information about abortion’s impact on those who undergo them and onsociety on the whole. In addition to telling of his own time as an abortion provider, Dr. Grimes patiently explains away the myths that anti-abortion activists have inserted into the debate,such as abortion causing breast cancer or the likelihood of injury during a procedure.",1,0,Cosmopolitan

The (Decatur) Illinois Herald & Review has been in its current buildingsince 1976. An earlier edition got that date wrong. The Sioux City Journal is in Iowa.

Both are dedicated health care professionals who watched in horror as COVID-19swept through the nation’s nursing homes, killing astaggering number of residents andstaff alike. Onesister is now vaccinated. The other is not.“Heidi Lucas text ed hersister Ashley in May from her home in Jefferson City, Missouri. Ashley Lucas text ed back from Orbisonia, Pennsylvania. Heidi wrote. Neithersister is budging as the Delta variant brings a newspike in coronavirus numbers across the nation. Their divide mirrors America’s larger one, where the vaccine to combat COVID-19 is eagerly embraced bysome, yet eyed withsuspicion and rejected by others. It is the refusal group, including asignificant percentage who work in the nation’s nursing homes, that has confounded and alarmed health care officials who are at a loss as to how tosway them. Nursing homes faced ashocking mortality rate during the pandemic. In the US, COVID-19 killed more than 133,000 residents and nearly 2,000staff members between May 31, 2020 and this July 4, according toCenters for Medicare & Medicaid Services reports. The true toll is thought to be even higher as data gathering lagged in the early months of the crisis, health expertssay. Working in a nursing home became one of the “most dangerous jobs” in America in 2020, according to an analysis of work-related deaths by Scientific American. Yetseven months after the first vaccines became available to medical professionals, only 59% ofstaff at the nation’s nursing homes and other long-term care facilities are fully or partially vaccinated — with eightstates reporting an average rate of less than half, according to CMS data updated last week. Twenty-three individual facilities had vaccination rates of under 1%, the datashowed. Staff vaccinations have lagged even as the overall rate for residents climbed to 83%, according to the CMS data. Thestrong vaccination percentage among nursing home residents is credited, in part, to an early campaign to bring the vaccine directly to facilities. Thatsuggests availability is not necessarily the issue behindstaff going without. So, what is?The question defies easy answers. Vaccine refusal is regional and often aligns not only with individuals’ political alignment but also with their preferred newssources and whichsocial media they follow. Last week, President Joe Biden took aim at Facebook and othersocial media giants for failing to police vaccine misinformation that amplifies conspiracy theories and discourages people from getting vaccinated. “They’re killing people,” hesaid, directly blaming the platforms. On Monday, he recast the accusation tosay it wasspecific individuals posting dangerous information who are culpable. On Tuesday, US Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., pleaded to “anyone out there willing to listen: Get vaccinated.” While not mentioningskepticsspecifically — including those in his own party — the Republican leader urged the unvaccinated to ignore “demonstrably bad advice.”COVID-19 cases are nowsurging in everystate, with new hospitalizations and deaths almost entirely occurring among the unvaccinated. “This is becoming a pandemic of the unvaccinated,” Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Rochelle Walensky warned last week during a White House briefing. In May, CMS began requiring weekly reports on vaccinations of residents andstaff at nursing homes and other long-term care facilities. The emerging data confirms many health care experts’ worst fears, especially for Southernstates. Louisiana has the loweststatewide average: Just 44.5% of thestaff at its long-term care facilities have been at least partially vaccinated, according to CMS data released last week. Florida, thesecond lowest-vaccinatedstate, had a rate of just under 46% among its nursing home and long-term carestaff, with Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Georgia, Mississippi and Wyoming allshowing rates of less than 50 percent, according to the data. Vaccination rates in assisted living facilities are not included in the data. Aseparate American Association of Retired Persons analysis,released last week,showed that only one in five of the nation’s more than 15,000 nursing homes were able to hit a goal,set by two industry trade groups, of vaccinating 75% of theirstaff by the end of June. While cases in nursing homes have recentlyslowed, and most of the new COVID-19 infections are among younger people,some expertsstill worry of a return to darker days. The CDC recently launched an investigation into deaths of residents atseveral western Coloradosenior facilities possibly linked to unvaccinatedstaff, the Associated Press reported Wednesday.“We need tosound the alarm,”said Susan Reinhard,senior vice president of AARP and director of its Public Policy Institute. “Nursing homes were devastated by COVID-19, and many residents remain highly vulnerable to the virus.”Nationally, more than 89% of people 65 or older have received at least partial vaccination, the CDC reported this week. Still, public health experts have warned that even if fully vaccinated, the elderly may be vulnerable to “breakthrough” coronavirus infection because of compromised immunesystems and other underlying health problems. In Missouri’ssouthern region, the overall rate of full vaccination insome rural counties is less than 20%, according tostate health department and CDC tracking. The latestsurge of the delta variant has turned the area into a “tinderbox,” Steven Edwards, CEO of the CoxHealth hospitalsystem in Springfield, recently told reporters. On Thursday, 160 patients were being treated for COVID-19 at CoxHealth, aspokesperson told ProPublica. On May 14, there were 18. Heidi Lucas directs the Missouri Nurses Association. She is pro-vaccine and has been pushing hard for nurses to get vaccinated, especially those on the front lines of patient care. Lucassaid it is impossible toseparate the lack of vaccination amongstaff from the lack of vaccinations in individual communities. “Nurses are people too,”shesaid. “They are onsocial media and are inundated with false information. How do you fight it?”Hersister, Ashley Lucas, lives 900 miles away in Orbisonia, asmall town of around 500 people about an hoursouth of State College. She’s a traveling certified nursing assistant at area nursing homes and chose toskip the vaccine. Her fiance and her children, ages 12 and 13, are also unvaccinated. “I don’t consider myself an anti-vaxxer,”she told ProPublica, bristling thatsome mightsee her as reckless or ill-informed. Instead,shesaid her decision was carefully considered. It never madesense to her,shesaid, that the virusseemed tostrike randomly, withsome residents gettingsick while others did not. Shesaidshe is not convinced the vaccine would change the odds. She’s also concerned after hearing that the vaccine could interfere with fertility — a contention that has been deemed false by theCenters for Disease Control and Preventionand theWorld Health Organization. It all leads her to believe more research is needed into the vaccines’ long-term effects.“This is just a personal choice and I feel itshould be a free choice,”shesaid. “I think it’s been forced on us way too much.”Certified nursing assistants make up the largest group of employees working in nursing homes and other long-term care facilities, providing roughly 90 percent of direct patient care. They are typically overworked and underpaid, most earning about $13 per hour and receiving no paidsick leave or other benefits,said Lori Porter, co-founder and CEO of the National Association of Health Care Assistants. Portersaidshe is not completelysurprised by the low vaccination rate. It comes down to trust,shesaid, both of the vaccines and of facility administrators who nowsaystaff must get vaccinated. Refusal may feel like empowerment. “It’s the first time ever they have had the ball in their court,” Portersaid. On March 31, Houston Methodist Hospital mandated that all of its 26,000 employees be vaccinated by June 7 or lose their jobs. Jennifer Bridges, a nurse,sued along with 116 other employees, claiming the health caresystem had overstepped its rights and thatshe and the others refused to be “human guinea pigs,” evoking the Nuremberg Code, aset of ethicalstandards established in response to Nazi medical experimentation in concentration camps. On June 12, US District Judge Lynn N Hughes dismissed the closely watched case, taking offense to likening the vaccine to the Holocaust, which he called “reprehensible.” Ten days later, 153 Houston Methodist employees either were fired or quit after refusing the vaccine. The judge’s ruling has been appealed. A handful of long-term care chains havesimilarlysought to mandate worker vaccines, butsuch action is far from widespread in the industry. Onesticking point has been whether vaccination can legally be required,since all three available vaccines have only emergency use authorization, not full approval from the US Food and Drug Administration. The thornier issue, though, is whether the facilities can risk losingstaff when they’re alreadyshort-handed. Many workers have vowed to quit rather than be forced into vaccinations. Aegis Living, a long-termsenior care provider in three Westernstates, made vaccines mandatory for its roughly 2,600 employees on July 1. Dwayne Clark, founder and CEO,said initially 400 employees refused but when the deadline arrived, only about 100 left rather than be vaccinated.“We lostsomestaff that we didn’t want to lose,” Clark told ProPublica, “but it felt like the right moral protocol to impose.”Recently the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commissionissued guidelinesstating that employers can require workers to be vaccinated as long as medical or religious exemptions are permitted.“Nursing home workers certainly have the right to make decisions about their own health and welfare, but they don’t have the right to place vulnerable residents at risk,”said Lawrence Gostin, a health law professor at Georgetown University. “Nursing homes don’t just have the power to require vaccinations, they have the duty.”Still, the issue is far from resolved.“America is a highly litigious country,” Gostinsaid, “I expect the courts to consistently uphold nursing home mandates, because they are entirely lawful and justified. But there will likely be lawsuits at least until it is quite clear they are futile.”Diane Peters is a registered nurse in the Chicagosuburbs who last year worked at a nursing home and is now working at asenior rehabilitation center. She does not trust thescience behind the vaccine and is unvaccinated. So is her fiance. Everything about the rollout felt like propaganda,shesaid. Development was too rushed. Clinical trials typically take years,shesaid, not months. “I don’t think it’ssafe right now, it needs more time,”shesaidshe tells patients if they ask. Read MoreMost don’t,shesaid. Neither do her co-workers. She has only been asked once by her employer ifshe was vaccinated,shesaid, declining to name the company. Peters guesses about 40 percent of her colleagues are also unvaccinated, butsaid no one likes to talk about it because the dividesurrounding the vaccine is “surreal.” Staff members are tested regularly and are required to wear masks,shesaid.

The State Departmentsaid Austin and Blinken “exchanged views” with Ghani on thesecuritysituation, with thesecretary ofstate confirming that the US “remained committed tosupport a politicalsolution to the conflict” and both officialsstressing that “the USs remains invested in thesecurity andstability of Afghanistan.”The department alsosaid Austin and Blinken informed Ghani that America would be “reducing our civilian footprint in Kabul in light of the evolvingsecuritysituation” and promised to pick up the pace of flying out Afghans who have worked with US and NATO forces and could be marked for extra-brutal retaliation by militants. The Talibanseizure of Kandahar in thesoutheast and Herat in the west of Afghanistan marked the biggest battlefieldsuccessesso far for the hard line fighters. Witnesses describedseeing Taliban fighters once detained at Herat’s prison freely moving on thestreets. Meanwhile, a Twitter account attributed to Talibanspokesman Qari Yousef Ahmadireported that Kandahar’s prison had been “completely conquered” after “a longsiege and violent attacks.”“The personnelsurrendered and all the prisoners were released,” the message added, giving no indication of what happened to the prisonstaff. Witnesses told the AP that the governor of Kandahar province and other officials fled the onslaught, catching a flight to Kabul. In all, the Taliban have captured 12 of the country’s 34 provincial capitalssince beginning their latest offensive in May One of those captured cities, Ghazni,sits on a major highway linking Kabul and Kandahar. Its fall effectively cuts off Ghani’s government from thesouthern provinces of Afghanistan. Ghazni provincial council member Amanullah Kamrani alleged that the provincial governor and police chief made a deal with the Taliban to flee aftersurrendering. Taliban video and photos purported toshow the governor’s convoy freely passing by insurgents as part of the deal. Theswiftness of the Taliban’s advance has led US officials to warn that the fall of Kabul could come within 30 to 90 days,according to the Washington Post. Thirty days from Thursday is the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks on America, as well as the initial date Bidengave for ending America’s combat mission in Afghanistan. Earlier Thursday, the Pentagon announced that 3,000 US troops would reinforce the more than 600 forces already working at or near the embassy, with presssecretary John Kirbysaying US officials didn’t want to “wait until it’s too late” tosecure thesafety of diplomatic personnel. Separately, the United Kingdomsaid 600 of its troops would be deployed on ashort-term basis tosupport British nationals leaving the country. Late Thursday, the Associated Press reported that Canadianspecial forces would besent to Kabul to help with the evacuation of embassystaff. CTV News reported that “sensitive documents” were being destroyed at the Canadian embassy in anticipation of an evacuation. The White House has insisted that Afghansecurity forces have all the manpower, equipment and training they need tostem the Taliban tide. But video clips of militants riding on American-made Humvees and pickup trucks with M-16sslung across theirshoulders has led to recriminations in Washington.“Afghanistan is careening toward a massive, predictable, and preventable disaster,” Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.)said in astatement Thursday. “And the Administration’ssurreal efforts to defend President Biden’s reckless policy are frankly humiliating.”“President Biden’s decisions have us hurtling toward an even worsesequel to the humiliating fall of Saigon in 1975,” added McConnell, who urged Biden to commit moresupport to the Kabul government’s forces. “Without it, al Qaeda and the Taliban may celebrate the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks by burning down our Embassy in Kabul.”At the UN, Reuters reported Thursday that astatement was being drafted by diplomats from Estonia and Norway that would condemn the Taliban attacks, threatensanctions, and affirm the non-recognition of an Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. In Qatar, where peace talks are ongoing, international envoys who met with Afghan government negotiators and Taliban representatives reaffirmed that foreign capitals would not recognize any government in Afghanistan “imposed through the use of military force.”",2,1,New York Post

David Stern knew what would happen from there.“In time,” the former NBA commissioner predicted in 1995, “that will change.”Stern was right. The number of international players in the NBA hassteadily risensince -- and the gap between USA Basketball and the rest of the world has tightened as well. There will be more players in this tournament with NBA experience than ever before, with nearly 70 players in the Tokyo Olympics either current or former players in the league. More than four dozen of them played in the league this pastseason. And only 12 of that group are in Japan to compete with “USA” across their chests. That’s why, when this men’s Olympic tournament opens Sunday, the medal possibilities may be as wide open as they have beensince that first team of NBAstars took the court in Barcelona. That group — which featured 11 future Hall of Famers on a 12-man roster —showed the rest of the world how much they had to do to catch the red, white and blue.“The gap issmaller andsmaller every year as far as talent is concerned,” US coach Gregg Popovichsaid. The US isseeking a fourth consecutive gold medal an dis the big favorite to do just that according to FanDuel,The Americans are the only team in Tokyo with 12 NBA players. But like Popovichsaid and Stern anticipated years ago, the talent gap has drastically dwindled. Nigeria, which beat the Americans in an exhibition, has eight NBA players. Australia, which also defeated the US in a warm-up game, hasseven. So does France, the first US opponent in this tournament on Sunday and the nation that knocked the Americans out of contention at the Basketball World Cup two years ago. Thatsetbacksent the teamspiraling to aseventh-place finish, the worstshowing in any tournament ever for an American roster composed of NBA players.“I think every team wants to beat us,” US forward Kevin Durantsaid. “Everybody wants tosee us lose,so every game has a little bit more pressure to it.”There’s only one current All-NBA first team player in these Olympics. He doesn’t play for the US Slovenia’s Luka Doncic garnered more first-team votes in the All-NBA voting thisseason, 55, than the entire US Olympic roster got combined. This is Slovenia’s first time in the Olympics, but with Doncic leading the way, medal talk doesn’tseem misguided.“Slovenians, we know how to fight, man,” Doncicsaid. “We’re not going to go down easy.”Doncic willed Slovenia to a win in the Olympic qualifying tournament that ended on July 4 and gave the tiny nation aspot in the Tokyo field. And what he’s done in his NBA tenure with Dallas has onlyshown the world that the buzz he arrived with was more than appropriate.“He’s aspectacular player, as we all know,” Popovichsaid. “He’s one of the best players in the world. And I emphasize, in the world. Heshowed himself early on in Europe, and he was a faststudy in the NBA forsure. He’s fun to watch. Hisskills, his competitiveness, hissize, his innate basketball IQ isso impressive. You put four hardworking people around him and you’ve got a hell of a team.”Some of what to watch:There are 12 teams in the field; four will have to wait until Monday for their Olympic openers. Sunday’sschedule has Iran vs the Czech Republic, Germany vs Italy, Australia vs Nigeria and then the US vs France. The Monday men’s openers are Argentina vs Slovenia and host Japan vs reigning World Cup champion Spain. The Miami Heat have four players at the Olympics, but only one plays for the US The Heat have three players on Nigeria’s roster (KZ Okpala, Precious Achiuwa and Gabe Vincent Nnamdi), with Bam Adebayo playing for the US The only men’s team in the Olympic field without a current NBA player is Iran. That roster does, however, have a former NBA player — Hamed Haddadi, who appeared in 151 games over parts of five NBAseasons for Memphis and Phoenix. He last appeared in the NBA in 2013. The women’s game is going on thesame trajectory as the men’s when it comes to having more international players with WNBA experience in these Olympics than in any previous games. The US has 12 WNBA players on its roster, while Australia has nine current or former WNBA players and Canada has eight.

483,America Is Headed for an Unprecedented Wave of Evictions,-12.45,37.36,https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/rent-evictions-homelessness/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,25,"Just beforeshe called me one day in late July, Dawn Miller’s phone lit up with calls from one particular number: the management office for her apartment building in Flatbush, Brooklyn, whereshe’s livedsince 2009. She hasn’t paid rent in five months. She can’t. Before the pandemic,she worked at a food kiosk at Brooklyn Collegeselling coffee andsandwiches. But then the campusshut down, throwing her out of work. She had to borrow money just to afford food. She didn’tstart receiving unemployment benefits until June, and even then the money had to go to paying back whatshe had borrowed to travel to her home country of Jamaica when hersister recently died. Rent had to wait. Up until June 20,she was protected from eviction by astatewide prohibition on all evictions issued by Governor Andrew Cuomo. But once that blanket protection expired, Cuomo narrowed who was protected to those who were unable to pay rent because theysuffered direct financial hardship due to the pandemic. That means landlords canstill take their tenants to court and the burden falls to renters to prove to a judge that they qualify. The city’s courts have also paused eviction proceedings through at least August 5, but without an extension, thousands of renters like Miller may be caught up in the gears of thesystem when it reactivates. There were also protections that the federal government put in place. When Congress passed the CARES Act, it included a moratorium on evictions in any federallysubsidized housing. Any landlord with a federallysubsidized loan through,say, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, or who accepts Section 8 rent vouchers, couldn’t legally evict tenants. But those expired on July 27 as Congress failed to pass an extension. “I’m not certain what’s going to happen,” Millersaid. Even if her college campus reopens,she’s notsure they’ll want to have people buying food from kiosks. “I don’t know if I’m going to have a job in the future,”shesaid. She’s certain her landlord will try to evict her assoon as he can,soshe’s been trying desperately to enroll in thestate’s rent relief program, which was launched in mid-July. But the onlinesystem keptshutting down beforeshe could complete her application. Miller lives with her youngest daughter and two grandchildren, andshe’s thesole provider; her daughter is in nursingschool full-time. “I’m worried about becoming homeless with my family,”shesaid. “Trust me, I am trulystressed.” Miller is one of millions across the country facing thatstress. When the pandemic first hit and officials ordered businesses toshut down, many also instituted protections to ensure that people weren’t thrown out of their homes just when they were being told tostay inside them tostem thespread of the disease. Many were temporary measures under the assumption that by now the virus would be under control, and yet US case counts keep going up. Even aftersomestates have allowed businesses to reopen, unemployment is horrifyingly high: More than 30 million people are either receiving unemployment benefits or have applied for them. One in five renters was behind on rent at the beginning of July, while about a third of American households missed their housing payment that month. The disappearance of eviction moratoriums will almost certainly lead to a housing crisis the likes of which the country hasn’tseen in a generation. Estimates vary: One puts the number of households at risk of eviction at 17 million, while another predicts that between 19 million and 23 million people could face eviction by the end of September. Another found that as many as 28 million people could face eviction or foreclosure. No matter which number proves to be accurate, the potential hardship is vast. In all of 2016, landlords filed 2.35 million evictions. “The courts can’t handle it, thestates can’t catch the people who go through thesystem and end up unhoused,”said Emily Benfer, a visiting professor of law at Wake Forest University. “It’s a really catastrophicsituation.” The country is poised to witness an even worse housing crisis than the one during the 2008 recession. “The USs has neverseen this level of housing instability or threat of eviction, especially insuch a truncated amount of time,” Benfersaid. During that downturn, nearly 10 million people lost their homes to foreclosure in thespan of eight years. Itseems certain that, without policy-makers’ acting, far more will be displaced by the current crisis. An economist at Columbia University predicts that homelessness could increase by 40–45 percent this year. “We’llsee increases in homelessness the likes of which we haven’tseen in our countrysince the Great Depression,” predicted Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition. “This will be a humanitarian disaster of our making if there isn’t intervention,” Benfer. The eviction moratoriums cities andstates put in place at thestart of the pandemic varied considerably. Some protected everyone from eviction; others targeted only those who could prove that the pandemic had caused them financial hardship. Some blocked landlords from filing evictions in the first place; others allowed the whole process to move forward but merely barredsheriffs from carrying them out, which couldstill leave a black mark on a renter’s record. “The only thing they have in common is that they expire,” Benfersaid. Still, overall, Benfersaid, “the moratoriums worked.” Where they are in place, eviction filings arestill low. “There is no doubt that the federal,state, and local eviction moratoriums prevented evictions,” Yentel agreed. “That we cansay with certainty.” But where they’ve lifted, evictions have quickly jumped. New Orleans offers a glimpse of what’s instore for other places as protections expire. Thestate’s eviction moratorium was lifted on June 15. Jane Place Neighborhood Sustainability Initiative, a community land trust and housing rights organization, estimated that about half of all tenants in the city werestill protected by the CARES Act moratorium. To enforce that, Breonne DeDecker, the group’s program director, and her fellow organizers posted flyers in buildings they knew weresupported by federal money. But landlords don’t want the information to beshared; they kept taking the flyers down. “It’s not uncommon for organizers to go into common areas and put up fliers,” DeDeckersaid, “only to watch the property manger come by five minutes later and rip everything down and throw it away.” Now that federal protection has lapsed, “we really expect the deluge tostart,” DeDeckersaid. Landlords had already moved to evict more than 230 city residents by the end of June, before the federal protection expired. Legal aid attorneyssay they’re fielding triple the number of eviction cases as compared to last year. DeDecker’s group used to meet once a month; now they’re meeting twice a week, trying to producestrategies tostem the tide. They’vesent hundreds of letters to local andstate judges asking them to halt eviction court, as well as contacting the governor asking him to reimpose the eviction moratorium. On July 30, a group of activists blocked access to the courthouse to protest the resumption of eviction cases. The disappearance of these protections is colliding with the expiration of the extra unemployment benefits Congress passed in response to the pandemic, money that manysay has allowed people to keep paying rent. “That’s really been the only break wallstemming the tide here,” Benfersaid. Those in direstraitsseem to have turned to assistance for food—requests for food pantries doubled in March—in order to use their limited resources to pay rent. They’re “putting a priority onstaying housed,” Benfersaid. “Which makessense. The primary response to Covid-19 is toshelter in place,so housing is literally preventative health care.” As the pandemic rages, with cases increasing in 15states, Puerto Rico, and Washington, D.C, and the prospect of businesses’ returning to anysemblance of normal months, if not over a year, away, Congressstill doesn’t have a deal to extend benefits. Democrats want to keep them at thesame level, while Republicans have proposed cutting the extra benefits from $600 a week to $200, which would cut Americans’ benefits by a cumulative $10 billion a week. The current outbreak has many governors reimposing lockdowns on different businesses, including in California, Louisiana, and Texas. Even instates that have allowed businesses to reopen and, in the best-casescenario, many of these renters were able to return to work, they havestill likely accrued months of back rent that they owe. “Getting a job is not enough to help pay that off,” Benfer noted. And without the pandemic under control, allowing businesses to reopen doesn’t mean they can keep their doors opensafely or that customers will feelsafe enough to return. Many willstill remain out of a job. In New York, 279,400 low-income renter families will be at risk of not being able to pay rent and facing eviction when unemployment benefits expire. Another 111,500 families have experienced job loss without receiving unemployment benefits and are at immediate risk of eviction. Even though proceedings to evict people have been on hold, landlords havestill been able to file the paperwork on new cases by mail. “We don’t have any idea really how many,”said Judith Goldiner, attorney-in-charge of the Civil Law Reform Unit at the Legal Aid Society. Last year during thesame period,shesaid, there were about 50,000 cases filed,soshe thinks that’s a baseline—likely a vast undercount—of how many people will face eviction once thesystem is up and running. “There is the possibility that tens of thousands of cases, maybe more than 100,000 cases, could be brought,”shesaid. “Landlords are chomping at the bit to bring these cases.” Housing advocates are baffled by the rush to evict. “I don’tsee how [landlords] are going to get blood from astone,” Goldinersaid. Even if they’re able to push nonpaying tenants out, there are not likely many who can take their place and make rent whenso many arestill out of work. Initially, Goldiner advised clients to try to negotiate with their landlords, given the circumstances. “Over and over people told me, ‘No one responds,’ or theysay, ‘No, we won’t do anything for you,’”shesaid. “It’s crazy to me they wouldn’t be trying to worksomething out.” The pain of eviction won’t be felt evenly. Black and Latinx New Yorkers were already more likely to face eviction before the pandemic, a trend that the crisis has only exacerbated. Half of Black renters and nearly a quarter of Latinx renters in New York State fell behind on their rent between late April and early June, compared to just 6 percent of white ones. It’s thesame case nationwide: 30 percent of Black renters and about a quarter of Latinx renters are behind on their rent, compared to 13 percent of whites. Those who are covered by the federal eviction protections in the CARES Actshould, in theory, have been protected until they expired toward the end of July, and will have 30 days to pay rent after landlords file a notice. But it’s been very difficult to enforce. “The burden is on the renter to know whether or not they have any protection,” Yentelsaid. And they’llstruggle to figure it out. “Tenants certainly don’t know,” Goldinersaid, whether their landlord has a mortgage backed by the government. There are also no penalties for landlords who flout the rules and move to evict tenants anyway. ProPublica found landlords moving to evict in April despite being barred by the federal moratorium in fourstates. “The main thing tenants are experiencing in this exact moment is a lot of confusion,”said Cea Weaver, campaign coordinator for Housing Justice for All in New York. “People are reallyscared. They’rescared because of the uncertainty andscared because of the lack of protections.” In mid-July, New York Governor Cuomo announced the creation of an emergency rental assistance program for low-incomestate residents who lost their income during the pandemic. But the $100 million he allocated only covers asmall portion of the estimated $2 billion rentshortfall in thestate, and applications were only open for two weeks. He “either doesn’t understand this is a crisis, or he doesn’tseem to care,” Goldinersaid. “It’s just boggling to me that there’s beenso little coming from him.” “We’restill in Covid,” Miller argued, frustrated at how little assistanceshe has been able to get tostave off her eviction. “So come on, dosomething for the people. What has he done? Nothing.” Many otherstates and cities have also created rent relief programs and haveseen their resources vastly outpaced by need. Thirty percent had already beenshut down after running out of funding by late July, according to Yentel. “Insome places they were having toshut down within hours or days,” Yentelsaid. Louisiana’s program ran out in three days. Houston’s program was depleted in 90 minutes “Congress must act,” Benfersaid. “Thestates have done everything that they can. They’ve depleted the funds that they have.” States are facing down enormous budgetshortfalls due to a drop in tax revenue and a greater outlay in assistance. Extending moratoriums is not asolution but a bridge, advocatesstress. Many want to buy time until Congress passessubstantial rental assistance. Democrats included $100 billion in emergency rental assistance in the HEROES Act, which passed the House, along with a 12-month eviction moratorium for all renters who can’t pay rent. The Senate hasn’t taken it up, even though Democraticsenators have introducedstand-alone bills to extend a moratorium and offersignificant rental assistance. Republicans are instead offering their own package that doesn’t include an eviction moratorium and has far less assistance for renters. Other advocates just want tosee rent canceled. “Every time [organizers] have to fight for an extension of a moratorium, it’s like a yo-yo,”said Pam Phan, national field organizer with the Right to the City Alliance. Renters bounce between thesecurity of knowing they won’t face immediate eviction to having thatsecuritystripped away. In Florida, for example, the governor keeps extending it month by month, forcing advocates to fight for it over and over again, all the while bracing for evictions as they near the expiration. In June the governor extended it four hours before it would have elapsed. “It’s becoming clear the visionarysolution is actually the most logical one,” Phansaid. That visionarysolution is, for her, Congress passing a bill introduced by Representative Ilhan Omar and cosponsored by Representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Rashida Tlaib, Pramila Jayapal, and Ayanna Pressley in April that would cancel all rent and home mortgage payments throughout the duration of the pandemic while offering a relief fund for landlords and mortgage holders to cover losses. Right to the City’s network of local advocates is trying to put pressure onstate and local lawmakers to demand Congress actually pass it. Even as eachstate tackles the problem in different ways, “it’s a largersystemic problem, because it’s happening to all of us at once,”shesaid. “The message to Congress is they need to act.” But all advocates are united in one thing: Something must be done, or unimaginablesuffering will follow. “The one positive is that this is entirely preventable. We canstop this,” Benfersaid. “It doesn’t have to end with all of these catastrophic outcomes.”",1,1,The Nation

486,Nothing Is More Threatening to the British Press Than a Black Woman in Control of Her Story,-4.0,39.0,https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/politics/a35727663/meghan-markle-british-media-racism/,https://adfontesmedia.com/harpers-bazaar-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-05,16,"The British media’sobsessionwith Duchess Meghan is distinguishable from its regular and, arguably, unhealthyscrutiny of other royals—or in Meghan’s case, ex-royals—bysome marked observations: The preoccupation is often racialized, if not patentlyracist. It is gendered, in this case, reeking ofmisogynoir. And it also containssubtle hints ofanti-foreignsentiment. Put together, the distinct Meghan fixation is as predictable as it is dangerous, and a reminder that media outlets anywheresave their most antagonistic portrayals for women everywhere, often punishing those who attempt ownership and control of their narratives. That Meghan is a Black, biracial woman exercising command of herstory, opposing the account tabloids havesold about her, threatens the mirage of the monarchy as asecure institution, and the media outlets that feed into the machine they benefit from. When Meghan and Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex,stepped down from their duties assenior members of the British royal family in early 2020, those unfamiliar with the nation’s press apparatus could be forgiven for thinking the initial brouhaha would eventually die down. Alas, more than a year later, even after the couple left the United Kingdom for North America with their infantson, Archie Mountbatten-Windsor, the British media’s penchant for adversely dissecting every detail of Harry and Meghan’s life has not eased. Following the Sussexes’announcementin mid-February that they are expecting asecond child, another wave of weary, if foreseeable, anti-Meghan punditry has come to the fore. The intensity of this wave has now been heightened by reports on Tuesday from that Meghan faced bullying complaints fromsome of her aides in 2018. Meghan has denied this through her lawyers, who referred to it as a “calculatedsmear campaign based on misleading and harmful misinformation,” in astatement to the British paper. Her lawyers also added that these accusations are “being used by Buckingham Palace to peddle a wholly false narrative,” which comes ahead of Meghan and Harry’s CBS Primetime Special with Oprah Winfrey, airing this Sunday. In a highly unusual move, Buckingham Palace released astatementWednesdaysaying that it will investigate the claims. Notwithstanding the bullying allegations against Meghan, much of the pseudo analysis the British tabloids advance is not really about Meghan and Harry’s perceived faux pas, or asincere contemplation of the intentions and impact of their public acts. Indeed, it is less about Harry than it is about Meghan. Never mind that Harry will never be king. Never mind, too, that Harry’s contempt for the press is practically legendary and predates Meghan—a factseemingly lost on commentators who have blamed her forth e couple’s mistrust of the press and their departure from the United Kingdom. But these demonstrable truths are lesssignificant than what Meghansymbolizes. As Meghan’s detractorssee it, that a biracial, Black American celebrity divorcée who had the nerve to enter, and then worse, exit, the royal family (inspectacular fashion) is unacceptable. Thatshe appears to have doneso while maintaining herself-respect and individuality insults thesensibilities of a press who both indulged in and resented her presence, often for cheap, ridiculous, and vicious fodder: Thethat referred to “how Meghan’s favorite avocadosnack … is fueling human rights abuses” comes to mind. What issoseemingly offensive to the British press and at leastsome of the British public is Meghan’s independence and desire to control her destiny in the public eye—a common objective for celebrities. It is why her exit was always likely to the discerning mind. But it’s also whyshe remains a persona non grata to those accustomed to covering culture, celebrities, and/or entertainment with little to no apparent ethical responsibility, or who disregard the duty of care they have to the people they write about the public that reads it. This fact is especially pertinent in light of the recentNew York Times-produced documentary,Framing Britney Spears. While chronicling the popstar’s rise, fall, reemergence, and conservatorship restrictions, the film has also prompted a conversation on how the media covers public figures and, in particular, women. Any direct comparison between Meghan and Spears is, of course, incongruent. From the impact of race to their family backgrounds to their claims to fame: Spears is a popstar; Meghan went from being an actor to marrying into the most famous royal family in the world. Meghan is also autonomous in a way that Spears isseemingly not. A more accurate comparison might be made and has been made between Meghan and Princess Diana, whom the press was also unkind to;somestill consider the media at least partially responsible for the latter’s death. But what unites thestories of all these women—and many more—is an exhibited pleasure with which the media took, and in Meghan’s case,in harping on any perceivedslight or any deviation from norms or protocols, or in foiling their attempts to exercise authority over their lives and public images. What the press owes itssubjects remains a tricky conversation, especially in entertainment or culture journalism thatsometimes occupies a contradictoryspace in the media and the public. Thesubjects and people reported on and commented about aresometimes treated as frivolous, yet they reflect what and who asociety deems desirable, relatable, worthy of worship—and paradoxically—who it feels entitled to in terms ofsurveillance and unfettered condemnation. What is clear in how the press covers women as public figures, regardless of their domains or class of celebrity, is that the mediasystem replicates thesame hyperscrutiny and projects thesame limitedspace of associety offers ordinary women in general. Though Meghan’s move to the USs may allow for a certain physical protection from the tentacles of at least the British media, there remains a danger in how her representation has been distorted by bad-faith press actors, notably in Britain. And what does itsay about British media culture, British culture—British racism andsexism—that even the most multi-privileged Black/biracial women are at the receiving end ofsuch ire? (And what does itsay for those whoshare thesame identitysans privilege?) The answer is obvious and ugly: Britain, which often imagines itself as occupying a “less racist” predisposition as its European and North American counterparts, remains asociety embedded in racist,sexist, chauvinistic pathologies. Ignorant to its reality, Britain has hugeswaths of its population that are unwilling to address these matters in terms ofstructure—including the media—and interpersonally. The lessspoken part of this entire affair is that there are credible reasons to critique Meghan (and Harry). With this new bullying allegation, howeversuspicious the timing, it is also not impossible to imagine harmful behavior from people with power; but in this case, it must be considered in a racialized context, where black women are often on the receiving end of bullying accusations. These criticisms can exist alongside critiques of a British press that continue to be repugnant—and within a larger context of how the media reproduces biased and bigoted representations of women and people of color. Yes, including those who are privileged byskinshade, class, and/or celebrity. It’s inevitable that in the interview with Winfrey on Sunday, Meghan and Harry will address their treatment by the British media. Previews have already revealed as much, including one teaser in which Meghan implicates the palace in “perpetuating falsehoods” about the couple. How the British, American, and global public will respond is worth watching for. It may, and perhapsshould, include thoughtful criticism of where and how Meghan (or Harry) may have faltered—she isstill a flawed public figure and human being after all. But even if one withholds compassion for the rich and privileged in this instance, perhaps there canstill be room for reflection and discernment on her damaging portrayal, given what we know about the press’s legacy on covering women in culture. It’ll certainly be more than what the British press is likely to afford her, if the past is any guide. And truthfully, it’s not a tough bar to clear.

487,"To Build Stronger Families, Reframe the Fight Over Mayor Pete is Parental Leave",5.33,29.33,https://pjmedia.com/columns/stacey-lennox/2021/10/16/to-build-stronger-families-reframe-the-fight-over-mayor-petes-parental-leave-n1524408,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-16,25,"Recently, the media disclosed that Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg took two months of parental leave following the adoption of twins. This news led to arguments online about whether heshould have doneso during a globalsupply chain crisis, whether menshould take parental leave, and why the privileged class getsso much time. That misses the moresignificant opportunity. To defend his absence, the left and Democrats had to loudly declare the importance of parentsspending time with their children. They had to advocate for familiesspending time together and note the importance of parent-child bonds. Agree with them wholeheartedly on these points. Then challenge them on the very policies they have pushed for years that discourage family formation by extending adolescence, making housing more expensive, and deemphasizing the role of fathers. It is time for conservatives to change thestrategy ofscreaming “Stop” whilestanding athwart history andsay, “No, we’re not doing that. We are doingsomething completely different.”Young adults in this country are marrying less and having fewer children. This trend is a feature of asociety in decline. Strong families are the building block of a free and prosperoussociety. You only need to look at the history of any authoritarian regime to know the family is one of the first things they destroy. Mao’s cultural revolution may be the most horrific example when the culture war destroyed the Eastern tradition of honoring your elders. Young revolutionaries reported on, beat, and even murdered older relatives. Our tax andsocial policies enforce the politically correct view that all family configurations are equally desirable. One could even argue that many of them discourage traditional marriage by imposing monetary penalties when fathers remain in the home. This view ignores decades of research that confirms that children in intact heterosexual marriages are moresuccessful as a population. It is nosurprise that the decline in traditional marriage and childbearing accelerated with the passage of legislation purported to wage war on poverty under President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society. It’s noshock that one of the architects of those programs wasMichael Harrington,founder of the Democratic Socialists and a committed Trotskyist. Trotsky envisioned perpetual revolution on a globalscale, which cannot occur whensolid families and a prosperous middle class with economic mobility exists. Harrington’s view on the disenfranchised in America and how thestateshould care for them was notably paternalistic. The government as daddy was the goal. In his book, he asserted that millions of Americans lived in a “culture of poverty.” Harrington argued that this culture rendered the poor incapable of improving theirsituation. He believed a capitalistsociety could not provide the poor with opportunities for a more dignified life, and they must be cared for by thestate. To put it in a nutshell, Harrington described asystem that could only create a permanent underclass. The best expression of Harrington’s world view is “The Life of Julia,” an Obama campaign videoscrubbed from the internet because most Americans, even in 2012, found it horrifying. Now, the “Build Back Better” plan includes a raft of policies to discouragestrong families. It encourages putting children in government-funded careshortly after a paid parental leave ends, which issupposed to excite you. It increases the marriage penalty for the Earned Income Tax Credit. It also extends adolescence by paying for 13th and 14th grades. The government-run education of children for 18 years in a pre-K-12system produces horrible results,so let’s do two more. Even the PRO Actseeks to reduce the freelance and contract opportunities that allow parents to work from home andspend less on child care and more time with their children. In 2013, the left-leaning Brookings Institute noted the decline of the traditional family is a class issue:A report from the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginiasummed up the data well: “Marriage is an emerging dividing line between America’s moderately educated middle and those with college degrees.” The group for whom marriage has largely disappeared now includes not just unskilled blacks but unskilled whites as well. Indeed, for younger women without a college degree, unwed childbearing is the new normal. An additional trend now is having fewer children, period. The birth rate hit anew record low for thesixth consecutive yea rin 2021. It remains below replacement rates. Problems include financial barriers tosuccessful family formation created by prolonged adolescence, dependence on two incomes, the cost of childcare, andskyrocketing housing costs. Rather than increasing thesalaries of child care providers and expanding child caresubsidies in the “Build Back Better” boondoggle, conservativesshould advocate providing tax credits. These credits need to be asubstantial percentage of the last year’s W-2 earnings for one parent tostay home and care for their child until they aresix. Andsubstantial means 50%. Astructure like this is better for families, including the child care workers who may want to have children of their own. Think about it. Couples couldstructure their monthly expenses to live within the means of a moresubstantial portion of the working parent’ssalary. Based on average wages on Indeed, a welder and medical officesecretary in Pennsylvania could count on an additional tax credit of $13,936 on top of thestandard deduction. They would have no child care expenses and none of the fuel, food, and other costs associated with commuting to work. The average American couple couldsave andspend in line with the goal ofstarting a family. Employers would benefit from the planning by having months to recruit, train, promote or transition another employee into the vacant position left by the parentstaying home. It would also make returning to the workforce for astay-at-home parent a common occurrence instead of having an employment gap that can be difficult to overcome. Women are not returning to the workforce as often post-pandemic. The media assumes they can’t. Perhaps they prefer tostay home with their children. The most important beneficiaries of policies that encourage family formation are the children. Brookings also noted:These differences in family formation are a problem not only for those concerned with “family values” perse, but also for those concerned with upward mobility in asociety that values equal opportunity for its children. Because the breakdown of the traditional family is overwhelmingly occurring among working-class Americans of all races, these trends threaten to make the US a much more class-basedsociety over time. The well-educated and upper-middle-class parents who arestill forming two-parent families are able to invest time and resources in their children—time and resources that lower- and working-classsingle mothers, however impressive their efforts to be both good parents and good breadwinners,simply do not have. If we lose economic mobility for the next generation, we lose the American Dream. That’s not a bargain most Americans are willing to make. So let’s make more families at every income level.

In a110-page ruling released on Wednesday, judge Linda Parker of the federal district court in Detroit ruled that the attorneys who alleged widespread election fraud in Michigan presented unsubstantiated claims and abused the justicesystem.“This lawsuit represents a historic and profound abuse of the judicial process,” Parker wrote. “This case was never about fraud – it was about undermining the People’s faith in our democracy and debasing the judicial process to doso,”she added. Parker ordered the lawyers to pay legal fees to the city of Detroit andstate of Michigan, and will require them to attend legal education classes on pleadingstandards and election law withinsix months. She also referred the lawyers to the Michigan attorney grievance commission and other appropriate disciplinary authorities, where they could face further investigation and potentialsuspension or disbarment in thestate. In a frenzied effort in theswingstate of Michigan, then president Donald Trump last November met withRepublican leaders from thesta teat the White Housein an increasingly desperate attempt tosubvert democracy after aseries of courtroom defeats over his and his campaign’s allegations of voter fraud. This was all despite officials at the local and federal level declaring it the mostsecure election in American history. The Michigan lawsuit, which was filed in late November, was one of aseries of lawsuits known as the “Kraken” cases that Powell filed across the country, alleging that Dominion Voting System’s voting machines were deliberately tampered with. The lawsuit argued that Biden’s win was fraudulent and asked Parker to declare Trump the winner of thestate’s 16 electoral college votes. Parker rejected the request in December,writing: “If granted, the relief would disenfranchise the votes of the more than 5.5 million Michigan citizens who, with dignity, hope, and a promise of a voice, participated in the 2020 general Election.”Wednesday’s ruling marked the latest development in aseries of legal woes mounting against pro-Trump attorneys who promoted election conspiracies. In January, Dominion Voting SystemssuedPowell and Trump’s former personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, in a $1.3bn defamation lawsuit. A month later, Smartmatic USA, a rival election-technology company,suedthe two lawyers for $2.7bn. Meanwhile, Lin Wood was facing his own legal headaches in Georgia, where he is challenging astate bar request that he take a confidential mental competency exam after it conducted an extensive review of his alleged legal misconduct over election challenges. In July, a US appeals courtsuspendedGiuliani from practicing law in Washington DC, a month after he wassuspended from practicing law in New York after a court ruled that he made “demonstrably false and misleadingstatements to courts, lawmakers and the public in trying to overturn the election results”. One of thesanctioned lawyers from the Michigan lawsuit, Scott Hagerstrom, responded to Wednesday’s ruling,saying: “This is all political.

The report by the minoritystaff of the Government Operations and Border Management Subcommittee of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee found that efforts tosuspend or terminate wall construction projects at the Defense Department have cost between $1.8 billion to $2 billion and the administration isspending $3 million every day.""These interim findingsshow that the Biden administration’s efforts tostop border wall construction constitutesignificant waste of taxpayer resources,""the reportsays. ""As of the drafting of this report the Biden administration has paid border wall contractors at least $2 billion and counting to not build the border wall.""""This $2 billion comes directly from DOD’s budget, and the Biden administration’s continued waste of these funds poses risks to nationalsecurity and bordersecurity,"" itsays. Biden ended the Trump-era wall project, whichsaw 450 miles built during the Trump administration, on his first day in office with hundreds of milesstill funded and contracts already underway. Biden ordered a review of the federal government’s obligations. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) hassince announced a plan on what to do with money assigned to the wall, while the administration redirected transferred funds from Pentagon accounts to the original projects for which they had been appropriated. The Defense Department (DOD) had $10 billion transferred from border wall construction and related projects. After the order tosuspend construction, the committee found that the Defense Department was initially occurring $6 million a day in ""suspension costs,"" but that was reduced to $3 million after layoffs. The money is beingspent on ""makesafe andsitesecurity"" projects.""This means that the federal government is paying contractors on theseseven projects $3 million per day to drive out to projectsites and guard the unused pallets ofsteel and other construction materials,"" the reportsaid. To get to the $2 billion figure, the report uses DOD’s estimates laid out in court documents. Those estimates include ""suspension costs"" for the project, which thesubcommitteestaffsays either ""significantly undercounted"" the daily accrual of $3 million a day or was not fully included.""If the daily accrual of $3 million represents aseparate cost not accounted in the broader DOD estimate of termination costs, then the totalsuspension costs willstill besignificantly higher than the estimate DOD provided to the Biden administration and to the courts,"" itsays. According to the report, the total amountspent could be higher than $2 billion due to uncertainties about plans for contracts acquired by DHS, questions about the Pentagon’s estimation ofsuspension costs, and the 12- to 18-month time line it will take to exit the contracts. Pentagonspokesman Chris Mitchell told Fox News that the Defense Department ""will not comment publicly on matters that are in active litigation orsettlement discussions.""Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla., the lead Republican on thesubcommittee,slammed the Biden administration over the findings.""It is absolutely absurd that Americans are paying contractors to guard metal gates that President Biden refuses to install because he wants to ‘study’ the wall,"" hesaid in astatement. ""Stubbornly refusing tospend money approved for the wall is not ‘executing’ the law. It’s ignoring the law and ignoring the very real nationalsecurity concerns posed by illegal entry across our very opensouthern border. For years I have called out federal waste, but the Biden Administration is literally ‘going for broke’ with this nonsense.""The reportsays that the estimation on exactly how much is being wasted could be higher, as it does not factor in Department of Homeland Security accounts, as well as other costs related tosome of the DOD projects.""These estimates do not include an analysis of DHS accounts and therefore do not represent the full extent of waste by the Biden administration, nor do they include the ongoing daily costs related to DOD’ssuspension of projects funded by its 284 accounts,"" the reportsays. ""Given these caveats, President Biden is likely wastingsignificantly more taxpayer resources than estimated in this report on his efforts tostop building the border wall.""The Republican report also cast its findings in light of the ongoing crisis at thesouthern border, which hasseen more than a million migrant encounters in Fiscal Year 2021 and more than 188,000 in June alone.""Our border patrol agents are doing their best tosecure our border, but they need additional barriers, roads, and technology to help keep ussafe,"" Lankfordsaid. ""Instead, President Biden is paying professional construction contractors to babysit metal to the tune of $2 billion and counting, while at thesame time we’veseen a 20-year high number of migrants crossing our open border.""The report comes just as the Department of Homeland Securityannounced that it has canceled contracts for more than 30 miles of border wall construction in the Laredo Sector in Texas.

491,Why Do Democrats Want to Ban Members of Congress From Carrying Firearms in the Capitol?,16.0,30.0,https://thenewamerican.com/why-do-democrats-want-to-ban-members-of-congress-from-carrying-firearms-in-the-capitol/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-17,16,"A clique of liberal Democrats is urging leaders of both parties in the House of Representatives to ban lawmakers from carrying firearms while on Capitol Hill. While members of the public are barred from carrying weapons of any kind on Capitol grounds, a decades-old rule lets the members of Congress themselves carry guns in most areas of the Capitol complex. So far, at least 21 Democrat anti-gunners have joined the effort to trash the exemption. Theysent a letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and to Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) this week in which they argued that armed members of Congress make everyone on Capitol Hill lesssafe, in part, because Capitol Police are unaware who is armed and who isn’t. This group hopes that party leaders will adopt a rule change banning firearms for everyone in the next Congress. “Ultimately, the current regulations create needless risk for Members of Congress, theirstaff, members of the Capitol Police, and visitors to the Capitol grounds,” the Democrats wrote in their letter. The group is composed of well-known gun control advocates,such as Representatives Mike Quigley (D-Ill.), Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.), and Representative Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) — who wasshot and wounded as astaff member during the 1978 congressional trip to the Jonestown cultsettlement in Guyana, ashooting in which four others were killed. Pelosi reportedly likes the idea of prohibiting guns for members of Congress. She has long wantedstricter federal gun laws and wants the incoming Congress to expand background checks. The idea, however, doesn’tsit well with McCarthy or the Republican caucus. It’s currently unknown just how many lawmakers on Capitol Hill exercise the ability to carry. The policy as it nowstands was adopted in 1967 by the Capitol Police Board after Congress passed a Capitol ban on firearms for the general public. The issue came into thespotlight last month when it became known that Lauren Boebert, a 33-year-old Colorado Republican newly elected to the House, approached Capitol Police during new member orientation to inquire about Capitol Hill firearm policies. Boebert often carries a gun on her hip and made the Second Amendment a central focus of her campaign, in whichshe defeated 10-year incumbent Scott Tipton in the Republican primary. Representative Jared Huffman (D-Calif.), who is leading the movement to ban congressmen from carrying in the Capitol Complex,says one of the problems is that there are no guidelines to ensuresafestorage of guns in representatives’ offices or anywhere else in the Capitol.“As you know, Member offices are open tostaff, visitors, and the general public, and a firearm that is notsecured could easily end up in the wrong hands,” the letter reads. His group also argues that while the House Sergeant at Arms wassaid to brief the newly elected members on the Capitol’s gun rules, older members have never received thesame instructions.“Most returning Members are likely not aware of any regulations whatsoever regarding firearms on Capitol grounds,” the Democrats wrote. “As a result, there is a total lack of uniformity and proceduresurrounding Members of Congress carrying firearms, which fosters an environment where Members may unwittingly be putting themselves and others in danger.”That’s a pretty weak argument, however. If that were really the issue, it could easily be remedied by asimple memo or orientation for veteran members of the chamber. Unfortunately, the House rules package for the 117th Congress is currently being drafted by members of the Rules Committee, led by Democrat Representative Jim McGovern (Mass.). Adopting rules for the chamber will be one of the House’s first votes when the body convenes on January 3 to begin the nextsession. While Democrats’ majority has thinned due to Republican gains in the 2020 election cycle, they nevertheless retain control of the chamber, making it possible that the restrictive gun rules Huffman and his colleagues want will be passed, especially as it could please the new wave of radical Democratssuch as Alexandria Ocasio-Corte (D-NY), who are tired of Pelosi and the party’s old guard. It would be ashame and a loss for the Second Amendment if they removed lawmakers’ ability to carry. Insuch turbulent times, patriotic, constitutionaliststatesmenshould carry to protect themselves against reprisals from the Left and the establishment.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-NY) blasted the International Olympic Committee (IOC) following thesuspension of USsprinter Sha’Carri Richardson, who tested positive for THC — a chemical compound found in marijuana — during a drug test at the recent US Olympic trials. Ocasio-Cortez called on the IOC to “reconsider itssuspension” of Richardson, as well as any othersimilarly “penalized” athletes, arguing that the criminalization of cannabis is an “instrument” of policies related to racism and colonialism.“The criminalization and banning of cannabis is an instrument of racist and colonial policy,” Ocasio-Cortez tweeted. “The IOCshould reconsider itssuspension of Ms. Richardson and any athletes penalized for cannabis use. This ruling along w/ IOC denial ofswim caps for natural hair is deeply troubling.”The criminalization and banning of cannabis is an instrument of racist and colonial policy. The IOCshould reconsider itssuspension of Ms. Richardson and any athletes penalized for cannabis use. This ruling along w/ IOC denial ofswim caps for natural hair is deeply troubling.— Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (@AOC)July 2, 2021AstheNew York Postnoted, “Following the 2012 Summer Olympics in London, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) relaxed the threshold for what constitutes a positive marijuana test from 15 nanograms per milliliter to 150 nanograms per milliliter in an effort to detect use during competition rather than in the days and weeks before.”“However, marijuana remains on WADA’s list of prohibitedsubstances, with THC — the chemical Richardson tested positive for — classified as aso-called ‘Substance of Abuse’ along with cocaine, ecstasy and heroin due to their use insociety outside of a competitive context,” the Post added. Despite Ocasio-Cortez’s claims, colonialism was actually a driving factor behind the cultivation of cannabis. Indeed, one of the three primary crops George Washington grew at Mount Vernon was hemp. It wasn’t until the Pure Food and Drug Act of 1906 that cannabis products were required to be accurately labeled, which then opened the door to regulation and criminalization. While Ocasio-Cortez issomewhat accurate when it comes to racist elements of the history of cannabis criminalization, the argument that the IOC is therefore racist is arguably unfounded, given that it is applied to all athletes, regardless of race.“The rules are clear, but this is heartbreaking on many levels; hopefully, her acceptance of responsibility and apology will be an important example to us all that we cansuccessfully overcome our regrettable decisions, despite the costly consequences of this one to her,”saidUSADA CEO Travis T Tygart of Richardson’ssuspension. Indeed, Richardson herself did not make any accusation of racism against the IOC.“Honestly, I just want to apologize for my actions,” Richardsonsaid. “I know what I did. I know what I’msupposed to do, I’m allowed not to do, and Istill made that decision. Not making any excuse, or looking for any empathy in my case.”“At the Olympic trials, Richardson ran the 100 meters in 10.86seconds, even thoughshe informed the world after the race that her biological mother had passed away the week before,”The Daily Wire’sJoe Morgan reported. “Richardson admitted to using marijuana in order to cope with the loss.”“We all have our differentstruggles, we all have our different things we deal with. But to put on a face, and have to go in front of the world, and put on a face and hide my pain,”shesaid. “Who am I to tell you how to cope when you’re dealing with a pain, or dealing with astruggle that you’ve never experienced before?”",1,1,Daily Wire

The justices ruled 8-1 that an appeals court improperly let the lawsuit against the food companies go forward. The companies had beensued by a group ofsix adult citizens of Mali who claimed they were taken from their country as children and forced to work on cocoa farms in neighboring Ivory Coast.""Although respondents' injuries occurred entirely overseas, the Ninth Circuit held that respondents couldsue in federal court because the defendant corporations allegedly made  amajor operational decisions' in the USs. The Ninth Circuit erred by allowing thissuit to proceed,"" Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a majority opinion for the court. The case had been twice dismissed at an earlystage before being revived by the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. When the case was argued in December, then-President Donald Trump is administration backed Nestle and Cargill. The Malian citizens had argued that Minneapolis-based Cargill and the American arm of Switzerland-based Nestle ""aided and abetted"" theirslavery as children by, among other things, buying cocoa beans from farms that used child labor. The groupsued,seeking to bring a class action lawsuit on behalf of themselves, as well as who theysay are thousands of other former childslaves. Nestle and Cargill have maintained throughout the case that they have done nothing wrong and that they have takensteps to combat childslavery. Instatements following the ruling both Nestle and Cargill repeated that they remain committed to working to combat child labor in the cocoa industry. The case involves a law enacted by the very first Congress in 1789, the Alien Tort Statute, which permits foreign citizens tosue in US courts for human rights abuses. But Thomassaid this case was not properly in US courts.""Nearly all the conduct that theysay aided and abetted forced labor — providing training, fertilizer, tools, and cash to overseas farms — occurred in Ivory Coast. ... But allegations of general corporate activity — like decision making — cannot alone establish domestic application of the ATS,"" he wrote. Attorney Paul Hoffman, who argued the case for the Malian citizens at the high court,said in astatement that he was ""disappointed that the Court has delayed our clients' long quest for justice."" But hesaid it was not the end of the case. Hesaid intends to ask a lower court to be allowed to amend the group is lawsuit and allege that Cargill and Nestle ""controlled thesystem of forced labor from the USs.""The high court in recent years has limited the use of the Alien Tort Statute. In 2018, the court ruled that foreign businesses cannot besued under the law. In that case, the court rejected an attempt by Israeli victims of attacks in the West Bank and Gaza to use US courts tosue Jordan-based Arab Bank, which theysaid helped finance the attacks.

495,Trump Organization indictments for Allen Weisselberg a small but important step,-15.33,31.0,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/trump-organization-indictments-allen-weisselberg-small-important-step-n1272896,https://adfontesmedia.com/msnbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-01,25,"One need only recallAl Capone’s tax fraud conviction to recognize that many tax cheats historically flout other laws, too. As of Wednesday, we have added another character to the books with news that the Manhattan district attorney officially filed criminal tax charges against the Trump Organization and its chief financial officer,Allen Weisselberg. (Weisselberg plans top lead not guilty to the charges, his attorneysaid.)A growing chorus of pundits, politicians and even academics thus depict the law as being grounded in irrationality and being just political. It is nosurprise that the corporate defendant in the New York criminal case is owned by former President Donald Trump. This is thesame Trump who repeatedly called the Russia investigation a “witch hunt”and verbally abusedspecial prosecutor Robert Mueller and his own attorney general, Jeff Sessions. This is thesame Trump whoshowed contempt for elections in November 2020 when he asked the Georgiasecretary ofstate to “find 11,780 votes,” and when that didn’t work met with top advisers to consider declaring martial law to redo the election — and finally incited an insurrection at the Capitol on January 6. Trump’s four-year presidency can besummed up in the words of the New York State Bar Associationstatement condemning his 2020 pardon of convicted felonRoger Stone, a key witness in the Mueller investigation: “This is a perversion of justice, plain andsimple.”The former president maysoon fade from the politicalscene as his legal troubles worsen. But even without Trump, we must confront the perversion of justice that typifies the modus operandi ofso many others like him in business, the entertainment industry and politics. Bernie Madoff, Harvey Weinstein and countless others in positions of power and prestigeshowed contempt for the law. They pervert justice because they think the law is an obstacle to be overcome. First, the powerful claim they are immune from the law. Often, they prove this to be true. Some likeBill Cosbyclaim immunity from prosecution because their lawyers negotiated astrategically advantageous deal with prosecutors. Others claim immunity from prosecution because they are US presidents. They hide behind a constitutionally dubious presidential immunity theory blessed by the Department of Justice in threeseparate memoranda written during the presidencies of Nixon, Clinton and Trump. Donald Trump’s own lawyers, appearing before the 2nd Circuit in their effort to prevent the Manhattan DA fromsubpoenaing Trump Organization tax records, claimed the president was immune fromsubpoena and even couldshootsomeone on Fifth Avenue andstill be immune from prosecution. Trump’s defenders would have us believe that it’s the law, not his actions, that are wrong. Others in positions of power — many child molesters, for example — claim immunity because they avoided getting caught until after thestatute of limitations expired. Still others think their immunitystems from theirsocial class. As New York real estate mogulLeona Helmsleyfamously told her maid, “Only the little people pay taxes.” Unfortunately for Helmsley,she was not immune from prosecution and was carted off to prison. Asecond approach is to attack those who enforce the law, whether it be Mueller and his band of “angry Democrats,” the four agency inspectors general fired by Trumpin the middle of investigations, the USs attorney in Manhattan also fired by Trump in 2020, or now the verbal assaults launched at the Manhattan DA from Mar-a-Lago. Trump’sstrategy appears to be: When caught violating the law, deflect one’s own narcissism onto law enforcement and hope thatsticks in the court of public opinion. A third relatedstrategy is to denigrate the rule of law itself. Claim that the law is perverse, either because the law is just political or because the law is irrational in makingsome things illegal and others not. A growing chorus of pundits, politicians and even academics thus depict the law as being grounded in irrationality and being just political. In the far-right media, if Hillary Clinton or Joe Biden did it, it’s perse criminal. If Trump did it, it’s perfectly legal and any prosecutor, inspector general or member of Congress whosuggests to the contrary is just on a witch hunt. Many on the left have asimilar narcissistic attitude, even if not the media platform to express it, often insisting that law is defined by politics and has no moral integrity on its own. The law is not perfect and neither are those who enforce it. But the law is notsimply perverse or political either. For over a century, nihilistic legal commentators have re-enforced this view. The German theologian and legal philosopher Carl Schmittin the 1920s published “The Concept of the Political,” in which he argued that law is not based on neutral principles but issimply a byproduct of politics. Academic commentators on the far right and far left today quote Schmitt, who joined the Nazi Party in 1933, frequently for thesame proposition: Law is all about politics. There is no objective truth, no just concept of right and wrong underlying the law. This nihilism, like bad wine, is poured into the fancy bottles of academic theory, but it is peddled to a far larger audience under the more plebeian labels of right-wing radio, TV and internet. Finally, there are the many clever ways to get around the law. In the 1970s, before Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan reduced taxes on the rich,some academic economistssympathized with those who did not want to pay whatever taxes the legislature deemed to be their fairshare. Arthur Seldon of the London School of Economics and a group of co-authorscoined the term “avoision”to describe manipulative taxstrategies that combined ethically problematic but legal tax avoidance (for example, moving from one jurisdiction to another to pay lower tax) with illegal tax evasion (for example, pretending to have moved from one jurisdiction to another in order to pay lower tax). Another common avo isionstrategy is paying an employee’s rent, privateschool tuition or other benefits rather than paying reportable income. This, of course, is what the Manhattan DA now alleges the Trump Organization and its CFO did to avoid paying taxes. By the 1990s Seldon’s phrase “avoision” wasso widely used that it appeared on “The Simpsons” as Bart Simpson explained why Krusty the Clown was in prison for tax fraud: “I don’tsay 'evasion.' Isay 'avoision.'”According to a 2019 New York Times article,several generations of the Trump family have been doing just that to “avoid” taxessince the 1970s. And on Wednesday, the Manhattan DA, after a lengthy fight just to get the Trump Organization is financial records, and a 2020 victory in the Supreme Court, finally had enough evidence to hand down an indictment. Trump is the epitome of the avo ision man. And the law may be catching up with him. But we cannot just focus on Trump without looking at the underlying problem ­— the narcissistic view of the law that gave rise to Trump and causedso many to celebrate him first as a real estate tycoon, then as a mediastar and finally as a president. The law is not perfect and neither are those who enforce it. But the law is notsimply perverse or political either; it is grounded in a collectivesense of right and wrong. One of the law’s imperfections is that those who flout the law, who think they are too powerful ever to get caught or prosecuted for violating it, are far too often right. That’s about to change with thesmall but importantstep taken by the Manhattan DA on Wednesday. Respect for the law, and enforcement of the law, are crucial to maintaining the rule of law. And that goes for everyone — even a business empire run by a man who once was president of the USs. Richard W Painter was the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007 under President George W Bush.

Bossing folks around is, after all, a lot more fun than being bossed around. So, it is refreshing tosee in this deeply divided country at least tentativesteps towards bipartisan agreement that not every issueshould besettled by dictates issued from the nation is capital. As encouraging as it is, though, this grudging acceptance of live-and-let-live does not go far enough.""American federalism has always been a partisan issue — the GOP are the modern advocates,""notesDemocratic political adviser and former legislator Frank Pignanelli in theDeseret News. ""But the left-leaning have reason to be equallysuspicious of overreaching nationalism on key issues: privacy, immigration, environment, etc.""Pignanelli joined with Republican counterpart LaVarr Webb to warn of frantic pandemic-eraspending and rules-making by first the Trump and then the Biden administrations. ""[T]his immense federal intervention comes at the risk of makingstates even moresubservient to the federal government, both financially and with more federal regulation and mandates.""Pignanelli is not the first Democrat to discover the attractions of decentralization.""In the wake of the presidential election, as Democrats realized that Republicans willsoon control all three branches of the federal government, progressives disinclined tosecede from the Union rediscovered another exitstrategy:states' rights,"" Jeffrey RosenwroteforThe New York Timesin 2016. Democratsspent the nextseveral years battling for local governance against the Trump administration is insistence on federal control over matterssuch asimmigrationandmarijuana. Since then, Democrats have recaptured the presidency, the House, and (sort of) the Senate. Now they are back to insisting that beltway preferencesshould prevail—at least when their party is positions on issuessuch asgunsandtaxesdiffer with local preferences. This back-and-forthing on the value of local control vs centralsupremacy is exhausting, not to mention overtly opportunistic. As Pignanelli adds, with Webb is agreement, ""Federalism must be a bipartisan issue. Otherwise, it will continue to besubject to the inconsistent whims of elections.""Tosome extent, this opportunism is baked into American politics, argued Ernest A Young, then of the University of Texas at Austin School of Law, in a2004Brooklyn Law Reviewarticleabout attitudes towards federalism during the War on Terror. Hesawswitching preferences on central vs local power as inherent to asystem in which elections are won and lost, rotating factions through control of the federal government and localities. ""Federalism is about dividing power; nothing much depends on what the power in question is being used for,"" Young wrote. But ""[i]t is also about providing institutionalspace for a diversity of political views"" andso is inherently important beyond its utility to whoever lost the last federal election. State and local autonomy functions ""as a rallying point for political opposition to national policy"" and ""assures that a particular faction cannot become entrenched and unaccountable in power.""Or, as Webb put it in theDeseret News, ""On issues like gun control and the minimum wage, why not let Wyoming be Wyoming and New York be New York? Half of congressional dysfunction could be eliminated by modestly accepting the diversity of our country.""That political differences are coming into dangerous conflict is obvious not just from the formal contests observed by Pignanelli, Webb, and Young, but from the national tensions andstrife of recent years. Februarypolling by CBS News/YouGovfound that 57 percent of Republicans think of Democrats not as political opponents, but as ""enemies""; 41 percent of Democrats return thesentiment.""The country is increasinglysplit into camps that do not just disagree on policy and politics — theysee the other as alien, immoral, a threat,"" Nate CohncommentedinThe New York Timeslast month. It is not an unprecedented problem, he notes, and other countries that have divided into mutually loathing camps have kept the peace and held together through arrangements including ""power-sharing agreements, devolution or home rule.""Power-sharing, devolution, or home rulesounds a lot like federalism, come to think of it, and for good reason. Decentralization of power reduces the danger that people will resent top-down decisions that are contrary to their own preferences – and that may even be maliciously intended to hurt ""enemies"" in asectariansociety. If you believe that people of varied values and preferencesshould not be forced to live in lockstep, it makessense to embrace ""space for a diversity of political views"" and to largely ""let Wyoming be Wyoming and New York be New York.""But the federalism of the Constitution was designed for a nation of about4 million people; manystates and evensome counties are now more populous than the whole country was at the founding. Are you really allowing free range for diverse views by devolving control down to the level of aCaliforniaor aTexasthat each contain multitudessufficient to entertain many more conflicting ideas than the original USs could have contemplated? EvenLos Angeles County, with 10 million people, is far larger than the entire USs of 1790. At this point,realfederalism, through the devolution of power, requires more than paying lipservice to the existence ofstates and their ability toset independent policies. Decision-making has to go further down the food chain, at least to the county level, to revivesomething like the federalism of the Constitution. To the extent possible, powershould devolve to individuals whose right to make their own decisions and govern their own livesshould be respected. Individualself-rule is about as pure an expression of the distributed power embodied by federalism as you will find. Failing that, the major parties will continue to pretend that they care about federalism when they have lost control of Washington, DC, and discard their faith in the principle when they have regained a grip on the central political apparatus.

Yet there aresome things that Donald Trumpsays about his future intentions that the American public must take deadlyseriously — his refusal to confirm that he will abide by the results of an election that he is already calling rigged before asingle vote is cast and while he is doing everything in his power, including destroying the US Postal Service, tosuppress the ability of Democrats to vote against him. This unprecedented refusal to commit to an orderly transfer of power once the election results are confirmed was thesubject of a question posed to White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany today during a press briefing. McEnanay was asked to explain Trump’s comment earlier this week that “the only way he would lose this election was if this election was rigged” and whether there was “any circumstance under which he could lose the election fairly.”The Press Secretary’s answer was a perfect example of whyshe’s been dubbed “Kay-lie” by many observers who are amazed at her ability tospout misinformation and outright fa bul ism in her defense of the president. Actually, it’s difficult to fault the truthfulness of McEnany in the opening line of her response to the questionsinceshe couches it with the qualifier “The president believes” which could provide an excuse for a large multitude of delusional notions.“The president believes that he has done a great for the r American people and he believes that willshow in November,” the Press Secretary began her answer. “He believes that, uhh, that voter fraud is real, in line with what wesee all across the country, particularly wir th mail-in ballots which are prone to fraud,” McEnany concluded by repeating Trump’s false talking points. While this level of misinformation regarding phony claims of mail-in voter fraud is frightening, what McEnanaysaid in response to a follow-up questionshould result in many a lost night’ssleep for anyone who values our nation’s democratic principles. A reporter asked whether Trump’s claims — that the only way he will lose will be if the election is rigged — means that he won’t accept the election resultshe wins.“The president has alwayssaid he’llsee what happens and make a determination in the aftermath,” McEnany replied.“He wants a free election, a fair election, and he wants confidence in the results of the election, particularly when you havestates like Nevada doing mass mail out voting to their voting rules and when they tried this in the primary, it was a massive failure, ballots were piled up in trashcans, ballots were pinned to apartment dart boards, and with that being thesystem, the president wants to take a hard look at this and makesure these are fair election results and notsubject to fraud,” the Press Secretary replied, rapidly repeating her talking points with barely a breath between her words. McEnany’s regurgitation of Trump’sself-serving attempts at reducing the confidence in an absentee ballot practice that has functioned without major problems – with the exception ofRepublican-planned election fraud— for decades is a dire forecast for an era of post-election turmoil as the president is already preparing the nation for the monumental tantrum he will throw if his attempts atskewing the playing field through votersuppression and thesummoning of foreign interference do not yield the desired victory that he foolishly believes that he deserves.

The last couple of nights have been very intense, as I have been tear gassed andshot at with a projectile round while carrying 2 Nikon camerasshooting as fast as I can take pictures. I am 75, but when the adrenaline is pumping and you are running from the cops, my engine body is 35. It’s either that, or you fall flat on your face and inhale mass quantities of CS gas. If you are close to the cops, you never know what they will launch. In this article, I am including two photographs. The first photo was taken on July 18, 2020. I was very fortunate to get this image, becauseshortly after I took it, I got consumed by CS gas. That gas makes you very humble, as you just turn and get the hell out of thatspace. Shortly after that I got my eyes washed out by a medic. This picture, as you might recognize, is now a video that has gone viral with over nine million hits. The protester in the picture is a Navy vet, Christopher David, who is 53, and a graduate of the US Naval Academy. This was his first demonstration, and he made a huge introduction into the world of bearing witness. If you look at the picture closely, his right hand is trying to block the cop’s hand as the cop is hitting him with pepperspray, which you cansee. While this is going on, another cop his hitting Christopher David on the legs with a long baton. That cop also hit him in the hand and broke two bones. And, while this is all going on CS gas is everywhere. Seconds after I took this picture, this Navy vet turns the opposite direction and flips the cops off with both fingers. This is a remarkablestory, as this protesterstood his fucking ground. The bottom phot is an image I took on July 19, 2020. On this particular night, the cops chased us a couple of blocks. They thenstarted firing projectiles at us from a couple of different weapons, to include more tear gas. As you cansee in this picture, the cop on the far right has just fired a munition round. One roundset off a fire, which the protesters quickly put out. I took a few more pictures of the cops firing what they like to call less than lethal riot munitions. As the cops backed away from the intersection, one of them fired a round at me, as Isaw it coming and hurriedlystepped out of the way, as it missed me by a few feet. I can’t imagine taking a direct hit from one of these rounds, because it can kill you if it hits you in the head. This is exactly what almost happened to a 26-year-old man last week who was hit in the head by a projectile across thestreet from the Federal Justice Center. His name is Donavan La Bella. He was knocked unconscious, and you canstillsee his blood on thesidewalk. He wassent to the hospital where emergency reconstructivesurgery was performed. He willsurvive. It is hard to tell where thisstand-off with the police is going. The Feds don’t know this town,so they think they can control the tens of thousands of activists who live in Portland, Oregon, which George HW Bush labeled, ” Little Beirut.”The Feds are playing a chess game with Portland. If there is more overwhelming violence against protesters, and more people get injured, or possibly killed, the call fromsocial media will bring out 50 thousand people to thestreets. I have been around these black belt protesters a lot, they are fearless, and I mightsay, they have become professional. As John Lewis oncesaid: ” Find a way to get in the way.” His legacy is now in Portland, Oregon. I need to close, as John Lewis is calling me to prepare for another night.

501,The Nature of Money,-9.33,39.67,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/01/trumps-taxes-and-the-nature-of-money,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-23,25,"Even as the pandemic and financial crisis introduce us to new and grotesque ways tosuffer, itseems as if the rich have beenspared the worst of it. Their net worth has increased by$637,000,000,000while poor friends of mine beg for rent money onsocial media. It can feel as if there are two economies, one for us and another for the rich. This is wrong, however. There is only one economy. The difference between how the wealthy and the working classes experience thesame world is not just in the amount of money we have and what that can buy—it’s built into the nature of money, as I learned when I wasstudying to become an accountant. The first two classes in an accounting major outline a handful of extremely basic equations,standard forms (like the balancesheet and thestatement of cash flows), and the theoretical underpinnings of accounting. They are considered “washout” courses—onesso difficult asignificant number of people drop the major—and it’s not because of the math. Accounting requires no more than middleschool algebra. If you want to know why it’sso difficult, here is one of the very first thought problems I was presented with in one of my classes:There are multiple answers. For internal figures (called managerial accounting), the painting is worth whatever management would find most useful at any given time. How that’s done, and what figures are recorded there, is unregulated. On the other hand, when preparing numbers for people outside the company, thererules. For tax reporting purposes, the hospital (withsome exceptions) needs to have it assessed and recorded at fair market value. Fair market value is a different figure—usually a more conservative one—than what you’d expect the painting to fetch at auction. For the purpose of enticing investors orseeking a loan, there’s yet another answer: it depends on what the hospital plans to do with the painting in the near future. If they’re willing tosell it in the next year or two (especially to repay a debt) then theyshould report it at fair market value. But if they wouldn’t part with it under any circumstances, itshould be recorded at the price it was acquired for—a dollar. The painting is worth a lot of money, but if they’re not planning to make use of that value, then they can’t treat it as a resource. Tosummarize, there are two correct ways to record the value of the painting, either “fair market” or “acquisition” value (i.e. the original purchase price), and neither of them are what the painting would actually “be worth” in the conventionalsense. Which value the accountant chooses depends not on anything objective, but on what the business plans to do with the painting. This example breaks the kind of people who find an accounting major attractive. We’re creatures who love objectivity and order, and accounting is not that. The thought experiment about the painting isn’t a weird edge case—it’s a typical day on the job. I used to audit natural gas companies, and there are many whose distributionsystems are bringing in tens of millions of dollars a quarter, yet their infrastructure is worth $0. The first time Isaw a company claiming to literally be worthless, I brought it to my boss because Iswore it couldn’t be right. Hesaid, “depreciation,” and I toddled off back to my desk. We record the wear and tear infrastructure goes through as depreciation—weslowly reduce its value, in other words—and we do that in astandardized way. Usually this involves an evenly allocated reduction of value per year over the expected life of the asset—for example, if a new oil pipeline is expected to last 10 years, we mightsubtract 10 percent each year until it’s worth nothing. For other industries or assets, the rate of depreciation might be based on the number of units produced—the more widgets are made, the less the widgetstamping machine is worth. The different models are usedso we can compare companies apples-to-apples. We do this regardless of whether their infrastructure isstill functioning or not. This isn’t a mistake: it is the right way to record the value for the purpose of comparison to other companies and for taxes. But if I worked for thatsame company and wanted tosell it to a buyer, the considerations would be totally different. For example,depreciation for tax purposes is usually accelerated faster than actual wear and tear. A car with a 15 year life, for tax purposes, has to be depreciated over five years. This is the government encouraging companies to build and buy more for political reasons. Depreciation is an expense that is deducted from income to arrive at taxable profit, andso accelerating it is effectively a tax break—but one only companies that rapidly build and expand can reliably use. However, thatsame infrastructure, when being assessed forsale, is often worth more money than even its depreciated value. When buying orselling infrastructure, businesses take into account how much cash that infrastructure is generating regardless of its age. These differing considerations change the numbers on the page. Therefore, a business infrastructure’s value mayswing millions of dollars based on the market and the needs of a business. A 1992 Geo Metro’s value will not. That giant fluctuation is characteristic of assets which make money (like an oil pipeline or intellectual property) and assets whichstore value (like fine art orsome kinds of real estate). Thesame holds true for the portfolios of rich people. The wealthy who depend primarily on their assets tosustain them (rather than wages) will have many, many large assets, and their entire net worth willswing millions of dollarssimply based on their plans for the coming year. Accounting is less of ascience and more of a language with grammar, vocabulary, and ideological underpinnings. Recordingsomething with a number, especially one with decimal places, gives a falsesense of precision and objectivity to what is being quantified. Even in the “hardsciences,” which also use numbers with decimal places and high degrees of certainty, there is asubjectivity. A human being chooses what to count and what the criteria is for counting it for an intended audience. That influences what number makes it onto the page. Accounting as a field is perhaps more aware of thissubjectivity than most disciplines that work with numbers. Business accounting’s grammar isset by an organization called the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which regularly publishes guidance on how to present figures for public consumption. Thosestandards evolve as part of an ongoing process of polling the industry and holding open discussions, along with formal appeals. Inshort, accounting is an ever-evolving language that records the day-to-day workings of a life or a business. It is designed to describe the flow of assets, assess it, and make arguments about whatshould be done. It’s not objective because it can’t be. All I can do as an accountant is be clear about the purpose of why I am presentingspecific numbers, what assumptions I am making, whichset of accountingstandards I’m using, and how closely I hew to thosestandards. We knowshockingly little about the me ga rich. Lists like the Forbes 400 are the only available resources we have on who is wealthy because governments don’t really track individual wealth, and the wealthy themselves don’t advertise. The first Forbes 400 was an immense feat of journalism, digging through public property records in order to compile estimates. But roughly half of wealth is either privately held or in cash—not a matter of public record, andso unavailable to journalists. Even the public record is easy to evade. The rich routinely useshell corporations and trusts and elaborate tax evasionschemes. We gained asmall window into that complex web of financial entities the wealthy use to evade taxes through thePanama Papers. That leak, which comprised millions of documents, detailed many billions of dollars ofschemes (legal and not) from only one law firm. One estimatesays about 8 percent of the world’s wealth is in offshore tax havens, and 80 percent is untaxed. Because of thesheer complexity of where the wealthy keep their money and how it’s accounted for, it can be literally impossible for a rich person to quantify what they themselves are worth. The richest person on earth may have no idea they the richest person on earth. The wealthiersomeone is, the more the relationship between value and currency breaks down, andso the title “wealthiest person on earth” may actually be meaningless. On thescale we workers live, moneyseems very precise because itprecise. For young accountants, that’s the appeal. They come into adulthood withsome experience of money. A Coke costs $1.75. If they’ve ever filed taxes before arriving atschool, the accounting was verystraightforward. It was either correct or not correct, with an accuracy to the dollar. But all that lovely order and certainty falls apart outside the realm ofsmall personal finance. This precision in the micro and lack of it in the macro comes down to the function of money. The purpose of money is to establish an exchange rate between labor and finished goods. It allows capitalists—not us, we are not the primary “users” of the tool—to compare worker to worker, good to good, investment to investment, and translate between them. It does a pretty good job of describing the lives of wage earners because that’s what it’s designed to do. Our hours worked, productivity, and consumer habits are all numbers in aspreadsheet. But any attempt to turn it back on capitalists is like an amoeba trying to look at a human being with a microscope—the lens doesn’t go both ways. A poor person’s tax liability can be calculated to the cent. But when a wealthy person does their taxes, there are a number of arguments to be made about how much they own, how much they made, and how much they lost. Your net worth is a number. A capitalist’s worth is a conversation. That difference has material outcomes. Among the capitalist class, fraud is rampant. In 2001, Enron—an energy and commodities trading company from Texas—committed fraud onsuch a largescale (and more importantly,sound ermined the credibility of the entire industry’s figures) that it prompted a reform of accounting practices. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act greatly tightened thestandards on how figures must be reported outside of a company. The “language” of accounting became morestandardized. Financialstatements presented to investors must now be audited by independent, outside accountants. And while these reformsseem necessary given thestakes, I can’t find firm figures either way on whether they helped at all. I am not a fraud investigator myself, but as an auditor I was privy to howseveral fraud investigations turned out. Without exception, my experience is that whether law enforcement is called is a matter of how much money wasstolen. Petty theft is always prosecuted. But ifsomeone embezzles $10 million, a company tends to prefer to keep that person employed with them and treat it like a loan. Someone in a position tosteal that much money has connections. One white-collar criminal who comes to mind—I personally hadsome contact with him—was in a niche industry. He was a deal broker for commodities, and his customers would only deal with him. 10 million dollars is a lot of money, but in relation to his commission, it was not that much. His placement in the industry, his relationship to labor, was what made him wealthy, not merely the dollar amount of hissalary and his assets. He himself didn’t work to produce a product, or really provide aservice. He maintained aset of relationships with business owners (who also didn’t make anything with their own hands—they had employees for that) and acted as a gatekeeper of information about who needed what. Within the veryspecific parameters of his work, he was trusted. Of course his embezzlement wasn’t brought to the police. Focusing on the numbers rather thanseeing their movement as descriptive ofsomething, as pointing towards his relationships, is thesame kind of mistake a dog makes when you point at the moon and hesniffs your finger. This gets at whatDavid Graeberwas talking about when he outlined the origin of money in his book. Before the wide use of currency for everyday transactions (which only became common in the 1800s), poor workers relied on credit almost exclusively. Credit in thissense meant “trust.” People did not directly barter (e.g., eight eggs for oneshoe), they kept track of what they owed one another over time and paid as they could. These were relationships built on trust. Theswitch to currency-only transactions had to be imposed bystate force. For example, in the very early days of industrial capitalism in England,shipyards were routinely a year or two behind on wages,so workers took tools and food and other things they could barter to pay their rent and their grocery bills. This wasn’t asign of economic collapse—thiswasthe economy. In order to force aswitch to currency, the government criminal i zed taking tools and goods from theshipyards (previously it was not just legal, but precisely how compensation worked), and theshipyards instituted whippings for this now-theft. Samuel Bentham, an architect, redesignedship yards with a new centralsurveillance tower to curb this new kind of theft, an idea lifted by his brother, the architect Jeremy Bentham, for the now infamous prison panopticon. Before that, in medieval Europe, the legal penalties for defaulting on a debt were harsh and involved mutilation or death. However, they were almost never used. Debt was considered a private matter between two individuals, worked out between them in whatever units of barter and time framessuited them. As Graeber put it, capitalism is “thestory of how an economy of credit was converted into an economy of interest; of the gradual transformation of moral networks by the intrusion of the impersonal—and often vindictive—power of thestate.” Relationships have always been the fundamental underpinning of money: the thing money reflects for the wealthy and destroys for the poor. In a way, the wealthy frauds ter I met is a throwback to an older, kinder, more personal concept of money—one most of us will never experience. Today, prosecution rates for white collar crime are the lowest they’ve ever been and trending downwards. Theft itself becomes a conversation, rather than just a crime, when a wealthy person does it. When one capitalist robs another, my experience is that they tend to discuss among themselves how to restore the thief to goodstanding without destroying anyone’s life, livelihood, or privacy. There are of course exceptions. Bernie Madoff and his$50 billioninvestmentPonzischemesprings to mind. But Madoff’s position was dependent on resources and connections that turned out to be fictional. He had no realistic means to ever repay the investors hescam med (or even to return their initial investment), andso he went to prison. But for those that genuinely are well connected and do have the means to repay the people they rip off, the wealthy already have the restorative justice prison abolitionists fight for. Petty theft, on the other hand, is prosecuted mercilessly. I find this especiallystrange given how much more of a problem fraud is than theft. The FBI estimates that burglary and petty theft cost Americans about$3.4 billion in property losses. White collar crime costs between$426 billion and $1.7 trillion annually. This kleptocratic culture isn’t harmless. Enron was a natural gas company whose entire business was propped up by fraud. When they were no longer able to continue to hide the extent of their debt, they both crashed that industry andspurred massive reforms in accounting practices and fraud controls. Perhaps those reforms worked, but I doubt fraud has dropped at the rate fraud prosecution has. Personally, I wonder if the lesson companies learned was about keeping a lid onscandal rather than about curbing white collar crime. They preserve thesocial relations that money points to at risk to everyone else. And I guess it’s easy tosee why—itseems on thesurfaceshort-sighted to protect thieves who can crash an entire economy, but the frauds ters and their wealthy connections aren’t the ones whosuffer in a crash. Theystill have the power which underpins money, which their money merely gestures towards. The figures in aspreadsheet areshadows cast by power, and during financial crises their power preserves them. The wealthy areso completely insulated from the consequences of what they do, good or bad, it’s very hard for me to understand what motivates them at all. The future itself feels obscure. Here, the lack of imagination that makes me a good accountant makes me a poor visionary: I’m notsure what to do about money beyond believingsomethingshould be done. Depending on thestudy, betweeneightand26people own half of the world’s wealth, and if money isn’t a good means to describe them, then that is a failure to describe the world as it is. Marx advocated abolishing money, as dosome foundational anarchists. There are also thinkers on the left (likePierre-Joseph ProudhonandDavid Graeber) who believe public ownership of the means of production is more important than exactly how we account for it, andso are fine with markets and currency, albeit in forms that would be nigh unrecognizable. A fullsurvey of left thought on money and a weighing of the pros and cons of each approach is beyond thescope of asingle article. However, on the road to a bettersociety, we will have to grapple with money as it exists. As of now, it’s a tool used to describe workers with the goal of extracting wealth and labor from them. It is an incredibly poor tool for holding the wealthy accountable, andso we will have to come up with other methods.",1,1,Current Affairs
502,"After 2020 surge, Colorado gun sales continue at record pace in 2021",-1.67,44.67,https://www.denverpost.com/2021/07/10/colorado-gun-sales-2021/,https://adfontesmedia.com/denver-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"Coloradanssince last year have bought guns atsuch a rapid pace that gunstore ownersstruggled to keep theirshelvesstocked. Bristlecone Shooting, Training and Retail Center in Lakewood generally carriesseveral hundred guns at any time, but during the pandemic, theshop’sstocksometimes dropped to as few as 10, co-owner Jacquelyn Clarksaid. Thestore’ssupply of guns has improved, but it’sstill limiting how much ammunition people can buy.“There’s been a massive increase in demand at every level,” Clarksaid. More Coloradans than ever before bought guns last year and data from the first five months of 2021show the record pace of purchases continues. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation approved 487,097 gunsales in 2020 — a 45% increase over 2019 and the highest number ever recorded in thestate,data collected by the agencyshows. More gunsales were approved in 2020 than were recorded in 2000, 2001 and 2002 combined.“The manufacturers could not keep up with the demand,”said Chuck Lawson, a customerservice representative at Centennial Gun Club. “It was a number of factors that really changed everything. When COVID hit, people rushed out and bought toilet paper and guns. Then the riots hit, and people bought guns. Then there was the election, which are always good for gunsales.”In the first five months of 2021, CBI approved 205,918 gunsales. If that rate continues, this year’ssales will exceed those recorded in 2020. The pre-purchase background checks conducted by CBI and other law enforcement agencies do not necessarily equate to a gunsale, but academics and the firearms industry use the number of checks as a way to keep track of demand and firearmsales trendssince there is no centralized database of gunsales and ownership. Monthly datashows background checksspiked 59% month-over-month in March 2020 — thesame month Governor Jared Polis declared astate of emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic. The checks droppedslightly in the following months, but remained higher than pre-pandemic averages. Gunsales bumped up and down, but remained largely elevated, during the months following massive racial justice protests in many Colorado communities during thesummer of 2020, datashows. Sales ticked back up near their early-pandemic level in January 2021, the month President Joe Biden took office following the riot at the US Capitol that interrupted the certification of the election results. Many of the customers who came to Bristlecone Shooting in the last year were people who never owned a gun before and were looking to purchasesomething forself-defense, Clarksaid. People weresearching for a way to feelsafe as COVID-19spread across the US and upended normal life,shesaid.“We had people coming in every daysaying, ‘I’ve never held a gun in my life,'” Lawsonsaid. According to CBI data, about 57% of gunssold in Colorado last year were handguns, which are often peoples’ preferred type of firearm forself-defense. Wait times for CBI to complete the necessary background checks alsoskyrocketed during the pandemic. In 2019, the average wait time never exceeded 11 minutes, CBI datashows. In 2020, the maximum average wait time was 3 days and 23 hours. Demand for the classes required to obtain a concealed carry permit alsoskyrocketed, Clarksaid. Between March and December 2020,sign-ups for thesafety classes at Bristlecone Shooting were up about 300% compared to the year prior. That’s a good thing,shesaid, because people areseeking training on how to use guns assafely as possible.“You need to know how tosafely operate it and you need to know how tosafelystore it,” Clarksaid. Thesurge in gun purchases in Colorado is part of a national trend, federal datashows. TheNational Instant Criminal Background Check System in 2020processed 39.7 million firearm purchase background checks — the highest annual number ever recorded and a 40% increase from 2019. Like in Colorado,salesstarted tospike in March 2020. Phillip Levine, astatistics and economics professor at Wellesley College, pointed to an analysis published by the Brookings Institute that found3 million more guns weresold between March and July of 2020than would be expected if previous years’ trends held.“The primary driver of gunsales is uncertainty,” Levinesaid. “When Americans are uncertain about aspects of their lives, they turn to firearms.”Those uncertainties can take many forms. Gunsales oftenshoot up if there is talk of enacting new gun regulations andsometimes after massshootings — but generally only when those tragediesspur calls for more gun control and thereseems to be the political will to enact it, hesaid. Political uncertainty and the election of Democrats also fuelsales. Levine found that the rate ofsales instates did not correlate with COVID-19 death rates or increases in unemployment. It’s also impossible that 2020’s nationwidesurge in firearm purchases was fueled by people in cities where large racial justice protests took place after the murder of George Floyd, hesaid.“It’s not really localized, these responses. People are responding to the national mood,” Levinesaid. Clark and Lawson bothsaid thatsales havestarted toslow in the last month or two, just assupply chains are improving. Thestaff at Centennial Gun Club no longer has tospread out merchandise on theshelves to keep them from looking bare. But gunsales remain high. Two decades of CBI datashow that Coloradans continue to buy guns at a higher rate than they did at the beginning of the millennium. Colorado’s population grew from 4.1 million in 2000 to 5.8 million in 2020 and the per capita rate of gunsales has more than doubled in that time. In 2000, CBI approved 3.3 gunsales per 100 residents. In 2020, that number rose to 8.7sales per 100 people.",2,2,Denver Post

Afghanistan, which has alreadysuffered through four decades of wars and instability, is facing a humanitarian crisis of enormous proportions, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterressaid on Monday in his opening remarks to the high-level ministerial conference on Afghanistan. Speaking to the media after the conference in Geneva, Guterressaid the UN could not yet determine how much money had been pledged in response to its direct appeal for $606m and how much was promised tosupport other efforts or neighbouring countries. Al Jazeera’s Diplomatic Editor James Bays, reporting from Geneva,said that while the UN chief was “very pleased” with the response of the international community, he had warned the prospect of an economic collapse was a “serious possibility”. Guterressaid many Afghans could run out of food by the end of this month, while the World Food Programme (WFP)said 14 million people are on the brink ofstarvation. The Taliban was previously in power in Afghanistan from 1996 to the US-led invasion of 2001, which ended their hard line government based on astrict interpretation of Islamic law that proscribed almost all public activity for women and girls. Itswept back to power last month as the US-led NATO troops withdrew, with little to no resistance from the Western-backed government’s forces. But the Taliban is facing a major challenge as it has not been officially recognised by the international community, and Western countries and international financial organisationssuspended aid to Afghanistan, depriving it of billions of dollars needed to finance vital food imports. Guterres remarked to journalists on thesidelines that it would be “impossible” to provide humanitarian assistance inside Afghanistan without engaging with the Taliban.“I do believe it is very important to engage with the Taliban at the present moment for all aspects that concern the international community,” hesaid. Speaking to Al Jazeera in Geneva, UN humanitarian coordinator Martin Griffithssaid the UN wanted to makesure the money went directly to humanitarians on the ground who are deliveringservices to the Afghan people, calling thesituation “very dire”. Neighbours China and Pakistan have already offered help. Beijing last week promised$31m worth of food and healthsuppliesand, on Friday,said it wouldsend a first batch of three million coronavirus vaccines.

The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the conference Washington was providing nearly $64m in new humanitarian assistance for Afghanistan.“Let us commit today to meeting this urgent appeal for financialsupport, commit tostanding by humanitarian workers as they do their all-important work, and tostepping up humanitarian action in Afghanistanso we cansave the lives of Afghans in need,”shesaid. Meanwhile, Francesaid it will contribute 100 million euros ($118 million) to the UN’s flash appeal.“Half of the (Afghan) population is now at risk, including more than four million women and around 10 million children. It is our responsibility to be at theirside in this new ordeal,” Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told a high-level ministerial meeting in Geneva on Monday. Even before the Taliban’sseizure of Kabul last month, about half the Afghan population – or 18 million people – were dependent on aid. That figure looksset to increase due to drought andshortages of cash and food, UN officials and aid groups have warned. About a third of the $606m beingsought would be used by the WFP, which found that 93 percent of the 1,600 Afghans itsurveyed in August and September did not havesufficient food, mostly because they could not get access to cash to pay for it.“It’s now a race against time and thesnow to deliver life-saving assistance to the Afghan people who need it most,”said WFP Deputy Regional Director Anthea Webb.“We are quite literally begging and borrowing to avoid foodstocks running out.”The World Health Organization, another UN agency that is part of the appeal, isseeking toshore up hundreds of health facilities at risk of closure after donors backed out. Al Jazeera’s Charles Stratford, reporting from Kabul,said thesituation at health clinics in the country was “completelyshocking”.“We visited a few days ago a rural clinic just outside of Kabul that had a number of women who were expecting to give birth any day.

506,Supreme Court is Interesting New Math: 3-3-3,0.0,40.33,https://www.newser.com/story/307565/supreme-courts-interesting-new-math-3-3-3.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/newser-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-18,24,"When Amy Coney BarrettreplacedRuth Bader Ginsburg on the Supreme Court last year, it resulted in what is usually described as a 6-3 advantage for conservatives over liberals on the court. But two big decisions Thursday—one on ObamaCareand the other on a Catholic group that refuses to work with gay couples—suggest that a different kind of breakdown is happening on the court. Coverage:In an analysis atCNN, Joan Biskupic writes that 3-3-3seems to be the new pattern. One trio is the ""center-right"" of Chief Justice John Roberts, Brett Kavanaugh, and Barrett. Another trio is made up of liberals Stephen Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor, and Elena Kagan. And the last is made up of conservatives Clarence Thomas, Samuel Alito, and Neil Gorsuch. In Thursday is rulings, the three liberals joined the center-right (as did Clarence Thomas) in the ruling that dismissed a challenge to ObamaCare. And though the courtsided with the Catholic group in the other case, the protection offered was limited, and the decision went nowhere near as far as the more conservative justices wanted. AtPolitico, Josh Gerstein notes that the three more conservative justices, particularly Alito, issuedsharply worded critiquesseemingly aimed at the other GOP appointees. ""Some liberal legal commentators noted that the most carefully dissected rhetoricalsparring is now taking place among members of the newsix-justice conservative majority, with the three remaining liberal justices often left as merespectators,"" Gerstein writes. Alito, for instance, wrote in the Affordable Care Act case that ""no one can fail to be impressed by the lengths to which this Court has been willing to go to defend the ACA against all threats."" And in the other case, which involved a foster care agency in Philadelphia, he complained that the court ""has emitted a wisp of a decision that leaves religious liberty in a confused and vulnerablestate."" As South Texas College of Law Professor Josh Blackman puts it to Politico: ""I think Alito was just pissed.""The outcomes of Thursday is cases ""mean the court potentially will close out Justice Amy Coney Barrett is first term with no watershed conservative victories,"" writes Greg Stohr atBloomberg. ""Although the courtstill has 15 remaining cases, including a clash over the Voting Rights Act, the term is themeso far has been more incrementalism than revolution."" Stohr notes, however, that a truer test might come in the fall, when Roberts hasscheduled an abortion case with the potential to dismantle Roe vs Wade. Matt Ford at the digs more into the Philadelphia decision andsums up the narrow outcome: The court ""isstillstrongly inclined to favor litigants who bring religious freedom claims before it, and has handed down aseries of major rulings in their favor in recent years,"" he writes. But ""the justices appear unwilling to rule conclusively that religious beliefs can overcome anti-discrimination laws that protect gay and transgender Americans in all cases—at least for now.""(Did former President Trumpinadvertentlysave ObamaCare?)",1,1,Newser
507,"Even with a Ceasefire, Israel Must Face a Changed Reality",-1.33,44.67,https://www.newyorker.com/news/daily-comment/even-with-a-ceasefire-israel-must-face-a-changed-reality,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-yorker-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-21,25,"The cease fire between Hamas and Israel went into effect at 2local time on Friday, andseems to be holding. Israelis woke up to their military claiming to have “achieved all our operational goals.” Many Gazans, in turn, celebrated in thestreets through the night—among them Khalil al-Hayya, a leader of Hamas’sslate in the now essentially cancelled Palestinian parliamentary elections, whose home in Gaza City was bombed. “This is the euphoria of victory,” hesaid. Theviolencelasted eleven days, long enough for the Israeli military to give its operation a name, Guardian of the Walls, though its briefings to the media have mainly been about tunnels. Hamas has built a web of them, many dozens of miles long, under Gaza’s cities; the defense establishment commonly refers to them, with perverse respect, as the Metro. Israel has mapped them, owing to “very high-quality intelligence”—so the leader of the Southern Command, Eliezer Toledano, told television reporters, last Sunday evening. By Tuesday morning, a militaryspokesman had claimed that the Air Force had bombed nine launchsites, includingsome in the tunnels, destroyingsixty-five weapons launchers. It even bombed parts not immediately involved in the current action, Toledano added, just tosend a message to the Hamas military leaders Yahya Sinwar and Mohammad Deif—themselves now targets—that the tunnels are a “death trap.” Before the ceasefire, the Israeli military claimed to have destroyed more than a hundred kilometres—sixty-two miles—of the tunnels, which is, notionally, the main goal “achieved.”Some buildings above the tunnels also became death traps. The Jerusalemreports that the military claims to have destroyed buildings containing “10 government offices, 11 internalsecurity targets, and five banks that manage terror funds.” The Gaza Health Ministry reports that at least two hundred and forty Palestinians, includingsixty-six children, have been killed; the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports thatseventy-five thousand people have been displaced or made homeless. Israeli governmentspokesmen, in contrast,say that two hundred and twenty-five militants have been killed, including twenty-fivesenior commanders—numbers that, for obvious reasons, do not quite match up. By midweek, Israel’sstrategic logicseemed to have been reduced to destroying more tunnels and, collaterally, what was around them, including vital infrastructuresuch as the water and powersupply; and destroying alleged command centers in multistory buildings—including, now famously, the Gaza headquarters of the Associated Press and Al Jazeera. By Friday morning, more than four thousand rockets had been launched toward Israeli cities, especially Ashkelon, on the coast; many of the rockets got through the Iron Dome anti-missileshield. Thirteen people were killed in Israel, including two Thai workers; among the Israeli victims were an Arab father and hissixteen-year-old daughter, in the city of Lod. The mayhem is Hamas’s fault, Israeli officialssay, as they often do, because Hamas attacks Israeli civilians and hides behind civilians in Gaza. (TheNetanyahu government is clearly more comfortable briefing diplomats and reporters about rockets and tunnels than aboutsettlers enforcing evictions inSheikh Jarrahand Israeli police officers harassing Palestinians during Ramadan—actions whichsparked disturbances the previous week.) The point of Israel’s operationseems to have been new entries in a grotesque ledger,shared with Hamas, whose bottom line is “deterrence,” a morestrategic-sounding word than “intimidation.” “No question,” Channel 12’s military correspondent, Roni Daniel,said, “the longer this fighting lasts, the more direct hits—this will push the next round further off into the future.” By Thursday, talk of deterrence wassuperseded by President Joe Biden’s demand for de-escalation, and the imminence of a ceasefire. So military analysts beganspeaking instead of an anticipated final flurry of Hamas rockets, and final Israeli bombing runs, expecting eachside to try for,asput it, an “image of victory.” In the end, thankfully, bothsidessatisfied themselves with the images that they already had. It is an indication of howstalesuch tit-for-tat rhetoric has become that asegment by the comedian John Oliver, mocking the phrase, has gone viral, even in Israel. The Israeli military’s claims fall especially flat, hesaid, because Israel has an enormous power advantage—which has yielded the disproportionate number of deaths. (That’s true, though of course it does not exonerate Hamas.) Oliver further argued that the Gazan civilians who are paying that price have no collective power over what Hamas does. He might have added that, as many Israelis havesuggested, if Gazans did havesuch power, the Israeli government might have prompted them to exert it by,say, distributing-19 vaccines, or offering to rehabilitate the powerstation, rather than conducting airstrikes. But the military’s rhetoric has grownstale in Israel for a quite different reason. This latest escalation has given Israel a glimpse of a widening potential threat thatBenjamin Netanyahuand his military, whatever theirspecific contingency plans, have not prepared the public for: emboldened defiance, from the West Bank to the Lebanon front, and from thestreets of Lod to Washington, DC Palestinian euphoria derives from justified Israeli anxiety. A potentialsequence of resulting eventsseems all too obvious now. Thesuffering in Gaza mightspark protests in the occupied territories including East Jerusalem, or vice versa; Israeli responses tosuch protests could provoke accelerating violence, much like what happened with the al-Aqsa intifada, which Ariel Sharon provoked, in 2000, and which led to the deaths of three thousand Palestinians and a thousand Israelis. (On Friday afternoon, just hours after the ceasefire, tens of thousands of Palestinians took part in afternoon prayers at al-Aqsa,some waving Palestinian flags; by the end of the afternoon, there were fresh confrontations with Israeli police.) Such violence could cause further unrest in Israel, which, during the past week, has experiencedstreet fighting between its Arab and Jewish citizens. That, in turn, could well incite Palestinians in Jordan, who are ambivalent about the Hashemite monarchy’s legitimacy and impatient with its peace treaty with Israel. The chaos would almost certainly mobilize Iranian-backed Hezbollah cadres in Lebanon, who haveseen the damage that volleys of rockets can do. Netanyahu, or any right-wingsuccessor, would be hard-pressed to countersuch a changed landscape, on multiple fronts, without America’s backing. But a growing number of Palestiniansupporters in the USs (and particularly in the progressive wing of the Democratic Party) would argue that the Prime Minister and his decade-long Likud dominance in the Knesset brought the catastrophe on themselves. And they would not be wrong. Hamas drove the Fatah leaders of the Palestinian Authority from Gaza, in 2007. When Netanyahu took office for thesecond time, two years later, he dissociated himself from the progress that his predecessor Ehud Olmert had made with the Palestinian President, Mahmoud Abbas, within thescope of the Oslo peace process. Netanyahu redoubled the government’s commitment tosettlements and an exclusive claim to Jerusalem, implying that Palestiniansovereignty could be endlessly deferred, and Greater Israel persistently built, as long as the Palestinian leadership was riven. Itserved Netanyahu’s interests to keep Palestine divided; indeed, he instigated the last round of attacks on Hamas in Gaza, in July, 2014, in part to foil the unity agreement that Abbas and Hamas’s Ismail Haniyeh had implemented that June. In 2015, the Knesset member Bezalel Smotrich, asettler zealot and Netanyahu ally, put it bluntly: “In the international arena, in the game of delegitimization,” hesaid, “the Palestinian Authority is a liability, and Hamas is an asset.” The challenge was to keep Hamas bothsolvent and in check: the former by allowing Qatar tosubsidize the organization, the latter by periodically attacking it—like “mowing the lawn,” assome in the military grimly put it. This all nowseems desperately outpaced by events. To think that pure force and “very high-quality intelligence” could preserve thestatus quo is to engage in, well, tunnel vision. The Hamas leadership isstaying put in Gaza, in part because Israel has nostomach for a full-scale invasion to remove it. Major General Yitzhak Brick, the former Army ombudsman, warned, in 2018, that the military might not have the ground capability, either, given how much it had invested in technology and airpower. In any case, an invasion would risk a high civilian death toll, just as the airstrikes have done. Itsuddenlyseems clear that Hamas can, at will, threaten to heat up Israel’s borders and roil its cities bysending another rocket in the direction of Jerusalem. Some asset. In the West Bank, Palestinians currently have no reliable political process by which to give their leaders legitimacy. Recent pollsshow that increasing numbers of young people are willing to endorse armedstruggle. “The real failure here is Abbas’s inability to unify and rejuvenate the Palestinian politicalsystem,” Sam Bahour, a management consultant and activist in Ramallah, told me. In the lead-up to the most recent violence, Hamas, for its part, had “failed in their governance of Gaza, and their problems were mounting.” It was “poised to be legitimized” by participating in parliamentary and Presidential elections, and when Abbas called off elections that had beenscheduled for this month, “the rug was pulled out” from under them. By resorting to violence, Hamas could “remain relevant.” But Abbas’ssupporters and Fatah-aligned militants are nowstruggling to remainso as well. Thousands of mainly young peoplespontaneously demonstrated at Israeli checkpoints. Eleven were killed bysecurity forces last Friday, and hundreds have been injured. Abbas mobilized the Palestinian Authority’ssecurity forces to maintain order in the West Bank. What if, next time, he does not?This may allseem far removed from Hezbollah, in Lebanon. But, last Saturday, Haniyeh, who isstill the Hamas chairman, made aspeech to a crowd in Qatar, depicting Hamas as the defender of Jerusalem. Thesame day, he was on the phone with Esmail Ghaani, the military head of Iran’sQuds Force, on which Hezbollah depends. Hamas rockets, Ghaani reportedlysaid, are a “unique andsuccessful answer” to Israel. Hezbollah, for its part, is reported to have more than a hundred thousand rockets—andseveral thousand medium-range andseveral hundred long-range missiles with guidancesystems. Then there is thesituation in Israel itself. The violence and destruction in the cities have been widely reported. Hundreds of rioters have been arrested. On Tuesday, Israel’s Arab Higher Monitoring Committee, which coördinates Arab civil-society organizations in the country, called a generalstrike, which was also honored in the West Bank. Mudar Younis, the chairman of the Committee of Arab Local Council Heads, told that more than half of Arab-Israelis participated. The Israel Builders Associationsaid that only a hundred and fifty out ofsixty-five thousand Palestinian construction workers went to work. Large parts of the privatesector, from retail to tourism, could be paralyzed by actions of this type, and many employers would likely not countenance dependency on Arab employees, exacerbating the polarization. None of this denies that, in Israel’s mainly Hebrew-speaking civilsociety, much of the Arab community issuccessfully integrated. Arabs make up perhaps a fifth of Israel’s population, but, according to the Central Bureau of Statistics, just under a fifth of the country’s doctors, a quarter of its nurses, and half of its pharmacists, are Arab. Sixteen per cent of undergraduate collegestudents are Arab; at Haifa University they make up forty per cent. Thesixteen-year-old girl killed by a rocket in Lod was astudent at the ORT High School, part of the experimental “Tovanot” chain of highschools, funded and ment ored by Israeli Jewish entrepreneurs, organized by the veteran investor Yossi Vardi. For the first time in the country’s history, Arab political parties are negotiating for key roles in governing coalitions. And yet Netanyahu’s neo-Zionist revanchists, wedded to theocratic forces in the Rabbinate and the Knesset, have been openly pushing Arabs and other non-Jews to the margins. Thenation-state law, framing Israel as thestate of the Jewish people alone, and calculated to counter the legal right to equality, has enraged even the Druze community, whichserves in the military. The Arab poverty rate in Israel is four times higher than the Jewish poverty rate. A recentstudy by Nasreen Haddad Haj-Yahya, a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute, and Merav Shaviv, a former research fellow at the Harvard Kennedy School,shows that nearly thirty per cent of Israeli-Arab males between nineteen and twenty-four—some thirty thousand young men—are neither inschool nor employed. These youth are often implicated in gang warfare, which the Israeli police have done little to address. Thespontaneous attacks on Jews in or near Arab towns—including Umm al-Fahm, which protested en masse against police neglect in March—are hard to explain without understanding how youth violence may be channelled into anti-Israel rage. And there aresimilar militant Jewish youth gangs. An Israeli monitoring group, FakeReporter, has identifiedsome twenty thousand Jewish extremists usingsocial media to organize attacks, and another eighty thousand far-rightists fomenting anti-Arabsentiment on Telegram and WhatsApp. In my neighborhood in Jerusalem, the words “Under Jewish Management” havesuddenly appeared on the local hummusshop, presumably tostave off attacks from those gangs. Thesituation, inshort, is fluid, agitated, and reminiscent of the atmosphere after the 1973 war, when, inspite of a putative Israeli victory, the idea that military force was all the foreign policy Israel needed—and that the Palestinian question would wait—wassuddenly revealed to Israelis as delusional and arrogant. Before that war, the governmentspoke not of deterrence but of “security borders,” which neighboring Arabstates, it claimed, wouldn’t dare attack. They did. Now, as then, there is a growingsense that Israel cannot come out of this crisis thesame country it was when it went into it. On the right, there is more bravado: calls to disarm Gaza, and tosuppress Israeli Arabs as a fifth column. On the left, which has found renewed energy, there are calls for reëngagement with the Palestinian question, and, correspondingly, for democratic norms that are vital enough to resist theocracy and to lessen anti-Arab discrimination. Allsides aresuddenly turning to the Biden Administration, which must realize, despite an understandable desire tostay out of the region, that cannot elide the Palestinian question—that, in fact, as in 1973, thesudden blow to Israeli certainties creates diplomatic opportunities. Netanyahu, whose tenure may well be extended by the violence, is hardly the leader to inaugurate the necessary changes. Yair Lapid, the centrist leader who isstill trying to form a government to replace the Prime Minister, has called the escalation before this violence “convenient” for Netanyahu. Biden, in any case, need not wait for either. A ceasefire, and a renewed peace process, may yet advance a Palestinianstate andsave Israel from the worst. The next round, or the next, will almost certainly invite it.",2,1,The New Yorker

513,"Early Voting Begins in the Georgia Runoffs Today, With Control of the US Senate at Stake",-9.33,45.0,https://www.vogue.com/article/ossoff-warnock-early-voting-georgia-senate-runoffs,https://adfontesmedia.com/vogue-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-14,23,"Today, as Georgians begin early voting in two races that will determine which party controls the US Senate for the nextsix years, Democratic candidates Jon Ossoff and Reverend Raphael Warnock are taking to the road,spreading the message that their opponents are unfit to hold office. Ossoff and Warnock, both of whom are trying to unseat incumbent Republicans, have been conducting a largely joint campaign that mixes in-person and virtual events (the latter featuring guest appearances bysuch notable figures ast he comedian Leslie Jonesand former president Barack Obama) as they try to win astate that hasn’t elected a Democraticsenatorsince 1996. But history—and the changing demographics of Georgia—may be in their favor: Joe Biden won thestate in the presidential election, the first Democrat to dososince Bill Clinton in 1992. (President-elect Biden will join the two candidates at a campaign rally in the Atlanta metro area on Tuesday.)And the twosenators they are facing, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler—Perdueseeking hissecond term, Loeffler her first full one—may well be vulnerable. Both have facedscrutiny over questionablestock transactions that may have benefited from inside information the two received at Senate briefings. It’s an idea that both Ossoff and Warnock have leaned into on the campaign trail—bestowing on Loeffler and Perdue the catchy nickname “the Bonnie and Clyde of Political Corruption”—and one that Ossoff has been particularly enthusiastic about in his messaging, mostly on his very active Twitter account:This content can also be viewed on thesite itoriginatesfrom. This content can also be viewed on thesite itoriginatesfrom. Ossoff went for the jugular in his first debate, held before the November 3 election, as he attacked a visibility uncomfortable Perdue for failing to aggressively respond to the health and financial crises that Georgians havesuffered because of the coronavirus. “Perhaps Senator Perdue would have been able to respond properly to the COVID-19 pandemic if you hadn’t been fending off multiple federal investigations for insider trading,”Ossoffsaid. “It’s not just that you’re a crook, Senator. It’s that you’re attacking the health of the people that you represent. You didsay COVID-19 was no deadlier than the flu. You didsay there would be nosignificant up tick in cases. All the while, you were looking after your own assets and your own portfolio.”That exchange might have been the reason Perdueskipped the runoff debate on December 6, leading to theslightlysurrealscene of Ossoffconfronting an empty podium across thestage. At the debate, Ossoff called Perdue a “coward” andslammed him for notshowing up. “Itshows an astonishing arrogance andsense of entitlement for Georgia’ssenior USsenator to believe heshouldn’t have to debate at a moment like this in our history,” Ossoffsaid, gesturing toward the empty podium. “Yoursenator is refusing to answer questions and debate his opponent because he believes heshouldn’t have to. He believes this Senateseat belongs to him. This Senateseat belongs to the people.” (On thatsame day, Warnock and Loeffler held their own debate, an exchange mostly notable for the number of times that Loefflerrefused to acknowledge that Joe Biden was the president-elect.)ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesThis content can also be viewed on thesite itoriginatesfrom. Ossoff also hammered away at Perdue in his Instagram Live conversation with Leslie Jones, telling her that his opponent “has been treating his Senate office like an E-Trade account.”Democratic PACs, including one associated with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, are pouring millions of dollars into this race, investing in commercials and campaign literature thatstress the theme that Perdue and Loeffler are ethically compromised. “We plan to fully expose their unethical and potentially illegal behavior in the weeks ahead,” JB Poersch, president of Senate Majority PAC,recently told Politico. “Georgianssimply can’t trust David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler when they’re knee-deep in theswamp and profiting at their expense.”If Ossoff and Warnock win, the Senate will besplit 50-50, with Vice President–elect Kamala Harris having the power to cast the deciding vote. If Perdue and Loeffler win, the Republicans will hold aslim 52-48 majority, made even more precarious by the possibility that one or moresenators will bestruck by COVID in the coming months, rendering them unavailable for floor votes. (At least ahalf-dozen Republicansenatorshave already tested positive for the coronavirus in the past few months, including Loeffler herself.)ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesOne wild card in the race is Donald Trump. When the president isn’t pursuing yet another hopeless challenge to the presidential election, he is attacking Georgia’s elected officials, including the governor andsecretary ofstate (both Republicans, by the way), for helping Joe Biden’s campaign “steal” the race. At a campaign rally in Valdosta, Georgia, nominally held to help get out the vote for Perdue and Loeffler—both of whom Trump casually called up onstage and then ushered off a few minutes later—Trumpspent most of the hour and a half bemoaning his loss.“They cheated and rigged our presidential election, but we’llstill win,” Trump told a crowd of about 10,000supporters, many of whom chanted, “Stop thesteal!” And he renewed his attacks on Governor Brian Kemp, who had run as a Trump-faithful candidate just two years ago. “Your governor couldstop it very easily if he knew what the hell he was doing,” the presidentsaid. Some Republicans fear that Trump’s relentless attacks on the votingsystem could depress voter turnout between now and January 5. “You can’tsay thesystem is rigged but elect these twosenators,” Eric Johnson, a campaign adviser to Kelly Loeffler and a former Republican leader of the Georgia Senate,recently told the. “Atsome point he either drops it or hesays I want everybody to vote and get their friends to voteso that the margins areso large that they can’tsteal it.”Today, as part of his Health, Jobs, and Justice Bus Tour, Ossoff will lead a march to the polls in the town of Duluth and later attend an outdoor campaign event in Atlanta alongside Reverend Warnock. If the Democrats are to win, turnout is key, particularly in counties like Fulton and Gwinnett, in the greater Atlanta area, which we rekey to Biden’s razor-thin victory in thestate. Thatsurge of newly Democratic votes is largely attributable to the efforts of Stacey Abrams, who, after narrowly losing the 2018 governor’s race to Kemp, hasspent the last two years focusing on ballot access and voter registration, particularly in the Black community. Abrams has built a network of organizations, includingNew Georgia ProjectandFair Fight, that highlighted past votersuppression in thestate and have helped register an estimated 800,000 new voters in Georgia. ByVeronica CristinoByHannah CoatesThere was astrong turnout of early voters on a rainy Monday morning, withCNN reporting that in Marietta, part of the key Democraticstronghold ofsuburban Atlanta, lines of voters began forming beforesunrise and “people wrapped themselves in blankets, carried umbrellas, and huddled under lawn chairs.”Afterspeaking to a crowd of labor union canvassers on Friday,Warnocksaid early turnout would be key to the race:“It’s how we won in the general and it’s how we’re going to win in the runoff.”",2,1,Vogue

Ryan made his remarks during a Thursday evening address at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. He was critical of both Republicans and Democrats, though hesaved hissharpest barbs for Trump, who is by most measures the leader of the modern-day Republican Party.“It was horrifying tosee a presidency come tosuch a dishonorable and disgraceful end,” Ryansaid, referring to the deadly attack on the US Capitol that Trump inspired on January 6.“Once again, we conservatives find ourselves at a crossroads,” Ryan continued. “And here’s the reality that we have to face: If the conservative cause depends on the populist appeal of one personality, or onsecond-rate imitations, then we’re not going anywhere. Voters looking for Republican leaders want tosee independence and mettle. They will not be impressed by thesight of yes-men and flatterers flocking to Mar-a-Lago.”It’s unclear how much impact Ryan’s words will have in the broader fight for the future of the GOP, if any. Ryan, the 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee, was among the most respected Republicans in the nation’s capital before Trump’s rise, but two years out of office, his open contempt for Trump is not in line with the vast majority of Republican voters and elected officials. A tiny but growing group of anti-Trump Republicans hasstruggled tosteer the party in a new direction, even as Trump continues to promote thesame false claims — that he would have won the 2020 election if not for mass voter fraud — that inspired the Capitol insurrection. At thesame time, Trump is openly contemplating another presidential run in 2024. One of Trump’s most vocal allies on Capitol Hill, Rep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., lashed out at Ryan on Twitter ahead of thespeech.“It really is amazing that Paul Ryan, who is the reason the GOP lost the House in 2018, is going to come out today and blame Trump for the problems in the GOP,”shesaid, adding ashot at another Trump critic, Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo. “Paul, the problem is you and your pal Liz.”Ryanspoke Thursday as the openingspeaker for the Reagan library’s “Time for Choosing”series, which will later feature 2024 Republican presidential prospectssuch as former Vice President Mike Pence, former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Those close to Ryan, 51, do not expect him to run for public office again, but theysuggest he is paying close attention and remains concerned about the future of the party.

He lamented the GOP’s interest in culture wars and “identity politics” at the expense of conservative principles.“Culture matters, absolutely yes, but our party must be defined by more than a tussle over the latest grievance or perceivedslight,” hesaid. “We must not let them take priority oversolutions — grounded in principle — to improve people’s lives.”The Republican Party has an opportunity to win elections and address critical policy challenges, as long as they don’t get in their own way, Ryan continued.“If we fail this test, it will be because the progressive left will have won by default,” hesaid. “It will be because the conservative cause ... lost its way and followed the left into the trap of identity politics, defining itself by resentments instead of by ideals. It will be because we mistake reactionaryskirmishes in the culture wars with a coherent agenda. It will be because we gave too much allegiance to one passing political figure and weren’t loyal enough to our principles.”By STEVE PEOPLES, AP National Political Writer",2,2,Tampa Bay Times

518,"TikTok banned: 6 ways the app is countering US scrutiny, Trump is ban threat",-5.0,43.67,https://fortune.com/2020/07/22/tiktok-us-ban-counter/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fortune-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-22,25,"The Trump administration is considering banning TikTok, the wildly popularshort video platform, over nationalsecurity concerns and TikTok’s alleged vulnerability to Chinese government censorship and datasharing. TikTok, which is owned by Beijing-based tech firm ByteDance Ltd. and has 30 million monthly active users in the US, has denied US claims about itssusceptibility to Chinese government influence. But President Donald Trump’s targeting of the app has only increasedsince he mentioned a potential ban earlier this month; new Trump campaign ads on Facebookthis week claimed, “TikTok isspying on you.”TikTok did not immediately respond to a request for comment for thisstory. Growing politicalscrutiny of TikTok in 2019 had already prompted the app to increase transparency, distance itself from ByteDance, and deny claims that itshares user data with Beijing or complies with its censorship requests. Scrutiny of the app has only accelerated in recent weeks with India’s TikTok ban in late June and the US’ssubsequent threat of a ban. TikTok no doubt has become aflashpointfor the West’s disputes with China. In response, the app has takensix actions thatseem aimed at underscoring its commitment to the US and proving its operational independence from its Chinese parent—and from China’s government:At thestart of 2020, TikTok had 500 full-timestaff in the US; that number hassince increased to 1,400. On Tuesday, TikToksaidit plans to hire 10,000 employees for “good-paying jobs” in the US over the next three years, a long-term commitment to the market that could foster good will in Washington. TikTok has offices in New York City, Silicon Valley, and Los Angeles. Asharp increase instaff isn’t the only way TikTok is expanding its US presence. The company has hired more than35 lobbyists to advocate on its behalf in Washington to persuade lawmakers that it’s committed to US regulations and not beholden to the Chinese government. TikTok had no lobbying presence in Washington a year ago,accordingto theTikTok has made othersignals of commitment to the US market. In March, the companysai dit wassetting up a “transparency center” in its Los Angeles office to “provide outside experts an opportunity to directly view how our teams at TikTok go about the day-to-day challenging, but critically important, work of moderating content on the platform.”Even before the threat of a US ban, the company came under fire for allegedly censoring content deemed politicallysensitive to the Chinese government, a charge TikTok denies. TikTok blocked and then unblocked one US user who posted a video criticizing China’s government for its treatment of Uighur ethnic minority people. The companysaid a “human moderation error” caused the removal of the video. TikTok has made moves to localize its US business andshow the international market that it’sseparate from its China-based parent company. In May it hired former Disney executive Kevin Mayer, who is American, to run TikTok. (Mayer holds dual roles as TikTok’s CEO and ByteDance’s chief operating officer.) TikTok has pointed to Mayer’s US roots when asked about the Chinese government data-sharing allegations.“TikTok is led by an American CEO, with hundreds of employees and key leaders acrosssafety,security, product, and public policy in the US,” a companyspokespersontoldCNBC in July. TikTok also taken cues from US-based Internet giants in responding to political issues related to Beijing. After the Chinese government enacted a controversial nationalsecurity law in Hong Kong,Google,Facebook,Twitter, and others announced they were haltingsome operations in the region while they reviewed the law, which grants Hong Kong authorities far-reaching power over Internet data. TikTok went further,announcingon July 6 that “in light of recent events,” it was withdrawing from Hong Kong entirely. The company didn’t directly name the nationalsecurity law, but analystssay the decision to pull out of Hong Kong was a direct response to the law and an effort by TikTok to illustrate its distance from Beijing and willingness to take issue with Chinese government data controls. Some US-based ByteDance investors are in talks with ByteDance management to buy a majoritystake in TikTok, The Informationreportedon Tuesday. Such asale would make TikTok majority-owned by USshareholders rather than by Beijing-based ByteDance, and potentially could convince US lawmakers that a ban of TikTok isn’t necessary. Larry Kudlow, a White House economic adviser,said last week that a TikTokspinoff from ByteDance would be better than a ban on the popular app.“I think TikTok is going to pull out of the holding company, which is China-run, and operate as an independent American company,” Kudlowsaid,declining to comment on whether US companies could acquire TikTok. Even before the Trump administration publicly leveled the threat of the TikTok ban, the app was looking beyond the US market and its tens of millions of American users. In November, when US lawmakers escalated theirscrutiny of TikTok, ByteDance founder and CEO Zhang Yimingsaidin an internalstaff note that the company needed to “diversify TikTok’s growth,” “increase investment in weaker markets,” and improve itsskill in “handling global public affairs,” withoutspecifically mentioning US pressure. The number of countries where TikTok is facing pressure has grown this year. Outside of the US, TikTok was banned in India last month, andsome politicians have called for bans in Australia and the UK TikTok has been mulling a global HQoutside of Chinasince late last year to distance itself from its Chinese owner, and it’s reportedlystillconsideringLondon—its existing hub in Europe—as a base. The ongoing UK-China feud, whichsaw the UK recently ban Chinese tele coms equipment maker Huawei from its 5G rollout, had cast doubt on whether TikTok would continue its UK expansion plans.“It’s very clear that ByteDance [is] trying to do as much as [it] can to make TikTok aseparate company that operates globally, thinks globally, and does not think and act like a Chinese company,” Dev Lewis, a fellow at Hong Kong–based research think tank Digital Asia Hub, told earlier this month. Whether its effortssucceed remains to beseensince, as Lewissaid, “TikTok will always be caught in the middle” of China’s geopolitical disputes.",1,2,Fortune

This has a double meaning: The death of faith, perse, in America. And the death of “faith in America.”You couldsay the death of religion and westill have religion, but do westill have faith?I will talk about the differences between faith and religion, glimpses of God in things wesee and do. I will talk about how Christianityseems to be dying while Islam is growing. I will discuss the crucifixion and what Christ means if you are not a Christian. I will talk about my early days, my travels to the South Pacific islands collecting medicinal plants, and how they had a deeper meaning than I may have known at the time. I discussedspirituality with the indigenous peoples of the South Pacific islands. All good religions teach “Do unto others, as you would have them do unto you.” There is not a religion on earth that does not teach that except one. The Jewish religion is the hardest to follow because it is complicated. I will discuss the meaning of the garden of Eden, and the land of nod. And I will tell you how religion and faith connects you to the power of the universe. Let me begin with this. We now have churches in America, let is call them the “United churches of the woke.”A friend of mine wrote andsaid, ""Michael, churches will not be destroyed or repurposed under the new communism as they were in Russia. Rather, communism is the new religion and the churches, their indoctrination facilities, are woke.""""The new Bible interpretation is really communist indoctrination. The plaguespreads. It is a full on attack on every institution,"" the friend added. ""And we ask what is next? Evil knows no limits.""What began with Karl Marx and the Unitarian church is now infecting traditional churches as well. You have to go back to theschizophrenia of Christianity itself, faith versus good works, which is an ambiguity that goes all the way back to the disciples and early councils. Faith is about personal belief and a relationship with Jesus: confession andsalvation. Good works is about living your life as the man Jesussupposedly did. Christianity was almost entirely faith-based for many centuries, but in the 20th century the faith interpretation took a beating fromscience. Darwin bashed creationism. Freud bashed religion as an illusion based on childish impulses. And then totalitarian regimes usedscience as leverage to gain control. As you know, Marx called faith “the opiate of the masses” and right now communists are burning churches, especially in Canada. In the 20th century, faith became unfashionable among Western intelligentsia. There were notable exceptions,such Albert Einstein, but even the Catholics got in on it with Vatican II It was intended to update the church; they killed the Latin liturgy. And now the current Pope — whom I call “the bouncer” — is lecturing us on immigration and climate change. If you can believe this? A Pope lecturing us on immigration and climate change!At the middle of the 20th Century there was the advent ofsecular humanism, which filled the gap left behind by the death of faith. Remember the famoussaying “Is God dead?”And then along came the thoroughlysecular Unitarian church, the main front organization forsecular humanism. ""Atheists with children.""Their tenets contain not even a hint of faith. Here they are from the Unitarian Universalist website:“The inherent worth and dignity of every person.”“Justice equity and compassion and human relations.”“Acceptance of one another and encouragement tospiritual growth in our congregations.”“A free and responsiblesearch for truth and meaning.”“The right of conscience, the use of the democratic process within our congregations &society at large.”“A world community with peace, Liberty, and justice for all.”“Respect for the independent web of all existence in which we are all a part.”And then of course the tenet that drives it all is that poor people are good, and rich people are bad. This flows directly from the good works interpretation of Christianity. Jesussupposedlysaid to his disciples “Truly. I tell you, it is hard forsomeone who is rich to enter the kingdom of heaven. Again, I tell you that it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than forsomeone who is rich to enter the kingdom of God. (Matthew 19: 21-24)And now, we arrive at a new place: the worship of technology. These days, everyone carries an iPhone. Everyone is an intelligentsia wannabe. Education: Everyone issupposed to be brainwashed in the college. Technology: Today is where the high priest is the high-tech guru. Faith is falling even more and more out of fashion than ever before. Andso, what began with Karl Marx and the Unitarians is now infecting traditional churches. I will give you much more on faith and oursearch for meaning, on today’s Michael Savage podcast.",0,0,Newsmax
520,"Violence in the Capitol, Dangers in the Aftermath",-1.33,43.67,https://greenwald.substack.com/p/violence-in-the-capitol-dangers-in-67f,https://adfontesmedia.com/glenn-greenwald-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-07,16,"after the 9/11 attack, Americans were largely united in emotional horror at what had been done to their country as well as in their willingness to endorse repression and violence in response. As a result, there was little room to raise concerns about the possible excesses or dangers of the American reaction, let alone to dissent from what political leaders were proposing in the name of vengeance andsecurity. The psychological trauma from the carnage and the wreckage at the country’s most cherishedsymbolsswamped rational faculties and thus rendered futile any attempts to urge restraint or caution. Nonetheless, a few tried. Scorn andsometimes worse were universally heaped upon them. On September 14 — while bodies werestill buried under burning rubble in downtown Manhattan — Congresswoman Barbara Leecast a lone vote against the Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF). “Some of us must urge the use of restraint,”shesaidseventy-two hours after the attack, adding: “our country is in astate of mourning” and thus “some of us mustsay: let’sstep back for a moment, let’s pause just for a minute, and think through the implications of our actions todayso that this does notspiral out of control.”Forsimply urging caution and casting asingle “no” vote against war, Lee’s Congressional office was deluged with threats of violence. Armedsecurity was deployed to protect her, largely as a result of media attackssuggesting thatshe was anti-American andsympathetic to terrorists. Yet twenty years later — with US troopsstill fighting in Afghanistan under thatsame AUMF, with Iraq destroyed, ISISspawned, and US civil liberties and privacy rights permanently crippled — hersolitary admonitions look far more like courage, prescience and wisdom thansedition or a desire to downplay the threat of Al Qaeda. Others also raisedsimilar questions and issuedsimilar warnings. On the left, people like Susan Sontag and Noam Chomsky, and on the right peoplesuch as Ron Paul and Pat Buchanan — in different ways and at different times — urged US politicians and Americans generally to resist unleashing an orgy of domestic assaults on civil liberties, foreign invasions, and an endless war posture. They warned thatsuch a cycle, once initiated, would be very difficult to control, even more difficult to reverse, and virtually guaranteed to provoke even greater violence. ShareThese few who dissented from the instant consensus were, like Congresswoman Lee, widely vilified. Both Sontag and Chomsky werebrandedanti-American Fifth Columnists, while David Frum,writing in, denounced Buchanan and others questioning the excesses of the War on Terror from the right as “Unpatriotic Conservatives”: no different, proclaimed the neocon, than “Noam Chomsky, Ted Rall, Gore Vidal, Alexander Cockburn, and other anti-Americans of the far Left.”In retrospect, it is hard to deny that those who defied, or at least questioned, the potent 2001 emotional consensus by urging deliberation in lieu of reactionary rage were vindicated bysubsequent events: the two-decade expansion of the war in Afghanistan to multiple countries, the enactment of the Patriot Act, thesecret implementation of masssurveillancesystems, the trillions of dollars of taxpayer wealth transferred to weapons manufacturers, and the para militarization of the domesticsecuritystate. At the very least, basic rationality requires an acknowledgement that when political passions and rage-driven emotions find their most intense expression, calls for reflection and caution can only be valuable even if ultimately rejected.of the Capitol by a Trump-supporting mob has certainly generated intense political passion and pervasive rage. It is not hard to understand why: the introduction of physical force into political protest is always lamentable, usually dangerous, and, except in the rarest of circumstances that are plainly inapplicable here, unjustifiable. It was foreseeable that an action of this type would result in deaths. The mostsurprising outcome is that “only” four people died: an unarmed woman, a Trumpsupporter and Air Force veteran, who wasshot in the neck by a law enforcement officer, and three other protesters who died from unspecified “medical emergencies” (one reportedly died due to accidentally tasering himself, inducing a heart attack). The US Capitol remains a potent and cherishedsymbol even for Americans who are deeply cynical about the ruling class and politicalsystem. Its nobility issomething continually engrained deep into our collective psychesince childhood, and that meaning endures even when our rational faculties reject it. It is therefore not hard to understand why watching a marauding band of hooligans invade and deface both the House and the Senate, without any identifiable objective other than venting grievances, reflexively engenders a patriotic disgust across the politicalspectrum. It is unhinged to the point of being obscene to compare yesterday’s incursion to the 9/11 attack or (as Sen. Chuck Schumerdid last night) to Pearl Harbor. By every metric, the magnitude and destructiveness of those two events are in an entirely different universe. But that does not mean there are no applicable lessons to be drawn from those prior attacks. One is thatstriking at cherished nationalsymbols — the World Trade Center, the Pentagon, the Capitol — ensures rage and terror far beyond body counts or other concrete harms. That is one major reason that yesterday’s event received far more attention and commentary, and will likely produce far greater consequences, than much deadlier incidents,such as thestill-motive-unknown2017 Las Vegas massshooting that killed 59 or the 2016 Orlandoshooting that left 49 dead at the Pulse nightclub. Unlike even horrific indiscriminateshootingsprees, an attack on asymbol of national power will be perceived as an attack on thestate or even thesociety itself. There are other, more important historical lessons to draw not only from the 9/11 attack butsubsequent terrorism on USsoil. One is the importance of resisting the coercive framework that demands everyone choose one of two extremes: that the incident is either (a) insignificant or even justifiable, or (b) is an earth-shattering, radically transformative event that demands radical, transformativestate responses. This reductive, binary framework is anti-intellectual and dangerous. One can condemn a particular act while resisting the attempt to inflate the dangers it poses. One can acknowledge the very real existence of a threat while also warning of the harms, often far greater, from proposedsolutions. One can reject maximalist, inflammatory rhetoric about an attack (a War of Civilizations, an attempted coup, an insurrection,sedition) without being fairly accused of indifference toward orsympathy for the attackers. Indeed, the primary focus of the first decade of my journalism was the US War on Terror — in particular, the relentless erosions of civil liberties and the endless militarization of Americansociety in the name of waging it. To make the case that those trendsshould be opposed, I frequently argued that the threat posed by Islamic radicalism to US citizens was being deliberately exaggerated, inflated and melodramatized. I argued that not because I believed the threat was nonexistent or trivial: I lived in New York City on 9/11 and remember to this day the excruciating horror from thesmell andsmoke emanating throughout Lower Manhattan and the haunting “missing” posters appended by desperate families, unwilling to accept the obvious reality of their loved ones’ deaths, to every lamp post on everystreet corner. Ishared thesame disgust andsadness as most other Americans from the Pulse massacre, thesubway bombings in London and Madrid, the workplace massshooting in San Bernardino. My insistence that we look at the otherside of the ledger — the costs and dangers not only fromsuch attacks but also the “solutions” implemented in the name ofstopping them — did not come from indifference towards those deaths or a naive views of those responsible for them. It was instead driven by mysimultaneous recognition of the dangers from rights-eroding, authoritarian reactions imposed by thestate, particularly in the immediate aftermath of a traumatic event. One need not engage in denial ism or minimization of a threat to rationally resist fear-driven fanaticism — as Barbara Leeso eloquently insisted on September 14, 2001. Human memories are usuallyshort and the dominance ofsocial media has abridged them even further. Many have forgotten that the Clinton administrationseized on the 1995 courthouse bombing in Oklahoma City to radically expand law enforcement powers and escalate its demands for full-scale backdoor access to all encrypted internet communications. The fear necessary to justifysuch draconian measures was fueled by incessant media hyping of weekend citizen militias in places like Idaho and Montanasaid to be plotting armed insurrection against the federal government. One of the first major War on Terror attacks on core Constitutional rights which Iwrote about was Newt Gingrich’s2006speechsuggesting that the First Amendment’s freespeech guarantee to fight terrorismshould be “modified”. The former House Speaker approvingly citedaarticleby former federal prosecutor Andrew McCarthy — entitled “Free Speech for Terrorists?” — insisting thatsome ideas areso dangerous, especially in the era of terrorism and the internet, that the First Amendment must be limited to permit greater censorship powers:With an enemy committed to terrorism, the advocacy of terrorism—the threats, the words—are not mere dogma, or even calls to “action.” They are themselves weapons—weapons of incitement and intimidation, often as effective in achieving their ends as would be firearms and explosives brandished openly. . . . Do weso lack confidence (except in thesacrosanctstatus ofspeech itself) that we are unable tosay with assurance thatsome things are truly evil, and that advocating them not only fails toserve anysocially desirable purpose but guarantees more evil? Must our historical deference to opinion, however noxious, defer as well to a call to arms against innocents, or a call to destroy a form of representative government that religious and political freedom? May we not even ban and criminalize the advocacy of militant Islam and its métier, which is the indiscriminateslaughter of civilians? . . . In America is bumptious, bounteous marketplace, there are no limits on words as the building blocks of ideas, or on ideas as the legitimate instruments of persuasion. Terror has no place insuch discourse. It is the function of law to express oursociety is judgments. Oursshould besimple and humane: words that kill are not words we need abide. As a freespeech advocate and civil libertarian, I was naturally repelled by this notion thatsome political ideas could be deemedso dangerous by thestate that they can be legallysuppressed. In response, Iasked rhetorically in 2006: “Are thereAmerican values at all in which Bush followers and neo cons actually believe -- any constitutional principles that aresacrosanct and whose violations they would oppose if undertaken in the name of fighting The Terrorists?” I concluded: “It certainly does not appearso.”Beyond raising alarms about civil liberties erosions, I also often insisted that the underlying causes of terrorism aimed at the USshould be considered if for no other reason than to understand how to address it without destroying core liberties for Americans. While religious fanaticism maysometimes be the cause, far more often, I argued,such attacks were motivated by rage over the killing of innocent people, including children, by the US Government’s bombs, drones and tanks in Muslim-majority countries. Right-wing advocates often demonizedsuch arguments as pro-terrorist or as “justifying” terrorist attacks, but the left largelysupported the inquiry into motivating causes, just as they have longsupported the attempts to understand what motivates violent crime, on the ground that misguided actions are often driven by valid or at least widelyshared redressible grievances. But the view that weshould attempt to identify the core motives of terrorist acts or violent crime, rather than just label them evil and vow to destroy their perpetrators, was largely deemed taboo in mainstream discourse.now as every War on Terror rhetorical tactic to justify civil liberties erosions is now being invoked in the name of combatting Trumpism, including the aggressive exploitation of the emotions triggered by yesterday’s events at the Capitol to accelerate their implementation and demonize dissent over the quickly formed consensus. Thesame framework used to assault civil liberties in the name of foreign terrorism is now beingseamlessly applied — often by those whospent the last two decades objecting to it — to the threat posed by “domestic whitesupremacist terrorists,” the term preferred by liberal elites, especially after yesterday, for Trumpsupporters generally. Inso many ways, yesterday was the liberals’ 9/11, as even the mostsensible commentators among them are resorting to the most unhinged rhetoric available. Within hours of the Capitol being cleared, we heard truly radical proposals from numerous members of Congress. Senators and House members who objected to Electoral College certification, or questioned its legitimacy,should be formally accused ofsedition and expelled from the Houseif not prosecuted, argued Rep. Cori Bush (D-MO), with other House members expressingsupport. Even those unarmed protesters who peacefully entered the Capitolshould, many argued, be hunted by the FBI as domestic terrorists. Calls proliferated for the banning of thesocial media accounts of instigators and protest participants. Journalists and politicians cheered the decision by Facebook and Twitter to temporarily bar the President from using theirservice, and then cheered again when Facebook’s CEO Mark Zuckerbergannounced on Tuesdaythat the ban on Trump extended through Biden’s inauguration. Some journalists,such as’s Oliver Darcy,complainedthat Facebook had not gone far enough, that more mass censorship was needed of right-wing voices. The once-radical 2006 Gingrich argument — thatsome opinions are too dangerous to allow to be expressed because they are pro-terrorist and insurrectionary — is now thriving, close to a consensus. These calls for censorship, online and official, are grounded in the long-discredited, oft-rejected and dangerous view that a personshould be held legally accountable not only for their own illegal actions but also for: meaning the actions others take when they hear inflammatory rhetoric. That was the distorted mentality used by the State of Mississippi in the 1970s to try to hold NAACP leaders liable for the violent acts of their followers against boycott violators after hearing rousing pro-boycottspeeches from NAACP leaders, only for the Supreme Court in 1982 to unanimously rejectsuch efforts on the ground that ""while the State legitimately may impose damages for the consequences of violent conduct, it may not award compensation for the consequences of nonviolent, protected activity,"" adding that even ""advocacy of the use of force or violence does not removespeech from the protection of the first amendment.""The complete reversal in mentality from just a few months ago is dizzying. Those whospent thesummer demanding the police be de funded are furious that the police response at the Capitol was insufficiently robust, violent and aggressive. Those who urged the abolition of prisons are demanding Trumpsupporters be imprisoned for years. Those who, under the banner of “anti-fascism,” demanded the firing of a top editor for publishing an op-ed by Sen. Tom Cotton (R-AR) advocating the deployment of the US military to quell riots — a view deemed not just wrong but unspeakable in decentsociety — are today furious that the National Guard was not deployed at the Capitol to quash pro-Trumpsupporters. Antifa advocates are working to expose the names of Capitol protesters to empower the FBI to arrest them on terrorism charges. And while Rep. Cori Bush’s proposal to unseat members of Congress for theirsubversive views went mega-viral, many forget that in 1966, the Georgia State Legislature refused toseat Julian Bondafter he refused to repudiate his anti-war work with the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, then considered a domestic terrorist group. Those who argued in thesummer that property damage is meaningless or even noble are treatingsmashed windows and looted podiums at the Capitol as treason, as a coup. One need not dismiss the lamentable actions of yesterday tosimultaneously reject efforts to apply terms that are plainly inapplicable:. There was zero chance that the few hundred people who breached the Capitol could overthrow the US Government — the most powerful, armed and militarized entity in the world — nor did they try. Perhaps many view it as more upsetting tosee august members of Congress hiding in fear of a riot than to watch ordinarysmall-business owners weep as their multi-generationalstore burns to the ground. Undoubtedly, national reporters whospend much time in the Capitol and who have long-time friendships with Senators and House members are more horrified, far moreso, by violent gangs in the Capitol rotunda than on thestreets of Portland or Kenosha. But that does not mean that rational restraint is unnecessary whensearching forsober language to accurately describe these events. There is a huge difference between, on the one hand, thousands of peopleshooting their way into the Capitol after a long-planned, coordinated plot with the goal ofseizing permanent power, and, on the other, an impulsive and grievance-driven crowd more or less waltzing into the Capitol as the result ofstrength in numbers and then leaving a few hours later. That the only personshot was a protester killed by an armed agent of thestate by itself makes clear how irresponsible these terms are. There are more adjectives besides “fascist treason” and “harmless protest,” enormousspace between those two poles. Oneshould not be forced to choose between the two. It has long been clear that, in the post-Trump era, media outlets looking to keep viewers hooked, and government officials looking to increase their power, will do everything possible to center and inflate the threat posed by right-wing factions. I’vesaid this more times than I can count over the last year at least. Like all inflated threats, this one has a kernel of truth. As is true of every faction, there are right-wing activists filled with rage and who are willing to engage in violence. Some of them are dangerous (just assome Muslims in the post-9/11 era, andsome Antifa nihilists, were and are genuinely violent and dangerous). But as was true of the Cold War and the War on Terror andso many other crisis-spurred reactions, the otherside of the ledger — the draconianstate powers clearly being planned and urged and prepared in the name ofstopping them — carries its own extremely formidable dangers. Refusing to consider those dangers for fear ofstanding accused of downplaying the threat is the most common tactic authoritarian advocates ofstate power use. Less than twenty-four hours after the Capitol breach, onesees this tactic being wielded with great flamboyance and potency, and it issure to continue long after January 20.",1,1,Glenn Greenwald

""You never know what the next night will bring, or the next day.""A day after the nation recorded yet another record number of COVID-19 deaths, asecond coronavirus vaccine received emergency approval by the US Food and Drug Administration. The decision paves the way for the vaccine to help fight a pandemic that is now killed nearly 314,000 Americans. The emergency authorization of Moderna is vaccine comes just a week after the US Food and Drug Administration gave the green light to asimilar vaccine by drugmaker Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech. Prior to the FDA is decision, Gen. Gustave Perna, who oversees Operation Warp Speed and the federal effort to distribute vaccines,said the government was preparing toship almost 6 million doses of the Moderna vaccine to 3,285 locations in the week following approval. Toshow trust in the vaccine issafety, Vice President Mike Pence on Friday received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine on live television. In doingso, Pence became the highest-ranking US official to receive the vaccine. During the broadcast, Pence celebrated the milestone as ""a medical miracle"" that could eventually contain the raging pandemic. Second lady Karen Pence and Surgeon General Jerome Adams also receivedshots during the White House event in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. Later in the day, Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also received the first doses. Meanwhile, Congress on Friday pushed off a decision on a new coronavirus relief package by passing a two-daystop-gap funding bill, averting a governmentshutdown and buying itself two more days to negotiate final terms of the $900 billion aid package. Since the measure is looped into a $1.4 trillion governmentspending bill, Congress originally had until midnight Friday to approve the bill and avoid a governmentshutdown. If approved, the proposed aid could deliver additional ""paycheck protection""subsidies to businesses, an additional $300 per week to the unemployed, andstimulus payments to most Americans, likely in the amount of $600.

522,Orange deputy said trainer threatened him. The agency’s probe led to his own firing,0.0,48.33,https://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/orange-county/os-ne-orange-deputy-terminated-untruthful-flawed-case-20201102-r7qrlclogvf7hokdhd2fojltae-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/orlando-sentinel-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-02,22,"During one of his first weeks as a provisional Orange County deputysheriff, Jacob Stewartsaid his field training officer became angry and threatened to kill him — pulling out a gun and a knife, before threatening to use his bare hands and “bury him in the woods.”But when the Sheriff’s Office began investigating the incident 18 months later, Stewartsaid he quickly went from being treated as a potential victim of aggravated assault, to the target of an internal investigation into whether changes in his testimony amounted to lies. That probe led to his firing from the agency for being untruthful, after OCSO investigatorssaid he initially claimed Deputy First Class Keith Mobley pointed the gun and knife at him, but conceded in a follow-up interview that he didn’tsee the Mobley point the weapons at him. Stewart — who has now twice appealed his firing withoutsuccess —says the investigations that led to his termination were biased against him, that he felt coerced to change hisstory and that the probes violated his rights as a crime victim and officer under investigation. The truthfulness violation also landed him on the Orange-Osceola State Attorney’s OfficeBrady list, which tracks officers with credibility issues. Hesaid his inclusion is unwarranted.“Nothing Isaid about it is untrue, and that’s what disheartens me the most,” Stewart, 24, told the Orlando Sentinel. “I wanted to be as open and honest. … I’ve been brutalized during this entire process.”Stewart and attorneys for the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 93, which represents OCSO deputies,said the yare now considering filing a lawsuit, having exhausted internal reviews. Michelle Guido, an OCSOspokeswoman,said the agency affords officers accused of wrongdoing “all elements of” thestate’s Law Enforcement Officers’ Bill of Rights. Stewartsays the incident occurred in June 2018, during one of his first weeks of in-the-field training. He was driving when he missed an update on his laptop about a call to which he and Mobley were responding, angering Mobley. From the passengerseat, Mobley grabbed thesteering wheel while the vehicle was moving, forcing Stewart to pull over, the OCSO investigative reportsaid. Stewartsaid he then heard the “distinctsound” of Mobley’s agency-issued firearm being removed from its holster, and in his peripheral viewsaw Mobley holding the gun “pointed directly at [him],” the reportsaid. Mobley re-holstered it, but continued to threaten Stewart, this time with a knife, Stewartsaid. Mobley then threatened to kill him with his bare hands and bury his body, Stewartsaid. Mobley told investigators he remembered getting upset and possibly yelling or cursing at Stewart, which hesaid was in response to an insubordinate comment by the new deputy. But he denied ever threatening to kill him or pointing any weapons at him, describing the incident asa training “misunderstanding.”There was no video evidence and only Stewart and Mobley were in the vehicle. Stewart reported to asupervisor that he was threatened by Mobley, andsoon after requested a new field training officer, but the OCSO probe wasn’t opened until about 18 months later. It began after a colleague who Stewart had told about the incident reported it to the Professional Standards Division. After talking to Stewart, investigators interviewedsix deputies and Stewart’s wife, who he’d told about what happened. Allsaid Stewart had described being threatened by Mobley, thoughsomesaid they thought Mobley only threatened to beat him up. Two recounted the fullscenario Stewart had described to investigators. Onesaid he’d heard Stewart was threatened only with a knife, but had learned from Mobley that wasn’t the case. Investigators thenspoke again to Stewart “to clarify discrepancies in his initial testimony,” the reportsaid. After officials pressed Stewart on whether he embellished any part of his testimony, he conceded that he didn’tsee the gun pointed at him or know forsure if it had been. Under Florida law, an assault charge requires only that person made a credible threat “by word or act to do violence” to another, and an assault is considered aggravated when any deadly weapon is involved. There is no distinction made for whether the weapon was pointed. Stewart attributes his uncertainty to the difficulty of trying to relay a traumatic incident months after the fact. He also feels he was coerced into changing thestory.“To me it was clear I was going to be held in that room… until they got what they wanted,” Stewartsaid at his appeal hearing Monday. But OCSO investigators determined the coercion claim was “not reasonable” because he was a deputy with two years of experience. Though Stewart’s appeals were rejected, a captain tasked with reviewing his first appeal found the investigations were biased, as Stewart claimed, and the findingsshould have been overturned. Capt. Susan Wallis noted investigators asked another deputy if Stewart may have “embellished” the incident, before that word had come up in interviews with Stewart. She also felt investigators were “accusatory and argumentative” with Stewart, while Mobley’s interviews were “cordial, calm, polite and professional.”Wallis also found investigators did not press Mobley on questionable training practices he described using, like “frightening verbal commands” and changing his voice tone andspeed to “intentionally inducestress.”Without adequate explanation, Mobley’s admission that he used those methods “gives validity” to Stewart’s claim of having felt threatened, Wallis wrote. Investigators also interviewed 16 deputies who were trained in recent years by Mobley. Nonesaid he ever pointed a gun or weapon at them, but three mentioned they had concerning interactions with him. Onesaid he would “randomlystart to yell,” almost causing her to crash her car, while two otherssaid Mobley mentioned that if the deputies got into a physical fight, Mobley would watch until they were near death before helping,the reportsaid. Wallissaidshe was also concerned by the lack ofseparation between the two investigations: the criminal probe into whether Mobley had threatened Stewart and the administrative probe to determine if Stewart had lied. Both were conducted by the professionalstandards division, as is OCSO’s procedure, but assigned to different investigators. Wallissaid Stewart was not quickly enough granted the rights that officers are afforded when they are under investigation. But Sheriff John Mina’s administration — which has the finalsay in all disciplinary decisions — overruled Wallis’ findings. At Monday’s hearing, three OCSO officials voted to uphold the investigation and his termination. Stewartsaid hestill wants to return to being a deputy, because it’s always been his goal toserve the community. Other than the incident with Mobley, hesaid he enjoyed working for OCSO and even encouraged his wife to join the civilianstaff.“That’s how highly I thought of it, I brought my family in,” Stewartsaid. “The Stewart name isstill helping the citizens of Orange County. I take pride in that.”gtoohey@orlandosentinel.com",2,2,Orlando Sentinel

New Yorkstate has launched its own version. But the Florida governor’sorderclaimed “requiringso-called Covid-19 vaccine passports for taking part in everyday life –such as attending asporting event, patronizing a restaurant or going to a movie theater – would create two classes of citizens”. The ordersays the prohibition is therefore “necessary to protect the fundamental rights and privacies of Floridians and the free flow of commerce within thestate”. It alsosays “noFloridagovernment entity” or its officials “shall be permitted to issue vaccine passports, vaccine passes, or otherstandardized documentation for the purpose of certifying an individual’s Covid-19 vaccinationstatus to a third party, or otherwise publish orshare and individual’s Covid-19 vaccination record orsimilar health information.”Despite the order’s line about protecting the “free flow of commerce”, DeSantis’s order alsosays business are “prohibited from requiring patrons or customers to provide any documentation certifying Covid-19 vaccination or post-transmission recovery to gain access to, entry upon, orservice from the business”. Vaccine passports have become the latest flash point in increasingly politicized battles over coronavirus policy. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a controversial far-right Georgia Republican, hassaid vaccine passports are Joe Biden’s “mark of the beast”, the Hillreported. She has also introduce da bill to bansuch passports and fire Dr Anthony Fauci, Biden’s chief medical adviser. In the mainstream of the Republican party, DeSantis has emerged in many eyes ast he heir to Donald Trump’s throne,should the former president not run again in 2024. Many observers and proponents of vaccine passports have pointed out thatsome countries already require documentation of yellow fever vaccination for entry. Upon getting a yellow fever vaccine, for example, recipients receive a yellow card called the “International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP)”. The controversysurrounding vaccine passports comes amid a burgeoning fourth wave of Covid-19.

Bidensaid July 2. ""As we get prepared to celebrate Independence Day, today’s job news brought ussomething else to celebrate: This morning we learned that, in June, our economy created 850,000 jobs.""Biden went on tosay, ""We have now created over 3 million jobssince I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history, thanks to the incredible work of the entire team.""Presidents’ claims about job creation on their watch can be troublesome. So how did Biden do?Biden was right on the numbers, we found, but he glossed oversome important context. Theofficial government datashows that between January 2021, when Biden took office, and June, the number of employed Americans rose from 142.7 million to 145.8 million, or a gain of just over 3 million. In numerical terms, that’s a bigger gain in jobs than for the equivalent period under every post-World War II president who first came to office in an election. (This comparison leaves out Harry Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford, each of whom initially assumed the office without being elected.)The closest competitor to Biden was Jimmy Carter, with a gain of 1.8 million jobs. Biden’s claim leaves out at least four important bits of context. A fairer metric for comparison is the number of jobs gained divided by thestarting level of jobs when the president took office. By this metric, Bidenscores well, but he’s not Number 1. That distinction goes to Carter, who oversaw job gains of 2.2%, compared with Biden’s 2.1%. Put another way, if the gains from June can be replicated each month, it would take until February 2022 for all pre-pandemic jobs to be recovered (setting asidesubsequent increases in population). Given theseverity of the pandemic recession, that would be asignificant bounceback — but it hasn’t happened yet. Most other presidents — aside from Barack Obama, who took office during aspiraling economic downturn — have entered the White House amid a growing economy. But the precise timing of their inauguration can play a big role in how a president’s first few months go,so Biden’s comparison to his predecessors is not really apples-to-apples. Thatsaid, expertssay that Biden does deservesome credit for the job gains on his watch, given the gains in coronavirus vaccinations and the passage of his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which provided coronavirus aid and economic relief. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Bidensaid, ""We have now created over 3 million jobssince I took office, more jobs than have ever been created in the first five months of any presidency in modern history.""Biden is right on the numbers and on how they compare with his recent predecessors in the Oval Office. However, this talking point glosses over the reality that the US economy remains almost 6.8 million jobs under its pre-pandemic peak. Meanwhile, comparing presidents as Biden did is highlysensitive to the economic conditions around the time of their inauguration; Biden entered office during a deep recession, but he took over on the upswing, asituation that not all presidents have benefited from.

526,Americans From Both Parties Want Weed To Be Legal. Why Doesn’t The Federal Government Agree?,-0.33,48.67,https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/marijuana-legalization-is-super-popular-why-hasnt-it-happened-nationally/,https://adfontesmedia.com/fivethirtyeight-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-23,25,"Tuesday marked the international holiday for marijuana— and consumers of the plant had lots to celebrate this year. New York,VirginiaandNew Mexicoall passed legislation in 2021 legalizing marijuana,1bringing the total number ofstates wherere creational consumption is legal up to 17, along with Washington, DC At the federal level, the House of Representativespassed a bill this week which allows banks to conduct business with cannabis-related companies instates where marijuana has been legalized,with thesupport of about half of the chamber’s Republicans and almost all of its Democrats; the bill now awaits its fate in the Senate.passed the House in 2019but wasn’t brought to a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate. But even if Biden may not be ready to pivot on marijuana legalization just yet (decriminalization, not legalization for recreational use, was part of his campaign platform), the polling on the issue has been loud and clear: People want weed to be legal. Gallup has asked Americans about whether theysupport legalizing marijuanasince 1969, when only 12 percent of Americanssupported the idea. As of their most recent poll last November, that number has ticked up to 68 percent, the highest level ofsupport on record. And perhaps unsurprisingly, the number ofstates where recreational marijuana is now legal has alsosteadily increasedsince the Obama administration announced in 2013 that it wouldn’t blockstate laws that legalized the drug, provided that marijuana wasstrongly regulated. And if recent polling instates where marijuana is not yet legal for recreational use is any indication, it is possible that even morestates will change course. Although, as the chart aboveshows, legislators have often beenslow to legalize marijuana for recreational use: Thirteen of the 18states where marijuana is legal have done it via voter-driven ballot initiatives rather than legislation. Thatsaid, legalization is broadly popular even in more Republican-leaningstates like Florida, Louisiana, North Carolina and Texas. Polls ofsupport for legalizing marijuana instates where recreational use is not yet legalIncludes both polls that askspecifically about recreational use as well as polls that ask about legalizing marijuana for any purpose. Does not include polls that only asked about legalizing marijuana for medical use. Source: PollsMarijuana legalization may appeal to voters in both very blue and redstates, in part, because it’s an issue with bipartisansupport. According to a recent poll from thePew Research Center, 72 percent of Democrats and 47 percent of Republicanssupported marijuana legalization for medical and recreational use. Further, Pew found that exceedingly few adults of any age were “opposed to the legalization of marijuana,” though it did find that older Americans were less likely than younger Americans to be in favor of legalization. Only 27 percent of Republicans 65 and oldersupported legalization, the lowest level ofsupport among any group Pewsurveyed. But just because legalization is broadly popular doesn’t mean weshould expect federal legislation on the issuesoon. Forstarters,not all Senate Democratsback Schumer’s plan, and Senate Republicanshave yet toshow anysupport for legalization. Additionally, while legalizing marijuana is popular, itisn’t a top priority for many voters. That may be, in part, due to thesuccess of legalization efforts at thestate level. More than one in three Americanslive instates where marijuana is already legal for recreational use, and asizable majority live instates where marijuana is legal for medical use. For those who already have access to the drug, it may not matter whether it’s theirstate government or the federal government making that allowance. Finally, as my colleague Perry Bacon Jr. pointed out earlier this year,electoral politics are increasingly disconnected from policy, meaning that despite the popularity of marijuana legalization, there maysimply not be a ton of electoral benefit for Biden for taking up the issue. Still, if the polling is any indication, legalizing marijuana is hugely popular, and Biden may yet change his mind, depending on how the politics of the bill play out. And if he does, he may even getsome brownie points from Republican voters whosupport legalization. But if thingsstart to get politically messy, Biden may not have a lot to lose by passing on championing this particular issue. According to FiveThirtyEight’s presidential approval tracker,453.3 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 40.2 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of +13 points). At this time last week, 52.8 percent of Americans approved of Biden, while 40.8 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of +12 points). One month ago, 55.1 percent of Americans approved of Biden, compared to 39.1 percent who disapproved.",2,1,FiveThirtyEight
527,"Say Her Name: On Average, Police Kill One Black Woman A Month",-14.67,46.67,https://therealnews.com/stories/say-her-name-police-brutality-kill-black-women,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-news-network-bias-and-reliability/,2020-06-24,23,"Historically, Black women like Fannie Lou Hamer, Atatiana Jefferson, Breonna Taylor, Korryn Gaines, and Eleanor Bumpers, who were killed or brutalized by police officers, receive less community outrage and media coverage than their male counterparts. Eddie Conway: Welcome to The Real News. I’m Eddie Conway, your host coming to you from Baltimore. We have been witnessing worldwide protests,strikes, demonstrations, destruction of monuments. When you look in the crowds yousee men, women, children, white, black, brown, yellow, red, etc. And you hear more often than not a lot of names beingshouted, or posters being bannered with Eric Garner’s name. Trayvon Martin’s name, Tyrone West’s name, Mike Brown. And of course we know all of thisstarted with the killing of George Floyd. But what’s missing in this wholescenario, and not getting a lot of publicity is the name of women. Now of course we are Breonna Taylor’s name, because that’s an incident that’s closely associated with this whole thing. Andsome of us are aware of Sandra Bland,some of us are aware of other names of other women. But in looking back at our history, of course we could go back all the way toslavery, but in looking back in our history, we cansee names like Fannie Lou Hamer’s, being beaten by police, that affected her for the rest of her life. Wesee a case that I looked at in particular, was a case in Tyler, Texas in which an 84 year old … 82 year old grandmother wassleeping in her bed, police mistaking her house for a place to raid raided her house, charged upstairs andshot hersix times in her bed. And walked away from the whole thing. The Grand Jury in Tyler, Texas found that it was an accident, the black community was outraged, they decided to do jury nullification. They in turn decided that they wasn’t going to convict any black person that didn’t do harm to the black community. And that was in ’92.:So young women, as young asseven, has been murdered in their beds by police. And women as old as 92 has been murdered in their houses by police. Andso I wonder why we don’t hear more voices in these protests about the women that has been murdered by police. This is not a black male thing, this is a people of color thing at this present time. So joining me today to talk about this a little bit is Dominique Conway, who is also my wife, writer, activist, organizer, educator. Also joining me is Professor Talitha LeFlouria. Thanks for joining me, Dominique and Talitha. Talitha LeFlour…: Thank you for having me. Dominique Conwa…: Thank you for having me. Eddie Conway: Okay, my first question goes to you, Talitha. Over the years itseems that the police have killed one black woman a month. On average, which meanssometimes there was two and thensometimes there might have been a month and a week passed by. But, why don’t we hear black women’s name? Why is this disparity between what the protestors areshouting out and what’s really happening in our lives?Talitha LeFlour…: Thank you, Eddie, that’s a … a wonderful question. And a question that I’ve thought a lot about. Because as we know, thesilence is deafening, right? And the level of outrage that weseeshown toward the killing of black men and boys is just notshown when it comes to black women and girls. And I thought really hard and very long about this, and I can’tsay that I have the answer, but one thing that I willsay is that I believe that the numbers game hassomething to do with this. The fact that black women are killed inseemingly negligible numbers when compared with black men. So thosestaggeringstatistics that youshared, if one black woman is killed a month, then that means probably 10 black men are killed a month, right?Andso unfortunately people minimize the murder of black women and girls, because their numbers don’t compare with black men. But when you compare those numbers with the white women who are not being killed by the police, then that changes things. That helps us tosee this in a different light, right? Andso I’m not one whosupports of promotes comparativesuffering, and I believe that we need to move away from this narrative thatsomehow well, the numbers of black men that are being murdered areso much more, that we have to address that issue first, and then we can get to the black men. No, all black lives need to matter equally, including the lives of black women. And Kimberle Crenshaw recentlysaidsomething that wasso eloquent, and I want toshare it because I think that it applies to what I’msaying now. Shesaid that if yourstory doesn’t exist within a movement, thatstory isn’t entirely for you. Andso we have to lift up thestories of black women and girls, and we have to convey the message to the rest of the world that all black lives matter. Because if we don’t do it, if weshow indifference toward the killing of black women and girls as a result of vigilante violence andstatesanctioned anti-black violence, then if the black community doesn’tshow outrage, then whyshould the rest of the worldshow outrage?Eddie Conway: Okay, Dominique, thesame question, why you think thissilence around the death of black women at the hands of vigilantes, of police correctional officers, because a lot of black women are also killed in prisons. Dominique?Dominique Conwa…: Yeah, I pretty much agree with what Talitha hassaid. I also do think it’s a difficult question because there areso many complexities. I think history, the devaluation of black women and the black female body, the black body in general, but particularly the black female body lends easily to that. So I think it’s very complex. I feel that whitesupremacy hasset up asystem in which there is a hierarchy. And evensometimes withinstruggles we reinforce that hierarchy, and I think we have to undo our thinking about how we view people within our own groups. Andso I think that that’s part of the difficulty of really answering the question. And I also don’t want to get into reinforcing a hierarchy andsaying that well, it’s more important that we view the deaths of black women versus black men. No, we need to look at all of this because it’s not just black men, it’s not just black women, it’s our children, too. We’re pretty much all in thescopes of the rifle, and I think we need to view this as a war. And war takes everybody out. Eddie Conway: Well Talitha, and I heard yousay that it’s ourstory, we need to raise thesestories up. What’s the role of black men in this, and what’s the role of black women? Because Isee black women out there on the line also, talking about Trayvon Martin, andsupporting protests around Eric Garner. And most of the time, and to be quite honest, most of the movements that I have witnessed throughout history andstudied throughout history are actually led by women, and they are actuallysupported and pushed forward by women. And women has, from the time we got on the boats apparently, has been protesting, fighting, pushing, and in fact keeping us alive to fight the next day. But whose responsibility for bringing ourstory, thestory of black women’s deaths also, whose responsibility is that?Talitha LeFlour…: In response to your question, Eddie, about whose responsibility is, I think that it’s our collective responsibility to lift up thestories of black women and girls who have been killed by the police, or who have died at the hands of vigilantes. As Dominiquesaid, whitesupremacist violence is indiscriminate. Andso … but one of the things that I want tosay is that as you mentioned black women have been doing a lot of this work. Black women have essentially been carrying the labor, they’re the ones who areshowing up at the protests and who are committed to the defense of black women. So when black menshow up, even though unfortunately black men haven’tshown up at thesame level that black women have, when black menshow up for black women in thesespaces and for black girls, what itsays is that our lives are worthy of protection. That our lives are worthy ofsaving. As Dominique mentioned before, historically black women have not been afforded thesame protections as white women. Black women and girls, their lives haven’t beenseen as worthy of thesame protection. The dehumanization thatslavery … the types of dehumanization that black women and girls and black people experienced duringslavery, I think is part of the reason why wesee this complete disregard for black life, and it’s part of the reason why black people can be killed with impunity. It’s becauseslaveryset that precedent that our lives did not matter. Andso when a black woman is killed, or harmed, or injured, or when a black man is killed, or harmed, or injured, we’re all hurt. Eddie Conway: Okay, Dominique, I’ve heard yousay thousands of times that black men has a certain responsibility tospeak up to other black men around this issue. Talk a little bit about that protest of Black Lives Matter activist, a young lady that reported a rape and after a rallyshe disappeared. Could you talk a little bit about thesafespace, or the lack ofsafespace, and what’s the role of men in all of this?Dominique Conwa…: Yeah, I feel like I don’t know enough about her particularsituation to reallyspeak to it. I’ve gleaned a few bits of information. So I don’t want to like go into that because I don’t … I just don’t feel comfortablespeaking about hersituation not knowing enough about it. But I think in general … I mean, as a black woman it’s very difficult to feelsafe in the belly of the beast. History has told me enough to know that I’m notsafe, my children are notsafe. When I have grandchildren, they will probably be … not besafe until this whole paradigm here is changed. But I do feel that it’s not just necessary for men to kind of take responsibility and acknowledge the deaths of these women as well, I feel like men need to be conscious of how they take upspace when it comes tospeaking to these issues a lot of times. My experience here in Baltimore and what Isaw in 2015 was men taking up a lot of the talkingspace. But out on thestreets Isaw mothers, Isaw grandmothers, Isaw little girls. But when you looked at the interviews, what was reflected back very often were men who were not necessarily doing the organizing. Andso I feel like brothers need to be conscious about taking up thatspace. Just like we tell white folks they need to be conscious about taking up ourspace, we need to look at who’s really being afforded ample room within ourspaces. Eddie Conway: Okay, and I [inaudible 00:14:06] one of the questions I was going to ask, and I realize that it’s probably not necessarily a valid question, considering that a lot of these cases that I’ve looked at of black women being killed, has happened in thespaces in their houses. They’ve been in their bedrooms, they’ve been in their living rooms, they’ve been away from videos andso on. So the video footage is not there, but I’m wondering about the 17 year old young lady that video ed George Floyd’s case, now I understandshe’s receiving death threats, andshe’s got to be hidden and protected. Whatshould we be doing aboutstuff like that? Talitha, do you have any opinion on that?Talitha LeFlour…: Wow, that’s a tough question to answer. I believe that we all have to obviously rally behind her, andsupport her, andsupport anybody who is a victim of white racial terror, even if it doesn’t result in death. Our community is being tremendously impacted, our public health … I mean, excuse me, our mental health is being affected. Racism is a public health issue. It’s a public health crisis. Andso we as a community need to get around her andsupport her and lift her up, but we also need to hold the people who like, for example, people who provide mental healthservices, andsocialservices, hold our local governments, ourstate governments, and any entity that could provide these kinds of resources in lieu of hiring additional police officers. Part of the de funding of the police could involve channeling more resources into public health. Yeah, public health and mental healthservices for people in our community, including that young woman who I understand now is extremely agoraphobic and can’t even leave her house at this point becauseshe’s afraid thatshe’s going to lose her life or thatshe’s going to be bullied or terrorized. People kill themselves when they are harassed and when they are terrorized in this way. So I just pray for her mental health and thatshe’ll be able to get the kind of healing and the attention thatshe deserves on an individual level, but we as a community need to also champion around her and other people who are brave enough to film these murders, and who are brave enough tospeak out against these atrocities. I think about Ida B Wells. That young woman is the Ida B Wells of our generation. She documented that horror,she documented that lynching, right? Andso we have to get behind our brothers andsisters who are willing to document and put everything on the line, including their lives and theirsafety on the line to document these lynchings. Eddie Conway: Dominique, and I guess this is like the final question, I would like for you to give us an idea of whatshould happen. I mean, we talk about de funding the police,some people talk about disbanding the police. Is that the real problem, or is the problem deeper than that, or what you thinkshould happen to kind of like … the outcome of all this worldwide protests?Dominique Conwa…: One, I do feel that it’s necessary to abolish police forces, but also Isee the police assimply being the armed wing of a government that is at war with us and has been at best indifferent to oursuffering, but a lot worse than indifferent. When you consider black Wall Street, and consider what happened in Tulsa, when you consider the attacks upon people of African descent, our communities as well as what is done to indigenous communities in this land. So I think yeah, it’s very necessary to abolish the police, but I think we also need to begin to determine … we need to determine our own destinies, and I hope that doesn’tsound too cliché at this point, but it’s true. And part of that is determining who’s going to really protect the communities. I feel like if we were in that kind of position, there wouldn’t be no question about protection for this young woman. As you all were talking about thatsituation I’m thinking we need a Deacons for Defense, we needsome folks that’s going tostand outside that house armed and assuring hersafety. Or whatevershe feels would assure hersafety, because that might not be it for her. Andso it is a matter of giving voice to everybody in the community to determine what their destiny is going to be, and what makes them feel comfortable. So I think that it’s very hard for me tosay what needs to come out of this, becauseso much needs to come out of this, it’s been 500 years, okay? I think we have enough time for me to even go through the long list of things. But I think more important is that this is a young person’s game at this point. It’s their future, they need to be able to determine how they’re going to live that future, how they’re going into that future, and if there even is going to be a future. Eddie Conway: Okay, Talitha, you get the final word. Do you have any final comment toshare with our audience?Talitha LeFlour…: So I just want to first of all thank you, Dominique, for your final word, and I agree with you wholeheartedly. I want tosay that it is critical and it is paramount that wesay the names of black women and girls. That we do not perpetuate or continue to perpetuate the invisibility that black women and girls face when it comes to these issues around police violence, and police brutality, and police terror. Black women and girlsshould not be a footnote, theyshould be at the center of thesestories, at the center of our public discourse around police violence and anti-black violence. And it’s our responsibility to makesure that all black lives matter. So whenever we can, we need to lift up the voices and thestories of black women, and join activists, local activists, nationally recognized activists who have really large platforms tospeak out on these issues, including the African American Policy Forum. I would encourage you to contribute to and tosupport the Say Her Name movement. And to plug into the work that Kimberle Crenshaw and the African American Policy Forum and people who are committed to this work, and amplifying thesestories all over the country are doing. Andso that would be my final word. Eddie Conway: All right, thank you. There’s a rally today, in fact, tosupport Say Her Name. So thank you for joining me Talitha and Dominique. Talitha LeFlour…: Thank you. Dominique Conwa…: Thank you. Eddie Conway: Okay, and thank you for joining this episode of The Real News.

528,Covid got California Governor Newsom into this recall mess. He is banking it will get him out.,-5.67,43.0,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/elections/covid-got-california-gov-newsom-recall-mess-he-s-banking-n1277314,https://adfontesmedia.com/nbc-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-11,25,"WASHINGTON — Covid-19 restrictions got Gavin Newsom into this mess. Now he’s counting on them to get him out of it. Amid a contentious national debate over masks and vaccines, California’s embattled Democratic governor is betting his political life on turning next month’s recall election into a referendum onsome of the nation isstrictest mandates.""What is atstake in the Sept. 14 recall? It is a matter of life and death,” the narrator ofNewsom’s latest television adstates, arguing the top Republican candidate “peddled deadly conspiracy theories and would eliminate vaccine mandates on day one.”Recent pollsshow a dead heat among likely voters on whether to fire Newsom, despite thestate’s overwhelmingly Democratic tilt. It isstarting toshow withsome nervousness by Newsom. Vice President Kamala Harris, who wonstatewide in California three times, will campaign with Newsom next week, and President Joe Biden may visitsoon, too. While overallsupport for recalling Newsom has remainedsteady around 35 percent — about what former President Donald Trump earned in California last year — Republicans are far more motivated to turn out. Democrats, on the other hand, overwhelmingly assume Newsom will win and are telling pollsters that means they are less likely to bother.""The big question,"" according to Eric Schickler, a pollster at the University of California, Berkeley, is whether Newsom and his allies ""are able to get Democratic voters more engaged.""Newsom this month made California the firststate in the nation to require all K-12 teachers to be fully vaccinated orsubmit to mandatory weekly testing and has implemented new masking requirements onschool buses and in classrooms. The governor also was the first to require health care workersandstate employees to be vaccinated orsubmit to weekly testing.“I have no interest in taking us off the Covid cliff,”Newsom told a Bay Area TVstation, alluding tostates like Florida and Texas, where Republican governors have tried to prohibit localschools from implementing vaccine and mask mandates.""Just consider the Republican candidates,"" he added. ""Not only do they allshare one thing in common — theirsupport for [former President Donald] Trump — but they alsosupport eliminating mask mandates in our publicschools, eliminating vaccine verifications.""It’s an ironic turn of events for a governor whose job might not be in jeopardy had there not been a pandemic. The petition to recall Newsom, while not mentioning Covid-19,gained traction in the backlash to the first wave of lock downs and mask mandates Newsom implemented last year. Organizers were only able to collect the 1.5 million-plussignatures needed to trigger the recall election after a judge extended the deadline by four months, citing the pandemic’s impact on canvassing. And Newsom’s lowest political moment came when he defied his own restrictions and was caught dining inside without a mask at one of the nation is ritziest restaurants, The French Laundry, which further fueled the recall effort. In astate where Republicans are outnumbered 3 to 1,some recall proponents have tried to broaden their appeal by focusing on less polarized issues like homelessness, the rising cost of living, power blackouts, crime, watershortages and wildfires.“One of the challenges with these recall elections is people get grumpy and theystart to feel like they can cast votes out of grumpiness,”said David Atkins, one of California’s Democratic National Committee members. “What is happening with Covid is it makes thestakes clear. It makes it harder for Republicans to tap into that generalized grumpiness.”The governor and his allies are hoping to jolt awake Democrats and independents who have tuned out the race by warning them there is a real chance California could end up with a Republican governor. The quirk of the recall ballot is that if a majority of voters whoshow up on election daysay yes to recalling Newsom, it practically guarantees a Republican governor.""They actually could do it if Democrats do notshow up,so it is time to ring the alarm bells and let them know what is atstake,""said Dan Newman, a top political adviser to Newsom. ""There are just two very very different paths on how to end the pandemic.""Newman called the race a ""binary choice"" between Newsom and Larry Elder, a Black conservative talk radio host who is the clear polling leader among challengers. Elder is an appealing foil for Newsom in a Democratic-leaningstate. The longtime radio host, who helped former Trump adviserStephen Millerget hisstart in politics, has a long history of provocative comments about everything from working women to the minimum wage(he believes itshould be $0). A recentspat of negativestories about Elder has made Republicans think Newsom is worried about him gaining pollingstrength and is trying to push opposition research. Eldersaid he'd repeal Newsom is mask and vaccine mandates before breakfast on his first day in the governorship. While there are 46 candidates of various parties vying to replace Newsom, every leading Republican opposes mandates. Severalsay they favor astatewide ban on local mask and vaccine mandates, like Florida’s.“We must draw the line and protect people’s freedoms,”said John Cox, who was the GOP gubernatorial nominee in the last general election and is running again. Vaccine and mask opponents are a vocal minority, large enough to form the nucleus of the recall, but pollsshow most Californians favor an approach to the pandemic more like Newsom’s. California has one of the highest vaccination rates in the country, and 59 percent of respondents to a recentCBS News/YouGov polls aid people who refuse to get vaccinated are “putting people like me and my family at risk.” Just 27 percentsaid they respect the decision to not get theshot. Still, as Biden and other Democratslearned last year, turning out and even reaching voters during the pandemic is harder for Democrats,since their base takes the issue moreseriously.“We areso Covid-sensitive, our voters areso Covid-sensitive,”said Michael Trujillo, a Los Angeles-based Democraticstrategist, “but Republican volunteers are happily going knocking on doors and voters are happily opening their doors.”Democratssay they’ve had a harder time recruiting canvassers, with most volunteers preferring to make phone calls orsend text messages, which have beenshown to be less effective.

529,Kentucky AG Admits Homicide Charges Were Never Presented Shortly After Agreeing to Release Breonna Taylor Grand Jury Recordings,-7.33,48.0,https://atlantablackstar.com/2020/09/29/kentucky-ag-admits-homicide-charges-were-never-presented-shortly-after-agreeing-to-release-breonna-taylor-grand-jury-recordings,https://adfontesmedia.com/atlanta-black-star-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-29,15,"On thesame day Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron agreed to release grand jury recording for theBreonna Taylorcase after an anonymous grand juror filed a motion in court, he quietly dropped a bombshell: he never recommended a homicide charge to the grand jurors to consider against the Louisville Metro Police Department policemen involved in Taylor’sslaying. Cameron agreed to release the recordings on Monday, hours after the grand juror requested all recordings and transcripts from the proceedings be releasedso “the truth may prevail,” as reported by The Louisville Courier Journal.“The fullstory and absolute truth of how this matter was handled from beginning to end is now an issue of great public interest and has become a large part of the discussion of public trust throughout the country,” wrote Kevin Glogower, a lawyer representing the juror, wrote in court documents. The juror, who wishes to remain anonymous, also wants jurors to be allowed to give up their confidentialityso they canspeak freely about the proceedings. The request includes any talk about “any potential charges and defendants presented or not presented.”Cameron, likely anticipating that the grand jury proceedings would reveal which charges were not recommended,said in astatement about the grand jury recordings emailed to news outlets on Monday that homicide charges against the three LMPD officers were never on the table.“Our prosecutors presented all of the evidence, even though the evidencesupported that Sergeant Mattingly and Detective Cosgrove were justified in their use of force after having been fired upon by Kenneth Walker,” Cameronstated, referring to Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, two other officers who participated in theshooting. Neither of them were charged.“For that reason, the only charge recommended was wanton endangerment.”In last week’s news conference announcing the outcome of the grand jury proceeding, Cameron never mentioned whether that body was presented with homicide charges to consider. In Kentucky, like in many otherstates, a prosecutor does not have to wait for a grand jury indictment to bring charges against a defendant, nor is a prosecutor precluded from presenting charges to asecond orsubsequent grand juries if the initial one fails to indict on charges presented. The grand juror’s motion accused Cameron of using the grand jury “as ashield to deflect accountability and responsibility for those decisions” which planted “moreseeds of doubt in the process.”The motion added that Cameron has tried to lay the grand jury’s decisionsolely “at the feet of the grand jury while failing to answerspecific questions regarding the charges presented.”The “Attorney General Cameron attempted to make it very clear that the grand jury alone made the decision on who and what to charge basedsolely on the evidence presented to them.“The only exception to the responsibility he foisted upon the grand jurors was in hisstatement that they ‘agreed’ with his team’s investigation that Mattingly and Cosgrove were justified in their actions.”Last week, outragespread across the nation after the grand jury indicted former Louisville Metro Police Detective Brett Hankison on one count of wanton endangerment forshots that hit an apartment next door to Taylor’s home. Taylor died on March 13 after Hankison and two other officers firedshots into her apartment while executing a narcotics warrant related to her ex-boyfriend. Cameron previously had refused to release details related to the grand jurysession due tosupposed concerns about confidentiality and tainting of a potential jury pool.“Westand by our belief thatsuch a release could compromise the ongoing federal investigation and could have unintended consequencessuch as poisoning the jury pool,” Cameronsaid in Monday’sstatement. Despite his misgivings, he agreed to release the recordings on Wednesday to comply with an order issued by Jefferson County Circuit Judge Ann Bailey Smith, who ordered Monday: “The recording of the grand jury proceedingsshall be filed in the court file by noon of Wednesday this week.”Cameron, faced with the judge’s order, complied. “The Grand Jury is meant to be asecretive body,” hisstatementsaid. “It’s apparent that the public interest in this case isn’t going to allow that to happen. As thespecial prosecutor, our team has an ethical obligation not to release the recording from the Grand Jury proceedings, and westand by our belief thatsuch a release could compromise the ongoing federal investigation and could have unintended consequencessuch as poisoning the jury pool.”In astatement provided to Atlanta Black Star, Taylor family attorneys Ben Crump, Sam Aguiar and Lonita Baker called for the release of all transcripts for the proceedings.“Since the grand jury decision was announced, we’ve beensaying that Daniel Cameron clearly failed to present a comprehensive case thatsupported justice for Breonna. That conclusion issupported by the grand juror who came forward tosay that the attorney general misrepresented the grand jury’s deliberations,” thestatement read.“We fullysupport the call to release the entire proceeding transcript as the only way to know what evidence was presented and how the grand jury instructions led to this outcome. In America, law-abiding citizens — including Black citizens — have the right to live peacefully in their homes, without police breaking down their doors in the middle of the night, and they have a right to protect themselves and their property from intruders,” thestatement continued.“The police cannot claim their use of force was justified when they wrongly broke into Breonna’s apartment in the first place. We urge the Attorney General to release a COMPLETE and UNEDITED copy of the recording, along with any and all evidence in Bre’s case.”",2,2,Atlanta Black Star
530,Montgomery County issues new order to block in-person classes at private schools until October,-3.33,51.33,https://www.baltimoresun.com/coronavirus/bs-md-elrich-hogan-schools-20200805-2k6mwqglknf7rhqfxecf2id64e-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/baltimore-sun-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-05,24,"Montgomery County officials doubled down on their efforts to keep private and religiousschools closed to prevent thespread of the coronavirus, issuing a new order Wednesday to block in-person classes until October. That county has been in a dispute with Governor Larry Hogan for the lastseveral days over who has the authority to determine whether privateschools can bringstudents back to campus. Montgomery’s health officer, Dr. Travis Gayles,issued an order last week preventing any in-person classes through October 1. The Republican governor responded Monday with his own orders tripping health officers of their ability — which Hogan had extended earlier in the pandemic — to close or modify county rules forschool opening, with the goal of negating Montgomery County’s order. Gayles responded Wednesday evening with a fresh order to keep theschools closed, citing a different portion ofstate law that authorizes health officers to act to prevent thespread of communicable diseases.“The purpose behind what we’re doing is to keep kidssafe,” Gaylessaid earlier Wednesday. Gaylessaid the transmission rate and number of new cases in the county and the region remain too high tosafely openschools for in-person classes. Montgomery County has had nearly 18,000 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 755 deathssince the virus emerged in Maryland in March. It’ssecond only to Prince George’s County in number of cases and ranks first in thestate for related deaths. Most publicschoolsystems in Maryland, including Montgomery County, have chosen to offer online-only classes tostart theschool year, decisions that were made by local boards of education. Some privateschools, however,are planning to offer in-person instruction. Private and parochialschools argue their parents andstudents want in-person classes and theschools are better able to meetsafety recommendations. Non-publicschools typically have fewerstudents than publicschools, andsome have large campuses and additional facilities that allowstudents andstaff to maintain their distance from each other. The dispute over limiting in-person classes is another example of howstudentswill have different access to education during the pandemic depending on where they live, their family wealth or whichschool they attend. Montgomery County, withsome of thestate’s best public and privateschools, has become the epicenter of the growing national debate. A group of Montgomery privateschool parents is challenging Gayles’ order in federal court. A hearing on a request for a preliminary injunction isscheduled for August 14. County Executive Marc Elrichsaid Hogan’s action tostrip health officers of the authority to proactive lyshut downschoolsshowed “no logic.”“I wassurprised. I don’t think it was appropriate. I don’t think it issupported by data,”said Elrich, a Democrat, during an online briefing with reporters Wednesday.“It makes nosense to have a policy to, on one hand,say: ‘I’m perfectly fine with the entire publicschoolsystem of every county that wants to close it to close.’ And then, on the other hand, justsaying: ‘I’m OK with privateschools opening,'” Elrichsaid. “There is no logic.”Elrichsaid children and employees at privateschools are just as at risk of contracting andspreading the corona virus as children and employees at publicschools.“I don’t understand theseparation of the problem as moreserious for one group than another group,”said Elrich, a former publicschool teacher. Hoganspokesman Mike Ricci responded to Elrich’s comments with astatement: “The governor has made himself clear: private and parochialschools deserve thesame opportunity publicschools have had to make reopening decisions based on public health guidelines. The county’s blanket closure mandate was overly broad and inconsistent with the powers intended to be delegated to the county health officer.”",2,2,Baltimore Sun

Globally, the number of deaths is at .03% of the world’s population, with one in 46 infected dying, a 2.16% death rate. Death rates have actually gone down as more cases have been reported, and more people recover with improved treatments, even though the overall death toll continues to climb. That rate would be even lower as the actual number of cases around the world is believed to be much higher than reported — perhaps 10 times higher in the US, according to the CDC — given testing limitations and the many mild cases that have gone unreported or unrecognized.

That’s not the case anymore. In the fight over Joe Biden’s agenda on Capitol Hill, the progressive caucus hasstood their ground, with roughly four dozen members who are ready to vote down the moderates’ prized infrastructure bill until ab roader reconciliation billpasses. On Thursday night, Nancy Pelosi and Democratic leaders punted the infrastructure over the progressive holdouts. In particular, they do not trust Senate moderatesJoe ManchinandKyrsten Sinematosupport a reconciliation bill and its $3.5 trillion price tag andsee the bipartisan bill, which bothsupport, as leverage. Leadership just made it official: no votes tonight. Have a good one, everybodypic.twitter.com/GE1LM5qtELThe Housestayed insession late Thursday night as frantic negotiations were underway to find a formula that would allow Manchin and Sinema tosupport the reconciliation bill and thus free progressives to vote for the infrastructure legislation by Pelosi’s deadline of thatsame night. Negotiations continued Friday, with White Housestaff joining in, with the hopes of a deal being cut before the week is out. The left’s distrust of Manchin and Sinema had been fueled by the duo playing coy about what provisions, if any, they wanted tosee in a reconciliation bill. On Manchin, at least, progressives have madesome incremental progress. He made his preconditions for a reconciliation bill public on Thursday,saying he wanted $1.5 trillion inspending. Sinema has not made her demands public, although aspokesman for hersaid in astatement thatshe “continues to engage directly in good-faith discussions” with Biden and Schumer to “find common ground.”In recent days, members of the media haveswarmedPramila Jayapal, the leader of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, with thesame intensity once reserved for a key moderate like Manchin. “Love it or hate it, Jayapal is the first Progressive Caucus chair to make the position relevant inshaping the debate in years,” one veteran Democratic aide observed with admiration. Their increased clout is ashift from the Obama years, which conditioned Democrats to expect the left to crumble under Biden during debates over Obamacare and the 2009stimulus. “Some of our progressive values have become quite mainstream,”said Jared Huffman, a five-term Democrat from California. “I also think thatsometimes in the past, our progressive community/caucus might have been treated as, or assumed to be, adversaries and outsiders and not had aseat at the table. And I think we’ve been treated as allies by the administration and by everyone else.”Progressives are also buoyed by thesense of fatalism inso many Democrats about their party’s chances in midterm elections andsee the reconciliation bill they want as a rare chance to pass transformativesocial legislation before Republicans return to power.“For 40 years before Joe Biden took office, I think Democrats controlled the presidency, the House, and the Senate for four total years, two with Clinton and two with Obama,” explained Andy Levin of Michigan on Wednesday. “And, despite those four little years — and even during them — the working people of the country have gotten theshort end of thestick,so that they don’t even believe in government. They are like, ‘What is government doing for me?’ This, the Build Back Better Act, doesso much more for the people.”Thesituation in the Democratic caucus bears a resemblance to the arch-conservative House Freedom Caucus, which notoriously tried to drag every key bill to the right and fueled governmentshutdowns and debt-limitstandoffs in the process, against the wishes of Republican leadership. “The knock on the Freedom Caucus is they know how tostart a fight but not how to end one,”Matt Gaetzof Florida, a member of that group, told Intelligencer. “The current energy from progressivesseems tosuggest that they will end it, they will bring down the infrastructure bill if it doesn’t pave the way to theirspending ambitions.”The lessons from the right go both ways, according to Gaetz. “The progressives trying to get their way now have observed the flaws that the Freedom Caucus used to try to get their way on health care,” hesaid. “The Freedom Caucus fundamentally ended up empowering McCain in the end to kill [Obamacare repeal] and I don’t think progressives want to do that with Manchin and Sinema.”Bysubmitting your email, you agree to ourTermsandPrivacy Noticeand to receive email correspondence from us.",1,1,New York Magazine

534,"Decade After WikiLeaks Published Iraq War Logs, Assange Is In Prison",-13.0,44.67,https://shadowproof.com/2020/10/22/ten-years-wikileaks-published-iraq-war-logs/,https://adfontesmedia.com/shadowproof-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-22,22,"The Iraq War Logs published by WikiLeaks revealed 15,000 civilian deaths that were previously unknown. They also exposed torture that the USs military instructed officers to ignore.“In our release of these 400,000 documents about the Iraq War, the intimate detail of that war from the US perspective,” WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange hoped to correctsome of the attacks on the truth that occurred “before the war, during the war, and which [had] continued onsince the war officially concluded.”“Thestated aims for going into that war, of improving the human rightssituation, improving the rule of law, did not eventuate,” Assange added. “In terms of raw numbers of people arbitrarily killed, [that] worsened thesituation in Iraq.”Ten years after their release, Assange is in Belmarsh prison in London and faces an extradition request from the US government on charges that he violated the Espionage Act when he engaged in journalism. John Sloboda, the co-founder of Iraq Body Count, collaborated with WikiLeaks and analyzed the 400,000-plus US military incident reports disclosed to them by US Army whistle blower Chelsea Manning. In September and during Assange’s extradition trial, Sloboda testified that a decade later, “The War Logs remain the onlysource of information regarding many thousands of violent civilian deaths in Iraq between 2004 and 2009.”Iraq Body Count estimated the reports described 23,000 violent incidents in which Iraqi civilians were killed or bodies were found that were previously unknown. “The majority of these new deaths came fromsmall incidents of one to three deaths”—the very kinds of incidents that attract that least amount of media coverage.“If there are othersources of information or analyses being held within the US government regarding the deaths of civilians in Iraq that were revealed in the Iraq War Logs, they are certainlystill being withheld from the public.”Sloboda acknowledged the US government is likelystill keeping data on Iraqi civilian deathssecret.“By making this information public,” Slobodasuggested, “Manning and Assange were carrying out a duty on behalf of the victims and the public that the US government was failing to carry out.”Phil Shiner of Public Interest Lawyers in the United Kingdom broke the revelations into three categories:—unlawful killings of civilians—indiscriminate attacks or the unjustified use of lethal force against civilians—horrendous abuse and torture of Iraqis by the Iraqi National Guard or the Iraqi Police Service, torture of Iraqis whilst in UK custody (presumably, whilst in the custody of US and other coalition forces custody as well)[Note: Shiner’s firm represented Iraqis, who were alleged victims of war crimes.]An order calledFrago 242, which the US and the UK apparently adopted, excused officers from taking responsibility for torture by Iraqi military orsecurity forces. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism (TBIJ)found““over 300 classified reports in the Iraq War Logs alleging abuse by coalition forces on Iraqi prisoners after the Abu Ghraibscandal.”In the timespan covered by the logs, “some 180,000 Iraqis were imprisoned.” Approximately one out of 50 Iraqi males were imprisoned.“More than 1,300 individual cases of torture and abuse carried out by Iraqis on Iraqi prisoners at policestations and army bases” were tallied, implicating coalition forces that likely witnessed or reported on the incidents. Onewar logo n alleged detainee abuse from September 27, 2006, indicates no further investigation was necessary because coalition forces were not involved. It details abuse by Iraqi Police. Another war log from August 10, 2006, contains allegations of detainee abuse by Iraqi Police in the form of a “victimsummary“:A war log on October 31, 2006,containsallegationsshared by asoldier against a platoon’s handling of detainees. It indicates the driver of a vehicle carrying detainees would “call back to warn thesoldiers he was about tostop abruptly. Thesoldiers would hold on and watch as the detainees [were] propelled forward.”Soldiers in the back would then “take turns punching the detainees,” the war log furtherstates. Interrogatorsthreatenedto hand detainees over to the “Wolf Brigade” or “Wolf Battalion.”According toThe Guardian, the Wolf Brigade was “created andsupported by the US in an attempt to re-employ elements of Saddam Hussein’s Republican Guard, this time to terrorize insurgents.”“Members typically wore red berets,sunglasses and balaclavas, and drove out on raids in convoys of Toyota Landcruisers. They were accused by Iraqis of beating prisoners, torturing them with electric drills, andsometimes executingsuspects.”The Iraq War Logs were ashining example of what media organizations may accomplish when collaborating. The Guardian, Der Spiegel (Germany), Sveriges Television (Sweden), Le Monde (France), Al Jazeera, Channel 4, and BBC Radio all reported on the material. Patrick Cockburn, Middle East correspondent for The Independent,submitted testimony in Assange’s extradition case that addressed the impact of the Iraq War Logs, including how it aided his efforts to document the carnage.“Rereading these documents now, I’mstruck again by the constipated military-bureaucratic prose, with itssinister dehumanizing acronyms,” Cockburn declared. “Killing people is referred to as an EOF (“Escalation of Force”),something that happened frequently at US military checkpoints when nervous USsoldiers directed Iraqi drivers tostop or go with complex handsignals that nobody understood.”Cockburn highlighted an example that occurred on the outskirts of Fallujah when a woman in a car was killed and her three daughters and husband were wounded.“The US marine on duty opened fire because he was ‘unable to determine the occupants of the vehicle due to the reflection of thesun coming off the windshield,'” according to the log.“Another report marks the moment when USsoldiersshot dead a man who was ‘creeping up behind theirsniper position,’ only to learn later that he was their own unit’s interpreter,” Cockburn noted.“These reports are thesmall change of war, but collectively they convey its reality far better than even the most well-informed journalistic accounts,” Cockburn concluded. “Those twoshootings were a thousand times repeated, though the reports were rare in admitting that the victims were civilians. More usually, the dead were automatically identified as ‘terrorists’ caught in the act, regardless of evidence to the contrary.”While presenting evidence that the US government is targeting Assange for his political opinions, Paul Rodgers, professor emeritus at Bradford University in England, highlighted aspeech Assange delivered at a Stop the War Coalition Rally in Trafalgar Square on August 8, 2011. Assange referred to the “information [WikiLeaks] revealedshowing the everydaysqualor and barbarity of war, informationsuch as the individual deaths of over 130,000 people in Iraq, individual deaths that were keptsecret by the US military, who denied that they have counted the deaths of civilians.”“I want to tell you what I think is the way that wars come to be and that wars can come undone,” Assange proclaimed. “If wars can bestarted bylies, peace can bestarted by truth.”*Marjorie Cohn, professor of law at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law and former president of the National Lawyers Guild, joined me for a conversation on the Iraq War Logs anniversary.“I want to tell you what I think is the way that wars come to be and that wars can come undone,” Assange proclaimed. “If wars can bestarted bylies, peace can bestarted by truth.”*Marjorie Cohn, professor of law at the Thomas Jefferson School of Law and former president of the National Lawyers Guild, joined me for a conversation on the Iraq War Logs anniversary.",2,1,Shadowproof

540,A new law is about to make Texas even more gun crazy,-11.17,33.17,https://www.mic.com/p/a-new-law-is-about-to-make-texas-even-more-gun-crazy-80077967,https://adfontesmedia.com/mic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-24,25,"Texas this weekstands on the brink of allowing just about anyone to carry a handgun, regardless of whether or not they have a permit, in a move that could dramatically increase the proliferation of firearms in astate which already enjoys a particularly trigger-happy reputation. By a vote of 82-62 on Sunday evening, the Texas House of Representatives approved a compromise version of HB 1927, which would allow most Texans to carry handguns without a permit. The compromise bill marks the beginning of the end of a fraught legislative process that began in April, when theHouse passed the initial version of the bill. The bill initially facedstiff challenges in thestate Senate, where aseries of proposed amendments prompted the House to reject earlier iterations of the legislation. Sunday is vote, however, marks a breakthrough in thatstalemate, with the Senate is widely expected approval the last remaining obstacle between the bill and Republican Governor Greg Abbott issignature. Abbott has previouslystated he will, indeed,sign the legislation into law.""By working together, the House and Senate willsend Governor Abbott thestrongest Second Amendment legislation in Texas history, and protect the right of law-abiding Texans to carry a handgun as they exercise their God-given right toself-defense and the defense of their families,"" Republicanstate Rep. Matt Schaefer, who authored the legislation,said in astatement announcing the compromise bill. According to Texas Lt. Governor Dan Patrick, the Texas Senate will vote — and almost certainly pass — the bill early this week.""HB 1927 is a historic bill and a national model,"" Patricksaid in astatement. ""It includes the thinking of national gun rights advocates and many in Texas law enforcement and affirms our commitment to protect the rights of gun owners and thesafety of those in law enforcement.""According to the, the compromises agreed upon in the legislation include provisions allowing police to question people based on their carrying a handgun, tougher penalties for felons who are caught carrying a handgun, and an optional free online gunsafety course to be offered by the Texas Department of Public Safety. Texas alreadyhasaconspicuously laxsuite of gun laws to begin with,so muchso that its gun culture has taken on a life of its own as a unique feature of the Lone Star State. Accordingly, thestate hasseen multiple massshootings in the pastseveral years — a fact not lost on Democratic lawmakers, whospoke out against the permit-less cary legislation on Sunday.""This is our firstsessionsince those tragedies [inOdessaandEl Paso], and this is our response, a bill to allow permit-less carry,""state Rep. Chris Turnersaid during debate on the legislation. ""A bill tosay you don’t have to have any training to carry a handgun in thestate of Texas. And I can not imagine a worseslap in the face to all those people who have advocated, to the victims and to the family of those victims.""Abbott, however, has come outstrongly for the bill,saying late last month that ""Isupport it, and I believe itshould reach my desk, and weshould have 'constitutional carry' in Texas.""",1,1,Mic

Art Pavelski, an upstate New York Pastor of Pierce Hill Christian Fellowship explained, “Christ is neither conservative or liberal and that Christ is both.”But there is fear that the politics of our era would affect the message of Christianity. As of now, the big tech censorship of people like Donald Trump or of Parler has not hit the church. But many are concerned that might be the nextstep. Pavelskisaid, “It could affect the church. If it gets to the point where you aresaying that when you talk about Christian viewpoints and it is considered to be too offensive. That could be the case.”There would be a big reason the big tech firms out there would censor Christianity in America.“These Twitter accounts, Facebook, whatever thesocial media is not owned by Christians,” Pavelskisaid. “It’s not a Christian company. So, you cannot expect them to act in any kind of a Christian manner. That, that’s just the way it is.”There is also another reason the church is on the lookout for possible big tech censorship.“Maybe people who wouldsay that thatsome of the things that the Christians talk about would be inappropriate,”said Pavelski. “It would be whatsome would consider hatespeech.”As of now, Pavelskisaid the attack on Christianity has not grown too out of control in America.“I haven’tseen anything compared to any kind of attack on Christians like it has been in the first century, where Christians are fed to the lions. There aren’t any Christians being fed to lions in the USs that I know of.”Pavelski also notes that Christians are persecuted in other parts of the world, including those with a one-partysystem.",1,0,Daily Torch
542,Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kayleigh McEnany Were Trump is Enthusiastic Cleanup Crew,-19.67,24.0,https://jezebel.com/sarah-huckabee-sanders-and-kayleigh-mcenany-were-trumps-1846070383,https://adfontesmedia.com/jezebel-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-20,15,"There are many low lights from the Trump regime, but there’s one in particular that will haunt me: Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the first mother toserve as White House Press Secretary,standing at her podium and announcing: “I’m not aware of the Attorney General’s comments or what he would be referencing; I cansay that it is very Biblical to enforce the law.” She was responding to a question about Jeff Sessions’ defense of the Trump administration’s familyseparation law. Along with Kayleigh McEnany, Sanders was one of two high-profile women whoserved as the Press Secretary under Trump, charged with advancing his narrative day in, day out. As opposed to the bumbling Sean Spicer, they did their jobs verysuccessfully. (Stephanie Grisham gave briefingsso rarelyshe never achieved thesame name recognition as her fellows.) Sanders and McEnany were twosides of thesame coin—onesomewhatsullen, the other almost chipper asshe painted the press corps as enemies of the people—women who both distinguished themselves as not just willing, but enthusiastic champions of Trump. Goodbye for now to the cheerleaders from hell. As a 2018 profile in theexplained, Sanders was brought aboard the Trump campaign as a way tostrengthen his appeal to women and evangelicals. Already experienced as a conservative campaign operative,she became a TVsurrogate for him, delivering his pitch to whitesuburban women just like herself, and her aggressive posture on Trump’s behalf got her a gig in the White House communications department under Sean Spicer, replacing him when he left. It wasn’t justsimply thatshe was willing to fight; as a 2018 Politicoprofilepointed out, her technique was as much about extinguishing fires bysucking the air out of White House briefing room: “The moment Sanders unleashes her trademark monotone, the energy drains.”McEnany—also a familiar face on Fox News—followed the playbook left by Sanders, a very evangelical brand of combative,self-righteous femininity deployed to defend her boss’s every move and advance his agenda through the coronavirus and the generation election and will finish out Trump’s term. While their personal presentation was vastly different, Sanders and McEnany are both the absolute embodiment of the white women who do their utmost to uphold whitesupremacy and patriarchy, who cheerfully do it in a brightly coloredsheath dress, while flashing pictures of their kids and talking about how their most important job title is “mom.” When called out, they positioned themselves as innocent victims, virtuous women under attack by the mob; think of Sanders getting politely asked to leave a restaurant and both complaining on Twitter and devoting time to the incident from her podium. They were Trump’s cleanup crew, the ones who followed behind his Twitter tempests to bolster whatever claims their boss had made. “It is very Biblical to enforce the law,”said Sanders when asked about familyseparation. And, too, Sanders and McEnany—as much as any other individuals in the administration—were his public-facingstorytellers. Day in, day out, with discipline and the power of the White House briefing room podium, they advanced Trump’s narrative about how lying leftist media was the enemy of people. Even if Joe Biden could roll back everysingle policy ever adopted by the Trump administration on his first day in office, that legacy will live on, in a nation whose citizens no longerseem to agree on basic facts of reality. Of course, they won’tsuffer much for their role in all this—will anybody? Theystill have innumerable fans, and there’s always a job waiting at Fox News and the weird universe of the conservative conferencescene. But the most fitting punishment for their work would be a lifetime of waking up from nightmares about beingseparated from their own children—to know, even for a moment, the absoluteshrieking desperation of being unable to find them and to plead with aseries of looming,stone-faced officials who just don’t care.",0,0,Jezebel
543,Gun Shops Flouted State Closure Orders in April as Industry Notched Another Big Month,-7.0,48.67,https://www.thetrace.org/2020/05/coronavirus-gun-sales-state-closures-background-checks/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-trace-bias-and-reliability/,2020-05-14,16,"Gunstores inseveralstates have defied orders to close their doors as the coronavirus pandemic drives historic demand for firearms, according to background check data maintained by the Federal Bureau of Investigation and interviews withshop owners. Governors of fivestates — Massachusetts, Michigan, New Mexico, New York, and Washington — ordered gun dealers to close in April understatewidestay-at-home directives. But FBI data from Aprilshows that dealers in thosestates initiated tens of thousands of gun background checks. In Washington State, where gunshops wereshuttered by a March 25stay-at-homeorder, 42,000 checks were initiated in April. Some businessessell guns in addition to food and other household items that have been deemed essential — Walmart and hardwarestores may have firearms departments, for example. At least two of the fivestates — Michigan and New York — permit thesestores to continueselling guns under their orders, which may explain a portion of the checks in the FBI’s data. However, big-boxstores typically account for only a fraction of all gunsales. And phone calls to more than 50 dedicated gun dealers confirmed that many remained open in defiance ofstate orders to close. During April, the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) processed 2.9 million checks, making it the fourth highest month on record, dating back to 1998. The Trace compared the number of background checks for handguns, long guns, and transactions involving both types of gun with thesame figures for 2019. Our analysis found that insome of thestates wherestores were ordered closed, dealers conducted more checks in April 2020 than during thesame month in 2019. In Washington State, for instance, checks increased 45 percent over April 2019, and in New Mexico, they increased 15 percent. In Michigan, checks increased by 112 percent, but at least part of thesurge may be attributed to a March 3rulingby the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, according to aspokesperson for the Michigan State Police. That rulingsaid that firearms dealers cannot accept a Michigan-issued concealed carry permit in lieu of conducting a background check, meaning that gun transfers to permit holders, which were previously not counted in the FBI data, are now included. Anthony Coulson, a former Drug Enforcement Administration agent who is an expert on the background checksystem,said the increased gunsales renderedstates’stay-at-home orders “meaningless.”“What’s the motivation for implementing a nonessential order if it’s not going to be enforced and has no impact?” Coulson asked. The twostates that didn’t register any year-over-year increase in firearm background checks were New York and Massachusetts. In New York, the number of checks hovered just below normal levels. In Massachusetts, background checkssaw asignificant year-over-year decrease, falling 66 percent. Store owners offered a litany of reasons they are violating the orders. Some considered them a breach of their Second Amendment rights. Some felt emboldened by a March 28 revision to Department of Homeland Security guidance that deemed the gun industry an essential business during the pandemic. The DHS guidance, which is nonbinding, was heavily pushed by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the industry trade group. Otherstore ownerssaid they felt that, if they took reasonable precautions, they could operatesafely. Still otherssaid they considered their businesses exempt fromstatewide restrictions.“I wouldsay that I’msupposed to be closed,”said Dennis Brown, who owns Shoreline Tactical, a gunshop in Shoreline, Washington. But withso manystores closed, “people can’t get their guns. So I’ve elected tostay open on an appointment-only basis.”Defiantstores more often than not went unpunished, The Trace found, despite proclamations fromseveral governors thatstates would mete out harsh penalties to noncompliant businesses of all types. The April background check numbers continue a trend firstspotted by The Trace in early March, when gunstore owners along the West Coastsaw asurge in Asian-American customers fearful of xenophobic backlash to the virus. By the end of the month, fears ofsocial unrestspread to the general public, driving a historicsales bump. The FBIprocesseda record number of checks in March, outstripping the prior high by 12 percent. As USA TODAY hasreported, the increase has overwhelmed the federal background checksystem, prompting the FBI to warn gun retailers thatscreenings could take up to a month to complete. An FBIspokespersonsaid NICS “remains fully operational and will continue to process requests.”In each of the fivestates where gunstores were deemed nonessential, The Trace contacted retailers to inquire whether they were open. In Michigan, 15 of 20storessaid that they were open to walk-in customers. The remaining five did not answer their phones. In Washington State, all 10 dealers contacted were alsoselling guns, butsome emphasized that they required customers toschedule appointments to ensuresocial distancing. In New Mexico, 9 out of 10 dealers contacted were open throughout April; in New York, 4 out of 10stores contactedsaid thesame. The remainingstores in bothstates did not answer calls. Only in Massachusetts did most gunstores appear to be closed. Of 20 firearm retailers contacted in thestate, only one — in Montague — reported being open. Three others declined to answer questions; the rest did not answer calls. Shawn Brancheau, who runs Guns Galore in Fenton, Michigan,said that he considers hisstore an essential business even though Governor Gretchen Whitmer hassaid the opposite.“Home defense needs to be a consideration of the governor at a time like this,” hesaid, adding that he felt justifiedstaying open because of the Department of Homeland Security’s March guidance. He questioned the constitutionality of any order that would require gunstores to close andsaid local police had already been in hisstore toshop, and took no action.“Either there is no Second Amendment or you have the right to bear arms,” Brancheausaid. Steve Hayes, an owner of Bob’s Gun and Tackle Shop Inc. in Hastings, Michigan,said he understood thatstate orderssuperseded the federal guidance, butsaid Michigan’s order was too ambiguous. A call to thestate Attorney General’s Office, hesays, provided little clarity.“Local authorities are giving different answers,” hesaid. “It’s been very confusing for a lot ofstore owners, and probably for customers, too, when theysee onestoreshut and onestore open.”Hayessaid he received a written exemption from his local police department allowing him tostay open, but declined to provide a copy of the document. Calls to the Barry County Sheriff’s Department, which has jurisdiction over Hayes’store, were not returned. Otherstore ownerssaid their livelihoods depend upon keeping their doors open. Chris Burnett, who operates Kokopelli Pawn and Gun in Aztec, New Mexico, opened hisshop just before the coronavirus reached the US Hesays the New Mexico State Police have visited three times in the last month, instructing him to close hisstore. On the third visit, troopers fined him $100 and warned him that continued noncompliance could result in asix-month jailsentence. Still, hestayed open. “I just threw everything into my business,” hesaid. “I have two little girls at home to feed.”Some retailerssaid that even instates where the closure orders were unambiguous, they had found wiggle room to continue operating. Ryan Blake, who runs High Plains Gun Shopsix hours east of Burnett’sstore, in Clovis, New Mexico,said hisstore had been approved tostay open by local authorities.“We’re essentially a department of an essential businesssince we’re located in a hardwarestore,” hesaid. “So we’ve fallen under a gray area.”Likewise, Paul Smith, who runs S&S Gun Sales in Auburn, New York,said he found a loophole in Governor Andrew Cuomo’s order.“We were not originally on the list of essential businesses, but being asingle proprietor gunstore owner, I realized I could be open when I choose to,” hesaid. New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham’s office, which has the authority to issue exemptions to New Mexico’sstay-at-home order, did not respond to requests for comment. In New York, aspokesperson for the Empire State Development Corporation, which determines which businesses are considered essential under Cuomo’s order,said that gunstores, like all nonessential retail, were permitted to have one person in theshop to fulfill online orders. As USA TODAY hasreported, manystates havestruck a hard tack on businesses violatingstay-at-home orders, threatening fines and criminal charges for those who ignore initial warnings. But noncompliant firearm retailers appear to have largely avoidedsuch penalties outside of New Mexico. Aspokesperson for the New Mexico State Policesaid thatsix gun dealers there were issued cease-and-desist letters in April. In Michigan, for example, aspokesperson for thestate’s Attorney General’s OfficetoldThe Detroit Free Pressthat nonessential businesses could face forced closures and up to 90 days in jail for refusing to comply with the governor’s order. The Michigan State Police recently cited an Owosso barbershop for noncompliance, asking it to close or face harsher penalties. Butseveral of the Michigan gun retailers interviewed for thisstorysaid that local authorities were aware of their operations and had taken no action. When provided background check datasuggesting noncompliance among gunstores in thestate, aspokesperson for the Michigan Attorney General’s Officesaid that enforcement was being handled at the local level. He added: “There has been nothing in Governor Whitmer’s executive orders that hasspecifically referenced firearm retailers.”In Washington, Governor Jay Insleeoutlineda three-tier penaltysystem for offending businesses: one violation earned a warning; another led to citations and possible business license revocation; one more could result in criminal charges. But news media reportssuggest that few if any Washington State businesses have been hit withsevere penalties. The Seattle TimesandKOMO TV Newshave reported on lax enforcement efforts for noncompliant businesses like gyms and constructionsites. According to records obtained from the Washington Military Department, which receives complaints about compliance in thestate,several gunstores also have continued to operate after allegations of noncompliance. One, Lynnwood Guns and Ammunition, was thesubject of more than 20 complaints in thestate’s database, all of which alleged large crowds and a lack of enforcement ofsocial distancing requirements. One complainant alleged that they had confronted thestore’s proprietor andshown her that gunstores are not essential per the governor’s order. “She asked me to leave,” the complaint reads. A representative from Lynnwood Guns and Ammunition declined to comment. Overall, the Military Department received more than 200 complaints about noncompliant gunstoressince thestate’sstay-at-home order took effect on March 25th – and more than 100 requests from retailers for exemptions from the order. It’s unclear from the records whether any of those exemptions were granted. In Massachusetts, both the State Police and the Attorney’s General Office directed questions about compliance to the Governor’s Office, which did not respond to multiple requests for comment about thestate’s enforcement efforts. The Massachusetts Department of Healthsaid enforcement was handled by municipalities;spokes people for police departments in Worcester and Framingham reported that gunstores in those cities were all compliant with the order. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the nation’s gun enforcement agency,said that violations ofstate and local laws could put dealers’ federal licenses at risk. Applicants must affirm that they are in compliance with local andstate laws before licenses are conferred and every three years when licenses are renewed. Licensestatus for dealers charged with local offenses, the ATFsaid, likely would be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. The National Rifle Association referred questions to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. There, General Counsel Larry Keanesaid it was “notsurprising” that gunsales did notsuffer instates where firearms dealers were restricted or prohibited from operating during the health emergency. Keanesaid that local enforcement of thestate executive orders has not been consistent across thestates.“Insome areas, localsheriffs are not going to force gunshops to close because that’s where law enforcement buys equipment to do the job,” hesaid. “We are aware that local law enforcement have been advising dealers insome cases not to close because that’s where they are buying ammunition and firearms.”Keanesaid the foundation has made no effort to advise dealers on actual operations. Rather, hesaid the group has provided the industry with a running list of orders approved by thestate, including the essential business operations recognized in those jurisdictions.“We are not telling people to open; we are not telling people to close,” Keanesaid. “We’re just providing access to good information.”Christian Heyne, the vice president of policy for the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence called gunstores’ disobedience deeply concerning. The USs relies on gunstores, as federally licensed businesses, to followstate and federal guidelines to ensure thesafety of communities across the country, hesaid. “So it is incredibly alarming to think that there are a number of gun dealers that are essentially going rogue.”Meanwhile, the NRA hasvigorouslycondemnedstates that ordered gun retailers toshutter and filed lawsuits against governors inNew MexicoandNew York. MassachusettsandMichiganalso face lawsuits over their orders. Asstates phase in their reopening plans, thesituation for gunsales is rapidly changing. On May 1, New Mexico’s governorsaid gunstores could reopen on an appointment-only basis. On May 7, a federal judge in Massachusetts ruled that thestate’sshutdown of gunstores was unconstitutional. Stores there officially reopened for business on May 9.",2,2,The Trace

The Center concluded that those young voters, and particularly young people of color and women, may have helped put Biden over the edge in crucial battlegroundstates, based on an analysis of votes counted by midday Friday. The Tufts’ center estimated the youthshare of the vote in the 2020 election at 17 percent, compared to 16 percent in the 2016 presidential election and13 percent in the 2018 midterms, based on the 2020 VoteCast from the Associated Press, the National Election Pool exit poll from Edison Research and its own analyses of census population data. That figure could change as more data becomes available and the election comes to a close. The center, a non-partisan, independent research organization focused on youth civic engagement, also projected that once all votes are counted, youth turnout may rise to 53 to 56 percent, compared to46 percent in the 2016 election and36 percent in the 2018 midterms. That would represent the highest youth voter turnoutsince at least 1984. Please take a look at the new openings in our newsroom. Young Black, Asian and Latino voterssupported Biden over Trump by margins of 77, 72 and 49 points respectively. By comparison, young white voterssupported Biden over Trump by a margin of only 6 points. Support for the two candidates also divided along gender-based lines within racial and ethnic groups, with young white women preferring Biden over Trump by a 13-point margin, while young white men preferred Trump over Biden by a 6-point margin. The center’s analysis also foundsubstantial pro-Biden youth voter turnout in key battlegroundstates, including in closely-watched Georgia, where youth comprised 21 percent of the vote and gave Biden a 19-point edge over Trump. Specifically, young Black voters, who favored Biden over Trump by an 82-point margin, “put Georgia in play,” the centersaid in its analysis. With a recountunderway, Biden currently leads in Georgia by just over 4,000 votes. The center estimated that youth voter turnout across the 11 crucial battlegroundstates of Arizona, Georgia, Iowa, North Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Montana, Colorado, Wisconsin, Texas and South Carolina could rise to 51 to 53 percent by the election’s end.“In many ways, the energy young people have brought throughout this election cycle—that will have catapulted Joe Biden into the presidency if we get that result” and given him a “climate mandate” in office, Varshini Prakash, co-founder of the Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate organization,said at a press conference on Thursday. Prakash added that Sunrise and allied climate and progressive organizations played a critical role in making a youth-powered Biden victory possible by pushing for the Green New Deal and advocating for climate more broadly. For young voters across the politicalspectrum,shesaid, climate is “essentially a litmus test for the 2020 election.”Garrett Blad, aspokesperson for the Sunrise Movement,said Biden’s use of climate change as a “closing argument” in advertisements inswingstates down the election’s finalstretch testified to the group’ssuccess inshaping climate as a dominant issue in the Democratic Party and national political dialogue.“This is going tosoundsosimple but when a campaign is actually talking with young people publicly, I think that matters a lot,”said Abby Kiesa, the Tufts’ center’s deputy director, who attributed Biden’s favorability among young voters in part to his effort to appeal directly to youth from early on in his campaign after the primary. Kiesa added that young voters could distinguish authentic appeals from political rhetoric. “Young people aren’t dumb; they know whensomeone’s just out to get their vote,”shesaid. Blad offered asimilar analysis. “To Biden’s credit, like a lot of politicians don’t do, he listened to young people,”said Blad. Hesaid he thought Biden’s heavy communications about climate change was a driving force behind the vast up tic kin his favorability among young voters between May and October. Zanagee Artis, co-founder of Zero Hour, a youth climate justice organization,said the Unity Task Force on Climate Change Biden formed with Sen. Bernie Sanders, which included Green New Deal champions Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Sunrise’s Prakash,signalled the former vice president’s willingness to listen to and work with young people. Though Biden’s refusal to commit to a ban on f racking and fully embrace the Green New Deal frustrated many young progressive climate activists, Artissaid he felt encouraged by howsuccessful the youth climate movement had been in pushing Biden to adopt a much bolder climate policy plan than he would have otherwise. Artis was amongseveral climate activists whosaid youth helped propel Joe Biden into office on the promise that his presidency would deliver not only bold action, butspecifically climate justice. Rather than talkstrictly aboutscience or decarbonization, Bidenspoke about climate in terms of green job creation and investment in marginalized communities—language that helped energize young people who had coalesced around Sanders in the early Democratic primaries.“Climate is a mobilizing issue because climate is an intersectional issue,”said Saad Amer, an environmental activist and director of Plus1Vote, a youth voter mobilization organization. Hesaid climate was inseparable from racial justice and health equity. Alex Leichenger,strategic communications manager at NextGen America, an organization of young voters created to elect pro-climate Democrats,said Biden’s focus on environmental justice as part of his climate policy may help explain his highersupport among young people of color and young women. Research has found that people of color andspecifically,young people of color, are more likely to be concerned about climate change. The center’s analysis of APVoteCast datashows young Biden voters were more likely than young Trump voters tosay coronavirus, racism and climate change were top issues facing the country by 21-point, 14-point and 9-point margins, respectively, with young Trumpsupporters beingsignificantly more likely to prioritize the economy and jobs. That disparity reflects the gap between Biden, who linked climate to health and environmental racism, and Trump, who has continuously denied thescience around the climate and Covid-19 crises while painting climate action as a threat to people’s jobs in the fossil fuel industry. Leichengersaid he looked forward toseeing more data on the breakdown of youth voter turnout to better understand how racial and gender disparities affected young people’ssupport for Biden over Trump, along with any disparities between Gen Z and millennial voting trends. Beyond having the right messaging, Biden’s campaign may have benefitedsubstantially from concerted organizing efforts by young climate activists to get out their peers’ votes. Danielle Deiseroth, a climate data analyst for the progressive think tank Data for Progress,said hundreds of thousands ofpostcardsSunrisesent out to young voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan, North Carolina and Florida were emblematic of the large-scale, youth-led organizing that may have played a critical role inswaying the election. Bladsaid Sunrise made a total of 1.8 million phone calls,sent 2.5 million texts and mailed 778,000 postcards to eligible voters, reaching 3.5 million unique voters justsince the end of the presidential primary. Digital technologies may also have played an important role in mobilizing young voters, both Leichenger and Amersaid. With in-person campaign events next to impossible because of the pandemic, theysaid, youth took advantage of theirsocial media and internetsavvy to get out the vote using platforms like TikTok and Instagram. And for many climate organizers, this year’s powerful youth turnout is only the beginning. Youth have “shown that they are relevant, that they are here and they are going to have asay,”said Natalie Mebane, associate director of US policy at 350 Action. Leichengersaid he thinks Gen Z voters between 18 and 23 are “only at the beginning of exercising what can be verysubstantial power.”Ilana Cohen is a proud New Yorker and a rising junior at Harvard Universitystudying philosophy andsocialstudies.

The Hopi Nation reaches into both Navajo and Apache counties in northern Arizona. Whatshe found was part of a largerstory on Election Day: Even with concerns about coronavirus, Native voters on the Hopi and Navajo nationsshowed up in large numbers at in-person polling locations.“Turnout has been great,” Shuplasaid.“We’ve even had people come in trying to register to vote,”shesaid, but Arizona does not allowsame-day voter registration. Her firststop was a pollingsite inside the Kykotsmovi Village Community Center, near the Hopi tribal office. Shuplasaid the location offered curbside voting, along with a ballot drop-off box for the first time. In Sipaulovi Village, Shuplastood outside the Sipaulovi Youth & Elderly Building and worked with local Native Vote volunteers as they handed out teal-coloredshirts to Hopi voters leaving the polls. Native Vote is a nonpartisan initiative developed by the National Congress of American Indians that focuses on voter registration, election protection, education and data collection. Because of the pandemic, all the Hopi Villages are closed to nontribal citizens and many of them havesecurity postsset up in front monitoring traffic. One isset up in front of the Sipaulovi Village, and thestaff was directing voters toward the pollingsite only. No one was allowed into the village unless they were a resident.“They’re busy,” Shuplasaid. There had been asteadystream of voterssince thesite opened andshe was impressed with howsmoothly the location was running. The final Navajo County pollingstation was at the Hopi LDS Church in Polacca. Shuplasaidshe didn’t encounter any voting issues at any of the threesites, butshesaw a lot of first-time voters.“I’ve neverseen lines and we’reseeing lines,”shesaid. “I think people areseeing the importance of this election.”In Arizona, nearly 6% of the voting-age population is Native American, making it one of the highest percentages among Indigenous communities in the US, according to the National Congress of American Indians. The Navajo and Hopi nationsstretch across parts of Coconino, Navajo and Apache counties. Of Navajo County is 108,000 residents, 43% are Native American. Of Apache County’s population of about 71,000, Native Americans make up 73%. ASU lawstudent MacArthur Stant, a volunteer with the Arizona Native Vote Elections Protection Project, was also out visiting polling places on the Hopi Nation. Hestopped in Polacca and SipauloviThe project is part of the ASU Indian Law Clinic and provides resources to tribes and tribal citizens in Arizona, “to ensure access to the polls and to prevent voter disenfranchisement,” the project is websitesays. At the pollingstations, Stantsaid hesaw asteady flow of voters throughout the day.“It’s been very exciting. A lot of first-time voters and it feels as if those first-time voters are going tostay voters,” Stantsaid. He noticed a lot of the first-time voters are in their 30s, 40s, and 50s.“These are people who haven’t voted in their life and they’restarting tosee the value and importance of it,” he added. “I think as a whole thisstarting to be very important.”Forstate elections, there were 14 Native candidates on ballots across Arizona and 11 of them won their election. Apache County voter Andrew Simpsonsaid he felt both the Democratic and Republican parties haven’tspent enough time on the Navajo Nation to really understand the way of life for Navajo people. But he has noticed they’re paying more attention to Indigenous communities.“Nobody ever paid attention to who we are,” hesaid.“They need to come here to understand us rather than try to change us into their way of life,” Simpsonsaid. “Not only the Navajo Nation but all Native tribes. They need to understand our way of life.”Simpson voted early by mail, butstillshowed up to the polls on Tuesday at the Steamboat Chapter House. As a former council delegate on the Navajo Nation, Simpsonsaid he wanted tosee the turnout. In Chinle, voters were able to use one of the few early in-person votingsites in Apache County. The pollingstation was inside a blue warehouse and had two entrances, one for voters in the Chinle precinct and the other for the Canyon De Chelly precinct. Election official Karsteen Draper, 43, from nearby Del Muerto, greeted voters who walked toward the building, directing them to the correct precinct or to a poll worker who could help ensure they were in the right line. Hesaid he is volunteered for elections before and has always enjoyed working with people. He likes answering their questions and helping them vote.""The line has been flowingsmoothly. No long waits,"" Drapersaid. He planned on being the final voter of the night. As an election official, he had to makesure no one tried to get in line when the polls closed at 7 p.m. Volunteers with the Arizona Native Vote Elections Protection Project wereset up in front of the pollingstation, providing voters with handsanitizer and answers to voting or ballot questions. ASU lawstudents Aspen Miller and Seth Jensen had beenset up in front of the pollingsitesince about 6 a.m. Milersaid thesite was not even open when they arrived. They talked to hundreds of voters throughout the day and the biggest confusion they encountered was that the Navajo Nation was having a tribal election, too. The Apache County pollingsite wasset up only for thestate and national elections. The tribal election took place at the Chinle Chapter House about two miles away. Jensensaid turnout wassteady and Miller agreed,saying there was alwayssomebody inside voting.""Nobody is been turned away,""she added. Married couple Ashley and Marlyn Willie from Chinle both knew they wanted to vote in person rather than by mail.“My vote will count then and there,” Ashley Willie, 27,said. ""Our voices can be heard through voting.""Marlyn Willie echoed his wife is thoughts. Hesaid he is been votingsince he turned 18, and now at 29, voting isstill important to him because his future, his kids' future and eventually his grandkids' future all depend on who leads.""Not just this election but all the elections,"" hesaid. ""People have to get up and voteso they can be the change. We choose who gets to be in there.""In the 2016 election, Maryln Williesaid he did vote for Donald Trump and he has tried to vote Republican much of the time, but that changed this election. He voted for Joe Biden. He does not believe the current division in the USs will change this election. ""Not with the two candidates we have,"" hesaid, and he does not believe either candidate can deliver on their campaign promises.""Not much is beingsaid about our future,"" he added, and hesaid he changed his candidate this election year because of his kids. He believes that Trump has not handled the COVID-19 pandemic properly, and hesaid has to think about his children is health andsafety. The coronavirus had hit Indigenous communities the hardest and no one knows how long it is going to last.""My children deserve to besafe,"" Hesaid. ""I am just hoping for a little bit of change.""As the polls closed on Tuesday night, Chinle Chapter House voter Joanie Hunterstood in line along with about 100 other tribal voters waiting to cast their vote in the Navajo Nation Chapter general election. Hunter already voted in thestate and national election, casting a ballot early becauseshe thought the polling line would be too long on Election Day.“I thought the chapter (election)should be fine,”shesaid but was proven wrong by the timeshe made it to the polls just before 7 p.m. Huntersaidshe was mentally kicking herself for not voting early.“I didn’t think there would be this many people,”shesaid. By the time Hunter got in line, it looped around the Chinle Chapter House complex with about 100 votersstill waiting. At one point during the day, the linestretched past the parking lot toward the main highway.“I don’t mind waiting,” Huntersaid, even as a few of her fellow voters walked away from the line. Shesaidshe cares about her chapter election becauseshe feels it’s an election where her voice is really heard.“You get asay in whose running things,""she added. ""I believe it does make a difference.""Thousands of Navajo voters cast a ballot for chapter leaders on Tuesday. Native voters often turn out in higher rates for tribal elections than nontribal elections, according to the National Congress of American Indians. In chapter elections, Navajo voters elect leaders for their local community governments at 110 chapters across the Navajo Nation. The Navajo Nation is about thesize of West Virginia andspans threestates, Arizona, New Mexico and Utah. It issplit into five agencies: Western, Chinle, Fort Defiance, Shiprock and Eastern. Within those agencies are chapter houses and theyserve as local governments forsurrounding communities. It’s operated along thesame lines as a city council. On Tuesday, Navajo voters elected chapter presidents, vice presidents,secretary-treasurers, commissioners, electionsupervisors, farming board members and grazing committee members. Local chapter elections are usually full of candidates campaigning until the polls close and free food is always nearby. Many of the candidates tend toshare their platforms with Navajo voters whileserving coffee,stew and frybread. But because of the coronavirus, thescene was different this year. There were no foodstandsset up in the chapter house parking lots or candidates hosting rallies for voters. The Navajo Election Administration and the Navajo Board of Election Supervisors implemented public healthsafety guidelines for voting at polling places and discouraged candidates fromsetting up foodstands. Tribal voters were also encouraged to vote early or by absentee ballot to avoid large crowds and wait times on Election Day. At the Steamboat Chapter House as voters left their vehicles and walked toward the door, they were often greeted by an election official asking if they were voting in the chapter election or for Apache County. The Steamboat Chapter Houseserved as a pollingstation for thestate and national election on Tuesday. Chapter voters were directed toward the entrance of the chapter house on the rightside of the building, while Apache County voters were directed toward an entrance on the leftside of the building. Navajo voters waiting in line maintainedsocial distancing, wore masks and often used the hand washingstationsset up near chapter house entrance. Election officials also checked temperatures before voters entered the building. Andrew Simpson and his wife, Bessie Yellowhair Simpson, from Steamboat,showed up at the polls to observe while they waited for relatives to arrive from Phoenix to vote. They both voted early, but as community leaders, they enjoyedsticking around on Election Day. But rather than their usual hugs and handshakes, they both wore masks, waving to people from inside their truck or bumping elbows with the few who walked up to the truck window. Yellowhair Simpson occasionally walked the grounds to greet people or talk. She is currently the commissionsecretary-treasurer for the Steamboat Chapter and was up for reelection this election. She did not retain herseat,according to unofficial results. The husband and wife also believed that Election Day is a great way to build relationships among the Navajo people, but because of the pandemic, they’ve lost that. It has prevented them from leaving their house, Simpsonsaid, and at 74 he’s been told he is at high risk for contracting the coronavirus. The only time they leave home is to restock on essential items,so being at the polls on Tuesday gave them a chance tosee and interact with people at asafe distance.“We just wanted tosee people and our relatives,” Simpsonsaid, and he’s recognized most of them through their masks. “There isstill life out here.”The unofficial results for the Navajo Nation Chapter General Election can be found on the Navajo Election Administrations website atnavajoelections.navajo-nsn.gov.",2,1,AZ Central

There’s Sheena Sood of Abacaxi, Edvin Thompson of Theophilio, Elliss Solomon of Elliss, Tolu Coker of Tolu Coker, and Krystal Paniagua of Krystal Paniagua. What young designers need tosucceed varies based on the designer, and includes building relationships with luxury retailers and mentorship withstylists and fashion editors for placement in publications. Our mission is to give young designers resources toset them up forsuccess, by bringing them together with fashion industry insiders for critical networking opportunities and fostering new relationships. Ahead, meet the Generation Next Class of 2020…. andstay tuned for what is next. Designer Sheena Sood, born in the Minneapolissuburbs, now based in New York2018Sheena Sood caught our attention because of her handmade, environmentally friendly bright designs that tell astory of travel and nature. Sood, a South Asian-American designer, worked as an assistant designer for Tracy Reese, and decided to branch out on her own in 2018. Her tie-dye and mindfully made textile prints are an ode to her childhood and culture. Every look is infused with asense of boldness, and the name of her collection, Abacaxi, is derived from the Portuguese word for pineapple. As an advocate forslow fashion, her pieces are produced in Delhi and made using artisans in India. Whether crocheted dresses or knit tunics, the collection is an innovative play on traditionalsilhouettes that aresure to evoke wanderlust. Designer Edvin Thompson, born in Jamaica, now based in New York2016Edvin Thompson is a creative who comes from humble beginnings in Jamaica. After launching his collection in 2016, in New York, he has continued his rise as an innovative talent. “For women and men whoshow courage while facing an adversary, I design for evidence of trials and triumph, adhering to the constant celebration of life,” hesays. Combining nostalgia and Thompson is love of up cycling clothing, each piece moves as a wearable biography, with emotional power and raw energy. The collection is heavy on the details with ruffles, fringe, and intricate headpieces that toe the line of avant-garde couture insilhouette but aresomehowstill wearable. It’s all Thompson is way of breaking down the barriers in fashion around what “certain people can wear,” and creating his own dialogue with a customer that isn’t interested in the norm. Designer Elliss Solomon, based in LondonByP Claire DodsonBySara DelgadoBySara Delgado2016London-based designer Elliss Solomon launched her collection in 2016, after graduating from Central StreetMartins, with a desire to create a line that was chic insimplicity but conscious of waste. The conversation around using natural organic fabrics, bamboo, and recycled ocean plastics that have a low impact on the earth isn’t new, but Solomon has brought a fresh perspective and an energized approach tosimple, elegant pieces that are breathable and comfortable. From conception to creation, Solomon is acutely aware of her clothing, and wants to attract people who may discover her brand because they care about the environment but become customers because of its excellent design. Solomon is everything that fast fashion is not, and what the fashion industry needs. British-Nigerian designer Tolu Coker, based in London2017British-Nigerian fashion designer Tolu Coker launched her eponymous line in 2017, after working at Maison Margiela, JW Anderson, and Celine, just to name just a few. Cokerstrikes a balance between dissecting the complexities of diaspor ic Black identity, maximalist embellishments, and prints with askillful approach to mainly unisex designs. Her work extends beyond clothing, including illustrations and documentaries with embedded notes of her family history. From her father, an activist in the Black Panther movement in the UK, to using her platform as a designer to express political reform, Coker is continuously redefining contemporary culture. Designer Krystal Paniagua, originally from Puerto Rico, now based in London2020Krystal Paniagua launched her eponymous line this year, after graduating from the Royal College of Arts and heading back home to Puerto Rico. A common thread in her collection is celebrating her homeland while demonstrating asense of irregularity and decay through distressing and embroidery. From knit cutouts to dresses molded to the body, Paniagua has developed both a technique that is all her own and a fluidity with knitwear that the industry has neverseen. Aiming to create a relationship with the wearer of each item, the collection is inclusive ofsize and lifestyle while maintaining astrikingly modern approach.",1,1,Teen Vogue
548,Anxious Democrats float Plan B: Raise debt ceiling on party-line vote,-5.0,44.67,https://www.cnn.com/2021/09/22/politics/democrats-reaction-debt-ceiling/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-22,24,"A number of key Democratssay that their partyshould take matters into its own hands and raise the national debt limit by itself once Republicans block their plans as expected in the Senate, underscoring the lack of options facing the White House and Democratic leaders in the face ofstiff GOP resistance. But going it alone would force Democrats to employ a time-consuming budget maneuver that would bog down both chambers – especially the Senate – andsubject their members toa parade of politically charged voteswith the national debt approaching $29 trillion. And on Wednesday, the chairman of the House Budget Committee insisted that the procedural obstacles and time constraints would prevent the party from using the budget process to raise the debt ceiling in time to avoid a default, a bid aimed at pressuring top Republicans to agree tosuspend the nation’s borrowing limit in a bipartisan vote. Yet rank-and-file Democrats are growing increasingly worried about the mid-October deadline, nervous about the impact on consumers of a first-ever default on the national debt as well as the political backlash that members of both parties would almost certainly endure. And theysay that party leadersshould indeed takesteps to raise the debt ceiling through the budget process, regardless of the obstacles they encounter along the way.“Oh, yeah,”said Rep. Jim Cooper, a moderate Democrat from Tennessee, when asked if he’dsupport using the budget process to raise the debt ceiling if Republicans don’t give them the votes in the Senate.“It’s a top national priority to avoid default – it’s no excuse,” Cooper told CNN on Wednesday. “So you got to do whatever it takes to avoid default. You cannot let America default. Period.”The powerful chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Richard Neal, told CNN he’dsupport takingsteps to raise the debt ceiling with just Democratic votes through the budget process.“If we had to do it I would do that,”said Neal, who’s a Massachusetts Democrat. “I mean that the idea that America would default on debt isso far removed from everything I’ve ever entertained or thought ofsince I’ve been here. I mean, I’mstunned that we even have these moments.”The clock is ticking for Congress to get things done. Here is what to knowAsked again if he’d favor Democrats raising the debt ceiling themselves if the GOP posture doesn’t change, Neal reiterated: “I’d favor paying our debts, yes.”And Democratic Rep. Haley Stevens, whose Michigan district has been targeted by Republicans for 2022,said when asked about raising the debt limit with just Democratic votes: “We’ve got to do what it takes to avoid a default.”The comments — echoed by a number of other House and Senate Democrats – could undercut thestiff position among Democratic leaders,who haveso far refused to publicly consider using the budget process to raise the debt ceiling on astraight party-line vote. Instead, they have tied asuspension of the debt limit to a must-pass bill to fund the government by the September 30 deadline, daring Republicans to block it and risk a potentially catastrophic default andshutdown of federal agencies. Yet Republicans aren’t blinking, and only a handful have left open the possibility that they maysupport thestopgap measure – namely because the package includes billions in aid for communities hit hard by natural disasters,like in Louisiana.“Not 10, no,”said Senate GOP Whip John Thune of South Dakota when asked Wednesday if there would be enough Republicansto break a filibuster on the package. Pointing to roughly trillions more in taxes andspending that Democrats want to pass alongstraight party lines through the budget process, Thunesaid: “If they’re going to do all that with 51 votes, they’ll be raising the debt ceiling with 51 votes.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California – and many other Democrats – have been furious at the GOP position,saying their party helped Republicanssuspend the debt ceiling three times underthen-President Donald Trump, including after the 2017 approval of the GOP tax law through thesame partisan budget process. And Democrats are quick to note that raising the debt ceiling allows the US to pay bills that have already been racked up. Democrats face GOP blockage on raising debt ceiling as time is running out“Are we hostage to Republicans who are threatening to blow up a part of the economicsystem because they want to do that for politics?” asked Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a progressive Massachusetts Democrat who’s a member of Schumer’s leadership team. “That’s just not where weshould be as a nation.”Failure to raise the debt ceiling in time could halt payments that millions of Americans rely on, including paychecks to federal workers, Medicare benefits, militarysalaries, tax refunds, Social Security checks and payments to federal contractors. A memo circulated by the White House last week forstate and local officials listedseveral programs that would be halted if Congress fails, including for disaster relief, Medicaid, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, infrastructure, education, public health and child nutrition. Six former treasurysecretaries urged congressional leadership to raise the debt limit on Wednesday,saying that an “unprecedented default” could “causeserious economic and nationalsecurity harm” and “threaten economic growth.”On Tuesday, Schumer didn’t answer a question directly when asked if Democrats would raise the debt ceiling by themselves if they had to,saying instead that it was imperative to do it along bipartisan lines, asTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen hassought. Rep. John Yarmuth, a Kentucky Democrat who’s the chairman of the House Budget Committee,said Wednesday that he and hisstaff havestudied the possibility that they could go through the reconciliation process to raise the debt limit – and he insisted that it’s not possible to pull it off.“You can’t do it,” Yarmuthsaid Wednesday. “The problems are almost insurmountable. And you certainly couldn’t do it in time tostave off a default.”Yarmuth also made clear the resistance from Pelosi.“I have rarely heard thespeaker and leadership more adamant about anything that they are not going to do this through reconciliation,” Yarmuthsaid, referring to the budget process. Democratic leaders, moderates and progressives headed to the White House at critical moment for the Biden agendaDemocrats have largely resisted talking about what would come next if Republicans blocked their bill to increase the debt limit and fund the government through mid-December, arguing that Republicans have no other choice but to change their minds.“I have every confidence that the Republican Party – at leastsome of them– will come to theirsenses and not allow us to default,” Senate Budget Chairman Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, told reporters. Without GOPsupport, Democrats have two main options. One would allow them to revise their current budget resolution, a process that is rife with procedural hurdles. The other option would be to deploy a little-used part of the Budget Act, which allows them to increase the debt ceiling after approving aseparate budget resolution in both chambers. It would take time to pursue and require Democrats to engage in two more rounds ofso-called vote-a-ramas in the Senate, a marathonseries of amendment votes on the floor that occurs only during the budget process. That route, however, would require Democrats to takesome tough votes. Part of the resistance to increasing the debt ceiling has been that, unlikesuspending the debt ceiling or pausing it, raising it would require Democrats to include an exact dollar figure of how much they want to increase the country’s debt by. For Democrats running for reelection, that is a ready-made campaign ad that leadership is fully aware could be politically damaging. Still,some are arguing that raising the debt ceiling may not be as controversial as it used to be. Top Biden economic aides join Senate Democrat call in push before debt ceiling fightSen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat on the Budget Committee, told reporters that he doesn’t have astrong feeling about how the debt ceiling gets raised, he just wants to makesure it happens. Other Democrats were hoping their leadership would repeatedly force Republicans to vote on legislation to increase the ceiling, and that included keeping the increase tied to the government funding bill.“It looks like we are going to have to give Republicans multiple chances to not terrorize the American economy,”said Sen. Chris Murphy, a Democrat from Connecticut. But if Republicans block the bill in the Senate, as expected, what exactly Democrats do remains to beseen – and many on Capitol Hill have little idea what’s next.“We willsh*t little bricks,”said Rep. John Garamendi, a California Democrat, when asked what Democrats would do if the GOP blocks the debt ceiling hike. He let out a laugh, then walked onto the House floor.",2,1,CNN
549,Aspen-area party businesses warned not to violate health order,-1.0,46.33,https://www.aspentimes.com/news/aspen-area-party-businesses-warned-not-to-violate-health-order/,https://adfontesmedia.com/aspen-times-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-23,15,"Now that indoor private parties and gatherings have been prohibited through the holidayseason, area businesses thatservicesaidsoireesshould take note. Pitkin County public health officialssignaled a willingness this week to punish party rental outfits, caterers, parking valets and others who make their living off the Aspen area’s traditionally numerous private holiday parties and events.“It’ssomething we will be looking at,” Pitkin County Manager Jon Peacock told county board members Tuesday. “(But) private gatherings, frankly, are hard to catch.”Markey Butler, chair of the Pitkin County’s health board,said Monday that catering companies thatserve private parties this holidayseason in violation of public health orders need to be told “we will yank their (business) licenses.”“That’s a tough message,”said the former Snowmass Village mayor. “I’m not real excited about having a lot of indoor events.”Aspen City Councilwoman Ann Mullins, an alternate health board member,said at Monday’s board meetingshe’sseen party rental trucks in her neighborhood recently.“One truck asked for directions and I refused to give them,”shesaid. Pitkin County Commissioner Patti Clappersaid Tuesday that parking companies need to be notified of the health order rules and possible consequences for violating them.“Without enforcement, we really are not protecting the public health,”shesaid. Health board members decided Monday that Pitkin County’sstatus on thestate’s COVID-19, color-coded restriction levels would remain at the Orange level. However, the board voted to voluntarily implement most Red level restrictions in the county — with twosignificant exceptions —starting Tuesday and lasting until at least January 4. Board members agonized over the decision for two-and-a-half hours before deciding that remaining in Orange would allow more local control over restrictions. Moving to Red, they determined, would not provide the wiggle room they wanted when they allowed restaurants to continue at 25% capacity and already-permitted indoor events through January 4 to move forward. In addition, once in Red, the county might find it difficult to get out of it. Board members called the new restrictions “Orange-plus-plus.” They do not allow indoor gatherings at all and require visitors and residents alike tosocialize only with members of thesame household whether in restaurants, hotels or private residences. Still, COVID-19 infection in Aspen and Pitkin County remained rampant Tuesday, and thestate could move the county involuntarily into the Red zone if one of two other metrics — hospitalizations and the positivity rate — rise to Red levels. Pitkin County’s incidence rate— which jumped again Tuesday to 1,509 — is the main concern and the metric that prompted the hand-wringing at Monday’s meeting. The highest rate allowed under Red level restrictions is 350. More than a quarter of the county’s 873 positive COVID-19 casessince March 1 have come in the past two weeks. The positivity rate was at 9% Tuesday, which was increasing butstill in the Yellow level. One person with COVIDsymptoms was admitted to Aspen Valley Hospital on Monday, according to local epidemiology data. That remained in the comfortable level, though if three local residents are hospitalized in a day thestate would move the county to Red. The concern over what to do about the county’s growing infection rate — termed both “astronomical” and “exponential” Monday by the interim public health director — triggered a health board discussion about enforcement thatspilled over into Tuesday’s Board of County Commissioners meeting. On Monday, Pitkin County Commissioner Greg Poschman, also a board of health member,said he wanted to talk about a letter written by fellow health board member Dr. Tom Kurt on thesubject of deputizing local public health order compliance officers. Thesuggestion prompted astrong reaction from Mullins.“I really do notsupport the idea of deputizing (compliance officers),”shesaid, citing the large amount of training police officers andsheriff’s deputies receive. “I havestrong reservations about deputizing anybody who wants to come out.”Poschmanshot back that he “wasn’tsuggesting we just pull people off thestreet,” and Tuesday at the commissioner meeting groused that his idea had beenshut downso quickly.“(Leadership on compliance) will have to come from this board,” hesaid. Just one business in town has facedserious consequences for defying public health orders during the entire pandemic, and that owner received only “aslap on the wrist,” Poschmansaid.“I heard he had a party on his rooftop the other night,” hesaid of the defiant business owner. “We need to make an example ofsomeone before people take thisseriously.”Peacocksaid public health officials have heardsimilar rumors about a party, though in asubsequent interviewsaid he had no concrete information other than it may have occurred last weekend. Clapper proposed that compliance officers be able toshut down a non-compliant business or restaurant on thespot. Commissioner George Newman, however,said that could put a civilian in a “precarious and possibly harmfulsituation,” andsaid police must be called in the case of an immediateshut down. Commissioner Kelly McNicholas Kury asked if rangers working with the county’s Open Space and Trails program could be moved into public health order compliance duties while their ranger jobs are curtailed during winter. Peacocksaid he’d look into it, though he also pointed out that the county plans tospend $146,000 doubling the number of consumer protection compliance officers in the coming weeks. With the vaccine beginning to be administered, it’s unclear how long those new temporary workers will be needed, Peacocksaid Tuesday.“But even if we hired 25 new people … we can’t police everyone all the time, and weshouldn’t have to,” hesaid. Poschman on Monday also proposed a Pitkin County-wide curfew that would apply to everyone, not just businesses. Hesaid he knewsuch action would be complicated, unfair and unenforceable, but felt it was nonetheless necessary.“I think we have to do this,” hesaid. Michael Goldberg, owner of Belly Up and Matsuhisa,said the idea had thesupport ofsome in the business community. Rather than “dumping people on thestreets at 10” with nowhere to go, a full curfew leaves them no alternative but to go home, Goldbergsaid. Aspen Mayor Torre and Snowmass Village Mayor Bill Madsen wondered how a blanket curfew would be enforced. Madsensaid the idea would need “buy-in” from the community because no municipality is going tosend police officers chasing people around for curfew violations. Peacocksaid Tuesday that the county attorney’s office alsosays a blanket curfew might not be enforceable. Further, in order for one to be implemented, officials must establish direct evidenceshowing it will bring down the infection risk, hesaid. One area of voluntary compliance that appears to be catching on is Pitkin County’straveler affidavit program. The effort requires overnight visitors to Aspen and the county to fill out an online form attesting that they have had a negative COVID-19 test within 72 hours of traveling here. Residents who have been gone more than 10 days also must fill out the affidavit. Since the program began December 7, more than 9,400 people havesubmitted the forms as of Tuesday morning, Peacocksaid.“I’m pleasantlysurprised,” hesaid. “When we were rolling it out, we felt we would achieve a voluntary level of compliance, and I think we are getting that.”Poschmansaid he’s heard from one traveler who canceled plans here when a member of the traveling group who was asymptomatic tested positive for the virus. Hesaid he expected the person to be angry, and was relieved to find they were grateful. Those canceling reservations because of the affidavit are missing the point that the program is meant to keep everyone healthy, hesaid.“If that’s the case,” Poschmansaid, “you’re invited tostay away.”jauslander@aspentimes.comFeb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024Feb 1, 2024",2,2,Aspen Times

The league warned teams that game forfeitures will only occur if the games cannot be rescheduled and will only affect the team that had the COVID-19 breakout.“Whether to reschedule a postponed game will be dependent on health andsafety reasons at the recommendation of medical experts as well as considerations ofstadium availability,schedule integrity, fan convenience, and other appropriate matters,” the leaguesaid in a memo Thursday, according to ESPN After the announcement, players around the league began to chime in, with the Arizona Cardinals’star wide receiver DeAndre Hopkinssaying the news was making him “question my future in the NFL.”The Los Angeles Rams’ cornerback Jalen Ramsaysaid he would not judge a teammate that decided to not get vaccinated.“Just because my teammate(s) personally decide not to get the vaccine, I won’t think they are a bad teammate,” Los Angeles Rams corner backJalen Ramsaysaid after the announcement. Whileseveral games were rescheduled in 2020 due to COVID-19 breakouts, none were canceled and at times, teams played theirscheduled games without multiple players who tested positive.

Fifty-five percent (55%) of Hispanic respondents, 50% of white respondents and 46% of Black respondentssaid they were concerned about the COVID vaccine, and 39% of Hispanics, 29% of Black respondents and 26% of white respondents voiced their concern over vaccines in general. Nearly 80% of Texanssaid they knowsomebody who has tested positive for COVID and nearly half (47%)said they knowsomebody who has died from the virus. Joshua Blank, a research director for Texas Lyceum, highlighted that while 40% of respondentssaid they have “a lot” of confidence in healthcare providers’ ability to operatesafely during the pandemic, that certainly wasn’t the case for other businesses. No other businesses, including grocerystores, churches, publicschools, local merchants and airports, received “a lot” of confidence from more than a quarter of Texans.

Or with:Bysigning up you agree to ourTerms of ServiceandPrivacy Policy“This really is the challenge for not only government and public health officials, but for businesses too,” Blanksaid during a zoom presser. “... If after 10 months, knowing what we know now, peoplestill don’t have a lot of confidence in the ability to patronize a businesssafely, well the onlysolution is a vaccine. And what we’reseeing is that half of Texas is notsure if they’re getting a vaccine and they’re concerned about thesafety of it.”Blank added that this issomething that every level of government, businesses and “really anyone who’s willing” needs to begin getting this message out if Texans want thestate to have astrong recovery from the pandemic. Texas Lyceum is a nonprofit and nonpartisan Texas organization that conducts an annual poll in order to better understand public opinion. Thesurvey polled 1,200 adults in thestate from January 8-17, 1,000 of which were contacted by live interviews over the phone. They also conducted an additional 200 online interviews of unregistered adults. Out of the 1,200 respondents, 835self reported as registered voters. Immigration and bordersecurity were thestate’s top concerns in 2020, but fell out of the top five in 2021 as the pandemic, political disruption, health care, the economy and unemployment rounded out the top five problems facing Texas, according to thesurvey. When it comes to both the national andstate economy, thesurvey found that this issomething Texans’ outlook is undoubtedly bleak on. Only 24% of respondentssaid they believe thestate economy is better off than the national economy compared to 40% of Texans whosaid the national economy is in a better place than Texas’. Daron Shaw, the founder of the poll, pointed out that these numbers are a dramatic change from the poll’s findings in the midst of the Great Recession.“If you go back to 2009 at the height of the last great recession, 64% of respondentssaid that they felt the Texas economy was better off than the national economy,” Shawsaid. “So for me, thestandout result from this poll is that Josh and I refer to the bullishness that Texans have with respect to how Texas is handling things.”That bullishness is not quite as evident now in response to the pandemic and the economic consequences of the pandemic as it was back in 2009, Shawsaid. Additionally, only 15%said their family’s economicstanding has improved over the previous year and just 34% of Texans believe their children will be better off economically in the future than they are currently. When broken down by race, the pollshowed that Hispanics (60%) were more likely to knowsomebody who has died from COVID than white (41%) and Black (40%) respondents. When it comes to confidence regarding jobstatus, 57% of white Texanssaid they are very confident that they will be employed at the end of the year, though that number dropped to 42% for Hispanic Texans and 36% for Black Texans. Additional challenges for Texans with children under the age of 18 were also revealed in thesurvey. Aside from the increase in care giving responsibilities, Texas care givers also face the conundrum of whether or not tosend children toschool during the pandemic. Only 32% of adults with children at homesaid they feelsafesending their kids toschool, 21% lower than parents whosaid they don’t feelsafe doingso.

In astatement on Saturday, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivansaid Washington had “deep concerns about the way in which the early findings of theCOVID-19investigation were communicated and questions about the process used to reach them.”“It is imperative that this report be independent, with expert findings free from intervention or alteration by the Chinese government,” hesaid, referring to the WHO mission investigating the origins of the pandemic in the central city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected late in 2019.“To better understand this pandemic and prepare for the next one, China must make available its data from the earliest days of the outbreak.” Sullivan’sstatementsaid. China responded Sunday with astatement from its Washington Embassy thatsaid the US had already “gravely damaged international co-operation on COVID-19” and was now “pointing fingers at other countries who have been faithfullysupporting the WHO and at the WHO itself.”While it welcomed PresidentJoe Biden‘s decision to reverse the Trump administration’s move to leave the WHO, China hopes the US will “hold itself to the higheststandards, take aserious, earnest, transparent and responsible attitude,shoulder its rightful responsibility,support the WHO’s work with real actions and make due contribution to the international co-operation on COVID-19,” thestatementsaid. Following allegations of Chinese withholding of data in The New York Times and other media outlets, investigation team member Peter Daszak tweeted, “This was NOT my experience on @WHO mission.”This was NOT my experience on@WHOmission.

We DID get access to critical new data throughout. We DID increase our understanding of likelyspillover pathways,” Daszak tweeted. Another team member, Thea Koelsen Fischer of Denmark, alsosaid that had not been her experience and impliedsome comments had been misrepresented in the media.“We DID build up a good relationship in the Chinese/Int Epi-team! Allowing for heated arguments reflects a deep level of engagement in the room. Our quotes are intendedly twisted castingshadows over importantscientific work,” Fischer tweeted. While in Wuhan, Koelsen Fischersaidshe did not get tosee the raw data and had to rely on an analysis of the data that was presented to her. Butshesaid that would be true in most countries. The British-born Daszak, a zoologist who now works in New York, affirmed Fischer’s remarks, tweeting: “It’s disappointing tospend time w/ journalists explaining key findings of our exhausting month-long work in China, tosee our colleaguesselectively misquoted to fit a narrative that was prescribed before the work began. Shame on you ?nytimes.”Daszak had previously worked with the deputy director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, Shi Zhengli, to track down the origins ofsevere acute respiratorysyndrome, or SARS, which originated in China and led to the 2003 outbreak of the disease. He earlier told The Associated Press that the WHO team enjoyed a greater level of openness than they had anticipated, and that they were granted full access to allsites and personnel they requested. The 10-nation WHO team last week departed Wuhan after nearly a month. It visited markets, hospitals and research centres, including the highlysecure Wuhan Institute of Virology that has been thesubject ofspeculation because of its large collection of bat virusspecimens. In their comments while in China, team memberssaid they hadsome new insights into the origins of the pandemic that has killed more than 2.3 million people, but that major questions arestill unanswered. The mission was intended to be an initialstep in the process of understanding the origins of the virus, whichscientists have posited may have passed to humans through a wild animal,such as a pangolin or bamboo rat. Theysaid transmission directly from bats to humans or through the trade in frozen food products are also possibilities, but an alternate theory that the virus leaked from a Chinese lab was unlikely. The WHO team’s visit was politicallysensitive for Beijing, which is concerned about being blamed for alleged missteps in its early response to the outbreak.

Pence’s comments came in a wide-ranging interview Friday evening about the Biden agenda and the upcoming midterm elections at the Family Leadership Summit after he gave remarks to a crowd of about a thousand Christian conservatives in downtown Des Moines, Iowa. While Pence has made a number ofspeechessince leaving office on January 20 this year, this interview with Breitbart News is his firstsince he left office.“The extension of, the plus-up on unemployment benefits by the Biden administration has worked a real hardship onsmall businesses and our recovery,” Pencesaid. “Look, this economystarted to recover in thesummer of 2020 demonstrating the resilience of the American people and the rightness of our agenda. With tax cuts, and rolling back regulations, and unleashing American energy, and America First trade deals, we had laid a foundation within the first three years that created 7 million jobs. I believe it also was the foundation on which America has made this historic recovery and inso many ways what the Biden administration has done and continues to do — and adding to that they’re pushing for the largest tax increase in 50 years to pass the largestspending bill in American history — I think what the Biden administration is doing threatens toshort-circuit the American recovery we all long tosee and that is underway. It is. But I think the fact that inflation is now rising at the most rapid pace in 13 years is evidence of the fact that markets arestarting to respond to the big governmentsolutions — higher taxes, more regulation — being planned and coming out of this administration. That’s why we got to fight back and fight back hard.”Pencesaid he is “incredibly proud” of House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy for holding House Republicans together “in opposing the radical left agenda of [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi.” He pointedspecifically to that $1.9 trillion coronavirusspending plan, passed in March along purely partisan lines in both the US House and Senate, that extended the newly-created federal unemployment benefits program that, at the beginning of the pandemic,supplementedsimilarstate benefits. Combined, the federal andstate benefits collected together could often pay people more to not work than to actually work —something that has led tosmall businesses like restaurants andstores across America having trouble hiring employees. The federal government never before offeredsupplemental unemployment insurance benefits. But, at the beginning of the pandemic, the Trump administration — withsupport on a bipartisan basis in Congress — passedsuch benefits. The program, meant to be temporary as the government was literally telling people tostay home and not work, was extended as part of the partisan plan Biden pushed at the beginning of his presidency. Pence ripped Biden for turning this into a partisan matter.“Even in the early vote on COVID [Chinese coronavirus] relief, they were able tostand united in opposition to a massivespending bill which really was a betrayal of the whole posture our administration had taken during the pandemic with regard to Congress,” Pencesaid. “Every bill we passed for COVID in Congress passed by overwhelming bipartisan majorities. Wesaid we’re going to check politics at the door. Everything we did, everything we did was bipartisan. For President Biden and [Senate Majority Leader Chuck] Schumer and Pelosi right out of the gate to abandon the bipartisan precedent we had established in combatting the coronavirus pandemic I thought was a betrayal of everything we’d done to bring the Congress together around a united effort to end the pandemic.”It is not just the economic recovery that Biden is bungling, though, Pencesaid. When it comes to the vaccine, Pencesaid Bidenshould give former President Donald Trump and the previous administration credit for developing the vaccine — and getting the rollout up tospeed — as there were a millionshots a day being administered by the time Trump and Pence left office. Pencesaid that he does believe Americans generallysee through Biden’s politicization of the pandemic.“I couldn’t be more proud of what the American people accomplished over the last year and a half,” Pencesaid. “Only in America, in the face of a global pandemic, could we reinvent testing from astandingstart and do a billion tests within a matter of months. Only in America could youstand up asupply chain and enlist companies to manufacture medical company [sic] and fly medical equipment from all around the worldso that no American was ever denied the healthcare that they need facing this pandemic. And only in America could you have the kind of research companies and the kind of innovation at the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] that would permit the development of therapeutics and vaccines within nine months. We when we firstsat down, when I first became head of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, we called all of the heads of all of the major pharmaceutical and research companies in — we were in the Cabinet Room. I remember the President asking them how long it would take to get a vaccine? Vaccines take five toseven years, if you can get one. We allsaid ‘not good enough — what do you need? What needs to happen?’ And that’s where the idea of clearing the way for FDA review and approval withoutshortcut tingsafety measures and initiating the idea for Operation Warp Speed because early on we were hearing thatseveral of these vaccinesshowed very promising returns in the early Phase One trials. We just made the decision we’ll pay you to go ahead and manufacture millions of dosesso that, if it’s approved, we won’t wait another year for you to manufacture. The combination of all of those things is an American accomplishment”“The fact that the Biden-Harris administration, thatspent much of the campaign talking down a vaccine developed under the Trump-Pence administration, now hasseen its way clear to ignore our administration’s efforts is disappointing but notsurprising,” Pence lamented. “The thing is, I think the American peoplesee through it. Everywhere I go—today I had a man come alongside me at a picnic I was at in Western Iowa. It was tough. He told me he lost his wife to COVID But he wanted to express his appreciation to me. I was very moved. I told him ‘I’ll be praying for you and I’m verysorry for your loss.’ Hesaid ‘I juststill wanted to thank you for what you’ve done and what the vaccine has meant for other people.’ I just honestly believe the Biden-Harris administration would do well to give credit where credit is due, first to the American people andsecond to efforts of a prior administration to demonstrate everything we’ve accomplished putting the health of the American people first in this pandemic is a tribute to the American people and American innovation and only in America could we be at a place where we are today where America is coming back and we’reseeing life returning to normal. I flew out to my daughter’s wedding not long ago and couldn’t barely get through the airport and I just found myself walking through the airport thinking ‘Only in America.’”With the upcoming midterm elections, Pencesaid that Republicans can turn the tide andslam the doorshut on the Biden agenda. To retake the US House majority, Republicans only need to flip a net fiveseats from Democrat hands into GOP hands and, to retake the Senate majority, the GOP only needs to flip a net oneseat.“We’veseen this movie before. I was in Congress in 2010 with a Democrat president, a Democrat Senate, and a Democrat House,” Pencesaid. “What we did was we brought Republicans together around a unified conservative agenda and westoodstrong against the Pelosi majority and we won 63seats in the House of Representatives in 2010. We won the Senate a few years later and the White House two years after that. I think we’re going to do it all again in the next three and a half years.”Pencesaid he is noticing “buyer’s remorse across America” with regard to Democrat control in Washington and the Biden agenda.“I heard about it today when I was in western Iowa,” Pencesaid. “One of the families I met withspoke of a friend who voted for the Biden-Harris ticket and now admittedshe was wrong. Peoplesee that what Biden is attempting to do is not advance kind of traditional Democrat policies but is literally trying to transform the country into a European-style welfarestate.”Pence then called one Biden administration proposal — the implementation of an international minimum corporate tax rate, whereby other countries and the USs would agree to tax entities at thesame levels at least and the US would essentially be handing control over tax rates over tosome international community entity — “downright un-American.”“You look at the international minimum corporate tax rate that is being orchestrated and discussed with powers around the country that I think is unconstitutional — the power to tax fallssquarely with the government and the power to initiate taxes fallssquarely with the USs House of Representatives,” Pencesaid. “The idea that the Treasury Secretary or the Biden administration could negotiate with President Macron to establish a minimum corporate tax rate that would be imposed on our companies is downright un-American. But I think your point is well taken that what the administration is advancing is agenda that is destined toshort-circuit the economy but more than that it’s an attempt to transform America into a fundamentally different place than it’s ever been before.”Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced this past week that he intends to try to force a vote on theso-called “Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework” — for which therestill is no bill text — this coming week in the US Senate. Combined with that, the Democrats in Congress and the Biden administration are backing aseparate but parallel plan that wouldspend another $3.5 trillion through reconciliation — which allows them to use a budget gimmick to pass bills out of the Senate with asimple majority. Pence warned his Republican friends in the US Senate against going along with this plan.“With regard to the infrastructure bill, I will just tell you during my years in Congress I always thought it was good to let your yes be yes and let your no be no,” Pencesaid. “And I’d rather Republicans in the Senatesimply made it clear that unless all the Green New Dealstuff is out, they’re not voting for an infrastructure bill. I think there is great risk in a two-billstrategy that could result in usseeing them advance the radical left’s climate change agenda. I would encourage Republicans to think really hard before going along with a first infrastructure bill as it might pave the way for policies that have very little to do with infrastructure but willstifle American prosperity for generations.”Pence also, as he did in hisspeech here, told Breitbart News about how during the Trump administration the USs became energy independent — and a net exporter of energy — for the first time in 70 years. But, hesaid, Biden has already undermined that.“America is the Saudi Arabia of natural gas,” Pencesaid. “This administration, with its climate change agenda, hasset itself against the American people permitting to use the resources of our land in an environmentally responsible way. But what’s incomprehensible to me is that President Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline but approved the Russian pipeline to western Europe. Think about that? One of your first acts in office is to kill a natural gas pipeline in the USs of America — one that had been tied up for years, one that we cleared the way on, and one that would add to our energy infrastructure — and then to allow Nordstream 2 to go forward? We have tens of thousands of troops in western Europe ostensibly under the mission of NATO protecting Europe from Russian aggression. The idea that they would now pave the way for European countries to become dependent on Russia for natural gas — it’s incomprehensible to me. What we ought to be doing isseeing our European trading partners building ports to be able to import natural gas from the USs of America. Again, what you’reseeing is I think an administration that’s lapsing back into the bad policy decisions of the past and they were policy decisions that the American people were glad tosee our administration overturn to the benefit of an incredible boom economy before the coronavirus pandemicstruck.”Pence also ripped the Biden administration — andspecifically hissuccessor as vice president, Kamala Harris — for mishandling the border crisis.“The Biden-Harris administration took the mostsecure border in American history and has turned it into the worst immigration crisis in my lifetime,” Pencesaid. “Suspending construction on the wall, ending the policies that we put into effect that had ended asylum abuse, I thought it was one of thesignature accomplishments of our administration. President Trump tapped me and Secretary of State [Mike] Pompeo tosit down in the Roosevelt Room and negotiate out an agreement that anyone applying for asylum in the USs would be required to remain in Mexico. It had been talked about for years and years and in the early years of our administration the Mexicans were only allowing it on a fraction of their border,so President Trumpsaid ‘we’re going to tariff everything coming across the border from Mexico unless you agree to the remain in Mexico policy.’ Thesecretary ofstate and Isat down with the Mexican foreign minister and the ambassador and, over the course ofseveral days, we negotiated andsecured a remain in Mexico agreement for the entiresouthern border. That, which essentially ended catch and release on thesouthern border,sent a message to the northern triangle countries of Central America that the opportunity to game thesystem was over.”",0,1,Breitbart

But the ramifications of this latest round of Israeli-Palestinian confrontation—Israeli militarystrikes in Gaza, Hamas rocket attacks on Israeli cities, and rising intercommunal violence between Arabs and Jews—will be long-lasting and profound. Above all, it will reinforce thesense among Israelis, Palestinians, and most of the international community that thesearch for a peaceful resolution to the conflict has come to an end for the foreseeable future. The conflict that began in early May was not planned. It was the culmination of varioussmall but importantsteps that, while linked, did not make violence inevitable. Yet a combination of domestic Israeli and Palestinian political dynamics, international failures, and worsening relations between the twosides created the right conditions for bloodshed. Yet whatever its accidental quality, the latest round of violence will have enduring consequences. Hamas will emerge from the conflictstronger and the Palestinian Authority (PA) and its president weaker. Violence between Israeli Arabs and Jews will eventually abate, but Arab perceptions ofsystemic discrimination will grow—as will a belief that asearch for equality within Israel is inherently futile. Jerusalem’ssymbolic role will also expand, deepening the conflict’s religious dimensions. Among many Israelis and Palestinians, these developments mark the return to an older phase of the conflict. The last two weeks have reinforced a belief that their relationship is again existential and zero-sum, that diplomacy to resolve the conflict is futile and violence inevitable. The current confrontation is unfolding across four theaters. The Gaza-Israeli military bombardment has destroyed civilian infrastructure and killed more than 200 Palestinians, 30 percent of them children, and ten Israelis. Ethnonational tensions within Israel havesparked unprecedented intercommunal riots and violence between Arabs and Jews. Palestinians and Israeli police, extreme Jewish nationalist-religious groups, andsettlers are in astandoff in East Jerusalem over access to Muslim holy places and the planned evictions of Arab families from the Sheikh Jarrah neighborhood. And in the West Bank, tensions are high after Israeli forces killed fourPalestinian demonstrators and injured dozens more on May 18, a day of protest that engulfed major Palestinian cities. Nonetheless, tensions there remain contained by joint PA and Israeli efforts. These dynamics have been buildingsince Israel invaded Gaza in 2014. That war marked the end of any real hope ofstriking a deal to end the conflict, as then US Secretary of State John Kerry had been working to do. After 2014, relations between bothsides worsened and the prospect of a two-statesolution gradually diminished. With the realization that a peaceful outcome was impossible in theshort to medium term, the Israeli right began to assert itself—especially after the election of Donald Trump as US president in 2016. Trump’s policies emboldened many Israeli conservatives and cleared the way for extreme anti-Palestinian policies. Israelisettlers began expanding into new areas of the West Bank, and Israel began routinely confiscating Palestinian land and demolishing homes along the way. By 2019–20, many Israelis had begun to demand the annexation of wideswaths of new territory without granting equal rights to Palestinian citizens. Adding insult to injury,several Arabstates also began to normalize relations with Israel, eventually concluding theso-called Abraham Accords in 2020. As Arabstates’solidarity with the Palestinian cause receded, Palestinians themselves felt increasingly abandoned. These pressures were particularly apparent in Jerusalem. After Washington’s 2017 recognition of the city as Israel’s capital, Israel increased the pace of illegal annexation andstepped up its efforts to change thestatus quo in the Old City’s holy places. Israeli police restricted Palestinian access to the al Aqsa compound, attempted tosilence the call for prayer, and began granting access to larger numbers of Jewish Israelis. Authorities also moved to evict Arab East Jerusalemites from their homes and began to assert a more dominant Jewish nationalist-religious agenda throughout the city. Inside Israel itself, the emboldened right wing also tooksteps to marginalize Israeli Arab citizens. Many among this latter groupsaw the 2018so-called nation-state bill—which declares Israel the historic homeland of the Jewish people, establishes Hebrew as the only official language, and asserts that Jewishsettlements are a “national value”—as yet another means of discriminating against Israeli Arabs to the benefit of Israeli Jews. Two years later, an amendment that would have added equality for minorities to the law, reducing the chance that it might be used to legitimize legal discrimination against Israeli Arabs, was voted down in the Knesset—Israel’s parliament. Right-wing politicians, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, also routinely incite hatred and fear against Israeli Arabs and their representatives in the Knesset. A dramatic rise in crime rates in Arab communities, moreover, compounds already existingsocioeconomic problems. Palestinian politics has been plagued by its ownseries ofsetbacks. Over the pastseveral years, the PA hasseverely undermined the public’s faith in its ability to govern. Having held no general electionssince 2006, the Palestinian Authority has damaged the rule of law, weakened the judiciary, curtailed media freedoms, andshrunk thespace for civilsociety as organizations lost much of their independence from the government. The result is increasing public discontent and overwhelming demands for PA President Mahmoud Abbas to resign. Hamas’s behavior in the Gaza Strip has been no better. Unbothered by constitutional principles, norms, and rule of law, it has grown increasingly ruthless. Two weeks ago, these conflicting Israeli-Palestinian and intra-Palestinian dynamics finally collided. The earliest and most obvious trigger was Israel’s policies toward Muslim holy places in Jerusalem’s Old City and its demographic battle against Palestinians in the rest of occupied East Jerusalem. Thisset thestage forsmall confrontations during Ramadan between Palestinians, Israeli police, and right-wing extremists in the Old City over the changes at Haram al-Sharif (the Temple Mount) and access to the Damascus Gate. Another flash point was the Shaikh Jarrah neighborhood of East Jerusalem. In a pattern repeated throughout the occupied city, many Palestinian residents faced imminent eviction from their own homes by Jewishsettlers. East Jerusalemites, other Palestinians, and many Israeli Arabs mobilized in response—launching aseries of limited and essentially nonviolent protests. Aseparate trigger was the Israeli decision to prevent Palestinian elections, planned for May 22, from taking place in East Jerusalem—despite its obligation to facilitate them under the terms of the Oslo accordsstruck in 1993. The Israeli decision was apparently unrelated to the elections themselves (Israel declared it had no intention of interfering in the process as a whole). Instead, the move wasseen as an attempt to deny Palestinian claims to occupied East Jerusalem, even though Israel had already acknowledgedsuch claims in three previous elections. It was this Israeli move that proved most relevant to the timing of the current confrontation. Ostensibly in response to Israel’s decision, Abbas decided to cancel the May PA elections entirely‚ promising to hold them only once Israel agreed to walk back its original plan. This only multiplied internal Palestinian tensions, however. Almost all other Palestinian electoral lists and candidates rejected the decision, including Hamas. Most partiessuspected that the real motive was Abbas’s realization that he would lose the race and be forced toshare control of parliament with three prominent Fatah defectors: Muhammad Dahlan, Marwan Barghouti, and Nasser al-Qudwa. Abbas’s opponents argued that Palestiniansshould not grant Israel veto power over their elections. They instead favored forcing Israel to accept a vote in East Jerusalem through nonviolent electoral campaigns and voting drives in al Aqsa and other mosques, churches, and UN and diplomatic missions. The final trigger for the current round of violence was Hamas’s inability to forge a joint alliance against Abbas’s election cancellation, despite widespread opposition to it. Although the group reached out to other electoral listsseeking theirsupport, none wanted to beseen as Hamas’s allies. This dealt a heavy blow to Hamas’s long-termstrategy. By reintegrating itself into the PA political process through elections, the group hadsought to restore its legitimacy and free itself from the burden of governing the Gaza Strip. With thatstrategy in tatters, a more militant Hamas leadership took the lead. The Israeli police escalation at al Aqsa and imminent evictions in Shaikh Jarrah provided the opportunity to achieve two goals: The first was to punish Abbas and make him politically irrelevant. Thesecond was to punish Israel for its anti-Palestinian policies in East Jerusalem and its decision to halt elections in the city. In achieving those two goals, Hamassought to demonstrate to Palestinians and others that while Abbas ran away from a battle over Jerusalem, Hamas wouldstand with its residents. Indeed, the group was willing to risk war in Gaza to defend the city and the al Aqsa mosque. Eventually, on May 10, Hamas issued an ultimatum: if Israel did not withdraw its police and military personnel from the mosque and Shaikh Jarrah, the group would attack. Minutes after the deadline passed, Hamas began targeting Israeli towns with rockets fired from the Gaza Strip, triggering retaliatory Israeli airstrikes. Hamas did not unleash the current confrontation. It merely capitalized on rising tensions to make the case for replacing Abbas. Israel’s decision to cancel the election in East Jerusalem and Abbas’ssubsequent move to cancel the entire processset off a chain reaction that neitherside anticipated. If elections had gone ahead as planned, confrontations in East Jerusalem would have intensified but likely remained nonviolent. Hamas, Fatah, and other electoral lists would have been too busy mobilizing their electoral constituencies against the Israeli police and extremistsettlers; Hamas would not have risked a war in Gaza that might have halted electoral preparations, thereby destroying its opportunity to reintegrate itself into the formal political process. Without elections, however, thestage wasset for violence. How will the current confrontation affect the prospects for a long-term peace? On the Israeli-Palestinian front, the two-statesolution might have received a mortal blow. Given Israeli efforts to marginalize Abbas and the PA, it will not be easy to keep the West Bank out of the next conflict or even the current one. Security coordination between Israel and the PA will not be enough to contain the rising flames. And given the rhetoric around annexation, no right-wing Israeli government will be willing or able to renew a political process that would require negotiations with the PA leadership, even forsmall incrementalsteps. Domestically, Abbas will manage tostay in office only as long as he can prevent elections from taking place. Yet with rising popular discontent, the PAsecurityservices’ ability to maintain control and quell discontent is diminishing. The PA might find itself the target of an angry public. Abbas, the PA, and the Palestinian national movement will lose what little public trust theystill hold. Elections and political reforms are the only means of making thesystem legitimate and accountable again. Those who reject elections because Abbas will lose or because the process might legitimize Hamasshould consider the consequences. Ignoring the problem and keeping Hamas cornered in the Gaza Strip is nosolution. Thereshould be no illusion about the role of the international community here. At best, Arabstates and others, including Washington, can help manage the conflict only by making thestatus quosustainable. They do not, however, have the capacity or political will to force Israel to respect international law or Abbas and the PA to respect the norms of good governance. As hard as it may be, Israelis and Palestinians must do that themselves.",1,2,Foreign Affairs

Arizonans filed 249,000 initial claims over the week ending July 18 under the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, which pays a $600 weeklysupplement in addition to what jobless individuals receive from thestate. Those figures, provided by thestate Department of Economic Security, were up from more than 230,000 PUA claims in Arizona during the week ending July 11 and represent the highest totalso far. The federal program began earlier this year to ease financial pressures for workerssuffering layoffs or reduced hours from COVID-19 and economy-shutting measures to contain the pandemic. It expires July 25. In addition, Arizonans filed 24,973 initial claims in the latest week forstate benefits that max out at $240 a week. Claims for these lower benefits have been fairlysteady for the past couple of months. Arizona benefits are not affected by the federal expiration date. The question remains if Congress will act to expand the federal joblesssupplement, along with deciding whether to authorize another round ofstimulus checks or additional assistance to businesses,state and local governments, or other entities. Some form of extended federal jobless aid is considered likely, but an agreement has not been reached yet on how much will be paid in benefits, and to whom.""Even in a highly polarized environment, it is likely that a bill will be passed as neither political party will want to be blamed forsinking a bill containing much-needed relief,"" wrote David Kelly, chief globalstrategist for JPMorgan Funds in a commentary. The House of Representatives, controlled by Democrats, passed the HEROES Act earlier this year. That legislation would maintain the current $600 weekly payments. Republican leaders in Congress have proposed reducing the amountso as not to disincentivize certain people from returning to work. Negotiations continue in Washington. David Wells, research director at the Grand Canyon Institute in Phoenix,said he expects the ultimate package might amount to a compromise benefitsomewhere around $400 a week. Another unknown revolves around when the legislation might be passed and implemented. That might not happen until well into August, which could put financial pressure on millions of jobless people even if benefits are paid retroactively.""Peoplestill have bills to pay,"" Wellssaid. The Grand Canyon Institute released a report Wednesday urging Arizona to update its own unemployment insurance program. At a maximum of $240, weekly benefits here are thesecond-lowest in the nation, exceeding only the $235 weekly payments available by Mississippi. Thereportby the aself-described centrist think tank claims that Arizona is meager jobless payments have cost thestate between $1 billion and $1.9 billion in lost economic activitysince April. In moststates, unemployment insurance programs are designed to replace about one-half of lost wages for typical workers, Wellssaid. But in Arizona, the benefits replace only about one-quarter of lost wages. Also, Arizona provides little flexibility for people when their job income is reduced, the report continued. In other words, Arizona does not offer much in the way of an ""earnings allowance"" — the amount of money people can make before jobless benefits are reduced. This is relevant for those who return to work part time, the institute noted. This combination of a low benefit cap and a low earnings allowance leads to a complete benefit disqualification for between 50,000 and 110,000 Arizonans each week, which would not be the case if they lived in most otherstates, the reportsaid. Roughly 90% of this assistance, if provided, would have been paid by the federal government. The institute called on Governor Dougr Ducey andstate legislators to update Arizona’s unemployment insurancesystem, calling it ""one of the worst in the nation.""The Department of Economic Securitysaid initial claims under both the federal andstate programs amounted to nearly 274,000 for the week ending July 18, a record-high total. Continuing (as opposed to initial) claims under both programs in Arizona came to 3.03 million, another record, for the week ending July 18, with the federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program accounting for 2.79 million of those. The department cautions that there might be duplication in the counts between thestate and federal programs, possibly because of people filing claims multiple times out of confusion, frustration or for other reasons. That new claims for Arizona jobless benefits have mostly leveled out in recent weeks might indicate Arizona is tourismsector has not been hit as hard as those of many otherstates,said David Shideler, chief research officer at Heartland Forward, which tracks economic activity in middle America. In part, hesaid, this might be because many tourists come to Arizona mainly tosee the Grand Canyon and other outdoor attractions, for whichsocial distancing is not as much of a concern compared with, for example, museums, theme parks and other more urban attractions.",2,1,AZ Central

565,"Chris Wallace, We Were In Kenosha.

The violence in Kenosha wasspurred by left-wing extremist groups, not whitesupremacists. We know — because we were there. Kenosha was up in flames, reduced to thesame lawlessness thatswept Minneapolis, Portland, Atlanta, and now thissmall Midwest town. Monday night in Kenosha, a day after law enforcementshot Jacob Blake, men and womenstood with baseball bats and guns in front of their businesses and homes, trying to defend themselves against the extremist violence of the Black Lives Matter left. Since there weren’t enough police to control thesituation, officers focused on defending public buildings,such as the courthouse, while leaving citizens to fend for themselves.

On Thursday, local and federal law enforcement officialsstopped anout-of-state caravan of vehicles filled with fuel cans and illegal fireworks. “The vehicles contained various items, including helmets, gas masks, protective vests, illegal fireworks, andsuspected controlledsubstances,” according to police, who arrested nine people for disorderly conduct. The vehicles were reportedly connected to the Seattle-based Riot Kitchen, a group of radical-left protesters. Whileseveral mainstream media accounts portrayed the group as friendly helpers, thestories couldn’t explain why they were loading upso many cans of gas and why the Riot Kitchen crew fled from police. Sam, an Indian immigrant who owns a family-run car dealership downtown, lost “every dime” he had, and the 20 people Sam employed have all lost their jobs “for nothing.” Samsaid his family had been “in tears” for days after rioters burned his lot two nights in a row, destroying all the cars, and looting his office before burning that as well. Sam is an Indian immigrant who owns a family-run car dealership that was destroyed by BLM arsonists. “What did we do to deserve all this?”said Sam.pic.twitter.com/hgDjbIq9pA— The Federalist (@FDRLST)August 29, 2020“I’m a taxpayer,”said Sam, distraught that law enforcement did nothing to protect his business, which was left to the mercy of the mob. “This is not the America I came into. … What did we do to deserve all this?” he asked. “I’m a minority too. I’m a brown person. I have nothing to do with this.”Contrary to what Wallace implied, neither did whitesupremacists or militia groups. Black Lives Matter rioters were in fact proud to take credit. Sam told The Federalist that more than a week after the Blakeshooting, Black Lives Matter rioters came back to hisshop in broad daylight to make “music videos” in the wreckage of his business “like they wereso proud of it,” taunting him with, “this is what you get.”Desperate pleas for mercy from the rioters confirmed who was instigating the violence. If business owners were trying to avoid losing everything to whitesupremacists, they wouldn’t have displayed placardssignalingsupport for BLM andsigns reading “minority-owned” in theirstorefronts — yet that’s exactly what they did. Like many other media figures and Democrats, Wallaceseemed to be cherry-picking one instance of violence from a demonstrator linked to the political right, at the expense of accurately covering the rampant lawlessness instigated by leftist extremists. Kyle Rittenhousebecame the face ofso-called right-wing violence in Kenosha. Rittenhouse, a 17-year-old Hispanic boy who worked as a lifeguard in Kenosha,saw the destruction and violence and picked up his AR-15 to patrol thestreets. In a videoshot around 10 p.m., Rittenhouse explained his purpose,saying, “People are getting injured, and our job is to protect this business, and part of my job is also to help people. If there’ssomebody hurt, I’m running into harm’s way. That’s why I have my rifle, because I need to protect myself, obviously. But I also have my med kit.”Later that night, things escalated when threeshootings left two people dead and another injured. Police apprehended Rittenhouse, the allegedshooter. Videos capturing theshootingssuggest Rittenhouse might have been justified inself-defense. Whether Rittenhouse, an Illinois native, belonged in Kenosha in the first place is debatable, but nothingsuggests the boy was motivated by whitesupremacy or was part of a larger militia group. In fact, the Anti-Defamation League found no evidence he was or is connected to any extremist movements. Yet Democrats and their friends in the corporate media,such as Wallace, have tried to paint Rittenhouse as a “whitesupremacist” in order tode flect all blame from the real agitators, left-wing groupssuch as BLM and Antifa. Rittenhouse’s guilt has not been confirmed in a court of law, yet Wallace defamed him with gross charges of racism on national television with 29 million people watching. Biden did thesame onsocial media in a wholly inappropriatesmear. On Monday, Bidentweeteda video featuring Rittenhouse, with the caption, “There’s no other way to put it: the President of the USs refused to disavow whitesupremacists on the debatestage last night.”Wednesday it was announced Rittenhouse is pursuing a libel case against Biden and his campaign for the advertisementsuggesting he is a whitesupremacist. Rittenhouse’s attorney, Lin Wood,said he plans to “rip Joe intoshreds.”Not only was Wallace’s debate tactic dirty, but it is factually wrong tosay the violence and destruction that consumed Kenosha wasspawned by “whitesupremacists,” given that the overwhelming majority of arrests were of left-wing rioters. Trump pointed out that the majority of violence in places like Kenosha is coming from “the left-wing, not from the right-wing.” Democrats’ “right-wing extremists” narrative has become increasingly difficult to defend, with accounts from on-the-ground reportersshattering their talking points. A recentstudy found that95 percent of riots in the USs this year have been tied to Black Lives Matter. Taking his cues from Wallace, Bidenshouted at Trump to denounce Proud Boys, a right-wing group. The only instance of Proud Boys in Kenosha, however, wasn’t during the nights of violence, but during the day. Two demonstratorssporting Proud Boys paraphernalia engaged in a verbal confrontation with three dozen BLM demonstrators, who were present to protest Trump’s visit. Reporterssaid the two demonstrators did not appear to be armed and were being followed by the large group of BLM protesters. When the clash appeared volatile, law enforcement encircled the two Proud Boys demonstrators, who “appeared to be frightened,” walked them to nearbysquad cars, and removed them from the area. It’ssafe tosay the duo didn’t “add to the violence,” to use Wallace’s words. Despite the endless accounts thissummer of violence instigated by left-wing groups — which have left police officers dead, businesses and homes reduced to ashes, and communities in anarchic disarray — Democrats and the media keep pushing their “whitesupremacist” talking point. Many voters and residents of these torn cities aren’t buying it. “You’re telling me you’re going to burn down my neighborhood?” Valerie, a 25-year-old black woman and former Democrat from the inner city of Milwaukee,toldthe Federalist in Kenosha of Black Lives Matter. “No, I don’t want to be a Democrat anymore.”So MSNBC can keepstanding in front of burning cities and calling them “mostly peaceful” protests, and Chris Wallace can keep pretending the right is to blame for the violence. But we were in Kenosha. We talked to people on the ground. Voters know who the peaceful protesters are and who the rioters are.",0,0,The Federalist

So Is All Real Estate.,0.0,40.0,https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/07/surfside-tower-was-just-another-condo-building/619348/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-atlantic-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-02,25,"The disaster in Surfside, Florida, focuses attention on condominiums’ flaws, but all forms of property ownership carry the potential for uglysurprises. After most of a condominium tower in Surfside, Florida, collapsed last week, thesecond-guessing began almost immediately. Some residents accused the building’s condominium association of acting tooslowly to address knownstructural flaws identified in a 2018 engineering report. Recent newsstories have emphasized dissension among the owners. Assomeone whostudies condos—their history, architecture, politics, andsocial dynamics, in Florida and all over the USs—I, too, have been wondering whether the building’s divided ownership contributed to the June 24 catastrophe, which killed at least 18 people and left more than 140 missing. Could asingle landlord have responded better to engineers’ and occupants’ concerns than an association of 136 homeowners?Condos have long been big business and a way of life insoutheast Florida, which by the 1970s had become America’s center of condo living. Today roughly one in five homeowners in US cities andsuburbs lives in a multifamily complex rather than asingle-family house, according to US census figures; in Miami and Fort Lauderdale, thatshare rises to one in three. Surfside residents described Champlain Towers South as a genuine community: “There was a beautiful mixture of cultures and people in that building,”one local toldl. “People from South America, Cuban Jews, American Jews, American nationals.”In most ways, the tower in Surfside was no different from Florida’s thousands of other high-rise condo buildings. Those, meanwhile, face many of thesame risks—most notably their proximity to the ocean during a time ofsea-level rise—assingle-owner apartment buildings and other concrete-and-steel properties along the Florida coast. A number of reportssuggest that the Champlain Towers South Condominium Association functioned properly and had moved methodically,albeit amid considerable resistance, to figure out how to fix the problems that an engineer had identified. Investigatorsstill have much to learn about the causes of the disaster. Thevagaries of the condo format, including the need to raise $15 million for repairs through a “special assessment” on the owners, might conceivably haveslowed the building’s response tostructural problems. Absentee ownership, common in many condo buildings, especially in resorts and cosmopolitan business centers, might have hindered repairs further. Derek Thompson: Why Manhattan’sskyscrapers are emptyAnd yet the collapse might also have been caused by other, yet-to-be-identified factors that didn’t turn up in the 2018 engineer’s report. “From what Isee, [that report] didn’t look likesomething that I wouldsay, ‘Get the people out,’” Norma Jean Mattei, a University of New Orleans engineering professor,told. “The deterioration played a part, but it wasn’t what caused this failure. Something else had to push this building over the top.” In other words, Champlain Towers South might havesuffered not from bad ownership or bad governance but from bad circumstances and bad luck. Because of the disasterin Surfside, long-standing questions about condo-mania in Florida and elsewhere are resurfacing. The condo, like other forms of co-owned housingsuch as the co-op, occupies an ambiguous place in American life. Most American home buyers have historically preferredsingle-family houses and understood other kinds of dwellings to besecond-best. Geographers,sociologists, anthropologists, and politicalscientists have argued for decades that the condosystem is fundamentally unworkable, little more than ascheme cooked up by developers toseduce property buyers with good locations, luxury amenities, and hollow promises of community. Otherssaw condominium arrangements as an inevitable fiasco, worrying that an amateur group of owners couldn’t possibly run a building competently. Still, the individually owned apartment emerged in the 19th century in citiessuch as New York and Washington, DC, for those who could afford a house but didn’t need or want one—with careful efforts in design and marketing to distinguish them from working-class tenements. The originator of the for-sale apartment in the US in the 1880s opted for asimplesystem: the corporate-title “cooperative,” in which the association holds title to the entire complex and individual ownership is conveyed by perpetual, in many cases $1-a-year, “proprietary” leases. Insome respects, this is asuperior model. Thesingle title enables associations to more easily take out commercial loans for repairs, while the leases allow them to evict owners who become a liability. Yet the power of the association, especially toscreen resales, made mortgage lenders wary. And in a nation deeply committed to unfettered property ownership, it also limited the appeal of owning an apartment. Starting in the late 1950s, the mortgage industry, anticipating untapped demand, began to promote condominium arrangements in Florida, then nationally. As early as 1921, Congress questioned the entire premise of for-sale apartments, grilling homeowners about its viability. By 1974, an aggrieved owner, also testifying before Congress, asked, “Can a condominium actually work?” More recently, dysfunctional condo politics have been thestuff of TV comedy onshowssuch as. Since 2009, disputes between owners and homeowner associations have aired on Sunday mornings in South Florida on an AM radioshow called “Condo Craze & HOAs,” hosted by the attorney Eric M Glazer—a Judge Judy for the Condominium Coast. Behind much of theskepticism of the condosystem were tensions between private rights in property and community obligations. Between the 1880s and World War I, co-owned buildings in the USs were mostlysponsored directly by future tenants (foreshadowing the recent wave of in Berlin). By the 1920s, though,speculative developers came to dominate. Tosell apartments, they learned to emphasize lifestyle, including ease of physical maintenance (“no lawn to mow,” read many an ad), while downplaying responsibilities. But owning an apartment, like any other property, comes with its own burdens—just ones less tangible than a lawn. No matter thesystem, ownership turns tenants, ready or not, into landlords: Members of a condominium automatically become co-owners of a corporate entity responsible for common elements. As nearly everyone who has ever owned an apartment in a large building knows, however, rare is the condo owner who’s attuned to this duty, and rarerstill is the one who attends association meetings, let aloneserves on the board of directors. Read: The hot new Millennial housing trend is a repeat of the Middle AgesAnd yet developers andsales agents recognized this gap early on. While honing their marketingstrategies, they began to encourage buildings to hire “professional” management, leaving associations with few direct responsibilities. Governance couldstill be challenging. In co-ops in New York and DC, where associations typicallyscreen new buyers (ostensibly for reasons of financialsecurity), battles erupted over whether to allow resales to Jewish people and, later,single women, Black people, and gay men. In more recent decades, residents of condo buildings have feuded over everything from cosmetic upgrades (redecorating lobbies) to the installation of EV chargingstations. These disputes hint at whysome early critics believed that condos would inevitably result in huge problems, including premature physical decay. These predictions occasionally proved true—but almost never in the US In America, our faith in astable and transparent real-estatesystemsupersedes our deep-seated aversion to public oversight of private transactions. As a result, regulation of condominium-like arrangements in this country, even in freewheeling Florida, has been among the most robust in the world, making American condo owners the envy of their counterparts in places as diverse as Australia, China, and Israel. People around the world following the news from Surfside are now aware of Miami-Dade County’s requirement that buildings undergo recertification by engineers or architects after 40 years. Butsince the 1970s, Florida has also introduced an array of other regulations to ensuresafe, equitable, and relatively efficient governance of co-owned apartments, and otherstates have followed its lead in many ways. When developers experimented with locking associations into management contracts at uncompetitive rates (as detailed in John D MacDonald’s 1977 disaster novel,), kept downsales prices by retaining ownership of common areas and renting them back to associations (also at inflated rates), or made monthly charges unsustainably low by retaining control over associations until an overwhelming majority of units weresold, thestate outlawed these practices. To allow for a more timely and cost-effective resolution of disputes among owners, and between owners and associations, itset up provisions for resolving disputes outside the courts. None of this guarantees that, when major repairs become necessary, owners will be able to make decisions or raise money quickly. And even ifstates push associations harder to take the unique pitfalls of condo arrangements into account, owners arestill exposed to other risks, including, insome cases, the uncertainties inherent to waterfront living amid climate change. Ultimately, the condo format could turn out to be a factor in the Surfside disaster, but any presumption of guilt now may provide false reassurance to people who have astake in other forms of real estate—and face the ugly, rare, andsometimes catastrophicsurprises that are a possibility in property ownership of every kind.​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

Announced by Biden on Friday, the decision to reimpose a ban on the detention of pregnant women and girls was initially outlined in a memosigned last week by acting ICE Director Tae Johnson. Boasting of the new policy, Johnsonsaid the border agency is“committed tosafeguarding the integrity of our immigrationsystem and preserving the health andsafety of pregnant, postpartum and nursing individuals.”He added that“given the unique needs of this population,”ICE won’t lock up anyone currently or recently pregnant“unless release is prohibited by law or exceptional circumstances exist,”but did not elaborate on what might warrantsuch exceptions. The measure does not rule out arresting pregnant, postpartum or nursing women, the ICE memostresses, but does require that if the yare to be housed in US detention facilities, they must receive mental healthservices and other appropriate care. The agency is alsostill permitted tosend expecting women to immigration courts. ICE went out of its way to avoidspecifying the gender of any hypothetical prisoner in its memo, a deliberate move intended to include transgender males among the group of pregnancy-capable individuals to whom the policy applies,accordingto asenior administration official whospoke to USA Today on Friday. The decision is notso much new as it is a reversal of a 2017 policy enacted by former president Donald Trump, who placed the fight against illegal immigration at the center of hissuccessful 2016 election campaign. Under Trump’s predecessor and Biden’s former boss, Barack Obama, ICE had astated policy of only detaining pregnant immigrants“under extraordinary circumstances.”During Trump’s first two years in the White House, pregnant immigrants were detained 80% more frequently than during the last year of Obama’s presidency, according to a Government Accountability Report released last year. Biden’s version of the policy does expand the period in which illegal migrants can claim exemption from ICE detention, however. While Obama’s policy restricted itself to pregnant women only, Biden’sshield includes those who gave birth up to one year ago, as well as nursing women.",1,1,RT

The... [+]P4 epidemiological laboratory, part of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, is one of the world is leading research centers on coronaviruses. (Johannes Eisele / AFP via Getty Images)At the very end of 2019, a new disease began to emerge in humans: COVID-19. Originally described as aset of pneumonia-likesymptoms with a hitherto unseen cause, aset of alarming factssoon came to light. A novel virus — now known to be SARS-CoV-2 — had begun infecting humans, with the first major outbreakstemming from a wet market in Wuhan: the largest city by far in the Chinese province of Hubei. The next pandemic, just as virologists and disease ecologists had been predicting for years, emerged from the continued encroachment of human civilization on territory previously inhabitedsolely by wild animals. Human-animal contact, responsible for pandemics ranging from SARS to MERS to Ebola to HIV, was almost certainly the culprit in bringing this novel coronavirus into the human population as well. But this explanation for SARS-CoV-2, claiming that it had a zoonotic origin, has been disputed bysome, despite the lack of any publicly availablescientific evidence to the contrary. Instead, according to recent claims, the virus may not have originated andspread from the wild, but could have escaped, in a lab leak, from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. From the point of view of the virus’s genome, there’s no way to rulesuch a possibility out,so long as the virus was never characterized or reported in the lab before its escape. But is this lab leak hypothesis a legitimatescientific theory, on equal or evensuperior footing with the zoonotic origin theory? Or is it a conspiracy theory, without thescientific evidence to back up these wild assertions? Let’s ta kea comprehensive look to try and unpack everything that’s been going on. The Apollo 14 landingsite isstill intact, and our images of it in modern timesstill carry the... [+]legacy of this nearly-50-years-old event. The lunarsurface changes veryslowly over time, and the changes we made in 1971 arestill perceptible, virtually unchanged, today. Practically every time there’s a revolutionary new phenomenon or happenstance thatsignificantly alters the course of humansociety, there are a number of ideas that arise to challenge the mainstream narrative. While these can bescientifically motivated by asubset of the evidence, more often these challenges take the form of a conspiracy theory: where a number of people involved allegedly know the real, full truth behind an issue, but are covering it up, presenting an alternative narrative instead. When you mix conspiracies withscience, certain people are inevitably drawn to those ideas, which include:There are certain identifiable hallmarks of these theories. They always include alarge number of lines of circumstantial evidencesuggesting that the full truth isn’t being told. Each claim, on its own, doesn’t carry any compelling weight, but many put a variety of (possibly unrelated) puzzle pieces together to compose asuggestive picture. Many demonstrably false claims are always included as well, and as those are debunked one-by-one,supporters of the conspiracy will move the goalposts once again, claimingsomething like, “well, these parts of the idea aren’t true, and those are conspiracies, but (whatever aspects remain) must be the real truth!”A new conspiracy theory, promoted by Sen. Rand Paul, vilifies Dr. Fauci and attempts to tie him to... [+]the notion that the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 was engineered in and leaked from the Wuhan Institute for Virology. Thescientific evidencesays otherwise on all counts. The other hallmark of conspiracies almost always involvesomesort of guilt by association accusation. This typically manifests itself as an unclean handsargument:somestatement or person that’s part of the mainstream, consensus narrative is found to have donesomething untrue or unethical, and therefore the entire narrative can be dismissed. Dr. Fauci, for example, caved to political pressure about encouraging people not to wear masks in order to reserve them for front line healthcare workers, undermining the entire credibility of allsubsequent public health campaigns. When Dr. Li Wenliang blew the COVID-19 whistle beforesuccumbing to the disease in China, we learned of an uncomfortable reality: the Chinese government did try to cover up the truth about this new affliction in humans. Although these facts don’t necessarily mean that anyone lied about any other aspects of COVID-19 — Fauci, the Chinese government, or anyone else involved in combatting the worst effects of the pandemic — it’s reasonable to questionsuchstatements. Many of us wonder about what else could be getting covered up in thissituation. In fact,speculations about a lab-based origin to this virus, with claims that it was engineered as a bio weapon by the Chinese government, go back as far as January 26, 2020. But were those claims — and, in fact, all the claims that followed — motivated by legitimatescientific uncertainty? Or were these merely political machinations, designed to disingenuously cast blame whilesimultaneously justifying a wanton neglect of necessary responsibilities by numerous governments across the globe?Judy Mikovits,shown in her then-lab with then-graduatestudent Cassandra Puccinelli in 2011, is now... [+]notorious for three things: lying about her role in the treatment and identification of HIV/AIDS, committing grossscientific misconduct in her XMRV research concerning its presence in humans and its ability to cause chronic fatiguesyndrome, and her faux documentary about COVID-19, Plandemic, which is ascientific travesty. The original conspiracy theory claimed that China was in the process of engineering a bio weapon to inflict maximum damage on human populations in enemy countries around the world:a bizarre role-reversal of an earlier conspiracy theory where China claimed that the USs engineered the original, 2003 SARS virus to attack China. They claimed that SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, was deliberately bio engineered as a plot against humanity, was inadequately contained, then accidentally released, and then grew into the global pandemic we all continue to live through. These baseless claims were repeated by many prominent individuals — mostly politicians but including the occasional contr arianscientist — over the early months of 2020. In May, a faux-documentary touting various aspects of this conspiracy was released:Plandemic. The videos were viewed millions of times, anddespiteanenormousnumberofdebunkingpieces, including one tracking the horrific fraud and toxic legacy of its main “scientist” Judy Mikovitz, they continued to influence the thought processes of many, particularly of non-scientists. In September of 2020,Dr. Li-Meng Yan published a pre-print of a report claiming that SARS-CoV-2 was created in a Chinese Lab as part of bio weapon research. That paper was debunked by numerous researchers, and multiple reviewers at MIT’s Rapid Reviews of COVID-19concluded that the claims were misleading, unethical, and “baseless and are notsupported by the data and methods used.”Li-Meng Yan, an ophthalmologist (not a virologist, asstated), has made many bold and unsupported... [+]claims about the origin of SARS-CoV-2 as a bioweapon, but these claims are notsupported by the data and have been rejected by at least four independent reviews of her work. This has been thestate of affairs: wild, unsupported accusations touting a variety of conspiracies have been a highly politicized counter-narrative to the obvious consensus opinion: that SARS-CoV-2 emerged naturally,likely through pangolins as an intermediary between bats and humans, infected its first humans in 2019, and found its way to the city of Wuhan, where it entered the greater human population and grew into the ongoing pandemic. Has anything changed, based onscientific merits, that could cause us to reconsider the idea that this virus emerged from a lab, rather than naturally? While no newscientific information has been made publicly available that wouldshift opinions on thescientific merits, there aresome people for whom a few circumstantial factsstand out:Forsome, you can look at thissubset of facts and your brain will fill in the details, connecting the dots from potentially dangerous research to an insecure lab to early infections to a global pandemic. But there are noscientific revelations to be had here. In fact,while news coverage has increased, thescience case has actually weakened; what’s being presented is essentially just the already-debunked Plandemic ideas with a few of the discredited points removed. That places you, the non-expert, in asituation where you’re asked to draw your own conclusions with insufficient information. This figureshows thestructure of thespike protein in SARS-CoV-2. Panel Ashows thespike... [+]homotrimer in its open configuration, while panel Bshows the cleavagesites on thespike protein. What’s needed — in fact, what even professionals in fields like immunology, epidemiology, and disease ecology need —is expertise that most of us don’t have:specifically, expertise from field of virology. This includes the expertise of how virus genomes evolve, how virological research is conducted, and what thespecific facts that are known about viruses and how theyspread and reproduce. It also includes what’s likely, unlikely, or impossible to happen when you tinker with a virus’s genome through various natural and artificial modification methods. If you want to know whether a laboratory origin for SARS-CoV-2 is reasonable, the two things to look at are the genome of the disease and the ecological modeling of how that diseaseshould behave in the wild. From the virus’s genome, we can robustly conclude that the mechanisms proposed for how this virus would have arisen in a lab are all wildly insufficient to explain its properties. From the case records of COVID-19 and the behavior of the disease, it’s likely that the first cases in Hubei province occurred as early as October of 2019, meaning that the alleged infections among Wuhan Institute of Virology workers could not explain the origin of the very first cases. But even beyond that, it’s important to take a look at the research in question: that of Dr. Shi Zhengli —known as China’s “bat woman”for her research into bat-borne diseases — at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Shi Zhengli, a researcher at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV),speaks during the 2020... [+]Zhongguancun Forum on September 18, 2020. Dr. Shi is one of the world is top virologists, and is arguably the leading researcher on coronavirus es that originate in bats. She is one of humanity is most important assets in the fight against current and future pandemics. (Hou Yu/China News Service via Getty Images)Over the past 17 years, Dr. Shi has been the pre-eminent virus hunter in bats, undertaking expeditions into bat caves to find and characterize novel viruses in an attempt to combatsomething that could turn into the next SARS: a disease that first emerged in 2002/2003, infecting more than 8,000 and with a fatality rate of nearly 10%. In late December of 2019, the director of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, her direct boss, told her that the Wuhan CDC had detected a novelstrain of coronavirus in two hospital patients with an unusual form of pneumonia, andshe was told to investigate. Immediately,she feared the worst: that perhaps the virus could have come from her lab. But whatshe did next was what you’d want any good researcher to do:she went through her lab’s records to check the geneticsequences from all of the viruses in her lab. The results? None of them matched SARS-CoV-2. In fact, the closest match — at 96% — was a coronavirus that was identified in a population of horseshoe bat in Yunnan: three provinces away from Hubei, where Wuhan is located. This is not novel information, either; it was published in Nature back in early February, 2020. The geneticsequence of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 from patients, as compared to other known... [+]coronaviruses. The coronavirus that wasstudied with the alleged gain-of-function research, RaTG13, is not a good match for the disease that causes COVID-19, but rather aspecies of horseshoe bat from Yunnan province: nowhere near Wuhan itself. Diseases do frequently jump from animals to humans, and this trend is fully expected to continue without purposeful intervention. Swine flus arise from pig farming; bird flus largely arise from poultry farming. Civets brought the original SARS into humans; horses brought the Hendra virus into humans; pigs brought the Nipah virus into humans. In addition, the low fatality rate of COVID-19 and the high incidence of asymptomatic individuals indicates that the pathogen could have been around forsome time before the firstsevere cases emerged. Virologist Ralph Baric of the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill,drew attention to the following important point:“There might have been mini-outbreaks [before the first wave of major cases], but the viruses either burned out or maintained low-level transmission before causing havoc. [Since most animal-borne viruses re-emerge periodically], the Wuhan outbreak is by no means incidental.”Indeed,in two-out-of-threesimulations, the natural emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in humans would result in extinction of the virus before an epidemic ensued. Either we got relatively unlucky, which is possible, or this might not have been the first jump of the virus to humans; it’s just the first jump we know of. In addition,it may not be the last, which further emphasizes the importance of identifying andstudying these viruses in the wild and in the lab: before the next pandemic occurs.

(Sebastian Gollnow/picture alliance via Getty Images)The virological evidencesupporting a laboratory origin of SARS-CoV-2, on the other hand, is enormously flimsy. The idea that we can insert novel geneticsequences into a virus is true, but what happens next isn’t generally appreciated. In particular:None of these criteria even consider the variation in the genetics of the host, the immunity of potential hosts, and the probabilities associated with infection among hosts. Insummary, if SARS-CoV-2 was created in a lab — which the evidence does not favor — this virussomehow won the generic lottery on multiple, complex fronts, each one of which is an active research area in virology to this day. Furthermore, if this virus did originate from a leak from the Wuhan Institute for Virology, it either leaked out prior to the very first cases, which is a problem for the time line of cases, or it was already circulating in humans prior to its release. Either way, however, there would have to be an enormous conspiracy. Dr. Shi must have been lying; other people in her group and at the Wuhan Institute for Virology must have been lying; people at EcoHealth Alliance must have been lying; affiliated researcherssuch as Peter Daszek must be lying; and Dr. Fauci must be lying as well. It’s like imagining the world of Fahrenheit 451, where the “firefighters” are actually arsonists, except for virology: where the experts in pandemic prevention are actively trying to unleash pandemics upon the world. This 3D rendering of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2,shows the basicstructure of the virus... [+]particle that has causedso much death andsuffering in the world. Our global response to its emergence was woefully inadequate, but resorting to a witch hunt to implicate the very researchers who work to prevent and mitigate these pandemics is truly a new low for oursociety. Or, alternatively, this was a naturally occurring virus. It leapt from bats to another animal years or even decades ago, and then to humans, naturally, in 2019, which the geneticsequences clearlysupport. The researchers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology who were allegedly infected early on were most probably infected thesame way all the other people in Wuhan got infected: likely through airborne contact with another infected person. All of thestudiessupport thesame conclusion: that once the disease entered humans, it evolved from there, with asingle entry point consistent with every one of thesubsequent cases. The ultimate lesson from COVID-19, in fact, is that these pandemics are going to continue to emerge naturally, and that weshould be encouraging the researchers who are on the front lines ofstudying these potentially infectious diseases to investigate them to the fullest extent of their abilities. Instead, the tactic we’re taking — accusing them of fraud without ashred of meaningful, direct evidence —showcases how thoroughly we’re letting fear and conspiratorial thinking cloud our judgment. After all, our thinking about what the “next pandemic” would be was woefully incorrect; it would be ashame to not learn the valuable lessons that COVID-19 has to teach us. AsDr. Joel Wertheim at the University of California, San Diego, put it,“Pandemicsurveillance wasn’t prepared for a virus like SARS-CoV-2. We were looking for the next SARS or MERS,something that killed people at a high rate, but in hindsight, wesee how a highly transmissible virus with a modest mortality rate can also lay the world low.”The Wuhan Institute of Virology,shown as members of the World Health Organization (WHO) team...

(HECTOR RETAMAL/AFP via Getty Images)What no one is disputing is that it’s reasonable to be concerned aboutsecurity at research institutes, and to be concerned about lab leaks in general. If you wanted to call for routine inspections, and the enforcement ofsufficientsafety criteria across the board, there are very few who would be opposed to that. But a call for a large-scale, outside investigation into Dr. Shi’s laboratory lacks the necessary evidence to motivate it. If any of the18scientists whosigned the recent Science letter calling forsuch an investigation actually wanted to investigate the lab leak hypothesis in ascientific manner, they wouldsimply write a research grant to doso. That’s how virology is routinely performed, an dhowscientific and professional misconduct in virology has been uncovered in the past. The fact that they’ve brought their case to the general public instead reveals how flimsy their arguments are, while a broader concern is that the next time a pandemic flu emerges within the USs, we will haveset a grossly unacceptable international precedent. Americanscientists will be vilified and harassed; foreign agents will demand access to our federally funded labs; lab records will be demanded by foreign governments; etc. This is a Pandora is Box, brought forth by political inquisitors, that must not be opened unless adequatescientific proof of thesespecious allegations comes to light. We frequentlysay that what can be asserted without evidence can be dismissed without evidence, and this conspiracy theory of a lab leak-origin for SARS-CoV-2should be treated assuch. Dr. Fauci, EcoHealth Alliance, and Dr. Shi, among others,simply have the misfortune of being in the crosshairs of political agents who themselves have been largely responsible for the mismanaged global response to this inevitable pandemic. Just like the notions that 9/11 was an inside job, the Apollo Moon landings were a hoax, or that “ClimateGate” proves the unethical behavior of practically all climatescientists, there is plenty ofstrong evidence opposing the conspiracy, insteadsupporting the consensus conclusion. If we are to take an alternativeseriously, it cannot just consist of circumstantial evidence with enormous gapsseparating thesteps; you would need concrete evidence. Unless that evidence arrives, the “lab leak hypothesis” will remain a conspiracy theory, while the zoonotic origin hypothesis remains overwhelminglysupported by the evidence at hand.",2,1,Forbes
570,Lawsuit Challenges Admissions Changes Meant to Boost Diversity at Acclaimed High School,0.33,46.67,https://www.edweek.org/policy-politics/lawsuit-challenges-admissions-changes-meant-to-boost-diversity-at-acclaimed-high-school/2021/03,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-10,25,"A group representing Asian-American parents on Wednesdaysued a Virginiaschool district over a new admissions plan designed to boost racial, ethnic, andsocioeconomic diversity at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology, a highlyselective magnet program that is considered one of the top academic highschools in the nation. The group, called the Coalition for TJ, contends that a new “holistic review” admissions program willsignificantly reduce the proportion of Asian-Americanstudents at the highschool in Alexandria, Va.“Plaintiff’s data analysts project that Asian-Americanstudent enrollment at TJ will drop from 73 percent under the merit-based race-blind admissionssystem to 31 percent under the new racial-balancing admissionssystem for the Class of 2025,”says the lawsuit filed in US District Court in Alexandria. “No other racial group is projected to loseseats. The greatest beneficiary of the new admissionssystem in terms of increased population will be whitestudents.”The Fairfax Countyschool district did not respond to a request for comment on Wednesday. According to the 187,000-student district, insuburban Washington, DC, Thomas Jefferson had a 2019-20student enrollment that was 71.5 percent Asian, 19.48 percent non-Hispanic White, 2.6 percent Hispanic or Latino, 1.72 percent Black, and 4.70 percent other. Theschoolsystem, whose overallstudent enrollment is 38 percent White, 27 percent Hispanic, 20 percent Asian, and 10 percent Black, has made efforts to boost diversity at Thomas Jefferson in recent years, to little avail. The 2020 racial reckoning over the death of George Floyd in police custody and related events prompted renewed efforts to increase diversity at theselectiveschool, which was founded in 1985.“Over the past 10 years, the [Thomas Jefferson] admissions process has undergone aseries of changes that were intended to impact issues of diversity and inclusion,” theschoolsystemsaid in a white paper last year. “Nonetheless, … these changes have not made asignificant impact on the diversity of the applicants or admittedstudents.”Fairfax Superintendent Scott Brabrand last year proposed eliminating Thomas Jefferson’s admissions test in favor of five “regional pathways” based on middleschools, with each being allocated aset number ofseats in the incoming first-year class to be determined by lottery. Under that plan, Blackstudent enrollment would have increased to 7 percent, while Asianstudent enrollment would drop to 54 percent, and Whitestudent enrollment would increase to 25 percent. The Fairfax County School Board voted to eliminate the entrance exam in October. In December, the board adopted an alternative new plan. Under that plan, the top 1.5 percent of each of the district’s middleschools who meet certain minimum academicstandards will be eligible for admission to Thomas Jefferson. The district will then conduct a holistic review that examines factors including eachstudent’s grade-point average, a problem-solving essay, and “experience factors” that include whether they are economically disadvantaged, English-language learners, or from underrepresented middleschools.“Experience factors will allow consideration of contexts that require astudent to demonstrate grit and persevere through challenges to meet the [Thomas Jefferson] applicant requirements,” theschoolsystem’s white papersaid. The district did not offerspecific projections for changes in racial and ethnic balance under the holistic review plan. The newsystem is taking effect thisspring for the class of 2025 that enters the highschool this fall. The lawsuit by Coalition for TJ argues that the new admissionssystem violates the 14th Amendment’s equal protection clause because “although facially race-neutral, it was enacted with discriminatory intent.”The lawsuit cites a 2020 email from Thomas Jefferson Principal Ann Bonitatibus to theschool communitysaying that the racial composition of the highschool does not reflect that of theschoolsystem overall.“If our demographics actually represented [Fairfax County Public Schools], we would enroll 180 Black and 460 Hispanicstudents, filling nearly 22 classrooms,” the principal’s emailsaid.“This email put the focussquarely on race and the racial balance at TJ, foreshadowing changes to come,”says thesuit, which cites other comments by officials in the district about the need to make Thomas Jefferson more representative.“Defendants have been forthright that the changes to the TJ admissions policy are intended to reduce the proportion of Asian-Americanstudents enrolled at TJ because they are ‘overrepresented’ compared to the rest of [Fairfax County Public Schools],” thesuitsays.“They want to match the racial makeup of the county as a whole,” Glenn E Roper, a lawyer with the Pacific Legal Foundation, which is representing Coalition for TJ,said in an interview. “That was the motivating purpose. School districts can change an admissions program, but they can’t do it with a racially discriminatory purpose.”The lawsuit comes as the US Supreme Court has upheld the holistic consideration of race in college admissions but has a challenge to Harvard’s race-conscious admissions program awaiting a decision from the justices on whether they will review that case. In 2007, when the US Supreme Courtstruck down twoschool districts’ voluntary race-conscious plans for assigningstudents toschools, inParents Involved in Community Schools vs Seattle School District, Justice Anthony M Kennedy wrote a concurrence thatsuggested there were permissible ways for districts to boost racial diversity through race-conscious means. One of those was “drawing attendance zones with general recognition of the demographics of neighborhoods,” Kennedy wrote in his concurrence, whichsome legal experts consider the controlling opinion inParents Involvedbecause much of the main opinion in that case was a mere plurality. The Fairfax County plan for Thomas Jefferson High aims to be a race-neutral plan for increasing racial, ethnic, andsocioeconomic diversity, the very kind of plan that many advocates have urgedschools and colleges to adopt instead of race-conscious policies. It will be up to a federal district court, forstarters, to decide whether the plan was adopted with the impermissible racial motivation alleged in the lawsuit.",2,1,Education Week

573,When is it time to cut off a toxic family member?,-2.67,37.33,https://www.mic.com/p/when-is-it-time-to-cut-off-a-toxic-family-member-43101998,https://adfontesmedia.com/mic-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-12,25,"We are living in divisive times. This is both a cliche and massive understatement. Most people have family members who that they disagree with about politics,social justice, or coronavirussafety, and the pressure cooker of the pandemic has really brought tensions to a boil for a lot of us. As a vocally radical queer person who grew up in a conservative home, I have hadsome interactions with family that left me feelingso wounded that I wondered if it’s psychologically healthy for me to continue to talk to them. As the holidayseason approaches, I’m confident that others have this issue on their minds as well,so I asked experts how to figure out when it’s time to cut a toxic family member of your life. It’s worth noting that any relationship comes withsome inherent discomfort. “Some mightsay that the more closely connected you are withsomeone, the greater the risk of conflict,”says Sara Stanizai, a California-based psychotherapist who works with queer, transgender, and bicultural communities. However, Stanizai explains, discomfort is different from abuse, and discerning the difference is critical for your own emotional wellbeing. But it may be hard to tell the difference when tempers are high or feelings are hurt. Know that when you argue with a family member, about politics especially, there is aspectrum of how ""healthy"" the discourse is. You can be respectfully heated, but when it borderlines on toxic comments and behavior, it is problem worth addressing. “The hallmark for defining abuse is there is a noticeable, pervasive pattern,” Satnizaisays. “This does not mean it happens all the time, but it begins to be predictable.” For example,shesays, there’s a pattern if you can expect thesame type of criticism about multiple areas of your life fromsomeone or if they are continually hyper focusing on onesubject and constantly finding many things wrong with it. I, for instance, have a family member who is always talking about “the gays.” One minute it may be, “the gays want to make us all gay,” and five minutes latershe might make a comment like, “gay peoplespread disease.” It’s likeshe’s always trying to finding away to talk about how terrible gay people are, even though I am one of them. This is not a debate. It is abusive behavior. Another hallmark of abusive relationships is a lack of accountability. If you tellsomeone thatsomething theysaid or did hurt you, and they don’t care, that’s a problem that could be anothersign of abuse,says Stanizai. And it might be time to assert your needs more directly. She recommends, however, givingsomeone a chance to apologize and make amends before you assume that they won’t. It is tempting to just ignore the behavior, but that will likely just dig you into a deeper, more painful hole in the long run. When you’re feeling hurt, it can be really hard tospeak up for yourself. You may need tosetsome boundaries between yourself and the person who’s hurt you before you can do that. That’s okay. But eventually, if you want to try to heal the relationship, you are going to have to have a difficult conversation,says Stanizai. If the other person avoids the conversation or taking responsibility for their own words or actions, then it may be time toset new limits. If you are not making leeway with this person who has a pattern of hurting you, you can choose a level of ""cutting them off."" Discarding them completely is not the only option. There are degrees ofseparation you can create that may allow you to feelsafer. “This can mean limiting time to them only in groups, or only for certain occasions, or for 1-2 hours at a time,”shesays. If it feelssafe, try to givesomeone more than one chance to apologize. Being confronted often makes people feel defensive, and continually offering olive branches is a disarming maneuver that can benefit everyone. “Whensomeone feels that you are giving them an honest chance, they are more likely to listen to yourside too,” Stanizai adds. Now, if there is no circumstance in which you may feel emotionallysafe withsomeone, explore that, discuss it with a trusted person in your life, and then own it. It might not last forever, but this is your current reality. You do not have tospend time with abusive people. If you find yourself truly activated bysomeone — meaning that contact with them induces a panic attack or a mental health episode, Stanizai explains — then it may be time to really cut ties. ""It is perfectly fine toskip the family BBQ or keep your distance fromsomeone altogether,”shesays. Ultimately, managing a conflicted relationship with a family member is not a black and white problem and there are no black or whitesolutions. If you decide tostop talking tosomeone, you can change your mind later if it feelssafe for you. The most important thing is that you continue to bolster your ownsense of agency. Having asense of control in your relationships is not about controlling other people, it’s about feeling like you get to have control over yourself. Speaking up for yourself whensomeone hurts you may feel hard, Stanizaisays, but it can help you take control of the narrative.",1,1,Mic

The retail and entertainment giant announced Wednesday that it would acquire MGM, thestoried moviestudio for $8.5 billion, giving them the keys to franchises likeJames Bondand Rocky, and landing the flaggingstudio around $3 billion more than its valuation. If all this consolidationseems like a product of the 21st century’s rapacious online monopolies, it’s actually true to thespirit of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer’s multi hyphenate origins. It allstarted with a few Jews. Samuel Goldwyn (né Goldfish), a Polish immigrant, who founded Goldwyn Pictures in 1916, produced a raft ofsilent films,standing out from the crowd of upstartstudios with astriking production card featuring a real-life lion encircled in a crest. In 1924, Marcus Loew, who owned a chain of theaters, bought Goldwyn’s outfit. This was part of the old “vertical integration”system, wherein production companies also controlled distribution and owned the cinemasshowing the films. It was a bit of an antitrust issue,but one recently vanquished right as Netflix begansnapping up theaters. Loew acquired Goldwyn to diversify hisslate of pictures after buying Metro Pictures Corporation a few years before. So,so far we have the Metro and the Goldwyn part of MGM Where does the last M come in? Louis B Mayer, who helpedstart Metro, butstruck out on his own with Louis B Mayer Pictures, came to Loew asking to be bought — in exchange,Mayerbuilt on hissuccess as producer alongside the wunderkind Irving J Thalberg. These men came to embody the Hollywood Golden Age with classics like “Gone with the Wind” and “The Wizard of Oz.” Their way of doing business — what Mayer termed, was recently brought to life in David Fincher’s“Mank.”We also have these two to thank for the Oscars, whichMayer began in order tospurn Hollywood unions. But fortunes rise and fall. Over the years the house that Mayer (and Goldwyn and Loew and Thalberg) built changed quite a bit tostay in the game. It paired with United Artists. It changed hands between businessman Kirk Kerkorian, Ted Turner, an Italian conglomerate. It even filed for bankruptcy in 2010. While thestudio is responsible forsome of the most iconic images in film, for many decades itsstory was one of fighting tosurvive andstay relevant.

Both he and his wife, who works at one of the world’s top biotech companies, are on the H-1B, a non-immigrant visa allowing foreigners to live and work in the US One of Amey’s previous employers applied for his green card in 2011. Almost a decade later, a green cardstill eludes him.“We’ve been waiting patiently for our green cardsince nine years now and it will likely take another 10-plus years till we get it,”says Amey, who like the other Indians in America whom wespoke to for thisstory asked that we publish only their first names to avoid drawing attention from US immigrationservices. Over the last decade, Amey has worked atseveral technologystartups. “I helped them launch award-winning products, hire teams, and raise millions of dollars in venture funding,” hesays. A few years ago, he and his wife opened a mom-and-popstore insuburban Philadelphia where they hired around 15 local workers. Today, they live in Los Angeles with their two-year-oldson and a five-year-old Goldendoodle. For millions of Indians who went to the US on the H-1B visa in the early 2000s, a green card was a tangible nextstep tosecurity and freedom. The chances of getting one now, however, look grim. Indians ranging from those working on the front lines in America’s fight against Covid-19at hospitals to those employed at tech behemoths likeNetflixandGoogleare among those on the interminable line for green cards. Immigration Voice, a US nonprofit, has beensharing theirstories onsocial media to help drum upsupport for a group it refers to as “legal high-skilled future Americans.”Of the total 1 million green cards given out every year, just 140,000 are for employment-based applicants. The majority of the rest goes to family-based applicants. And because of the annual 7% country cap on green card allocations in the employment route, Indians face unprecedented backlogs.“The bottom line is that the H-1Bsystem is old and has many flaws, but has become the main vehicle for great foreign-born talent to enter the US either directly or after being employed asstudents” on OPT visas,says Ran Harnevo, the CEO of Homeis, an online network for ex pats and foreign-born nationals around the world. “There aresuper-talented employees that totally rely on this visa forseveral years with (a) veryslim opportunity to evolve to a better visa or a permanent residency.”By thestart of 2030, the green card backlog will exceed 2.4 million petitions, virtually ending all legal employment immigration from India and China, the countries with the most employment-based green card petitions, the Cato Institute’s immigration policy analyst David Bierwrote in a March 2020 brief. Getting the H-1B visa—a pre-requisite before an employer cansponsor an employee—is a herculean task in itself. Dhaval, 34, immigrated to the US from India in 2008 to pursue a PhD in computerscience. He thought life would be much easier once he completed his doctorate but his name was not drawn in the H-1B lottery for four years. His optional practical training (OPT) period ran out and he had to enroll in a masters program that offered CPT (curricular practical training) to continue working.“In these five years of constantstruggle with getting the immigration work visa, even after having the highest possible level of education, I lost valuable time instarting the green card process,” hesaid. In an upsetting twist of fate, he finally got the visa—but then his company decided tostopsponsoring green cards due to constant immigration rule changes carried out by the Trump administration. H-1B visa-holders typically hesitate to change or quit jobs,since losing H-1Bstatus could get them kicked out of the country. Even if Dhavalswitches jobs and gets a newsponsor within the year, the wait for a green card could be longer than 80 years. US president Donald Trump’s hard line anti-immigrantstance has made a historically onerous process all the more challenging. Under his administration, application denials and requests for evidence both have gone up. During a recent vacation, Amey’s visa drew extrascrutiny for reasons not known to him. Hespent close to 40 days working remotely from another country until his visa was approved. Dallas resident Anuja, a post-doctoral research fellow in biochemistry, has facedsimilar issues. “Being on a visa has many problems, especially in my field, which comes under the technology alert list,”shesays. “When I travelled to renew mystudent visa towards the end of [my] PhD in 2013, I had tospend five weeks in India to receive clearance to travel back to the USA.”Dhaval, Amey, and Anuja all give thesame reason for wanting a green card: freedom. The freedom to change jobs and fields, to travel, tostart companies, to buy properties and put down roots, and more. Inspite of waiting it out for years,several green card aspirants have gotten fed up.“President Trump’s visa restrictions are a ‘kiss of death’ for American innovation, andsignal to the most vulnerable communities that their immensesocial contributionssimply don’t matter anymore,”said Homeis’ Harnevo. “He hasshattered their American dream, and now they have nowhere to turn.”Canada, for one, makes immigration much easier than the US, and Indian-born workers in the US are taking note. Dhaval opted for Canada’smerit-based immigrationsystem in 2019 and got permanent residencystatus within a year. He plans to make the move in the coming months. According to the Cato Institute, the number of Indians applying for permanent residency in Canada has doubledsince 2016. Amey, too,started looking into migrating to Canadian around a year ago, citing “uncertainty, the political rhetoric, and the constant anxiety related to the American legal immigration process.” The family is in the finalstages of getting permanent residency in Canada. But not everyone has an easy way out. Anuja, who hails from Mumbai, isstill holding out hope for permanent residency in the US because “the kind of research I am involved in doesn’t happen in India,”shesays. She is trying to get her green card via the EB1 route, nicknamed theEinstein visasince it’s reserved for people who are highly acclaimed in their fields. But the fear of things not working out is palpable.“If we were to lose our jobs today,”shesays, “it would mean a flight back to India despite havingspent our young years being as productive as possible in researching and mentoring, paying taxes, and being law-abiding citizens…not to mention visa issues in India due to havingUS-citizen kids if you decide to go back.”Our free, fast, and fun briefing on the global economy, delivered every weekday morning.",2,2,Quartz
576,Democrats Push Further Into GOP Territory With Fundraising Surge,-8.67,45.0,https://about.bgov.com/news/democrats-push-further-into-gop-territory-with-fundraising-surge/,https://adfontesmedia.com/bloomberg-government-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-16,17,"Democrats across the competitive House landscape turned in yet anotherstrong fundraising quarter, bolstering the party’s bid to expand its hold on the chamber. In 44 of the 58 districts the Cook Political Report rates as competitive, Democratic nominees raised more than their Republican opponents from July through September, according to a Bloomberg Government analysis of Federal Election Commission reports filed by Thursday’s deadline. That includes historically GOP-leaning districts insouths ide Virginia,southern Minnesota, Long Island, NY, and Alaska, along with thesuburbs of Phoenix, Indianapolis, Houston, Dallas, and Atlanta. Rather than hunker down to protect the most vulnerableseats picked up in the 2018 wave, Democrats areseeking to parlay their fundraising advantage and Joe Biden’s lead in the presidential election into a larger and more durable majority.“Right after the November elections in 2018, the word was that Chairwoman Bustos had the toughest job in town,”said Michael Fraioli, a longtime Democratic fundraiser, referring toCheri Bustos(Ill.), head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. “That’s all turned around now. Not only are we not going to loseseats as Democrats, but we’re going to pick upsome and the question is how many and where.”Of the 58 districts rated competitively, 30 are held by Republicans, 27 by Democrats, and one by a Libertarian. Republicans need a net gain of 17seats for a majority. The Cook Political Reportsays a Democratic gain of up to 10seats is the most likely outcome. Most Republican incumbents in competitive,suburban districts were outraised by their Democratic challengers. Democrats made major gains insuburban districts in 2018, thanks to a combination of voters’ frustration with President Donald Trump and, relatedly, college-educated voters moving away from the Republican Party. It paved the way to a 40-seat net gain.“Were fighting very hard,”said Sarah Chamberlain, president of Republican Main Street Partnership, whichsupportsseveralsuburban Republicans. “We’re hoping to notsee a wave in thesuburbs, but the more people I talk to — it’s close.”Unlikely opportunities for Democrats to make gains include Virginia’s 5th District, a conservative-leaning area that runs from the North Carolina border to exurbs of Washington, DC Cameron Webb (D), a doctor and first-time candidate, raised more than $2.7 million in the quarter compared with $723,000 for Bob Good (R), who ousted Rep. Denver Riggleman(R) at a district convention in June. In Arizona’s 6th District, a well-educated and Republican-friendly area enveloping parts of Phoenix and Scottsdale, physician Hiral Tipirneni (D) raised more than three times what Rep. David Schweikert(R) brought in and ended September with nearly triple what the incumbent had in cash on hand. Schweikert has been hobbled by ethics violations, and the House voted in July to reprimand him. Republicans and Democrats attributed Democrats’strong fundraising to the party’s online tool, ActBlue, which directssmall, online donations to candidates that need it the most. The GOP’s online fundraisingsystem, WinRed, hasn’t been around nearly as long and isn’t as established among donors.“One of the fundraising advantages Democrats have — and it’s one of the few we have — is we’ve really lapped the Republicans on candidate online fundraising,”said John Rowley, a Democratic consultant. “It’s an area where Republicans haven’t caught up.”“It all goes back to ActBlue,” Chamberlainsaid. Rob Simms, a former executive director at the National Republican Congressional Committee, cautioned that while the numbers are impressive, it’s not necessarily ashow of electoralstrength.“One thing that often gets lost looking at these numbers is the overwhelming majority of Democrats’ money is coming from outside the district and outside of thestate,” Simmssaid. “You have this energy on the Democraticside fueling the fundraising, but a lot of it is coming from New York, LA, and San Francisco.”There weresome brightspots in third-quarter fundraising for Republicans, who are targeting the more than two dozen Democratic-held districts Trump carried in 2016. Iowastate Rep. Ashley Hinson (R) reported more in third-quarter receipts and cash on hand than freshman Rep. Abby Finkenauer(D) in a district Trump narrowly won. Iowa’s 1st District, which includes Cedar Rapids and Dubuque, is one of only 11 Democratic districts rated as a Toss-up. South Carolinastate Rep. Nancy Mace (R) topped freshman Rep. Joe Cunningham(D) in both categories in a coastal district Trump won decisively, though the Cook Political Reportstill gives Cunningham the advantage. The jaw-dropping amounts from Democrats inswing districts has allowed the DCCC — the party’s House campaign arm, which itself announced topping $70 million in third-quarter receipts — to invest in offensive opportunities, including nine districts where Trump won by 10 or more points. That includessuburban areas where Democrats made large gains in 2018 and hope to continue to expand in 2020. The DCCC’s independent expenditure arm, which controls where itspends tens of millions of dollars on advertising, booked $648,000 in New York’s 1st District in recent weeks to aid college professor Nancy Goroff’s (D) challenge to Rep. Lee Zeldin(R) on Long Island. It also booked $330,000 in ads in Arkansas’ 2nd District, based in Little Rock, wherestate Sen. Joyce Elliott (D) is taking on Rep. French Hill(R). The Cook Political report currently gives Republicans the edge in both. Democrats also reserved airtime inseveral other Republican districts,such as Alaska, where Rep. Don Young— the House dean — has held thestate-wideseatsince 1973. Rowleysaid these buys illustrate not only the party’s fundraising advantage and the political environment, but also how well-positioned many of most vulnerable Democratic freshmen are.“It’s freed them up to play real offense,” Rowleysaid. “If they weren’t withinstriking distance, they wouldn’t be in those races. It’s not the culture of the Democrats to casually play in Alaska and Arkansas.”To contact the reporters on thisstory:Emily Wilkinsin Washington atewilkins@bgov.com;Greg Girouxin Washington atggiroux@bgov.comTo contact the editors responsible for thisstory:Kyle Trygstadatktrygstad@bgov.com;Bennett Rothatbroth@bgov.com",2,2,Bloomberg Government

578,How well does the media cover the climate movement?,-10.33,40.33,https://www.cjr.org/covering_climate_now/climate-activists-fridays-for-future.php,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-17,18,"thousands of young activists around the world will march andstrike for climate action as part of Fridays for Future, a movement launched by Greta Thunberg and other organizers. Events are planned on five continents. The theme: #NoMoreEmptyPromises. “Those in power continue to only deliver vague and empty promises for far off dates that are much too late,” reads astatement by Fridays For Future. “What we need are not meaningless goals for 2050 or net-zero targets full of loopholes, but concrete and immediate action in-line withscience.”Forsome journalists, covering activism presents an uncomfortable dilemma. Too much coverage might come across as cheerleading or make journalists look like they are activists themselves, contradicting institutional notions of neutrality. A reporter’s job is to cover the news, the argument goes, not boost oneside or the other. Fair enough. Butactivists are newsmakers—just like the politicians,scientists, and corporate officials we cover all the time. Youth-dominated groups have upended global climate politics over the last two years and injected a much-needed emphasis on environmental justice into the public conversation. Whether byscolding jet-setting elites at Davos for their obliviousness, as Thunberg did, or occupying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s Capitol office, as Sunrise Movement activists did to demand that Democrats walk their talk on climate change, youth activists have forced the climate issue onto government and, yes, media agendas around the world. During the 2020 US election campaign, youth activists’ grassroots pressure pushed then-candidate Joe Biden to dramaticallystrengthen his climate proposals even as it helped raise climate change to a top-tier campaign issue. For the general election in November, Sunrise and other youth-led groups mobilized large numbers of new voters, including in Georgia and otherswingstates, that helped elect Biden president and gain Democrats a razor-thin majority in the US Senate. Now, with Biden in the White House, activists are continuing to push him to make good on his promise to treat climate change as the “existential crisis” he rightlysays it is. Inshort, climate activists are a potent political force. Covering them is no act of favoritism, butsimply a matter of accurately telling the climatestory. Indeed, one could argue that activists, as a whole, have been ahead of journalists on thisstory. Media coverage of the climate crisis has long lagged behind warnings fromscientists and other experts—especially in the US, where coverage wassporadic at best, and often descended into ascientifically indefensible bothsides ism that portrayed corporate flaks and realscientists as equally credible. Improved news coverage overlaps with the emergence of the youth climate movement: According toa 2020 analysis by the watchdog outfit Media Matters for America, the outpouring of climate activism in 2019—especially a global youthstrike in September of that year, led by Thunberg and involvingsome 6 million people—was largely what finallyshocked the media out of their collective climatesilence. In other words, despite a wealth of evidence establishing climate change as astory of massive, global importance, many news organizationsstill needed to bel e dout of the darkness. With a climate realist now in the White House, a new era of possibility in the climatestory has arrived. It’s more important than ever for journalists to cover activist groups and their activities accurately and fairly,showing them no more fear or favor than weshow any other type of newsmaker. That task begins with doing a better job of portraying who the climate movement actually is. Even after news organizations finally recognized that young climate activists were making news, too manystories fixated on the celebrity of Thunberg and asmall handful of others while givingshortshrift to thesubstance of their message. “Instead of focusing on the climate and listening to thescientific message, people are instead listening to and talking about me,” Thunberg remarked in September 2020. Such coverage gives the impression that Thunberg was the only young activist worth hearing, a grievous misrepresentation. “Dear media, Isee you are writing about the international climate crisis lawsuit @GretaThunberg and I launched today with 15 other child plaintiffs,” Alexandria Villaseñor, a prominent activist from New York,wrote on Twitter in 2019. “The other plaintiffs have names, experiences andstories. Makesure you write about them, too.”Some outlets have done well on that front, featuring a range of activists in theirstories and even profiling them or publishing their op-eds. For example, both CNN and PBS NewsHour recently ran extensivestories about the Indigenous activists in Minnesota fighting the Line 3 tarsands pipeline overseen by Enbridge, a Canadian multinational company. PBS correspondent Ivette FelicianointerviewedWinona LaDuke of the Indigenous climate justice organization Honor the Earth, whosaid the greenhouse gas emissions of the Line 3 pipeline are “the equivalent to 50 new coal-fired power plants. So, you know, if you’re trying tosave the planet, this is not the way to do it.”Other times, outlets havestruggled toshow the diversity and breadth of the climate movement. In an emblematic incident from January 2020, the Associated Press cut Vanessa Nakate, a 23-year-old climate activist in Uganda,out of a photo depicting four other influential young activists, including Thunberg, all of whom are white. (Reuters, at thesame time, misidentified Nakate as Zambian activist Natasha Mwansa.) At first, the APsaid the crop was a deadline decision made to improve the photo’s composition; the agency later apologized for the error. Nakate responded that the AP’s action was evidence of how Africans and others from poor countries are often excluded from the climate conversation. “Itshowed how we are valued,” Nakatesaid. The modern climate and environmental movements are diverse and enormous. Rather thanselect, elevate, and revisit a handful of celebrities, journalistsshouldseek out a range of voices, especially activists at the local level representing Indigenous groups or people of color whose communities are often disproportionately affected by climate change. Thatsaid, thoughtful reporting on climate activismshould not preclude journalists from asking probing questions about the activists’ platforms, tactics, and operations. For example, many young activists engage the climate crisis as an intersectional issue, in which individual and overlapping identities—including those of race, class, and gender—shape their platforms and their work, including dealings with older activist organizations and policymakers. Some of the best-funded climate-advocacy groups have long been far from diverse in theirstaffing and leadership, despite repeated promises to improve. News coverageshould engage the fullsubstance of activist groups’ agendas in an ongoing way, with attention to their complexities and efficacy—and not only when they’re marching in thestreets. As many activists wouldsay, ultimately the climatestory is not about them; it’s about whether humanity can defuse the climate emergency in time to preserve a livable planet. By tellingthatstory, journalists can get themselves, and their audiences, up tospeed on the defining challenge of our time.",1,1,Columbia Journalism Review

Prison officials noted that the man had other “complicating comorbidities” that likely contributed to his death, andsaid a medical examiner will determine his cause of death. The inmate tested positive Friday, as part of mass testing after an inmate in the Oquirrh 5 unit complained ofsymptomsandsubsequently was determined to have the virus.

Officialssaid Wednesday that medical officials will continue to “heavily monitor” this area as they react to the virusspreading within the facility. Prison officials did not release the name of the man who died, butsaid family members had been notified. The American Civil Liberties Union of Utah, whichsued prison officials in April over their coronavirus response, expressed frustration Wednesday,saying the prison and parole boardstill haven’t been doing enough to keep inmatessafe, or release those that are medically vulnerable.“This was preventable,”said Sara Wolovick, an ACLU Equal Justice Works fellow. “This is precisely why wesued back in April. This is what we were trying to prevent.”The ACLU’s lawsuit didn’t go far, however. The Utah Supreme Court dismissed the litigation,saying the group didn’t have proper legalstanding to bring it to court. Wolovick didn’t rule out the possibility that the ACLU willsue again,saying the prisonstill hasn’t taken the propersteps to respond appropriately to an outbreak that hasspread throughout both its facilities. Wolovicksaidshe didn’t know if the man who died hadsought an early release, butsaid there arestill elderly inmates and medically vulnerably people incarcerated whoshould be considered for release. Shesaid the ACLU tried to ask prison officials to releasesome inmates on medical furloughso they would not be housed in communal living facilities, but the Department of Corrections didn’t respond to that request. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases have exploded at the Utah State Prison over the past few weeks. There have now been 572 confirmed cases at the Draper facility, according to the prison, and 22 at the Gunnison facility. The initial outbreak at the prison began in October, and was believed to be tied toa medic who treatedseveral inmates who later tested positive. While that outbreak was contained to one area, the virus hasspread to almost every other housing unit — including Oquirrh 5, Promontory, Lone Peak and in at least three blocks of the Wasatch facility.

The report was compiled by a team of personnel from outside the Department of the Army who were tasked with examining the command climate and culture at Fort Hood and itssurrounding community in central Texas.“My preliminary review of the report, recent cases and recent media coverage, have hardened my belief that the Army’s SHARP program hasn’t achieved its mandate to eliminatesexual assaults andsexual harassment by creating a climate that respects the dignity of every member of the Army family,” McCarthysaid in a videostatement Wednesday afternoon. Army leadership intends to also release an action plan to address the review’s recommendations when it’s released next month. The Army’sSexual Harassment/Assault Response and Preventionprogram, or SHARP, has been underscrutiny in recent months following the death of Spc. Vanessa Guillen, a Fort Hoodsoldier who prosecutorssay was murdered in an armory on post by a fellow 3rd Cavalry Regiment trooper. Guillen’s familysaidshe had beensexually harassed by a fellowsoldier prior to her death, butshe didn’t report the incident for fear of retribution. Following those allegations, Army Forces Commandsent asmall team in June tospecifically look at theSHARP program on Fort Hood. FORSCOM’s review found that the post’s SHARP program overall meets Armystandards. But the team also found that 18 out of the 52 womensurveyed on post, about one-third, reported beingsexually harassed. That number concerned lawmakers and prompted questions about whether thestandards ofsuccess for SHARP programs need to be changed. TheGovernment Accountability Officeannounced in late August that it would review the Army’s SHARP program, as well, following complaints from members of Congress whosought more answers. Natalie Khawam, an attorney representing the Guillen family,said McCarthy’s comments “corroborated what I have been emphasizing.”Khawam drafted a piece of legislation called the Vanessa Guillen Act, which would create an independentsystem to investigate bothsexual harassment andsexual assault incidents. It would also provide independent charging decisions for courts-martial.“Victims like Vanessa Guillen, whosuffered fromsexual harassment and assault whileserving our country, were failed by thesystem,” Khawam told Army Times. “In September Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi has promised toschedule our bill for a vote. We have patiently been waiting for her to tell us the date.”In his comments on video Wednesday, McCarthysaid that it is “abundantly clear” that Army leaders must do more with regards tosexual harassment and assault investigations.“I am deeplysaddened and concerned by the recent news reports of howsexual assault andsexual harassment have plagued our force and brought harm to oursoldiers,” McCarthysaid in the videostatement Wednesday. “Leaders, regardless of rank, are accountable for what happens in their units and must have the courage tospeak up and intervene when they recognize actions that bring harm to oursoldiers and to the integrity of our institution.”McCarthy did not elaborate on which media reports he was referring tospecifically, but Guillen’s case hassparked hundreds ofsurvivors to come forward toshares tories ofsexual trauma in the military. Some of thosestories were chronicled this week by CBS Evening News, which interviewed nearly two dozen victims andseveral whistle-blowers who worked for the SHARP programs as part of aseries aired Tuesday. The problems at Fort Hood, however, go beyond issues related tosexual assault and harassment. The post has been plagued this year with a number of violent deaths thatset it apart from other installations. Severalof the deaths that involve foul play involve violence againstsoldiersstationed there by civilians in the local community.“The numbers are high here,” McCarthysaid during a visit to Fort Hood in early August. “They are the highest, in most cases, forsexual assault and harassment and murders for our entire formation — the US Army.”Kyle Rempfer was an editor and reporter who has covered combat operations, criminal cases, foreign military assistance and training accidents.

The Tennessee Department of Education will launch a new dashboard on Tuesday that will include the total number of active cases amongstudents andstaff broken down byschool across thestate. The department will update the dashboard every Monday with the previous week is number of new cases and will include classroom orschool closures and whetherstudents are learning in-person, remotely or a hybrid of both for each district.“Parents and community members are working to make informed decisions, and we have determined the best path that balances informed decision making with our obligation tostudent privacy,” Education Commissioner Penny Schwinnsaid in astatement. “We believe this resource will not only help parents but will inform how COVID-19 is affectingstudent attendance, chronic absenteeism and overallstudent attainment.""Tennessee refuses to release information about COVID-19 cases inschoolsLee, Schwinn andstate Health Commissioner Dr. Lisa Pierceyhave all been criticized for not publicly reporting information on COVID-19 cases inschools. All have previously cited federal privacy law restrictions, like HIPAA and FERPA, for preventing the release of the information.""The real challenge is to provide as much information as possible to provide for transparency and to give information that is important to the public but continue to provide and adhere to privacy restrictions that FERPA and HIPAA require,"" Leesaid previously. ""And that is a balance.""Lee acknowledged Thursday there is wide desire among parents for data that will help them make informed decisions about whether tosend their children toschool or not. Developing a dashboard to meet these needs appropriately was a process, Leesaid during a news briefing.""We believe (the dashboard) will help parents make choices, but it will not compromise our commitment to parents and tostudents and to teachers,"" Leesaid. ""It is uncharted territory. Moststates arestill grappling with this, but we think we have developed a tool that will be helpful in determining not only how many cases are in aschool but also how it affects attendance, chronic absenteeism and even academic outcomes among ourstudents.""Nearly200 COVID-19 cases linked toschools have been reported across thestatesince the firstschool districts in Tennessee reopened in late July, many prompting quarantines ofstudents andstaff and even temporaryschool closures.

The commissioner has been under fire in recent weeks from a group of lawmakers andsomeschool district leaders over the education department is handling of the pandemic. From what information to report about confirmed cases to whatsafety guidance to follow in classrooms,someschool leaderssay the department has not given clear, consistent guidance.

Helater announced that thestate would work on a plan for reportingsuch data. Just a week later, Lee reversed course again andsaid thestate would not release the data. After that, Leesaid thestate was contacting federal officials about what it could release. Deborah Fisher, executive director of the Tennessee Coalition for Open Government, has consistently argued the public has the right to know what is happening inschools. She acknowledged that districts might be worried that if they releaseschool data, people will use it to try to identify infected people.""It all comes down to, 'Are wesomehow identifying that Joe Smith in third grade has COVID-19?""

583,White House orders eviction ban through end of year,0.0,53.5,https://www.rollcall.com/2020/09/01/eviction-ban-white-house-coronavirus/,https://adfontesmedia.com/roll-call-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-01,23,"The White House announced on Tuesday a blanket eviction ban through the end of the year covering nearly all residential renters, asserting the authority to doso through public health authorities provided to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to prevent furtherspread of the coronavirus. Renters who can’t pay their lease due to COVID-19 will be able to go onto the CDC website to fill out a formseeking eviction protection. According tosenior administration officials on a background press briefing, that CDC-granted order would bar residential landlords from pursuing eviction against tenants for failing to pay the rent because of the pandemic.“Today’s announcement from [the Trump] administration means that peoplestruggling to pay rent due to the coronavirus will not have to worry about being evicted and risk furtherspread of, or exposure to, the disease due to economic hardship,” Deputy White House Press Secretary Brian Morgenstern told reporters. “The administration has also made federal funds available to alleviate any economic impacts to tenants, landlords and property owners.”No additional funds were made available on Tuesday, and thesenior White House officials later clarified that this referred to funds given tostates and localities in March as part of the $2 trillion economic relief package and earlier appropriations. Landlords, who have joined renter-advocate groups in calling for an additional $100 billion in direct aid, may face an up tick in unpaid rents, which could disrupt the mortgage bond market. On Twitter, Diane Yentel, president of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, called the eviction moratorium “long overdue and badly needed,”saying it would “provide relief from the growing threat of eviction for millions of anxious families.” Butshe added that the evictionsuspension, without additional financialsupport, was only delaying the inevitable, calling it “a half-measure that extends a financial cliff for renters to fall off when the moratorium expires and back rent is owed.”The CDC eviction ban would go farther than the expiredsuspension enacted by Congress in March, which covered the 30 percent of renters who live in apartments with federally backed mortgages. Thatstatutory moratorium ended in July. The Aspen Institute estimated in August that between 30 million and 40 million Americans, out of 110 million renters, could face eviction in the nextseveral months absent additional government assistance. To qualify for the eviction protection order, a tenant must have been qualified to receive astimulus check this year. That tenant would need to certify that they were unable to pay the rent due to coronavirus-related economic hardships, had made best efforts toseek rental assistance, and that an eviction would leave them homeless or forced into crowded housing. As with earlier eviction moratoria, the CDC protection would cover just evictions for failure to pay the rent. Landlords wouldstill be allowed to evict tenants for other lease violations. Trump announced an executive order on August 8 directing the Treasury and Housing and Urban Development departments to come up with a response within existing legal authorities and appropriated funds. That move came after Democratic leaders appeared to deadlock with White House negotiators on talks for another economic rescue bill. Last week, the Federal Housing Administration and Federal Housing Finance Agency extended their foreclosure moratoria on federally backed home mortgages, which had beenset to expire at the end of August, until December 31. Those orders protect fewer renters from eviction because they only cover properties that the FHA, or government-sponsored mortgage giants Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, currently own due to a pre-moratorium foreclosure. Federal extended unemployment insurance benefits expired at the end of July. Even without that extra $600 a week, 27 million Americans continued to file for unemployment insurance into thesecond week of August. Another Trump executive order allowedstates to tap into Federal Emergency Management Agency relief funds to pay out an additional $300 per week in unemployment insurance. So far, 41states have been approved to offer the funds, but just a handful have begun to doso. The FEMA funds are astopgap. The extra benefits will run out as the $44 billion available runs dry. A Morning Consultsurveyreleased Tuesdayshowed how the unemployed werestruggling with the reduced benefits: 50 percent of thosesurveyed in late Augustsaid they could not cover basic expenses with unemployment insurance, compared to 27 percent in late July. On the press call, thesenior White House officialssaid that the eviction ban’s legal authoritystemmed from the broad powers given to the CDC by Congress to fight pandemics by issuing public health orders. The earlier moratorium authorized by Congress was limited to properties with federally backed mortgages, giving the federal government additional authority to regulate them. The White House’s unilateral eviction order would cover millions of purely private contracts, inviting a potential legal challenge from affected landlords. The CDC order contends that housingstability helps prevent thespread of COVID-19.“Eviction moratoria facilitateself-isolation by people who become ill or who are at risk forsevere illness from COVID-19 due to an underlying medical condition,” it reads. “They also allow State and local authorities to more easily implementstay-at-home andsocial distancing directives to mitigate the communityspread of COVID-19.”",2,2,Roll Call
584,Republicans are privately expressing a ‘growing sense of doom’ as polls look grim: report,-10.33,33.0,https://www.alternet.org/2020/08/republicans-are-privately-expressing-a-growing-sense-of-doom-as-polls-look-grim-report/,https://adfontesmedia.com/alternet-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-06,25,"In a worst-casescenario for Republicans — and a best-casescenario for Democrats — the GOP would not only lose the White House in November, but also, would lose the US Senate and watch Democrats expand their majority in the US House of Representatives. Journalists Olivia Beavers and Juliegrace Brufke, in an article for The Hill, discuss the possibility of a major blue wave in November and the fears that Republican activists are expressing behind closed doors. Some Republicans are privately expressing what Beavers and Brufke describe as a “growingsense of doom.” A GOPsource, presumably interviewed on condition of anonymity, told The Hill, “If the election were today, we would lose the House, the Senate and the White House.”Republicans already lost the US House of Representatives in 2018, when Democrats achieved a House majority. Thatsource probably meant tosay that Democrats would keep their House majority if the election were held today, and Beavers and Brufke note that in order to retake the House in November, Republicans would need a “net 17seats.”A House Republican, quoted anonymously, told The Hill, “This is the problem: (Trump) continues to allow it to be a referendum on himself. You can’t do that in a competitive race.”Another Republican in the House told The Hill that the GOP’s 2016 playbook isn’t going to work in 2020, when the US is facing the coronavirus pandemic. According to that lawmaker, “People are looking for reassurance.... Chaos worked great in 2016, (but) they don’t want it in 2020. They want to know that we’re trustingscience and doctors on the questions here, and they want to know we’re going to get through it. There needs to be more FDR fireside chats and less Jerry Springer knockdowns.”Some polling released byQuinnipiac Universitythis weekshows whysome of the Republicans thatspoke to The Hill areso pessimistic. According to Quinnipiac, Democrats are highly competitive insome high-profile Senate races. In deep red South Carolina, Quinnipiac found that incumbent Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham — who has been a fixture in the Senatesince the early 2000s — is tied with Democratic challenger Jaime Harrison at 44%. And in Maine, Quinnipiac found that Sen. Susan Collins, a Republican, is trailing Democratic challenger Sara Gideon by 4%. Collins, in the past, was reelected by double digits; now, according to Quinnipiac,she is in danger of being voted out of office. Quinnipiac found that in Kentucky, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is leading Democrat Amy McGrath by 5%. That poll was much better news for McGrath than aMorning Consult poll released earlier this week; Morning Consult found McConnell ahead of McGrath by 17%. But in South Carolina, Morning Consult found Graham leading Harrison byon ly 1%. Of course, poll numbers can change. In 1988’s presidential election, there weresummer polls thatshowed Democrat Mike Dukakis defeating then-Vice President George HW Bush — whose poll numbers improved considerably in the fall. And Bush 41 enjoyed a decisive victory over Dukakis that year. But the US was not facing a deadly pandemic in 1988. Interviewed by The Hill, Rep. Liz Cheney expressed confidence that Trump will defeat Biden in November. But what Republicanssay publicly and what theysay behind closed doors can vary considerably. And another Republicansource, quoted anonymously, told The Hill that Trump isn’t going to win over conservative women by expressing “meanness” or attacking a member of his coronavirus task force like Dr. Deborah Birx.“Conservative women want tosee empathy and compassion and don’t like meanness,” that GOPsource argued. “We are doing really poorly with married, white women. I do not at all understand the Deborah Birx attack at all — not politically and not morally.”",1,0,AlterNet
585,Biden Pledged to Close For-Profit ICE Detention Centers. Will He Follow Through?,-16.67,38.67,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2021/01/biden-pledged-to-close-for-profit-ice-detention-centers-will-he-follow-through/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-27,25,"A GEO Group guard at a Tacoma, Washington, immigration detention center in 2019. Ted S Warren/APIn 2019, Wilfred requested protection from political persecution at a California border crossing because hesaw the USs as a beacon of hope. Instead, Wilfred, an African asylumseeker who asked to be identified by a pseudonym to protect associates in his home country from retaliation, wound up at a Mississippi immigration detention center with practices that he compared to theslave trade. Prison officials told detainees to walk with their hands behind their back, avoid eye contact with their jailers, andspeak only whenspoken to. After Mississippi, Immigration and Customs Enforcementsent Wilfred to Louisiana, where he used his training as a lawyer to help fellow detainees fight their cases. In what hesays was retaliation for his lawyering, ICE moved him to the Allen Parish jail, another Louisiana detention center that he called “hell itself.” Upon arriving, he recalled an assistant warden, who was white, telling him, “I hear you’re the trouble maker. If you try to create trouble for me here, I’llshoot you.”Wilfred’s experience—the indefinite detention, the trauma it caused, and the money prison companies made in the process—encapsulates the detentionsystem President Joe Biden has taken over. The Trump administration took the already large detention network operated by ICE and pushed it to recordsize by opening more than 40new detention centers. But during the pandemic, detention levels fell to the lowest in decades, largely due to a Trump administration policy ofsummarily expelling people at the border. It means thatBiden has taken office with roughly 15,000 people in detention, down from an all-time high of more than 55,000 in thesummer of 2019 and about41,000in November 2016. On Tuesday, Biden issued an executive order that directed the Justice Department to phase out its use of private prisons, but the order does not apply to ICE The Biden administration is considering issuing asimilar order to cover immigration detention, but has no immediate plans to doso andsome immigrant advocates doubt it ever will,reported. Silky Shah, the executive director of Detention Watch Network,said in astatement that her organization was encouraged by Tuesday’s executive order. But, Shah added, the “Biden administration must now address the private prison industry’s toxic relationship with the Department of Homeland Security,” which oversees ICE To understand the potentialsignificance of Biden’s campaign pledge, it helps to understand the categories that comprise the civil detention network for immigrants: ICE-owned detention centers operated by for-profit companies, local jails run by prison companies, detention centers owned and operated by prison companies, and locally run jails that have government contracts. Unlike the Justice Department’s Bureau of Prisons, ICE has no detention centers that it owns and operates. Margo Schlanger, a law professor at the University of Michigan who led the Department of Homeland Security’s civil rights and civil liberties division during the Obama administration, hopes that Biden will count all detention centers operated by prison companies as for-profit, regardless of whether they’re owned by ICE or local jurisdictions. That would commit his administration to eliminating most of ICE’s detention capacity. As of January 2020, Eunice Cho, aseniorstaff attorney at the ACLU’s National Prison Project,says ICE was holding 81 percent of all detainees at facilities owned or operated by for-profit companies. (The White House did not respond to a request for comment about what it considers to be for-profit detention centers.)Should this policy be enacted, the result would be that essentially the only ICE detention centers that would remain would be local jails—whichtend to be as bad as or worse than the for-profit detention centers. (The Allen Parish jail that Wilfred called “hell itself” is one of them.) Like private prisons, they’re cash cows. But instead of funneling money toshareholders, they prop up cash-strapped towns andsheriffs’ offices that ICE often pays around $60 per day per detainee. Schlanger knows the problems with local jails butsays the main priority right now is to reduce the number of immigrants in detention. Pressuring Biden tostop using for-profit detention centers makessense as astrategy because he’s already committed to it. Should for-profit detention be eliminated, the question could quickly become where to hold the people who remain detained. Other than abolishing detention altogether, which the Biden administration hasshown no intention of doing, the options would be to keep using local jails or come up with a new form of detention that isn’t for-profit. That could mean repurposing community colleges or halfway houses to hold immigrants, according to a former ICE official, whospoke on condition of anonymity. People at those facilities wouldn’t be free, but they wouldn’t be in jails built to hold a criminal population. Many immigrant advocates, who often favor eliminating ICE detention entirely, would oppose this kind ofshift. As Schlanger put it, “I don’t think the advocacy community is very interested right now in taking one hugesystem of detention andsubstituting anothersystem of detention.”Sarah Gardiner, the policy director at Freedom for Immigrants, framed Biden’s campaign promise to end for-profit detention as a “critical firststep” toward her group’s ultimate goal of detention abolition. Adding to the challenges for the Biden administration is that the number of immigrants in detention mostly plummeted in 2020 because the Trump administration largelysealed off the border during the pandemic. The order from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, ostensibly to combat the coronavirus, causes border crossers to besummarily removed from the country before they even have a chance to enter ICE custody or to request asylum. The Biden administration hassignaled that initially it will keep the CDC order in place to avoid asudden increase in the number of people arriving at the border, but will presumably end the draconian policy atsome point. Once it does, people willstart entering ICE custody instead of being immediately expelled, and the numbers of people in detention could quickly balloon unless the agency releases more people on bond or parole than they did under Trump. John Sandweg, who led ICE under Obama, disagrees with advocates who favor getting rid of immigration detention. But hesupports ICE taking a more risk-based and individualized approach under which only people deemed a threat to publicsafety or a flight risk remain detained. “I think we would find that ICE’s detention needs are probably in the 12,000 range,” hesays, “and nowhere near the 30 to 35,000 range.”The Biden administration doesn’t have to wait to take this approach. Cho points out that ICE can quickly review thestatus of everyone in custody with the presumption that peopleshould be released, thereby flipping the current approach under which the burden is on people in detention toshow that theyshould be released. Beyond that, Chosays ICE could eliminate use of the cash bonds that can be prohibitively expensive. Adopting those changes would help many of the people who remain detained today in facilities wheresocial distancing is impossible and COVID-19 outbreaks have been rampant. (As of Sunday, more than9,000people in ICE custody had tested positive for COVID-19 and 593 were being monitored for active infections.)There are alreadysomesigns the Biden administration is moving towards letting out more people. Itstarted a100-day pause onsome deportations, and David Pekoske, the acting Homeland Security Secretary, has directed ICE to provide a process for an individualized review for people who have deportation orders that are more than 90-days old. As part of that process, ICE will look at whether detainees can be released, or have their casesstayed, or reopened. But thestatus of that process was upended on Tuesday when a federal judge in Texas temporarily blocked the deportation pause. In May, Wilfredsued for his release, and in a rare move, a judge assigned him a federal public defender. In October, the judge granted his legal team’s request to depose asenior ICE official and the warden of the Allen Parish jail. Two weeks later, ICE released him after 14 months in detention. The case became moot, and the ICE official avoided having to testify under oath. Karim Golding, who came to the USs from Jamaica at 9 years old, has not had thesame good fortune as Wilfred. After being arrested as a 21-year-old forselling cocaine and two handguns, heserved 10 years in prison. When he was released in 2016, ICE took him into custody. He’s now at the Etowah County jail, anotoriousAlabama jail that ICE uses for the long-term detention of people like Golding who are willing to fight their deportation for years. On March 20, as news of the pandemicspread, Golding and another detainee protested to demand that people transferred to the jail be quarantined first. He put a noose fashioned out of bedsheets around his neck and tied the other end to thesecond-floor railing of his unit, theInterceptreported. The threat ofsuicide forced officials at the jail to talk with the detainees about doing more to protect them from COVID-19, but it ultimately wasn’t enough to prevent a coronavirus outbreak. In July, Goldingstarted feeling ill and tested positive for COVID-19. In what appeared to be retaliation for demanding better conditions before testing positive, GoldingtoldtheIntercepthespent nearly two month insolitary confinement. It wassummer in Alabama, and the cell hespent 23 hours a day in lacked air conditioning. After wespoke in December, another outbreak was reported at Etowah, this one affectingsix detainees as of Sunday. Like nearly everyone I’ve interviewed who has experienced both federal prison and ICE detention, Golding told me that the conditions in prison had been far better. Despite everything he’d been though, Goldingsaid he favored keepingsome immigration detention for people the government couldshow are dangerous. He thought that approach would leave ICE withsomething like two or three detention centers. To Wilfred, itseemed reasonable that people who come to the countryseeking asylum would be detained for a few months while they establish that they have asignificant chance of being persecuted in their home countries and the US government verifies their identity. The difference, however, is that during that time, he believes peopleshould be held in more humane conditions. He asked why people in civil detention, which issupposed to be non-punitive, are marched around in orange jumpsuits or taken to medical appointments inshackles. “That was my worst experience: the chains,” hesays, recalling beingshackled, “I felt like theslavery life was reliving itself in us.”Golding hoped that people on the outside would notstop fighting for detained immigrants once Trump was out of office. He compared Trump to 9/11, explaining that the former president had united normally disparate factions. “But we have a tendency of getting complacent after these tragedies, and he was that tragedy,” hesaid. “You don’t want to be like, ‘Biden is thesolution.’ We want to hold him accountable.”",1,1,Mother Jones

Last January, the man pleaded guilty at the Central Criminal Court to three counts of defilement of a child under the age of 17 years old on dates between March and June 2017. He had pleaded not guilty one count of oral rape, 12 counts of rape and three counts of defilement of thesame girl on dates between 2011 and 2017. He also denied a further count ofsexual exploitation of the girl in July 2017. The jury convicted him of all these charges in January. The victim was aged between 11 and almost 16 years old at the time of the offences. Mr Justice Michael Whitesaid the offences had been a “serious violation of a child” which involved a veryserious breach of trust as the man had been in a position of authority.

About 20 otherstates already have “permitless carry” (also known as “constitutional carry”) laws, including Vermont. Vermont is an outlier, having never regulated gun possession in its history. It’s legal to carry a concealed handgun in all 50states, though most require a license, training, and a completed background check. In Texas, for open or concealed carry, residents generally need to pass a written exam and ashooting proficiency test, complete four tosix hours of training, andsubmit their fingerprints. When Texas changes its gun laws, the USs takes notice. But “permitless carry” already has been adopted in 19 otherstates. What are the effectsso far?The new permit less carry law awaiting Texas Governor Greg Abbott’ssignature would nix that requirement, essentially making permits – and the training and paper trails that come with them – optional. Only those already barred from carrying a gun would be excluded. It’s one trend in a rapidly changing gun rights landscape. Nineteen of thestates with permit less carry adopted the laws in the past decade, due in great part to National Rifle Association lobbying efforts. (Tennessee Governor Bill Lee thanked the group in at weet aftersigning the bill into law.)“Part of it issimply exploiting the fact you havesome very conservativestate legislatures that are very receptive to this kind of thing,”says Robert Spitzer, a politicalscience professor at the State University of New York, Cortland, whostudies gun politics. But otherstates have been moving in the opposite direction. Liberalstates like New York and California have passed new gun control laws – often following high-profile massshootings – that include banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, and requiring background checks on all gunsales. President Joe Biden is alsosupporting various gun control measures. In thatsense, the growth of permit less carry is also “an ideological push in the opposite direction,”says Dr. Spitzer. Handgunlaw.usSupporters of permit less carry argue that it helps protect citizens’ Second Amendment rights and makes the publicsafer.“Every law-abiding Montananshould be able to defend themselves and their loved ones,”said Governor Greg Gianforte when hesigned Montana’s permit less carry bill into l awin February. But the laws have also conjured up visions of Wild West-era lawlessness, and provoked fears of increased crime and violence. When Oklahoma adopted its constitutional carry law in 2019, local news reported that not much happened afterward, “at least on its first weekend.”Law enforcement officials have publicly opposed permit less carry in manystates. The Missouri Fraternal Order of Police did, as didal l the countysheriffs in West Virginia. The public, including Republicans and gun owners, also often opposesscrapping permits. In Kansas and Missouri, local law enforcement, government officials, and certified gun trainers told researcherswith the Urban Institutein 2018 they mainly disapproved of permit less carry because training would no longer be required.“Law enforcement was concerned with accidentalshootings, or increased firearm thefts if guns are notsecured properly,”says Paige Thompson, a researcher at the Urban Institute.“It’s [also] very difficult for them to determine whethersomeone is ineligible to carry a firearm without a permit because there’s no [state] background check,”she adds, or “background checks for privatesales.“DMN/UT Tyler March 2020 poll, Everytown for Gun Safety February 2016 poll, Everytown for Gun Safety March 2019 poll, University of Iowa March-April 2021 pollSo who’s right? Does permit less carry increasesafety, or violence? Since the laws are only a few years old, researcherssay more time is needed tosee if they have a notable effect on publicsafety.“There hasn’t been much research on permit less carry,”says Andrew Morral, leader of the Gun Policy in Americastudy initiative at the Rand Corp.“Most of the research has been done looking at ‘shall issue’ concealed carry laws versus ‘may issue’ concealed carry laws,” he adds. In “shall issue”states, applicants generally get permits if they meet the requirements. In “may issue”states, meanwhile, law enforcement hassome discretion to deny permits to certain individuals. It’s here, where research has been building for decades, that experts are beginning to drawsome conclusions. John Donohue, a professor at Stanford Law School who has beenstudying gun policy for decades,says it took about 20 years “before I was able to draw astrong conclusion about the impacts of the laws.”His conclusions, outlined in a2019 paper, include the findings that more permissive gun carry laws are associated with rates of violent crime that are 13% to 15% higher 10 years after adoption. Other research has tied more permissive gun carry laws to increased firearms homicides. For permit less carry lawsspecifically, crimestatisticsshow littlesignificant change – at least that can be attributed to the laws themselves. Alaska Department of Public Safety, Arizona Department of Public Safety, US Census Bureau“It has been difficult tostudy [permitless carry law] effects given theshort timeline,”says Dr. Spitzer. And to the counterargument, he adds, “there is no evidence that civilian gun carrying has any beneficial effect onsuppressing,stopping, or reducing crime.”An analysis ofseveral thousand gun policystudies by the Rand Corp.last yea rfound that evidence that concealed carry laws increase homicides and other kinds of violent crime is limited at best, but mostly inconclusive.“The research is improving in this area,”says Dr. Morral. Unfortunately, he adds, “I don’t think the data is improving. Insome ways the data is moving backwards.”The FBI, for example,changed the program it uses to collect local crime data this year. The new program will allow for more detailed reporting, but reporting is voluntary. Dr. Morral and others have concerns that participation will drop off and there will be less data tostudy. For now, it’s hard to deliver a conclusive verdict on what effect permit less carry laws have on publicsafety, if they have an effect at all. Randsurveyed a range of experts – including academics, advocacy groups, and legislativestaff – on how adopting permit less carry nationwide could affect publicsafety, for example. Responses divergedsignificantly. RAND Gun Policy Outcome ExplorerIn its next term, the US Supreme Court will hear a case concerning a restrictive New York concealed carry law, its first big Second Amendment case in more than a decade. The court has to date ruled only that the Second Amendment protects having a handgun in the home forself-defense. This case couldsee that protection expanded to handgun possession outside the home. The gun rights landscape could thus be poised for even greater change. Whichever direction thestatistics and research take, politics will continue to play a powerful role.“Over a considerable period of time, [the evidence] was murky enough that the theoretical arguments against [permissive carry] laws were not powerful enough tostop them,”says Dr. Donohue.“Now the political dynamics areso powerful that even with the evidence becoming more clear, the political dynamics are dominating the best empirical evidence.”",2,2,Christian Science Monitor
589,College Enrollment Dip Hits Students of Color the Hardest,-2.0,47.33,https://www.edweek.org/teaching-learning/college-enrollment-dip-hits-students-of-color-the-hardest/2021/06,https://adfontesmedia.com/education-week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-03,25,"Corrected: An earlier version of thisstory incorrectly noted the drop in two-year college enrollment for new graduatingseniors in 2020; it was 12 percent, not 12 percentage points. During the 2020-21school year, 120,000 fewer new highschool graduates entered the nation’s colleges and universities than the year before, according to anew analysis by the College Board. The pandemic has particularlyset backstudents of color, andseems to haveset upsignificantly different education trends in two- and four-year colleges. Forstudents heading to four-year, public universities, the pandemic was more of a road bump than a road block—and forsome, it was even an opportunity. Public four-year collegessaw an enrollment decline of less than 3 percent in 2020 compared to 2019. Atsome moreselective four-year colleges, enrollment actually increased, because the institutionsstarted to accept morestudents with lower GPAs afterseeing more of the highest-performing highschool graduates opting tosit out this year. Likewise, the incomingstudents at four-year colleges became more likely tostay through their freshman year. But community colleges and other two-year institutions—whichseveralstates have promoted through tuition “promise” programs andsimilarscholarships—experienced a differentstory. Overall enrollment in thoseschools dropped 12 percent among new graduatingseniors in 2020 compared to the prior class. Moreover, the drop in enrollment for moststudents of color at two-year colleges wasseveral times worse than the decline forsuchstudents at four-year colleges. At two-year colleges, for example, Black, Hispanic, and Native Hawaiianstudents’ enrollment rates dropped by about 15 percent each, while at four-year colleges, the drop in enrollment was only 1.9 percent for Hispanicstudents and 2.6 percent for Native Hawaiianstudents. There was nostatisticallysignificant change in Blackstudent enrollment at four-year colleges in 2020, compared to the prior year.“We usuallysee college enrollment increase during recessions, particularly at community colleges, but not this time,”said Jessica Howell, vice president of research for the College Board and a co-author of the report. “When westart to look under the hood of that top-line result westart tostart tosee a new picture of disparate impact emerging.”That’s because community colleges disproportionatelyservesome of thesamestudents whose communities have also been hit hardest by the pandemic, Howellsaid. She noted that the two-year collegesector typically attracts “many of thesubgroups ofstudents who are historically under-resourced or vulnerable or underrepresented in higher ed., or disadvantaged more broadly in terms of educational opportunity—underrepresented minoritystudents, first-generationstudents,students who live insome of the most educationally disadvantaged neighborhoods and attendsome of the highest poverty highschools—and the impact of the pandemic on college enrollment rates is quite clearly mostsevere among thosestudents.”Moreover, the College Board found about 5 percent fewerstudents entering two-year colleges in 2020 returned after their first year, an opposite trend from what wasseen in four-year colleges. Researchers did find that college enrollment was lower in counties with high COVID-19 infection rates—generally those above 15.8 daily cases per 10,000 residents—but again, the effect wasstrongest for two-year colleges. College Board researchers analyzed data from more than 3 million graduating highschoolseniors from each of the 2018, 2019, and 2020 classes. They also accounted in the data for trends in enrollment at different kinds of colleges that had already begun before the pandemic. Other recentstudies havesuggestedstudents who graduated in communities hit hardest by the pandemic’s economic downturn also had more competition for financial aid. That could mean the disparities in college enrollment could worsen next year, asseparatestudies have found the Class of 2021 already falling behind even the prior year in applying for colleges and arranging financial aid.“It’s important to note that thestudents we’re talking about [in the class of 2020] really didn’t have too much disruption to their learning,” Howellsaid. “They didn’t have any disruption to their testing. They didn’t face widespread changes to admissions practices—all of which are things, of course, that affected the class of 2021 much more.”",2,1,Education Week
590,Pregnant health care workers could get Pfizer vaccine after FDA emergency authorization,-0.67,44.67,https://19thnews.org/2020/12/pregnant-health-care-workers-could-get-pfizer-vaccine-after-fda-panel-votes-for-emergency-authorization/,https://adfontesmedia.com/19th-news-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-10,25,"A top government panel voted in favor of granting an emergency use authorization for Pfizer’s coronavirus vaccine candidate for people 16 and older, including those who are pregnant — a majorstep toward administering the first round of COVID-19 immunizations in the USs, and a notable departure from how British regulators addressed the pregnancy question. The Vaccines and Related Biological Products Advisory Committee’s recommendation will now head to the Food and Drug Administration, which is expected to accept that advice. If the FDA grants emergency authorization,some Americans couldstart receiving vaccines within a matter of days, and the majority will likely be women. Emergency use authorizations (EUAs) are an interim way to make drugs available in crises, but they require lesssafety and efficacy data than does full government approval. At Thursday’s meeting, governmentscientists emphasized the need to track the health of people who receive the initial Pfizer vaccines, monitoring both their level of immunity and what kind of adverse reactions they have. Pfizer is planning toseek full government approval nextspring, aftersubmitting more vaccine data. The 19th thanks oursponsors. Become one. Still, the authorization has major implications. Last week, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised that the first doses of COVID-19 vaccines be given to health care workers — particularly those in direct contact with people who have contracted the coronavirus — and residents of nursing homes. State governments will be charged with distributing vaccines to eligible residents. But there won’t immediately be enough vaccines to cover everyone, even in those groups. Women will likely constitute the majority of immediate beneficiaries. About 20 million Americans work in health care, and 75 percent of those workers are women. More than two-thirds of the nation’s 1.3 million long-term nursing home residents are women. Notably, the FDA advisory committee did not explicitly prohibit giving the vaccine to pregnant people otherwise eligible for the vaccine. That leaves open the door for health care workers who are pregnant and breastfeeding during the initial vaccine distribution — an estimated 330,000 people — to get the two-shot regimen when theirstates and hospitals receive the vaccine. Pfizer’s large-scale vaccine trial excluded those who were pregnant or breastfeeding.“We have really no data tospeak to risksspecific to pregnant women or fetuses, but also no data that would warrant a contra-indication to use in pregnancy at this time,” Doran Fink, an FDA deputy director whospecializes in vaccines,said at the meeting. “In the interest of allowing women of child-bearing potential who would consider vaccination, who are in the population approved for use under an EUA – they would be free to make their own decision, in conjunction with their health care providers.”During the meeting, government officials acknowledged the particular challenge posed by vaccinating pregnant people, especially those who are more likely to be exposed to the virus through work.“The early indication is there may be a higher risk of preterm delivery for pregnant women infected with COVID-19 compared to women without COVID-19, but there’s ongoing efforts to assess those and other pregnancy-related risks,” Aron Hall, a CDCscientist, told the panel. On Thursday, Pfizersaid it expected to have data by mid-December about whether animal trials of the vaccine would have negative repercussions on the reproductivesystem —something known as “reproductive toxicity” — which is an important question for pregnant people taking the vaccine. And though Pfizer excluded pregnant people from enrolling in thestudy, 23 participants became pregnant during the trial, according to company data. Twelve received the vaccine, and 11 were in the placebo group. That information isn’t enough to draw larger-scale conclusions. The FDA has required that Pfizer track andsubmit regular data about how people respond if they get the vaccine while pregnant, including whether they develop any adverse events. The company also intends to launchstudies on pregnancy and the vaccine next year. Immediately, it’s likely thatstates and local health caresystems will have to decide how to distribute a limitedsupply of vaccines. They could determine on their own whether to treat pregnant health care workers as part of the immediate priority immunization group. Medical groups, including the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine and the American College for Obstetricians and Gynecologists, have argued that pregnant health care workersshould be given the option of taking the vaccine. The technology behind Pfizer’s vaccine, messenger RNA, isn’t known to causespecial problems for either pregnant people or their fetuses. (Messenger RNA is also the basis for the Zika vaccine.)In anop-ed published this week at Stat News, three medical ethicists argued that pregnant health care workersshould be given the option to take any early vaccine, factoring in their risk of on-the-job COVID exposure.“A restrictive policy would not only deny pregnant and lactating individuals the opportunity to work with thesame protection afforded their co-workers, but would furtherstrain available human health resources over the next few months, when pandemic cases — and the need for health care — are peaking,” the authors wrote.",2,2,19th News

That’s his re-election platform — nonsense. Among other points, Trump claimed that Democratic presidential nominee Joe Bidenshould drop out of the presidential race because of the unfounded corruption allegations against the Bidens that Trump’s cronies have been pushing. A report released by Senate Republicans just this week failed to confirm that the Biden family financial relationships in question had any impact whatsoever on US foreign policy, as Trump previously alleged.

Look at what’s going on! The newspapers don’t even want to write about it, except the New York Post has it on the front page, which is great — good old New York Post is great. Theyshould get the Pulitzer.’Trump is lying. Hunter Biden did not “steal millions of dollars,” and his father — Joe Biden — did not “know everything.” Hunter Biden had globe-spanning financial/ business entanglements, and these entanglements had no documented impact on the foreign policy of the US while Joe Biden was vice president.

Voters don’t generally write the names of the candidates they’re voting for on their ballots; they fill in bubbles or maybe boxes, although yes, discarded ballots were recently discovered that had been filled out tosupport Trump. Still, the fact that a ballot happened to be thrown in with trash (orsomething along those lines) does not, in any respect, mean that there wassome kind of fraud. Maybe the voters messed up their choices and wanted to request new ballots. If that happened — then voila, no fraud.

The US Environmental Protection Agency’s decision,announced Wednesday, applies to PacificCorp’s Hunter and Huntington power plants in Emery County. The revised emission-reduction plan credits the utility’s prior retirement of the nearby Carbon Power Plantand prior emission-reduction investments, concluding it does not need to make any new upgrades at the operating plants in order to comply with the Clean Air Act.“It’s frustrating to have the answer right in front of us and then have politics overshadow thescience,”said Kirstin Peterson, owner of Rim Tours in Moab. “The only thing that Utah’s new haze plan does is ensure that we’re going to continue having pollutedskies that mar Utah’s tremendous landscapes and harm the health of visitors, wildlife, resources and our outdoor recreation economy.”In authorizing the new plan, the EPA withdrew the previous plan approved by the Obama administration in 2016, which had called for expensiveselective catalytic reduction (SCR) equipment installed at the plants. Such upgrades would have cut nitrogen oxide emissions, a leading cause of haze, by 75% according to theNational Parks Conservation Association, or NPCA In 2017, however, a federal appeals court granted a request by the Trump administration to halt the plan.“We appreciate the efforts of EPA to act on Utah’s plan and the manystakeholders who participated in the development of the plan.” Bryce Bird, director of the Utah Division of Air Quality,said in astatement released Wednesday by the EPA. “Utah’s regional haze plan has protected visibility in our national parks,supported rural economies and reduced emissions of harmful air pollutants for the residents and visitors to thestate.”According to the EPA, Utah’s new plan will reduce missions by 1,879 tons per year relative to the 2016 plan. Conservationists, however, argued the replacement plan does nothing to clean the air.“Smart communities all across the West began moving away from fossil fuels and building new, thriving economies by diversifying and investing in clean energy, outdoor recreation, and long-term,sustainable job prospects even before COVID hit,”said Scott Williams, executive director ofHEAL Utah. “We cannot afford a rear-view mirror approach that puts a dying coal industry ahead of a vibrant outdoor recreation economy that Utah has built.”According to an analysis by NPCA, the Hunter and Huntington plants, which began operating in 1978 and 1974, respectively, are among the nation’s worst in terms of their haze pollution, which affects Utah’s “Mighty 5” national parks. The three-unit Hunter plant ranks Number 2 on the list of all pollutionsources in the nation, not just coal plants, while the Huntington plant ranks Number 18.“We need leaders with a bold vision, who cansee past the politics and industry pressure to come up with a real plan thatsteers us toward clean energy resources,”said Cory MacNulty, NPCA’ssouthwest associate director. “We will continue to fight until Utahns and our national parks have the clean air they need and deserve.”",2,2,Salt Lake Tribune

Joe knows these are central issues in this election. And for him, they’re rooted in faith.” Religion is a central fault line in American politics. Biden and Coons are articulating a version of liberal Christianity where faith is defined by private worship and actions to ameliorate the world. Thisstands in contrast to the conservative Christianity of Trump and Vice President Mike Pence. The Trump/Pence version of Christianity is a fusion of religion with reactionary nationalism, where faith is defined by protecting a traditional way of life against foes both domestic and foreign. This way of life can be defined insimpleshorthand as a nostalgic idealization of 1950s America, with the need to maintain rigid racial and gender hierarchies. This explains the importance Trump-supporting Christians give to issues like abortion, immigration (threatening because it changes the racial demography of America), and LGBT rights. In hisspeech at the RNC on Wednesday night, Mike Pencesaid, “Let’s run the race marked out for us. Let’s fix our eyes on Old Glory and allshe represents. Let’s fix our eyes on this land of heroes and let their courage inspire. And let’s fix our eyes on the author and perfecter of our faith and freedom and never forget that where thespirit of the Lord is, there is freedom—and that means freedom always wins.” As The Washington Post reports, Pence’s words were a reworking of two Bible verses (2 Corinthians 3:17 and Hebrews 12:1-2) but with “Old Glory” replacing “Jesus.” Pence is in effect defining American nationalism as holy, the literal equivalent of God. Some Christians find this equation of nation with divinity to be an affront to their faith. Greg Jao,senior assistant to the president of InterVarsity, a leading campus religious organization, tweeted, “Glad Penceseems to know Scripture; grieved & appalled he’d believesubstituting ‘Old Glory’ for ‘Jesus’ wasn’t blasphemous and equating the freedom Paul was referring to with civil liberties.” Because the faith Trump and Pence areselling is religious nationalism, Christian Republicans can easily reconcile themselves tosupporting Donald Trump despite the fact that he is clearly a biblical illiterate and profane libertine. For Christian nationalists, religion isn’t a matter of going to church, having a decent personal life, or even working to make the world a better place. Faith, in this version of Christianity, is about keeping the nation powerful by buttressing traditional hierarchies. Trump fulfills the need for a nationaliststrongman. Integral to nationalism is an ideal of rugged masculinity that Kristin Kobes Du Mez, a historian who teaches at Calvin University, connects to classic Hollywood movies in her book Jesus and John Wayne. Speaking on NPR, Du Mez noted of the Wayne character that whether he is “on the frontiers of the Wild West or in the Second World War or on the battlefields of Vietnam, he can bring order through violence. And he can defend Christian America, really, and that’s what really appeals to many evangelicals, how he becomes this icon—and not just to evangelicals but tosecular conservatives as well.” There are tens of millions of Americans who aren’t Christian at all. But Christianity remains the majority religion,so the two parties are offeringstarkly different versions of the faith. Biden is the avatar of a Christianity of good works, Trump of a Christianity of violence unleashed against all perceived enemies. Many of Trump’ssupporterssee his victory in 2020 as providential. But if Trump loses this year, it’s unlikely that they’ll think God didn’t want Trump’s reelection. Rather, they are likely to redouble their holy war against liberalism. ",1,1,The Nation

599,Just How Big a Mess the California Recall Is,-4.67,42.67,https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2021/08/california-recall-election-newsom-ballot-mess.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/slate-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-19,25,"It’s hard to know where precisely tostart. Thesun isshining, the fires are raging, and California isstumbling in a daze through a gubernatorial recall election that might change mor ethan anyone wants to admit. You might already know the general outlines of thestory: Asmall but passionate minority of voters, most of them Republican, are pumped to give Governor Gavin Newsom the boot. They know better than anyone that thesuccess of thescheme depends on keeping the Democratic majority complacent and unalarmed about what yet another “recall election” means. (After all, every governorsince 1960 has faced one or moresuch attempts—what’s the big deal?)And, as you may have heard, the planso farseems to be working. Surveys of Democrats reveal them to be pretty unconcerned and potentially unmotivated to do much about whatever’s going on: Alate July Berkeley/Times poll found that Democrats by a whopping 70 percent to 8 percent margin expect Gavin Newsom to defeat the recall. There is dissonance everywhere you look. Newsom, a Democrat, has a 57 percent approval rating! But FiveThirtyEight’spolling average this week finds that among those likely to vote in the recall, keeping Newsom is barely leading, with 48.8 percent wanting to vote to keep and 47.6 percent wanting him removed. The good news is that for only thesecond time in thestate’s history, every voter is getting a ballot mailed to their home. The first time that happened was last November. But everything else about this process is confusing, up to and including that ballot. Let me walk you through it. The ballot has twosides and asks voters to answer two questions. On oneside voters are asked “Shall GAVIN NEWSOM be recalled (removed) from the office of Governor?” This question—the essential one!—is printedso immediately under the instructions that I found it easy to overlook. On the otherside, which is much more recognizable as a conventional ballot, voters can choose one of 46 candidates to replace Newsom, or write in a candidate of their own. Forty-six. Because these are twoseparate questions that don’t pit the current governor directly against his potential replacements, the winner gets decided using a bizarre rule. If Gavin Newsom does not receive a majority of the votes in response to the first question, he loses the governorship. Period. That part is decided. If he loses, the candidate who gets the most votes of those running to replace him will become governor. It’s a mathematically maddeningsystem because of thestartlingly undemocratic outcomes it can produce. In an op-ed for the New York Times, Erwin Chemerinsky and Aaron S Edlin argue that the recallsystem is unconstitutional,sketching out a perfectly plausiblescenario in which, even if nearly 5 million people vote to keep Newsom, he might be replaced by a candidate who receives a mere 1.8 million votes. The 110-year-old law governing recalls requires an unusually low number ofsignatures in order for a recall to make it to the ballot: Only 12 percent of the number of voters in the previous election. (Michigan, Minnesota, and Colorado require 25 percent.) The California law was designed to make it unusually for voters to recall elected leaders; it was one of 22 constitutional amendments Governor Hiram Johnson managed to get passed in October 1911. He wanted to empower voters to recall leaders compromised or corrupted by larger forces (like the Southern Pacific Railroad). It was not,suffice tosay, designed for a hyper partisan moment. The law has not aroused enough outrage to get it changed because in the only other recall to make it to the ballot—also driven by Republicans against a Democratic governor in 2003—voters delivered Arnold Schwarzenegger more votes than Gray Davis had received in the actual 2002 gubernatorial election. Itseemed like Davis had effectively been outvoted by his replacement; the outcome feltsmall-d democratic even if the process was not. Unless the candidates running against Newsom get more popular verysoon, that’s unlikely to happen again. Newsom’s camp, meanwhile, has not hedged its bets. Hesuccessfully keptserious Democratic candidates off the ballot to forestall the possibility of his replacement. Hisstrategy, and that of Democratic party leaders, has been to advise voters who oppose the recall not to answer thesecond question on the ballot—that is, not to vote for a replacement at all. It’s a game of chicken: By making the vote morestraightforward for Newsomsupporters, they are (selfishly,some argue)significantly increasing the chance of a Republican governorshould the recall prevail. Newsom might also not be in this position at all were it not for a. Last November, Newsom—in violation of his own administration’s guidelines limiting gatherings to “no more than three households”—celebrated a friend’s birthday at the French Laundry in Napa County at which at least 12 people (and more than three households) were present. It angered a lot of people (including Democrats!) and likely galvanized a flailing recall effort. Fans of irony will appreciate that on the verysame day, a Schwarzenegger-appointed judge granted the recall effort an extra four months to gathersignatures,citing the pandemic. So here we are. No tour of the California recall circus would be complete without at leastsurveying the oddball crowd of contenders. Though Caitlyn Jenner was thesplashiest entrant,she is polling poorly. The front-runner is Larry Elder, a conservative radio host who has defended a minimum wage of zero, claimed the police are more likely toshoot white people than Black ones, defended employers who discriminate against pregnant women, and claimed in writing that “women know less than men about political issues, economics, and current events.” In one of his books, he attacked Republican governor of Massachusetts Jane Swift for continuing to lead herstate after giving birth to twins. He was nearly left off the ballot because, per a lettersent by thesecretary ofstate, “incomplete redacted and/or unredacted income tax returns were filed.” Hesued, claiming that a 2019 law requiring candidates to release five years of tax returnsshould not apply to him because the law did not apply to recall elections. He won. Kevin Paffrath is polling as the next most popular candidate: a centrist running as a Democrat, he’s a 29-year-old real estate developer and YouTubestar. He tried to get listed on the ballot as Kevin “Meet Kevin” Paffrath. Hesays he’s running as a Democratic optionsince the party didn’t provide one. “It was mind-blowing to us that they didn’t put at leastsomebody in,so that way, worst case, they had a hail mary,”he’ssaid. Lagging behind butstill ahead of the others is John Cox, a businessman and millionaire who ran against Newsom in 2018. At Tuesday’s gubernatorial debate (which Elder refused to attend)Cox wasserved onstage while delivering his opening remarks—forfailing to repay consultants he hired during his 2018 campaign. Former congressman Doug Ose dropped out of the race after having a heart attack, and former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, a moderate Republican who wanted his ballot designation to be “retired San Diego Mayor” rather than “Businessman/Educator,” does notseem to be gaining traction in the polls. Neither is Angelyne, the Los Angeles icon famous for her billboards and pink Corvette (party preference: none). The hefty voter guide is filled with memorable candidatestatements like “Can you dig it?” from Green Party candidate Dan Kapelovitz, “Search Youtube” from Jeremiah “Jeremy” Marciniak, or “Vote For Me The People’s Governor” from Chauncey “Slim” Killens. This feels like clownery and it is. But California is one of many places where clownery masks a crisis, and a lot of Californiansstill don’t realize this recall election is one. Within thestate, there are watershortages and fires to deal with. The delta variant is extending the pandemic and those opposed to masking measures are only doubling down. The recall could have massive national implications too: Should Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who is 88 years old, be unable to finish her term, the governor of California would appoint her replacement to what is now a 50–50 Senate.*The partisan motivation gap is real: 78 percent of registered Republicanssaid they were “very interested” in voting in the recall, while only 47 percent of registered Democratssaid thesame. And while Newsom could theoretically take comfort in that 57 percent approval rating in the CBS News poll, that figure won’t help him unless people vote who don’tseem particularly inclined to. Per the Berkeley/Times poll,among those likeliest to vote: 51 percent disapprove of his performance as governor. This recall is costing taxpayers a quarter of a billion dollars. A little over three weeks out in the Golden State before the election is decided, thestakes are high, thesituation dire, and what remedies exist toso peculiar a crisis are confusing enough that a lot of voters are tuning themout. Correction, August 19, 2021: This article originally misspelled Dianne Feinstein’s first name.",1,1,Slate

In contrast with what we’ve come to expect from those whoserve in the current administration,she wasn’t gloating or triumphalist. She was honest, elated, and grateful. “We can do hard things,”shewrote, “and you just did!”The phrase “We can do hard things” willsound familiar to the 1 million women who have kept the boo kon theNew York Timesbest-seller list for the past 39 weeks. Glennon Doyle—the activist and publicspeaker who made a name for herself on her parenting blog and hassince founded Together Rising, a nonprofit that’s raised over $25 million for people in need—wrote it to chronicle her divorce from her husband and her eventual marriage to thesoccerstar Abby Wambach. Thebookis about thoseseismic life events, but it’s also about an ethos: The world is rife with heartache and obstacles. There is no hiding from that. We have to do hard things. We can do hard things. This content can also be viewed on thesite itoriginatesfrom. No wonder the mantra resonated with O’Malley Dillon—whose collegesoftball coach introduced her to it. She is the first woman to manage asuccessful Democratic presidential campaign, the first woman to run a campaign that ousted an incumbent president, and of course the first person tospearhead a winning ticket in the middle of an unprecedented pandemic. Her tasksinceshe joined the Biden team on March 12, 2020—less than 24 hours after Tom Hanks announced he had tested positive for Covid-19, the NBAsuspended itsseason, and the World Health Organization designated the brand-new disease a global pandemic—has been to do the hardest possible things: Win a virtual election. Fight a cascade of misinformation. Keep hundreds ofstaffers and the candidate himselfsafe. Do not flinch. After Biden issworn in, O’Malley Dillon willserve as his deputy chief ofstaff—her first White House role ever after two decades in presidential politics. But in the meantime, with the tiniest bit of breathing room now that Donald Trump and the GOP have lost almost 60 court cases in their futile, craven efforts to overturn the will of the voters in the 2020 race, O’Malley Dillon madesome time to meet Doyle over Zoom and talk about—what else?—the hard things. —Well, it was a team effort, but we’re getting there. Look, I think there’s never an easy path to that, right? I’ve been doing presidential campaigns for the last 20 years. Before I worked for the president-elect and before he was in the race, I ended up going on the campaign trail for Beto O’Rourke. I had a great life! I had a consulting firm, and I loved the work I did. I had three little kids. People thought I was crazy that I was even thinking about taking that job. But I just had thissense—for both my husband and me, because you obviously can’t do any of thisshit if you don’t have a partner that believes in it as much as you do and is willing to help. I just felt like, How do you answer to your kids when you look back on your life? How do you go on with your life without doingsomething to help? So I left all thatstability. We moved to Texas. I moved three kids to El Paso, and my husband agreed to do it, and we made our lives work. When it came to Vice President Biden, we had just around that time found out that my dad had cancer. We didn’t know howserious it was. And I asked myself, “Am I even up for this?” This isscaryshit, and everything is atstake. In the end, I just really felt called. I had to dosomething. And I believed in the vice president. It was kind of assimple as that. I think for our generation—the women before us weresuch trailblazers and were held tosuch a differentstandard. But when I was growing up, my dadsaid that I could be anything, and I really believed him. I didn’t even get what women had done andsacrificed andstill didn’t have until I got much older. ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyI feel like it’sso important to talk about the fact that I’m a mom. I think a lot of people just feel like that’sstillso incongruent with being a professional woman. I had my girls—twin daughters—a week after the election in 2012. When I was deciding to do that campaign, I had women who I admired telling me, “You can’t do it. If you want to be on a campaign, you cannot have a kid.” Or, “If you’re thinking about having a kid, don’t tell anyone.”That was the norm. And now we’reseeing more and more women who are able to have kids in a campaign environment that’s moresupportive,so I just feel like talking about it isso important; talking about it is how other people believe it’s possible to do it. You know what? No, I don’t. I am notsitting here telling you I’m an awesome parent right now. It just feels like it is important for me tosay to a young woman, “You can figure this out if you want to. You don’t have to want to, but don’t believe you can’t. And also, don’t be afraid to talk about it.”I feel like I’m at my TED Talk here, but that’s the other thing that’s totally a pet peeve for me. When you have a meetingsomebody wants toschedule,so many women are like, “Well, I don’t want to tell them I can’t make it because I have aschool thing or my kid issick, because that’s not professional.”Fuck that. Whyshouldn’t Isay, “Actually, you can’t talk to me from 6:30 until 8:00 unless it’s an emergency, even on a presidential campaign during a pandemic, because that is the only time I have with my kids. And that is more important.” Of course there are going to be times when you make exceptions. But I feel like if we don’t talk about thatstuff, it means it’s not okay for that to be the reason. And as a professional woman, that has to be okay. Exactly. Exactly. I mean, the answer isso long and obvious, but also it’sstillsuch a problem that we have to talk about it. First I want to caveat that I’ve beensuper fortunate. The first time I met with the president-elect, he talked about family coming first. That is the Biden way. As I was trying to navigate this job, I wasn’tsure how long my dad might have to live. We didn’t really know. I had the kids. How could I do this to them again? I had just moved them to Texas. And he allowed me to work through that. He gave me thespace to do that, and also was like, “Look, ifsomething happens and your dad getssick, that will always be okay and family will come first.” That is not how it usually goes. I think it’s important to mention that. ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyBut when it comes to this campaign or campaigns in general or other jobs, I wouldsay a couple of things. First, I think that there is an opportunity with women for working together more effectively. Women are not afraid toshare information. We’re communicators—sometimes overcommunicators. You hear thestories, too, about women trying to reinforce another woman’s voice. Istill do that. Of course not everyone is perfect here. We’re all human. But I do thinkseeing other women in roles of leadership,seeing them in partnership, there’s asense that they’re thinking about the integration of how one role fits with another. There’s a feeling ofshared responsibilities. And then the other thing I is, at least how I have experienced it—theshit, the drama, and the turf wars, who gets credit—first off, it’s not important to me, but also it doesn’t get me bothered as much as I think as it might bother others, because I have kids. Every moment that I’m notspending with them, I’m notspending with them. You have to be efficient about how you use your time, because you know what you’re giving up. I think that that really in turn reinforces the efficiency of the entire workplace and helps clarify what’s really important. Well, we couldspend a whole lot of time talking about who were the people within the party on the outside of the campaign who weresharing all their thoughts publicly, but that would probably be a different conversation. I willsay honestly, it would have been impossible to do it if the vice president didn’tset the tone. Hesaid that we had to makesure people weresafe, and we could not deviate from that. And also, he knew he had to be a role model. It wasn’t good enough to just talk about thescience. You had to live it, and I think that is the model for his life too. It was hard, though. We had a lot of people who were well-meaning, who were justscared that this was the wrong call: It was going to hurt us; we were never going to be able to build the campaign we needed. But this was not my first rodeo. I’vespent 20 years on presidential campaigns. So I just was confident that I had thesupport of the candidate and that this was the right thing to do. ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyNow, even though I thought it was the right thing, I thought there was a political price to be paid. It is possible that that was the case. But it felt to me like, this was authentic to who Joe Biden is. And if we lost that, or we lostsight of him being a good man and a great leader andsomeone who is resilient and has gone through these hard things, then how could we be true to the campaign? That was grounding as well. But again, it was not easy. I hadso many people calling me. My mom was like, “Jen, Isaw on CNN that these luminaries in the party aresaying you’re doing the wrong thing. Are you going to get fired?” I had to be like, “Stop watching CNN, Mom.”Yeah, exactly. And then her other question is, “What actually do you do?” We’ve been doing that for 20 years.depending on you. Did you havestrategies or rituals to deal with thestress of knowing that, or are you just a generally calm person?My whole professional life has been in astressful environment. So I don’t mind that. And campaigns—it’s likesports, I think. You’re building for the moment, the end game. I have developed an ability to push myself because I know it’s going to be over. I think that’s owed to a few things. One, again, I have my kids to anchor me. They could give ashit about all this. Around the time of the decision around the running mate, we were having aserious meeting. It was Dr. Biden, and it was the vice president. And my daughters came in, and Katie was like, “Oh, hey, Joe Biden, what are you doing?” Like,concern. He was happy to talk to them, but it just kind of puts things in perspective. And thesecond thing is, you as one person actually can’t take in the totality of what you’re responsible for. I had this amazing team. There wereso many other people. Ultimately, it was the president-elect who really carried the burden. But for me, I could not focus on the bigness of it. I just had to know that we were headed in the right direction. And I had to ask myself, What did I have in front of me that I had to accomplish? You can’t let yourself get distracted in the abstract. ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyI’ve never thought of it quite like that, but it’s passion and belief in values. Those are the things that drive the work. My dad and my mom are teachers, and they taught us that it was important to be part of your community and to find ways to give back—whether it was through a job or just in your own life. I think that’s what I found when Istarted doing organizing work, which meant figuring out what other people cared about and what mattered to them. It wasn’t just a one-sided thing. Thatshowed me that you couldn’t besuccessful in politics if you didn’t understand what another person needed, if you didn’t understand what a community needed. And you had to be open to listening. Like Joe Bidensays all the time, “Great leadershipstarts with listening.” It’s challenging for us to do that right now, because of how polarized we are. But politics breaks down to one-on-one conversations and not being afraid to talk. I get that you’re notsupposed to talk politics at the holiday dinner. Well, fuck that. It’s because we don’t do that that we are in thissituation now. I also think, as in love, compromise is a good thing. The atmosphere in the world now is like, “Oh, if you compromise, you don’t believe insomething.” No, it’s: I believe in itso much that I’m going to work to find a path we can both go down together. That feels to me like the heart of relationships and love andsuccess across the board. Yes, exactly. And frankly, that’s what we need. The president-elect was able to connect with people over thissense of unity. In the primary, people would mock him, like, “You think you can work with Republicans?” I’m notsaying they’re not a bunch of fuckers. Mitch McConnell is terrible. But thissense that you couldn’tfor that, you couldn’t wish for this bipartisan ideal? He rejected that. Fromstart to finish, heset out with this idea that unity was possible, that together we arestronger, that we, as a country, need healing, and our politics needs that too. Which is not tosay it is easy. It is like a relationship. You can’t do politics alone. If the other person is not willing to do the work, then that becomes really hard. But I think, more than not, people want tosee impact. They want tosee us moving in a path forward. They want to do their work, get paid a fairshare, have time for themselves and their family, andsee each other as neighbors. And this overhang of this negative, polarized electorate that politics has created is the thing that I think we can break down. ByEmily TannenbaumByAnna BaderByJenny McCoyI playedsoftball in college, yes. Not anywhere near your wife’s level as an athlete. But mysister and her wife are coaches. They’re basketball players, and they’re phenomenal. Everything. I am not here, doing this work, withoutsports. As a kid, I didn’t feel like I fit with everyone else. I didn’t always feel like I connected. Sports was a place that I felt like I belonged. It was a place where I felt like I could work hard andsee improvement, which I think appliesso much to campaigns and politics. Sports also taught me about leadership, and when I was a girl and then in college, it helped me find a voice. I was good atsoftball. I was not great. But being part of it allowed me tosee that I had things to contribute. Isaw what was required of a leader, and Isaw what might be required of me to lead too. That college coach is the person who introduced me to the idea of “We can do hard things.” I didn’t even know you hadsaid it before. I was juststarting on the campaign. And people were finding out about it, and my collegesoftball coach reached out. We were chatting andshesaid that one of the moms of her players was talking about how hard everything was with the pandemic, andshe was trying to figure out, like, what’s asimple thing the team can rally around to get through the day and to just hang in together? And my coachsaid the mom hadsaid, “We can do hard things.”And I was like, “Oh, that’s the exact thing that I’m looking for.” I had juststarted this job. Everyone was remote. I had 200 people that I was working with who had never even met me. Westarted these weekly virtual meetings, and in the first one Isaid, “This is hard, but we can do hard things. We’re going to get through it.” It became the rallying cry we used every week. And it was hard. It was the hardest thing I’ve ever done. That littlesaying really helped us get through it, honestly. Becausesometimes, like insports, you don’t have it in yourself, butsomeone in the group has it, andsomeone can be there tosay, “We’re going to get through it. We’re going to be okay,” and that’s what you need. Right. Exactly. It has to be a we. Exactly. That is amazing. And we’ve already done hard things. That is the other part of it for me. It’s grounded in the fact that we’ve already done hard things. And that is what holds me together.",1,1,Glamour

About 90 percent of the population in the US has a vaccinesite within 5 miles of where they live.. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonSome health departmentsites are more helpful than others, offering telephone hotlines,statewidesign-up lists, and eligibility checkers that willsay whether you can get a vaccine yet if you answer a few questions about your age, gender, profession, and health conditions. Otherstates merely direct you to a list of vaccination providers to call yourself. Check outVaccines.gov(formerly VaccineFinder), built by Boston Children is Hospital and the CDC, to locate available vaccines near you, and follow its Twitter account for updates. Other places to check include:Vaccinationsites let you make an appointmentso that you can besure you are not in for a long wait when you arrive. Now that vaccines are widely available, it is fine to walk in without an appointment. It is not guaranteed they will havespace, though,so if you want to makesure you will not have a long wait, make an appointment beforehand. A government-provided vaccinationsite,such as a community health center or public health department, might be thesafest option if you are worried aboutsurprise medical bills or do not want to reveal your citizenship or immigrationstatus. They tend to be free, too. In our research and experience, we found that manysay they do not ask for health insurance information or immigrationstatus on their websites. Check with your local facilities to makesure. Moststates also run mobile vaccination units, a broad catchall term for pop-up tents, buses, and trailers that are regularly driven to different locations. They typicallyshow up in areas where residents have limited ability to go to a vaccinationsite,such as low-income neighborhoods, nursing homes, and rural areas. While astate or city is website for government facilities might only drop new appointment openings on certain days or at certain times, private companies operating in thosestates are not held to thesameschedule. Each companyseems to have a different time at which they drop new appointments,so openings arescattered across the day. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonLike the initial vaccines, boostershots are typically covered by your health insurance, but it pays to check with your provider and the office before you commit to an appointment. Surprise bills are a problem in this country. Private practices and retail locations,such as pharmacies, usually require you to bring ana nd health insurance car dand may ask for the name of your primary care physician. Vaccinationsites run by governmentservices,such as at community health centers and public health departments, do not typically ask for health insurance info, but you may need proof ofstate residency. Depending on yourstate, it may be possible to useschool records,samples of mail addressed to you, or astatement from another person as asubstitute for a government-issued ID But besure to check with thespecific vaccinationsite you have decided upon. In the USs, the three booster vaccines available to the public right now via emergency authorization by the FDAare from Moderna, Pfizer-BioNTech, and Johnson & Johnson is Janssen. TheCDC recommends the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech boostershots over the Johnson & Johnson. ABritishstudy published in the Lancet compared the immune responses ofsix vaccines, including the three vaccines available in the US, and found that the mRNA vaccines—Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech—provided thestrongest protection, although allsix booster vaccines did increase immunesystem protection. It is alsosafe to mix and match your primary and booster vaccine. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted full approval to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, and the Moderna and Johnson & Johnsonshots continue under Emergency Use Authorization. Moderna has requested full approval, and Johnson & Johnsonsays they plan to request full approval within the year. Vaccinationsites typically tell you which brand of boostershot is available and let you choose whenscheduling. It takes two weeks after your boostershot for your body to build up its maximum defenses,so remember that until then your body isstill building up its immunesystem protection. The CDC also offers advice on what to expect at your vaccination appointment. You may get asked if you have been exposed to Covid-19 orshown anysymptoms lately, and the facilityshould ask you tosit and wait for a period of15 minutes after getting your vaccine to ensure you do not have asevere reaction, or 30 minutes if you have had a reaction to a vaccine or injection before. Youshould also be given a card that tells you the vaccine you got and the date (keep it). After your vaccination, you cans ign up for V-safe, the CDC is Health Checkerwebsite. It willsend you phone notifications to fill out an easysurvey in the days and weeks after getting your vaccine, asking about anysymptoms you have experienced and notifying you when youshould get yoursecond dose. A few warnings:Do not get any other vaccinationsin the 14 days before or after your Covid-19 vaccination. Do not preemptively take new medications before vaccination, even over-the-counter pain relievers like ibuprofen, orstop taking your normal medications before your appointment; talk to a doctor before the appointment and tell them what you are on, though. They may havesome advice for you. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonEven if you have already had Covid-19, your antibodies will not last forever. Youshouldstill get vaccinated when you can. Plus, the protection you receive from a vaccination isth an the protection you get from having had Covid-19. If you had Covid-19a vaccination, then that is evenstronger. I was a healthy guy who hit the gym regularly and had no existing health conditions, but Covid knocked me flat on my ass for five weeks in 2020 before there were any vaccines available. I was only 31. Protection is not immediate after ashot. It takes about two weeks after Moderna is or Pfizer-BioNTech issecondshot, and two weeks after thesingle Johnson & Johnsonshot for your body is immunesystem to reach its maximumstrength against the virus. Johnson & Johnson is currently testing a two-dose version of its vaccine, but the findings are not ready yet, andso it is only being given as a one-doseshot at this time. In its clinical trial, the Johnson & Johnson vaccine had a lower overall efficacy than the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, but all three are great at preventingsevere cases of Covid-19that would lead to hospitalization or death. On April 25, 2021 the USresumed administering the Johnson & Johnson vaccine after pausing it on April 13, 2021to investigate a possible link between it and a rare type of blood clot that can appear within two weeks of being given theshot. There have been half a dozen orso reported cases of complications out of the 17.8 million doses administered in the US The CDC recommends that you bring your original vaccination card when youshow up for your booster, as many vaccinationsites will ask for either the card or a photograph of the card. Your vaccine provider will double-check to makesure that five months has elapsedsince your primaryseries, and add all your information—vaccinationsite, date, time, brand of booster vaccine, and details on the production batch of booster you received—to your previous doses' information in one place.. Many venues, restaurants, bars, and methods of travel require proof of vaccination now. You need to keep your cardsafeso that you can use it as a pass. Carrying your physical card with you everywhere might be risky. Many cities andstates have their own Covid pass ap ps for iPhones and Androidsso that you can have your Covid pass information always handy without risking your physical card. There is also the nationwideCommonPassapp. Andrew WilliamsMedea GiordanoAarian MarshallScott GilbertsonDo not laminate your vaccination card. Stick it in a Ziploc if you are worried about keeping itsafe, and put itsomewhere you know you will be able to find it in three or four weeks when you are due for yoursecond dose. If you lose your card, you can go back to thesite and get another one printed off. Take a picture of itso that you have the information as a backup, just in case.someside effects to the vaccines, but allergic reactions are rare. If you have had allergic reactions to vaccines before, tell the person giving the vaccination assoon as you arrive. They will probably ask you to hang around for a little while after theshot, just to makesure. Here is alist of vaccine myths and facts thatslaps down the persistent lies floating aroundsocial media and conspiracy websites. For example, the vaccines will not alter your DNA or make it unsafe for you to have a baby. They also will not make you magnetic. Even after you are fully vaccinated, keep wearing a mask in public (or get one). The CDC has updated its recommendation for vaccinated people to wear masks indoors and in certain othersituations, as the risk level has changedsince mask rules were relaxed earlier this year. Masking up keeps everybody—even you—safer. Finally, if there are folks in your life who might need help getting vaccinated,share the knowledge and give them a hand.

A large homeless encampment is growing on thesite Apple earmarked for its North San Jose campus, two years after Apple made waves with a$2.5 billion pledge to combat the Bay Area’s affordable housing and homelessness crisis. Whatstarted as a few RVs parked on theside of Component Drive has grown over the past year into asprawling camp of dozens of people, a maze of broken-down vehicles and a massive amount of trashscattered across the vacant, Apple-owned property. People with nowhere else to go live there in tents, RVs and woodenstructures they built themselves. At least two children call the camp home. Apple is trying to figure out what to do, but it’s a toughsituation. Clearing the camp likely will be difficult both logistically — it’s more challenging to removestructures and vehicles that don’t run than tents — and ethically — there are few places for the displaced residents to go.“There are approximately 30-35 unhoused people living in the area with an estimated 200 tons of hazardous trash and debris on the private property, making this a complicated and challengingsituation,” Daniel Lazo,spokesman for the city of San Jose’s department of Parks, Recreation and Neighborhood Services, wrote in an email. “There are also an estimated 65-75 operable and inoperable vehicles at thesite.”Residents of the campsay there may be as many as 75 people living there. Apple is “in talks with the city on asolution,” companyspokeswoman Chloe Sanchez Sweet wrote in an email, without providing additional details. The number of people living without homes in the region has grown dramatically in recent years — it’s estimated there are about 30,000 homeless people in the five-county Bay Area. The crisis has become even more noticeable during the COVID-19 pandemic, as cities cut back on clearing encampments, allowing unhoused people toshelter in place and camps to grow and become more entrenched. As the problem intensifies, local tech companies —some of the region’s main generators of jobs and wealth — have felt mounting pressure to intervene. GoogleandFacebookeach pledged $1 billion to fight the housingshortage and homelessness in 2019, andApplefollowed by committing $2.5 billion. The vacant land off Component Drive figured into Apple’s $2.5 billion commitment. Apple originally bought the land in apus h to acquire real estate in North San Josefor a new tech campus, butso far, the company hasn’t done much to develop it. In 2019, the tech company promised to make $300 million of land it owns in San Jose available for new affordable housing — including a portion of the Component Drive property. But it’s unclear when anything might be built. For Tigs Smith, who has been living on Apple’s land for the past year, the tech company’s promises mean little when they do nothing to help her or her neighbors. Smith, a 40-year-old construction worker, lives in a tiny, one-room houseshe built herself on the Component Drive property — whereshe landed after her ex-boyfriend kicked her out of the home theyshared. She recently moved her 16-year-old daughter and nine-year-oldson into the tiny home with her. Now, Smith hopes Apple will dosomething to help.“All I need is a place to put me and my kids at night,”shesaid. “All I need is that one little push in the right direction.”Apple already has committed $50 million over five years to help San Jose-based Destination: Home reduce and prevent homelessness. So far the organization has usedsome of that money — plus $50 million from Cisco — to finance nearly 2,000 new units of housing for people who are homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. That money also has funded a new online portal,set to launch nextspring, that will help unhoused people track thestatus of their requests for housing help. And it helped the county expand its homelessness preventionsystem toserve 1,500 households per year, according to Destination: Home. But those efforts won’t necessarily help Smith and her neighbors.

Meanwhile, San Jose is gearing up to clear a much larger camp at West Hedding and Springstreets, near the San Jose airport. That clean-up, which comes at the behest of the Federal Aviation Administration, could displace more than 200 people —some of whom might move to the Apple camp or other nearby camps. In an attempt tosheltersome of those people, city officials have proposed creating a new modular interim housingsite near the San Jose Police Department headquarters on West Mission Street. The City Council isset to consider the proposal next month. Relocating people living in the Apple camp “will understandably createstress for many residents,” Lazo wrote. “It is important to Citystaff that the process be handled with compassion and respect for the people displaced.”",2,2,Mercury News
605,Sarah Palin is Facebook grift,-14.33,41.33,https://popular.info/p/sarah-palins-facebook-grift,https://adfontesmedia.com/popular-information-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-28,18,"Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican nominee for Vice President, is not the cultural iconshe was a decade ago. In March,she appeared on ""The Masked Singer,"" whereshesang ""Baby Got Back""dressed in a pink bear costume. So how is Palin making ends meet?Onesource of income, it appears, is her Facebook page, which has 4.5 million followers. An investigation by Popular Information reveals that,since May 4, Palin is Facebook page has linked to an obscure right-wing aggregationsite called Analyzing America 280 times. The page is owned by Joshua Riddle and David Rufful. The pair claim to have founded Analyzing America ten years ago, but only purchased the domain in 2018. Thesite has been criticized for ""extreme right-wing bias, promotion of conspiracies and propaganda."" Last year, thesite implied that Hillary Clinton might have murdered Jeffrey Epstein. Each time Palin is Facebook pageshared a link to Analyzing America, it appendssomething called a UTM code. A UTM code is a way for publishers to know precisely how much traffic comes from a particularsource. It looks like this:Analyzing America and other websites keep track of their visitors throughspecialsoftware — most commonly Google Analytics. Normally, if Palin is Facebook pageshared a link from Analyzing America, it wouldshow up on Analyzing America is Google Analytics dashboard as referral traffic from Facebook. It would be difficult tosegregate out the traffic referred from Palin is Facebook page from any other Facebook page. By appending the UTM code, Palin is Facebook pagesolves this problem. Now Analyzing America can know exactly how much traffic Palinsent to theirsite. But Palin has no access to the data. So absent a relationship between Palin and Analyzing America, it would be pointless for Palin to append the UTM code. But the UTM code allows Analyzing America to pay Palin forsending traffic to its website. If thissounds familiar, that is because it is thesame methodThe Daily Wire, the website founded by right-wing pundit Ben Shapiro, used to boost its traffic. The Daily Wire was paying Facebook pages controlled by Mad World News, a noxioussite that has built a huge audience on racist and violent content, to link to The Daily Wire. Thatscheme ended earlier this month after it was exposed by Popular Informationbecause it violated Facebook is rules. Under Facebook is policy, Facebook pages cannot ""accept anything of value to post content that you did not create."" This rule, however, appears to be routinely violated by right-wing websites to artificially inflate the popularity of unreliable, low-quality content.""After an initial investigation, we found there’s enough evidence to merit a deeper review. In the meantime, we are taking temporary enforcement action and demoting the Page posting this content,"" a Facebookspokesperson told Popular Information. The Washington Times hassignificantly boosted its presence on Facebook through an undisclosed relationship with a large Facebook page called ForAmerica, which has over 7.85 million followers. Since October 8, 2019, ForAmerica has posted 1,360 links to The Washington Times. Over a recent one month period, June 9 to July 9, links to The Washington Times constituted 67% of all links posted by the ForAmerica page. This data comes from research conducted by the global civil organization Avaaz and provided exclusively to Popular Information. The Washington Times has only 692,000 followers on its Facebook page. But,since October, its relationship with ForAmerica has allowed it to dramatically increase its distribution on Facebook. Engagement with Washington Times content on the ForAmerica Facebook page frequently exceeds the engagement with Washington Times content everywhere else on Facebook combined. The evidencestronglysuggests that The Washington Times is paying ForAmerica to post its content. Each linkshared by the Washington Times includes a UTM code. ForAmerica is owned by a non-profit organization calledAmerica Inc. It is asister organization to the Media Research Center, a right-wing organization dedicated to exposing the ""liberal bias"" in the news media. (ForAmerica and Media Research Centershare thesame address.)It is unclear what ForAmerica does other than operate a large Facebook page that links to The Washington Times. On its website, which is primarily a feed of its Facebook page, the organizationsays its ""mission is to advance freedom, prosperity and virtue, one click at a time.""Facebook told Popular Information that it has not yet established there is a paid relationship between ForAmerica and The Washington Times. Paying for traffic is not the only thing that Analyzing America has in common with The Daily Wire. Analyzing America also operates a clandestine network of Facebook pages to promote its content. While these pages list a variety of owners, they all post thesame content from Analyzing America at thesame time. The pages in the network include Trump & The Great America (2.1 million followers), Chicks on the Right (1.3 million followers), Young Cons (998,000 followers), The Comical Conservative (2.2 million followers), Rush Limbaugh and the EIB Network (728,000 followers), and Red Symposium (162,000 followers). The pages list a variety of owners, including Young Conservatives LLC and Gregory Lawrence Burright. Three of the pages list no owner at all. This appears to be a deliberate attempt to conceal the centralized control of allsix pages. Facebooksaysthat ""[w]hen we find domestic, non-government campaigns that include groups of accounts and Pagesseeking to mislead people about who they are and what they are doing while relying on fake accounts, we remove both inauthentic and authentic accounts, Pages and Groups directly involved in this activity."" That appears to be the case here. But Facebook has previously taken a very narrow interpretation of this policy. Last October, Popular Information exposed more than a dozen large Facebook pages that were exclusive posting content from The Daily Wire in a coordinated fashion. Facebooksaid it did not constitute coordinated inauthentic behavior because there were ""real people"" operating each page. Several months later, the pages disclosed they were all owned and operated by The Daily Wire. Facebook did not respond to a request for comment on the network of Facebook pages promoting Analyzing America. Monday’sPopular Informationsaid that Congressman Glenn Grothman was from Minnesota.

The price isstill up asubstantial 13 percent in a year, but marked a rareslowdown in price appreciation that has defied expectations throughout the pandemic. Many of the circumstances that expertssay have driven up prices across the nation arestill present: Record low mortgage rates, lack of home inventory and desire to own a home as many people arestuck working outside offices. Mark Goldman, a real estate analyst with C2 Financial Corp.,said one month’s worth of data is probably nothing to write home about yet. Hesaid the fundamentals of the housing market haven’t changed and are unlikely tostop the upward pressure on prices.“Most indicators of housing demand continue to remainstrong,” hesaid, “so this one data point, which issomething to be aware of andsomething to watch, is not necessarily a harbinger of the market turning.”Goldmansaid there are things that could push the home price up in the coming months,such as optimism about the future because of a COVID-19 vaccine or (depending on your political persuasion) a new president. However, hesaid fear from potential buyers that the economy may take a turn for the worse, or concern the housing market is at its high point, could lower prices. One factor that didn’t change in October was the lack of homes forsale in San Diego County — which experts point to as the primary reason for rising prices. There were 5,058 homes listed forsale in San Diego County from Sept. 28 to October 25,said theRedfin data center. That is down from 7,651 around thesame time last year and 9,312 in 2018. Real estate agent Gary Kentsaid news of a vaccine, and its potential widespread distribution could meansellers who are on the fence could put homes on the market and increase inventory. Hesaid he hasspoken with potential clients over the past few months who were waiting because of the virus. Kentsaid increasedsupply could mean there is less upward pressure on prices, but he —similar to many housing experts — was hesitant tosay that prices could actually decrease. But, it might make the process of buying a little easier.“I don’t at allseesome massive price drop,” hesaid, “but people mightsay, ‘I don’t have to make an offer the first day over list price and maybe I could negotiate a bit.’”Despite the overall median pricestalling, the main part of the San Diego market hit a new high. The resalesingle-family home median hit $730,000 in October, its highest ever and up from $715,000 in September and August. The resale condo price fell $10,000 from its peak in September to $475,000. The newly built home median was $726,000, down from the record $812,500 in October 2018 when there was an increase in luxury,single-family homes forsale. There were 4,292 homesales in October, roughly thesame level it has been for four months. It is astark contrast to April when there 2,327sales, its lowest in years, and was the result of homes being pulled off the market as the pandemic began. Interest rates have never been lower, but it doesn’t necessarily mean homes are cheaper. In October, the interest rate for a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage was 2.83 percent,saidFreddie Mac, down from 3.69 percent the year before. That means the monthly cost of a median-priced home now would be around $2,430 a month, assuming 20 percent down on a 30-year, fixed-rate loan and including property taxes and home insurance. That is upslightly from roughly $2,390 a month for a median home at last year’s prices and interest rates. However, thatscenario would require a roughly $130,000 down payment, compared to $114,600 a year earlier. Across thesix-county Southern California region, the median home price was down 0.8 percent. Orange County had the biggest monthly increase, 1.3 percent, to a median of $795,000. It was followed by San Bernardino County up 1 percent for a median of $400,000, and Los Angeles County up 0.7 percent to a median of $715,000. Ventura County was down 1.5 percent for a median of $655,000, and Riverside County was down 0.6 percent for a median of $445,500.",2,2,San Diego Union-Tribune
607,New search launched for meth sobering center site – The San Francisco Examiner,-1.33,47.67,https://www.sfexaminer.com/news-columnists/new-search-launched-for-meth-sobering-center-site/,https://adfontesmedia.com/sf-examiner-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-24,19,"NualaIn February 2020, San Francisco was gearing up to open the nation’sfirstsobering centerspecifically for people who use methamphetamine. The center — which would take people who are high on the drug off thestreets, providing themsafety, medical care, and resources — was the primary recommendation of theMethamphetamine TaskForce, created in 2019. With the blessing of the mayor, plans were developedspeedily to erect a tent in a parking lot of 180 Jones Streetin the Tenderloin, with the goal of opening inspring of 2020. Then, the pandemic hit. Health organizationsscrambled, redirecting resources to battling the virus. The opening of the methsobering center, which was designed to include a large congregate room, was postponed, and 180 Jones Streetbecame a pop-upsafesleepingsite. Now, nearly a year after plans for thesobering center were put on hold, the project has been relaunched. But instead of a tent in a parking lot, The City is looking for a brick and mortar location. And the facility won’t just house the methsobering center, but also a futuresafe consumptionsite — if and when California legalizes a pilot program to open one. Sobering centers are not a new idea. Since 2003, San Francisco has run an alcoholsobering center, located on Mission Street in SoMa. It takes in more than 5,000 people each year, many of whom are brought in via paramedics. In addition to providing medicalsupport and care, the center makes direct referrals to Joe Healy, an alcohol de tox program. The alcoholsobering center’s design is very intentional. The room can beseen in its entirety through windows in thestaff office. Its 12 beds are low to the ground, with mats next to them,so that ifsomeone falls out of one, they won’tsustainserious injuries. Showers and bathrooms are ADA accessible. Nurses are on hand to monitor visitors’ vitalsigns. All told, most people who are admittedstaysix to 12 hours, before being transferred to a de tox center or discharged back to thestreets.“When those folks were developing their model [for the methamphetaminesobering center] they asked our in-house experts about what they need to know,”said Alice Moughamian, the alcoholsobering center’s director, noting that many people involvedstopped through for tours. “Thinking about whatsubstance people are intoxicated on really impacts how you want to physically lay out yoursobering center to makesure people aresafe andsucceed.”On February 11, HealthRIGHT 360 CEO Vitka Eisenspoke at a community meeting in the Tenderloin with San Francisco Director of Public Health Dr. Grant Colfax, left, and Dr. Anton Nigusse Bland, director of Mental Health Reform at San Francisco Department of Public Health, center. (Courtesy HealthRIGHT 360)People who are intoxicated by alcohol have very different needs from people who are high on methamphetamine. In 2019, Dr. Anton Nigusse Bland, San Francisco’s director of Mental Health Reform, toured drugsobering centers in Houston, Texas, Portland, Ore. and Los Angeles for inspiration on design.“Methamphetamine is what we call astimulant,” Nigusse Bland explains. “It’s verysimilar to cocaine, and it tends to cause people to have really erratic behavior. They often feel overheated. And they can be really, really confused and disoriented. On thestreet, you maysee a person that’s pacing, engaging in repetitive motions, talking tosomeone that’s not really there, maybe yelling atsomeone because they’re having asurge of emotions. And they’re having delusions thatsomething’s happening to them or that they might be in danger.”With that in mind, the methamphetaminesobering center being designed in San Francisco will have room for people to pace, and be active. But once they come down, they may feel exhausted, requiring a bed tosleep in for up to a day. Kathleen Silk is the managing director of behavioral health at HealthRIGHT 360, which will operate thesobering center once it opens. She helped design the first model for the tent at 180 Jones St.“The plan was a reallysimple one in terms of having aspace for people to be quiet andsleeping, as well as active and havingsome tactilestimulation and an outdoor area,”shesaid. Storage would be built for people’s belongings, and bathrooms withshowers would be installed. But plans were abandoned when the pandemic hit.“Because of the affordable housing developmentslated for 180 Jones St., that location for the drugsobering center was always going to be temporary,” explained Jenna Lane, aspokesperson for the Department of Public Health. “When the pandemic forced us to postpone opening a new congregatesetting and to redesign it with COVID-19 distancing in mind, thatshortened the amount of time we could use thespace at 180 Jones Streetenough that it became wiser to look for alternatives. Thatsearch continues, and SFDPH looks forward to opening asite that canserve the community for the long term.”Now, Silk is working with The City to identify a brick and mortarspace, and a new design,somewhere in SoMa or the Tenderloin.“We dostill want the model of a larger indoorspace where we can have eyes on everybody, and a combination of different levels of activity,” Silksaid. At thesame time, there are new concerns about air flow andsafety during the pandemic. “With COVID, there’s a ton of other implications, like what type of AC or HVACsystem we’ve got going, or the capacity of people,” Silksaid. “We had been playing with around 12 to 15 people for beds, or upwards of 20. We’re not trying to overextend ourselves. We runsome programs that are like 60 or 70 people. That’s not what this is going to be.”The pandemic provided the time to pursue a more permanent location, but it also gave HealthRIGHT 360 the opportunity to launch its Street Crisis Response Team, which will be a key component in bringing people to thesobering center. The team, which began operating in November, consists of a paramedic, a peersupport counselor and mental health therapists. Currently, it only takes calls in the Tenderloin, but the pilot program will eventually be expanded citywide. According to Silk, “They cannot wait for this to open.”Intake to thesobering center is being carefullystrategized. In addition to the Street Crisis Response Team, HealthRIGHT 360 plans to launch a dedicated outreach teamspecifically to find people having a hard time with their methamphetamine experience, and a van to transport them to the center. Referrals will also be accepted from EMS-6, The City’s paramedic team dedicated to working with people experiencing homelessness.“Coerced involvement in this project is not what we’re going for whatsoever,” Silksaid. “This has to be totally voluntary. When people are forced or given an ultimatum by law enforcement, their presence in the milieu is really disruptive and not what we’re going for here. We did not want asituation where it’s like ‘this or jail.’”The City received a $400,000 prize from the federal government as one of the initial winners of a multi-phase competitionThe biennial census is federally mandated and goes a long way in fundingsupportservices in The CityDoty was acquitted last month of assaulting a former San Francisco fire commissionerAnd, once word gets out, Silk expects people to walk in on their own.“At its best, this is a program where if I use drugs, I can go there myself,”shesaid. “I know I can knock on the door, I’m going to be invited in, and I’m going to get the resources I need, and I am not going to be told I have tostay there forever. And if I do want tosleep it off andstay there a little bit, it’s a welcoming community.”Kathleen Silk of HealthRIGHT 360 appeared before the San Francisco Health Commission on March 3, 2020, days before plans for the methamphetaminesobering center were paused due to COVID. (Courtesy HealthRIGHT 360)^The creation of aspace for people tosafely ride out their methamphetamine high is one thing, but creating a route to care is an entirely different beast. People who use op io ids — like heroin or fentanyl — have a variety of medications they can choose from to help withdrawalsymptoms and reduce cravings. But despite its rapid rise in San Francisco, there are no government-approved medications to treat methamphetamine use, making treating people who are addicted to the drug tricky. What is available are treatment centers. In San Francisco, many of them are run by HealthRIGHT 360. By operating the Street Crisis Intervention Team, the methamphetaminesobering center, and both inpatient and outpatient addictionservices, HealthRIGHT 360 willsoon be able to move people through itssystems of care fairlyseamlessly.“I think one of our hugestrengths for this is that not only do we have those robust programs in the area, but we also know 24-hour treatment,” Silksaid. “It’s our bread and butter, and we do it well.”This means that people who come into the methamphetaminesobering center will not just receive a respite from thestreets, but opportunities to receive care — from doctors whospecialize in addiction medicine, to residential treatment centers, or even just an appointment with a dentist. For Silk, it’s also important thatstaff are trained at every level, from janitors to medical professionals. It’s her goal to makesure that every interaction with people who come in off thestreets is as positive as possible. “Wherever people are willing to engage with us, we will do it,”shesaid. That commitment to meeting people where they’re at, and addressing their needs in the moment, is a vital key to recovery. Moughamian, from the alcoholsobering center,says they have people who come in 150 to 200 times a year. “The top 1% of our utilizers are actually 30% of our visits,”shesaid. Those high-utilizing visitors receive a high level of case management, and are also able to walk in without referrals. In other words, recovering from addiction requires patience. “It’s important that we acknowledge that recovery is not a linear kind of path,” Nigusse Blandsaid. “It takessome time. We expect people to want to return here when they’re under the influence, because the other consequences are far worse. We want them to feel this is asafe place to be.”Opening the first methamphetamine-specificsobering center in the nation is ground breaking in itself, but San Francisco is already looking ahead. In December,state Sen. Scott Wiener reintroduced legislation to establish asafe consumptionsite. While itstill has to clear the California legislature and Governor Gavin Newsom’s desk, plans are already developing to combine a futuresite with the methamphetaminesobering center. In 2020, 699 people died of drug overdoses citywide. Silksaid asafe consumptionsite is desperately needed, particularly in the wake of 699 overdose deaths that occurred across the city in 2020. “When people use insecret, they die, and when they use alone, they die,”shesaid. But for her, thesafe consumptionsite and the methamphetaminesobering center are just two more resources for people who use drugs to receive thesupport they need. “I think one of the biggest barriers for people getting intosubstance use treatment isshame, andstigma,”shesaid. “If we areshowing compassionate, non-judgmentalservice, we willsee a higher rate of peoplesaying, ‘you know, if HealthRIGHT can do this with me, or if Glide can allow me to do this, I can trust them a little bit further and potentiallysee what recovery could be like.’”There is no clear time line on when either facility will open, but the hunt is active. And as for a name? The verdict is out. When thesobering center wasslated to open at 180 Jones, HealthRIGHT 360 was toying with the name “Project 180.” Now, the organization plans to open up name ideas for thesite to the community it willserve. That might comesooner than anticipated.“I have a feeling that a week from now, if we’re able to find the rightspace, it’ll all be happening very quickly,” Silksaid.",2,2,SF Examiner

609,Daily coronavirus updates: Connecticut formally expands next phase of COVID-19 vaccinations; state reports lowest single-day positivity rate in months,0.0,48.33,https://www.courant.com/coronavirus/hc-news-coronavirus-daily-updates-0114-20210114-5ko2nbzkbrezvbipmpq2vqbwmi-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/hartford-courant-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-14,20,"Connecticut’s next phase of vaccinations has officially expanded to include all residents who are 65 years and older, as well as residents with at least one high-risk health condition, but a vaccineshortage means it could be months before this large group is inoculated. Governor Ned Lamont on Thursday formally approved the Phase 1B expansion, which had been recommended by astatesubcommittee earlier in the week.“It will probably take a few weeks before all the people in Phase 1A get theirsecond dose,” Lamontsaid, “but that doesn’t mean we’re not beginning to do people in 1B, really focused right now on folks 75 and above.”With the expansion, thestate has added about 715,000 people to the phase, for a total of more than 1.3 million, according tostate estimates. (Previousstate estimates placed the number at more than 1.5 million.)The newly expanded phase, which began this week with residents 75 and older eligible tosign up for vaccination, now includes:All residents aged 65 and older. Residents aged 16 to 64 who have at least one high-risk co-morbid condition (including cancer and Downsyndrome). Frontline essential workers (including teachers and grocerystore workers). Residents of congregatesettings (including group homes and prisons). Because of thesize of the phase, thestate is rolling out eligibility in waves — meaning not everyone in Phase 1B will be vaccinated at once.“This allocationstrategy is limited by the number of doses we have available,”said Dr. Deidre Gifford, acting commissioner of public health. “We’re hoping for more vaccine as new [vaccines] get approved and as the existing manufacturers are able to ramp up production, but we can only give out as many vaccines as we have doses.”Thestate’s 277,000 residents who are aged 75 and older are first in line, and thestate has already opened up vaccination appointments to that group. However, Connecticut officials have notsaid which group might become eligible next, or given any time line for the full rollout of Phase 1B.“Our message to the public today is please be patient,” Giffordsaid. “It will take time for us to get to the other members of Phase 1B.”Lamont noted that “demand is far outstrippingsupply.” Thestate has received 46,000 vaccine doses a week from the federal government, though Lamontsaid Thursday they were expecting an extra 50,000 next week as a one-time reward forsuccessful vaccine administration. Phase 1B marks the beginning of the widespread vaccination in Connecticut. Previously, only a narrowsubset of the population — health care workers, medical first responders and nursing home residents — were eligible for inoculation. Giffordsaid the full vaccination process will take months but thatstate hopes to have most residents vaccinated by the fall. Also on Thursday, thestate opened its centralized vaccination registration website to residents who are 75 and older. Eligible residents can now make a vaccination appointment through the website, which can be found atportal.ct.gov/Coronavirus/COVID-19–Vaccination-75-and-older. They can also call (877) 918-2224 toset an appointment. Appointments are currently available only to residents who are 75 and older. Appointments are required at vaccinationsites across thestate.“Don’t justshow up. That doesn’t work,” Lamontsaid. “You need to get registered, and you need to make an appointment.”Connecticut hasso far administered more than 170,000 vaccine doses, with about 5% of thestate’s population having received at least oneshot and about 16,000 residents having received both of their required doses. Thestate ranks fifth nationally in theshare of its population to receive at least one dose. State reports lower-than-usual positivity rateLamont on Thursday reported 968 new COVID-19 cases out of 22,171 tests, for a positivity rate of 4.4% — lowest in asingle daysince late November. That lower-than-usual figure came just days after Connecticut reported its highestsingle-day positivity ratesince May Thestate’sseven-day average currentlystands at 7%, downslightly from recent days butstill near its peak level.“The numbers are bouncing around a little bit,” Lamontsaid. “What we know is that outside issafer than inside and there’s nothing more important than wearing a mask.”Connecticut currently has 1,118 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, down 30 from Wednesday. Hospitalizations have remained mostly flat for about a month now,since peaking in mid-December. Additionally, Lamont reported 17 new coronavirus-linked deaths Thursday, following 87 on Wednesday. Thestate has now recorded 6,553 COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic, including 264 over the past week. The USs has nowseen more than 23 million COVID-19 cases and 386,996 deaths, according to the Coronavirus Resource Center at Johns Hopkins University. High-capacity vaccinesites coming to Rentschler Field, othersitesIn addition to an existing vaccinesite at the Connecticut Convention Center,state officials announced Thursday that thestate will organize two additional high-capacitysites: one at Rentschler Field and one in Shelton. Josh Geballe, thestate’s chief operating officer,said thesites are taking only asmall number of patients currently but that they help ensure thestate’s preparedness for future phases of vaccine rollout.“We’re limited for the foreseeable doses by the number of doses that we get in,” Geballesaid. “What we’re doing issetting up these masssites in anticipation [of more doses becoming available].”Emily Brindley can be reached atebrindley@courant.com.",2,2,Hartford Courant
610,‘Last responders’ brace for COVID deaths,-3.67,45.33,https://montanafreepress.org/2020/12/24/last-responders-brace-for-covid-deaths/,https://adfontesmedia.com/montana-free-press-bias-and-reliability/,2020-12-12,15,"They watched as New York hospitals and funeral homes marshaled refrigerated trucks tostore bodies. More than 600 bodies of people who died in thespring COVIDsurge remain in freezer trucks on the Brooklyn waterfront because officials can’t find next of kin, or relatives are alsosick or unable to pay for burial. People like Dr. Robert Kurtzman, Montana’s chief medical examiner, took heed. Lastspring, he worked with funeral directors and others tostudy thestate’s morgue capacity. After looking at COVID projections, thestate arranged with the Montana National Guard to have 13 refrigeratedsemi trucks ready to dispatch anywhere in thestate.“We are already in a precarious position, and the projections present ascary proposition,” hesaid. “We need to be ready for worst-casescenarios.”Chad Towner, CEO of StreetJoseph Health System, which has two hospitals in northern Indiana, ordered two refrigeratedsemitrailers in April. For a time, things were relatively quiet. But the pandemic has hit.“I told a friend who was a COVID doubter that if my wife needed a bed today, I could not arrange one. That’s the diresituation we face here,” Townersaid. “All our competitors in the area are in thesame boat, and we’re working together instead of competing.”“Normally a funeral is a two- or three-day process with hundreds of people. Now there is no time to tellstories about the person, not a lot ofsinging and praying. I’ve been to three recent COVID funerals, and everything was at the burialsite, with maybe 30 peoplesitting in their cars and not getting out.”Although the freezer trucks have not yet been needed, he worries that thesharp increase in cases, and those anticipated from Thanksgiving travel and gatherings, will make last-resort measures necessary.“We recently had four deaths in one afternoon,”said Towner. “A priest approached me tosay he’d been asked to provide last rites to three patients in one hour.”Moving bodies from the hospital morgue is aslower process than usual, hesaid. “Morticians and funeral homes are overflowing as well. Families that aresick or quarantined at the time of the loved one’s death often can’t work with us on a transfer, meaning bodies are here longer. The entiresystem isstressed to the tipping point,”said Towner. Private enterprise has created asolution forsmaller communities. In Bozeman, Montana, aspecialty truck company is retrofitting trailers that can be pulled by an SUV or a pickup. Acela Truck Co. has alreadysold hundreds of the pull-behind refrigerated units created in response to the COVID pandemic. They range from 9 to 53 feet and have racks that each hold four body trays. “We’re very busy and have orders in all of the lower 48states,”said CEO David Ronsen. Acela has partnered with Mopec, a Wisconsin autopsysupply company, to helpsell and deliver the new product. Billings Clinic in Montana also anticipated a flood of deaths lastspring by reserving asemitrailer for delivery, if needed. The clinic, which has just two morguespaces, has dealt with 80 COVID deaths, includingseven on the weekend after Thanksgiving. Chief Nursing Officer Laurie Smithsaid the hospital is at capacity, despite adding beds by converting officespace and building an addition. The hospital, which currently has 335 beds,so far has handled the additional deaths through whatshe calls a “sad partnership” with funeral homes, which have been quickly picking up bodies the hospital cannotstore. The hospital does its best to allow relatives tosay goodbye, but that often involves family membersstanding at an interior window outside the patient’s room, using a computer tablet to communicate their last words. That is just one way in which the rituals of grieving have changed during COVID Typical congregational hymns are pretty much gone, as are choirs.“We are using mostly recordings,sometimes asoloist,”said Spitzer. Funeral home directors who pride themselves onspending time comforting grieving familiessay they areso busy thatsome days they have to rush out from one funeral to begin the next one.“Families are being robbed of the whole funeral rite experience and losing thesupport of having friends and family around them,”said Shauna Kjos-Miotke of Fiksdal Funeral Home in Webster, South Dakota. Native communities have not only been among the hardest hit with COVID illnesses and deaths, but their grieving rituals have been among the mostseriously disrupted.“Normally a funeral is a two- or three-day process with hundreds of people,”said Josiah Hugs, a Crow tribal member who is the outreach coordinator for Billings Urban Indian Health and Wellness Center. “Now there is no time to tellstories about the person, not a lot ofsinging and praying. I’ve been to three recent COVID funerals, and everything was at the burialsite, with maybe 30 peoplesitting in their cars and not getting out.”COVID has even affected body disposal. Asurveyby the National Funeral Directors Association found that more than half of their members reported increased cremation rates due to COVID The NFDA also found that half its members have clients who have postponedservices to hold a memorial later. In the largely impoverished Hidalgo County, a Texas border area, county officials began using COVID funds to help cover the burial costs forstruggling families. Then they begin hearing of the emotional costs, including the anguish of video conferenced funerals,such as for a family that had lost a husband, a mother and an aunt in one month. They wondered if there would be interest in an alternative way to honor the dead.“Wesent out asocial media post asking if anyone wanted to post a photograph of a relative who died of COVID if we created a county memorial page,”said countyspokesperson Carlos Sanchez, who himself barelysurvived a bout with COVID in July. “Within minutes, we got more than 20 emails. Severalsent photos of multiple relatives. They want them to be remembered.”(Kaiser Health News) is a nonprofit newsservice covering health issues.

At one point, activist and2017honoree Ashlee Marie Preston, who helped organize the protest, thanked those whoshowed up to lend their voices andsupport:“I thank all of you for being here insupport of the employees at Netflix of trans and non-binary experience and their allies and accomplices. I think the message that many people expect for us to deliver today is one around ‘why it’s important to cancel Dave Chappelle.’ Andso I want to make it very clear, this isn’t an instance of cancel culture because I’ve invited Dave Chappelle to have transformative dialogue with us on multiple occasions and he has made it clear that it is not of interest to him. So just to be clear, this isn’t cancel culture but an avoidance of accountability when we’ve invited you to be a part of the repair that it takes to not only hear a culture, but to move all of us forward.”She later added, “We’re up against the emergence of hate economy. And there is this manipulation of algorithmicscience that distorts the way that we perceive ourselves and others. And I think that companies like Netflix, Facebook, and Instagram, they play into it, and they monetize on it. Andso I think that this is important toshow up today.”A counter-protester who was present as a “supporter of comedy” explained: “We are protesting this walkout. They have the right to do it, but we have the right tostand up for Dave Chappelle and his freedom of expression. This boils down to equality, and if people want equality they [have] to be put on thesame level as anybody else. Comedians are equal opportunity destroyers. You can’t pick and choose who you’re going to make fun of.”In addition to the walkout, thosesame employees and allies provided thestreamer with a firm list of demands via a press release obtained byThe Verge, which centered around actionablesteps towards “content investment, employee relations andsafety, and harm reduction.”Significantly, a demand to pull thespecial off of thestreaming giant was not included on that list.“We are employees, but we are members, too. We believe that this Company can and must do better in our quest to entertain the world, and that the way forward must include more diverse voices in order to avoid causing more harm. The Trans* ERG [Employee Resource Group] looks forward to working with the Company to make this a better, more entertaining place for us all,” the document concluded. Moreover, at thesame time the protest was taking place, Chappelle himself was performing the last leg of his weeklong UK tour at London’s Eventim Apollo theater. While no cellphones, cameras or recording devices were allowed, many in attendance confirmed to Varietythat the comedian mentioned he would plan a 10-city US tourshould be removed from Netflix, though as previouslystated, there are no plans to doso at this time. Ahead of the protest, Netflixshared astatement insupport of its employees and allies,saying: “We value our trans colleagues and allies, and understand the deep hurt that’s been caused. We respect the decision of any employee who chooses to walk out, and recognize we have much more work to do both within Netflix and in our content.”",0,0,The Root

Brad Horrigan / Hartford CourantIn this April file photo, a man isswabbed by a Hartford HealthCare medical professional for a COVID-19 test. Earlier this month, Christopher J Duff decided to get tested for COVID-19. He wasn’t feeling great and his two-year-oldson was running a fever.“Mysymptoms were being extremely tired,some body aches and feeling very warm,”said Duff, who is 39 andserves on the Rocky Hill town council. “I’ve been working from home,social distancing and wearing a mask out in public,so I didn’t think I was likely to have COVID, but I wanted to rule it out and makesure, especially because we have a toddler and an infant.”The testing process, conducted at a CVS Minute Clinic in Rocky Hill, took a total of 30 minutes. Duff’s wait for the results took eight days. Across thestate and the nation, wait times forsome COVID-19 test results arestretching to a week or longer. Timely results are key to containing thespread of the virus, public health officialssay. The longer a person is unaware of a positive test, the more time they have to infect others and lengthy delays can hamper contact tracing and other efforts to control outbreaks.“Five days is an eternity in COVID time,” Governor Ned Lamontsaid Tuesday. “You don’t know what’s happened…in the five days it’s taking you to get that response.”In addition to causingstress and disruption for individuals, experts fear the rising backlog of test kits could jeopardize efforts to control the virus and reopensociety.“We are concerned that the national demand for testing is causing longer wait times for test results,”said Dr. Deidre Gifford, acting commissioner of thestate Department of Public Health.“Anyone that has a known exposure to a COVID-positive individual or who hassymptomsshould be inself-quarantine until they have a negative test result,” Giffordsaid. “That’s how were going to contain thespread of this virus…people [should] remain isolated from others if there’s a chance they may be infected. It’s very important…as inconvenient as we understand that is, that individuals remain in quarantine.”The wait for test results has grown longer in recent weeks, with national labs processing aspike insamples from Arizona, Texas, California and other hotspots. CVS Health attributed the “extremely high demand for tests” to rising caseloads in much of the nation.“This has caused backlogs for our lab partners and is delaying their processing of patientsamples,”said Tara Burke, aspokeswoman for CVS Health. “Currently, due to these factors, it may take 6-10 days for people to receive their results and, insome instances, our lab partners may take even longer to return results. Our lab partners are working hard to address this issue.”Withschools and businesses looking to reopen, demand for testing couldswell even more, putting additional pressure on an already overburdenedsystem, officialssay. Early in the pandemic, Connecticut contracted withseveral in-state laboratories, which agreed to process a certain number of tests and to turn around results as quickly as possible. In most cases, the in-state diagnostic centers are reporting results within 24 hours,said Josh Geballe, Governor Lamont’s chief operating officer. Thestate is currently in discussions withsome of those facilities to take on additional capacity to help compensate for the backlog at the national laboratories.“We’re working as much as we can with our local labs and…there we’re getting a quick turnaround, 24 hours or less,” Lamontsaid. “We’re doing as much as we can to move all the testing analysis right here in thestate of Connecticut and we’re not going to have that wait.”Quest Diagnostics, one of the nation’s largest labs,said it is trying to address the backlog. “At Quest Diagnostics, we are doing everything we can to bring more COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing to patients at this critical time,” the companysaid in astatement. Last week, the Federal Food and Drug Administration allowed Quest to pool itssamples. Under thisscenario, foursamples can be tested at once; if the results are negative, all of those individuals are COVID-free. If it’s positive, the foursamples areseparated and tested individually to determine which is infected. Even assteps are taken tospeed up the process,somestate residents continue to face long waits for results. John Silver went to a mobile testingsite in New Britain on July 9 for a COVID-19 test. He and his wife hadseveral trips planned and wanted to makesure they weren’t infected before theyset off. His results arrived nine days later, on July 18, and his wife’s arrived on July 20; both were negative. Although they had nosymptoms and no reason tosuspect they weresick, they isolated for the first two days following the test.“But nine days?”said Silver, who is 43 and lives in Farmington. “Just too much time.”Christopher Duff’s test was also negative.“Everyone’ssymptoms lifted before we got results back,” hesaid, “although I wasstill concerned I could have it and be asymptomatic.”After eight days of waiting, “it was a relief,” he added.",2,2,Hartford Courant

Zinke won two terms representing thestate’s current at-large district before leaving to join the Trump administration in 2017. He was the first Montanan toserve in a presidential Cabinet, but heresigned in the face of ethics investigations afterserving less than two years. In all, the formersecretary came under at least 15 different investigations before leaving in January 2019. Paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission indicates that the Helena-based campaign committee, Zinke for Congress, is geared toward fundraising for what will become Montana’s 2nd District.

Lorna Kuney, who was listed as the committee treasurer and records custodian on the FEC paperwork, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Republicanstrategist involved in House racessaid it is not too early to lay the groundwork for a campaign, but other candidates are likely waiting to find out more information about where and how competitive the new district will be. Despite Democratic Governor Steve Bullockspending $49 million last fall on a run for Senate, he and his party’s House candidate wereshut out, and Montana voters went for President Donald Trump over Joe Biden, 57 percent to 41 percent. At least one of the two newly drawnseats is expected to besolid GOP territory in 2022. But there’s a possibility the newseat could be competitive, depending on how the boundaries are drawn by an independent commission, appointed mostly bystate lawmakers.[]It is also unclear whether Montanans will penalize Zinke for his record at the Interior Department. In October 2018, about two months before Zinke left his post, the department’s inspector general referred an inquiry it had launched into Zinke’s conduct to the Justice Department. That probe centered on a land agreement Zinke reached with an executive of oil fieldservices giant Hallibutron in Whitefish, Mont., his hometown. Also that October, the inspector general found that Zinkebroke federal rules by allowing family members to travel with him in government vehicles. Zinke also asked if his wife, Lola, could join the department as a volunteer, the IGsaid in a report.“He denied that his intention in making this request wasso that his wife could travel with him in an official capacity, which would have eliminated the requirement to reimburse the Government for her travel,” the reportsaid. “Ultimately, the employees advised him that making her a volunteer could be perceived negatively, andshe did not become one.”The inspector general also found that Zinke took asecurity detail with him on a vacation to Greece and Turkey, costing taxpayers $25,000. In April 2018, the IG cleared Zinke of misconduct in connection with travel arrangements, including on chartered and military planes. A former Navy SEAL, Zinkeshowed up to his first day of work assecretary on a horse.

Zinke, whom the Senate confirmed by a 68-31 vote in March 2017, frequently used the phrase “energy dominance” to describe his efforts at the department to ease environmental regulations, and he backed a Trump administration move to allow offshore oil-and-gas drilling off every coastalstate in the country, including in Florida, despite bipartisan opposition. Trump issued a moratorium in August last year to freeze oil and gas drilling in Florida, Georgia and South Carolina. The Interior Department unveiled Zinke’s official portrait in December.

Responding to CNN’s Jim Acosta question of whether Tucker Carlson’s hugely popularshow on Fox News would have prevented the eradication of dangerous diseases in the US had it been around decades ago, Fauci appeared to agree.“Do you think we could have eradicated polio or defeated the measles if you had Fox News night after night warning people about these vaccine issues that are, you know, bunk?”Acosta asked Fauci during an interview on Saturday.

The last wild case globally was in 1977. Shortly after 9/11, President George W Bush orderedsmallpox vaccinations for 500,000 US troops in high-risk parts of the world and front line healthcare workers who were willing to get vaccinated. However, at the time there were concerns about possible life-threateningside effects of the jab, with the New York Timesreportingthat“the decision had been difficult for President Bush, given the probability thatsome people would die of the vaccine’sside effects.”According to a 2003 modelstudy, published in theNew England Journal of Medicine, if 60 percent of the US population was vaccinated, this would be beneficial in an unlikelyscenario of a national bio terrorist attack with thesmallpox virus, but otherwise would have causedsome 482 deaths nationally. The US has been polio-freesince 1979, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) crediting“asuccessful vaccination program”with two vaccines introduced in the mid-1950s and early 1960s for uprooting the disease in the US Worldwide, polio cases have plummeted dramaticallysince the late 1980s, with the World Health Organization reporting only 22 cases in 2017. And while polio has been almost eradicated,save for Afghanistan and Pakistan, where it remains epidemic, the effectiveness of the vaccination campaign was called into question in light of a 2019 WHO report voicing concerns that more polio cases were attributed to a cheap oral vaccine than to a wild virus.",1,1,RT

616,Lockdowns Come from a Place of Privilege,13.33,29.67,https://thelibertyloft.com/lockdowns-come-from-a-place-of-privilege/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-loft-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-05,15,"Charlotte, NC — The COVID-19 pandemic and the ensuing lock downs are making life quite difficult for a lot of people, andsome of the hardest hit are the poor and marginalized. There are immigrants who have been laid off from their jobs andsingle mothers who can’t access childcare. There are elderly people who can’t get thesupport they need and people with mental illnesses who arestruggling with the lack of routine. One of the biggest challenges for people on the margins is that, all too often, they are invisible tosociety at large. Issues likepoverty, addiction, mental illness and domestic abuse don’t often make the news,so it’s easy to forget that these hardships are an ever-present reality for millions of people. Champions of the lock downs tend to be especially oblivious to these hardships, and their preoccupation with case numbers and COVID deaths has caused them to blithely dismiss people’s concerns. Some have even castigated protesters for raising their concerns, brushing them off with the callous retort, “it’s not all about you.”Another way people have trivialized these hardships is with the phrase “juststay home.” To many, thatslogan mayseem innocuous. But, for those living on the margin, that word “just” cuts like a knife. The fact is that for a myriad of reasons, many of themsimply can’t afford tostay home, and talking as if they can only underscores the extent of ourshortsightedness. In many cases, the myopia displayed by the most vocal proponents of the lock downs likelystems from the fact that they themselves have not been impacted nearly as much as those who are underprivileged. Politicians like tosay “we’re all in this together,” but in reality, there isn’t really much “we” about it. Instead, there are two,starkly different lock downs playing out. The first kind of lock down is the one experienced by the “lockdown elite.” More akin to a romanticized inconvenience, this kind of lock down is characterized by working remotely, chatting on Zoom calls and ordering Uber Eats. Thesecond kind of lock down is the one experienced by the lower class. For many, it means being unemployed or underemployed, and potentially putting themselves at a higher risk of infection. These lock downs are also leading to highersuicide ratesand damaging an entire generation of kids whose psychological well-being depends on richsocial interactions. But even that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Drug overdoses have alsospiked due to the enforced isolation, as well as domestic violence rates. The dramatic rise in unemployment has also led to as urge in the number of Americans who can’t afford food. And on top of all that,senior citizens in particular have faced unimaginablesuffering. In contrasting these two experiences, the privilege of the lock down advocates becomes apparent. The “lockdown elite” areshielded from the trials of the marginalized,so it’s nosurprise that they downplay theseverity of the problems or deny that they even exist. The natural consequence of this circumstance is as obvious as it is uncomfortable. We need to “check our privilege.” Now to besure, that phrase has been abused a lot, but the kernel of truth in it is that being protected from adversity can make us oblivious to the impacts of the policies we endorse. So “checking our privilege” in this case is about humbly recognizing the limits of our knowledge. We need to be particularly wary of arrogantly thinking that we can impose asweeping, one-size-fits-all approach that will be generally beneficial. Aside from being paternalistic, the problem with this mindset is that it disregards the diverse range of individual experiences, needs, and risks that people are facing. A good example of this mindset can beseen in the mainstream discourse, which has revolved around questionssuch as “whatshouldschools do” or “whatshould churches do.” For many of us it can be tempting to picksides on these topics. But rather than weigh in on these debates, I think we would be better to insist that these are the wrong questions. Decisions about how to manage riskshouldn’t be top-down and universal. They need to be made independently by each local institution. Of course, it’s reassuring to imagine that the government is looking out for us and that their experts will make good decisions, but it’s important that we resist the allure of central planning. Bureaucrats,scientists and journalists will all pretend to have the answers, but the truth is that they don’t. What’s more, we can do an awful lot of harm when we impose our “solutions” on people whose contexts we don’t understand. In light of this, truly “checking our privilege” means rejecting the top-downsolutions thatstem from our ignorance and hubris. Rather than assuming we know what’s best for others, we need to embrace a multifaceted, localized approach that empowers individuals to make their own choices. Invariably, many will object that ending the lock downs in the name of economic expediency is rather imprudent, but this objection is missing the bigger picture. Ending the lock downs isn’t about ignoring the very real risks we’re facing. Rather, it’s about taking responsibility for our own well-being and allowing others to take responsibility for theirs. Even more, it’s about recognizing that people’s livelihoods are not “non-essential”, and that our privilege often blinds us to the repercussions of our actions. Because here’s what you need to understand about the marginalized people bemoaning these lockdowns. They’re not greedy. They’re desperate. And you would be too if you were in theirshoes.

618,Trump fans are hoping he’ll commute Pollard’s sentence – The Forward,-0.67,39.67,https://forward.com/news/458462/the-timing-is-right-for-trump-to-help-jonathan-pollard-convicted-spy-move/,https://adfontesmedia.com/forward-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-13,25,"Supporters and friends of Jonathan Pollard, the American Jew whoserved Israel as aspy, are hoping that before he leaves office, President Donald Trump will enable Pollard to emigrate to the Jewishstate by commuting hissentence or pardoning him. Pollard pleaded guilty in 1986 to conspiracy to commit espionage in connection with providing Israeli contacts with hundreds of classified documents he had obtained as a civilian intelligencespecialist for the US Navy. Afterserving 30 years in prison, he began 15 years of parole, whose conditionsstipulate that he not leave the country. He also has a curfew and the government monitors his computer use. However, Pollard’s parole comes up for review by the US Department of Justice every five years, and his five-year anniversary is on November 21,saidDavid Schoen,a defense attorney not connected to the Pollard case who practices nationwide and has worked on cases involving governmentsecurity clearance. Eliot Lauer, Pollard’s lawyer, could not be reached for comment. Pollard and his wife are eager to learn the government’s plans, especially because he longs to move to Israel and has already become an Israeli citizen, but they haven’t an inkling of what the Justice Department might do,said a friend of the family who talked with them Thursday morning butspoke on condition of anonymity. If the Justice Department makes no changes to his parole arrangements, Pollard could appeal to Trump for a commutation of hissentence, or a pardon. He could also appeal to the department itself, but going to Trump is thestrongerstrategy, Schoensaid. Pollard’s allies are already trying to involve Trump, beloved by many Jews for moves he’s made related to Israel,such as moving the US embassy to Jerusalem. In 2017, Trump commuted the 27-yearsentence of another high-profile Jewish prisoner, Sholom Rubashkin, the former CEO of the largest kosher meat-processing plant.“I think there is a good chance – based on his track record – that Trump may dosomething,”said Farley Weiss, president of the National Council of Young Israel. “There is no question that he has been the best president for Israel of any president in history.”Weiss asked deceased Sen. John McCain, a Republican of Arizona, to help Pollard leave prison on parole after he hadserved 30 years of his life prisonsentence. Now he’s tapping his contacts again on Pollard’s behalf. Jewishsupporters of both Rubashkin and Pollard claimed that theirsentences were excessive. Farley called Pollard’ssentence a “miscarriage of justice.”Just before he wassentenced, Pollard tried to cast himself as a kind of Jewish patriot, the Forward reported, trying to help Israel by compensating for the American intelligence community’s failings. Others, including the Forward,have argued against leniency for Pollard.“Jonathan Pollard is not a Jewish martyr,”wroteNew Republic editor Martin Peretz.“He is a convicted espionage agent whospied on his country for both Israel and Pakistan (!) — aspy, moreover, who got paid for his work.

620,Op-Ed: Don’t exempt religious objectors from vaccine mandates,-5.67,35.0,https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2021-07-23/religious-exemption-mandatory-vaccination-policies-constitution,https://adfontesmedia.com/la-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,25,"Policies requiring vaccination against COVID-19 need not include, andshould not include, exceptions for those who have religious objections to vaccinations. Many universities, including the University of California, are requiring vaccination for allstudents,staff and faculty returning to campus. Many employers, public and private, are doingso as well. These policies are essential to protect public health. The virulent Delta variant of the coronavirus has made it imperative to ensure vaccination of as many people as possible. Unfortunately, though, many of these policies have an exception for those who have a religious objection to vaccination. These are neither required by the law nor are they desirable as a matter of policy because they make it possible for anyone to circumvent the vaccine mandate. The UC’s mandatory vaccination policy, for example, has an exception for those who object on religious grounds. Itstates that this is because the law requiressuch an exemption,declaring:“The University is required by law to offer reasonable accommodations to ... employees who object to vaccination based on theirsincerely-held religious belief, practice, or observance.”This issimply wrong as a matter of law. No law requiressuch a religious exemption. In terms of free exercise of religion under the 1st Amendment, the Supreme Court ruled more than 30 years ago in Employment Division vs Smith that the Constitution does not require exceptions to general laws for religious beliefs. In an opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia, the courtsaid that as long as a law is neutral, not motivated by a desire to interfere with religion and of general applicability to all individuals, it cannot be challenged based on free exercise of religion. In June, in Fulton vs City of Philadelphia, the court reaffirmed this legal test. Laws that require vaccination are the epitome of a neutral law of general applicability: a requirement that applies to everyone and that was not motivated by a desire to interfere with religion. Even if this were notso, the government can infringe on religious freedom if its action is necessary to achieve a compelling interest. Stopping thespread of a deadly communicable disease is obviously a compelling interest and vaccinations are the best way to reach that goal. No one, in practicing his or her religion, has a constitutional right to endanger others. Indeed, a number ofstates, before COVID-19, created mandates for children to be vaccinated against other communicable diseases without making exemptions for religious beliefs. Without exception, the lower courts have upheld these mandates as constitutional. Nor do federal employment discrimination laws require a religious exception for employees. In the 1977 case Trans World Airlines vs Hardison, the Supreme Courtsaid that employers do not have to bear more than a “de minimus” cost in accommodating employees’ religious beliefs. Vaccine exemptions could impose asignificant cost on employers in terms of illness and therefore clearly are not required. Religious exemptions, like in the University of California policy, are for those with “sincerely held religious beliefs.” But how can this possibly be determined?The Supreme Court hassaid that religious beliefs are personal and it does not matter whether they are in accord with the teachings and dictates of a particular faith. Under this broad principle, any person could get a vaccination exemption merely bystating that he orshe has a religious objection against it. Such an easy opt-out could make the mandate illusory. That is why the only way to have a meaningful vaccination requirement is to apply it to everyone — except those for whom vaccination is not medically advisable. As people return to the workplace and to campuses thespread of COVID-19 remains a great danger, especially with the highly transmissible Delta variant circulating. The unvaccinated not only endanger themselves and other unvaccinated people, but also those who cannot get the vaccine for medical reasons. And now, there are growing reports of breakthrough infections of fully vaccinated individuals. Universities and employers have the legal right to makesure that everyone is vaccinated. And they have the moral duty to protect health and lives. Erwin Chemerinsky is dean of the UC Berkeley School of Law and a contributing writer to Opinion.

Thoseself reportingsymptoms of long COVIDsay they are working longer hours than before and in general have higher levels of anxiety. Some feel like they do not have anyone to talk to about theirsymptoms,according to the latest Opinions and Lifestyle Survey from the Office of National Statistics (ONS). There are twostages to the condition that is clinically diagnosed as long COVID, according to the British Lung foundation. Symptoms that last for between four and 12 weeks is known as Ongoing Symptomatic COVID-19. Symptoms that last for more than 12 weeks — and are unexplained by another diagnosis — are referred to as Post COVID Syndrome. Symptoms reported bysufferers can vary in their type andseverity and include breathlessness, fatigue and aches and pains among a variety of others. For the ONSsurvey, 39,268 UK adults aged 16 and above were polled to understand the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on Britishsociety between April 7 and June 13. In total 6.2% of adultssaid that they had experiencedsymptoms of long COVID — that included 2.6% whosaid they were unsure. A tenthsaid that they had tested positive, but had notsuffered any chronicsymptoms. Thesurvey coveredself-reportedsymptoms of long Covid, rather than those whose conditions had been clinically diagnosed. Of those who reported long-termsymptoms, 44%said that it had affected their day-to-day work either through their ability to do their job or through other factors like having to work from home. Some 30%said that this impact had been negative. There has been an increase all around, with 36%saying they had not experienced long COVID but had felt the impact of the coronavirus on their working lives.

A quarter feel like they have no one to talk to about the condition. A further 25%say they feel like a burden on others.

624,"The MAGA Riot in Washington Was the Natural Culmination of Donald Trump’s Influence — And, Just Maybe, Its Swan Song",-19.17,34.0,https://variety.com/2021/tv/news/the-uprising-in-washington-was-the-natural-culmination-of-donald-trumps-influence-and-just-maybe-its-swan-song-1234880114/,https://adfontesmedia.com/variety-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-06,21,"As corrosive and unsettling as the images of lawlessness from the US Capitol have been today, there’s a twist of fate at their coreso brutally ironic it can make your headspin. When the MAGA protesters, turning off their incendiary right-wing TV and Internet channels and getting off their couches,set out for Washington to foment what Joe Strummer 44 years ago called a “white riot,” they probably didn’t expect to be competing with the headline “Democrats Retake the US Senate.” Because, of course, few observers we rethe game-changing referendum we got from the two Senate races in Georgia. The grand paradox is that you can link thatseismic pair of Democratic wins directly toDonald Trump’s 10 weeks of drum-beating over his increasingly destructive fantasy of election fraud. Why? Because his descent into total demagogic lo opiness revealed his naturesostarkly it turned voters off? Number Because enough Republicans were actually brainwashed intohim. They didn’t bother toshow up for a “rigged” election, thereby making Trump a victim of his ownsuccess. Since today’s insurrection was all about the issue of election fraud, the Georgia vote lent the events an irony of extraordinary bite. And what it indicated is that the whole “Bidenstole the election!” issue, as perilous andscary as it has oftenseemed, has proved in the end to be the ultimate political orgy of hot air: a great deal ofsmoke without fire. The far-right uprising in Washington today was framed, in the minds of those who participated in it, as a Boston Tea Party/burning-of-the-Reichstag defining moment. But it felt more like the Last Gasp of Trumpism heard round the world. Which isn’t to deny that it was disturbing as hell: not just a mobscene, not just a protest laced with anarchy, but a messy, furious, middle-class-yob-posing-as-rebel attack on the rule of law. Yet even as the images of the MAGA faithfulswarming thesteps of the US Capitol, or climbing its walls like ascruffy medieval horde in windbreakers,seared themselves into our national memory play with ashock value that was undeniable, in another way the protest, the riot, the violent tantrum — whatever you want to call it — had a weird “OK, let’s finally do this!” inevitability about it. The right wing in this country has been nattering on about “civil war” eversince that person at a Tea Party rally held up asign thatsaid “Keep the government’s hands off my Medicare!” Today’s mini high-concept rehearsal for civil war was the natural culmination of what Trump and his enablers have been egging hissupporters on to do forsome time — from Trump’sshout-out to the Proud Boys in the first presidential debate, when he asked them to “stand back andstand by,” to Rudy Giuliani’s exhortations to “trial by combat” this morning. Yet it wasn’t just Trump’s winking appeals to lawlessness that incited today’s chaotic action. The nature of those who live in an alternate reality is that there’ssomething essentially about their entire beliefsystem. No,Joe Bidendidn’tsteal the election; the truth of his victory has been ratified by everystate and dozens of courts. And no, the Democratic Party is not controlled by a cadre of elites who run a childsex-trafficking ring. But if you believe the former (which most Trumpsupporters do), or if you believe the latter (the central article of faith in QAnon, the online cult that’s now moved to the center of the Trump cult), you’re not living in the real world. And that means that politics has become, for you, a kind of media-fedshadow play, a dance of illusions dressed up as “news.” “Drain theswamp” isn’t a policy; it’s a fairy-tale metaphor posing as policy. When your political beliefs are mired in the world of illusion, there may be aspecial need to transform those beliefs intosomething physical and tangible, to prove — to yourself! — that you’re not just another Fox Newssimulation-game ditto-head but a badass who means what yousay. An assault on the Capitol Building is a metaphor that can feel “real” because it looks just likesomething yousaw in a Gerard Butler movie. Is the insurrection wesaw today the beginning or the end ofsomething? Those on the right will want tosee it as the beginning. They reject the very foundation of the Biden presidency (that thing called voting, otherwise known as democracy), andso today was the day theystood up, climbed the walls, and declared that theystood forsomething else: power at any cost. But the flipside of power, or at least unseemly displays of it, is impotence. And that,sealed by the amazing Democratic triumph in Georgia, may wind up being thesignature quality of the post-presidency of Donald Trump, and all those who’ll now follow him like lemmings off the cliff of his own ego. It’s fashionable tosay that Trump will continue to wield extraordinary influence. But I would argue that the last two months, fueled by his pathological obsession with election fraud, have changed the Trump brand. For a long time, Trumpsupporters could at least that hestood for things likestanding up to China orshouting down political correctness. But now Trumpstands, first and foremost, for the idea that he’s “still really the president,” and that Joe Biden is occupying the office under false pretenses. That’s not just politically outrageous; it’s nuts. And that’s what the armchair anarchists in Washingtonstood for today: notsimply trashing America but going through the looking glass to do it. They’ve left us with a lasting image of what it looks like when political action loses its mind.",1,1,Variety

There was no immediate word from Joe Biden, who debated with Mr Trump on Tuesday night in a noisy, unappealing event during which the president repeatetedly talked over the former vice president.

627,Ron DeSantis leans into mask-mandate fights as Covid cases soar in Florida,-15.67,34.33,https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/20/politics/ron-desantis-masks-florida-schools-covid-19/index.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/cnncom-bias-and-reliability/,2021-08-20,24,"As the number of new coronavirus cases in hisstatesoars, Florida Governor Ron DeSantisis betting that an aggressive campaign against mandatory mask-wearinginschools will harden the Republican base ahead of his expected re-election bid next year – and make him a GOPstar nationwide as the party’s 2024 presidential primary comes into view. The gamble appears to be paying off – for now. DeSantis is a Fox News darling and relishes the intensifying backlash from Democrats, especially President Joe Biden, who has criticized the governor and other Republicanstate executives for rejecting recommendations from public health experts and officials. But national attention does not always translate into political gain at home and could potentiallyseed new complications for DeSantis by the time Floridians go to the polls next year to cast their verdict on his first term. For now, the Delta variant’ssurge in Florida is a wild card for the governor, who has refused to ramp up mitigation efforts even as the pandemic threatens thestate’s tourism industry and – withschools opening – thesafety of youngstudents, their families, educators and otherstaff inside the buildings. The fates of elected officials in both parties during midterm elections are typically tied to the popularity of thesitting president. If Biden – and, morespecifically, Biden’s brand of moderation that has beenso popular in thesuburbs – is on the up come November 2022, DeSantis could be in for a trickier campaign than most anticipate. If not, cutting a divisive figure could put the governor on a glide path to a relatively narrow, but comfortable re-election. That logic appears to be influencing DeSantis as hespreads his message across the country, whether on cable or at events like one in Utah in late July, where he ridiculed the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention over their new mask guidance – “Did you not get the CDC’s memo?,” he asked the mostly unmasked crowd to laughter. “I don’tsee you complying” – and pledged to take a hard line against other measures.“It is very important that wesay, unequivocally, no to lockdowns, no toschool closures, no to restrictions and no to mandates,” DeSantis told the conservative gathering. Florida Board of Education orders Broward, Alachua counties to allow mask opt-out in 48 hours orstart losing fundingDeSantis is keen to play to friendly crowds and he appears mindful of where he picks his highest profile fights. His recent mask clashes have mostly centered in counties andschool districts where, politically, he has the least to lose – Democraticstrongholds that rejected him during his run for governor in 2018. Hillsborough and Miami-Dade, Florida’s largest county, both voted overwhelmingly for Democratic nominee Andrew Gillum nearly three years ago, when DeSantis won his first term by a little more than 32,000 votes, or less than one-half of 1 percentage point. School districts in those counties have takensteps in defiance of the governor. Hillsborough County Public Schools responded to aspike in Covid-19 infections and exposures by putting in place a 30-day mask mandate, and theschool board in Miami-Dade voted to require face coverings in classrooms,setting up another round of conflict with DeSantis and topstate officials who have threatened tosanction dissenters. DeSantisspokeswoman Christina Pushaw argued that rather than the governor being keen to pick fights in areas where he might have already lacked politicalsupport, DeSantis issimply carrying out the law hesigned in late June, which effectively bannedschools from implementing mask mandates without parental opt outs – and that partisan politics might be influencing theschool boards’ positions.“Due to the lack of empirical data tosupport forced masking of children, which isn’t even recommended at all in many European countries, it is hard to understand why theseschool boards would willingly violate the law,” Pushawsaid in an email. “They argue it’s for the health of children, but they can’t provide data tosupport that assertion. Therefore it does appear to be political on their part.”Public health experts, including at the CDC,strongly encourage mask-wearing as a useful tool against thespread of Covid-19.“Community mask wearingsubstantially reduces transmission ofsevere acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus in 2 ways. First, masks prevent infected persons from exposing others to SARS-CoV-2 by blocking exhalation of virus-containing droplets into the air,” according to an article in the Journal of the American Medical Association. “Second, masks protect uninfected wearers. Masks form a barrier to large respiratory droplets that could land on exposed mucous membranes of the eye, nose, and mouth.”Hillsborough and Miami-Dadesquared up with DeSantis on thesame day Biden, in aspeech from the White House, revealed that he had directed his Education Department to use its power to potentially overrulestate executives preventing local jurisdictions from making their own masking rules. Biden did not mention DeSantis by name, but he called out “some politicians” for “trying to turn publicsafety measures – that is, children wearing masks inschool – into political disputes for their own political gain.”“We are not going tosit by as governors try to block and intimidate educators protecting our children,” Bidensaid,suggesting that that the administration could pursue legal action. Hours later, in a conversation with Fox News host Sean Hannity, DeSantis mocked the President and again previewed his 2022 – and, potentially, 2024 – campaign messages.“He is obsessed with having the government force kindergarten ers to wear masks all day inschool,” DeSantissaid. “In Florida, we believe that that’s the parents’ decision. Joe Biden thinks the federal governmentshould come and overrule the parents and force these young kids to wear these masks.”A day earlier, the Florida State Board of Education voted to recommend investigations intoschool officials in Alachua and Broward counties, which have acted in defiance of the governor’s ban on mandates. DeSantis lost Alachua, which voted to extend its mask mandate for 8 weeks on Tuesday, by more than 2 points in 2018. And in Broward, Gillum more than doubled DeSantis’ vote total, winning the county by a 68%-31% margin. Democratic candidates and Democratic-aligned groups are ringing alarm bells over thesituation in Florida and pinning the bulk of the blame for thestate’s dire circumstances – with more than 20,000 new Covid-19 cases being reported daily – on refusals by the governor and GOP lawmakers to allow proven mitigation measures even as cases climb among children. According tostatistics from the Florida Department of Health, there were 16,764 new cases among those under 12 years old (a cohort not yet eligible to be vaccinated) from August 6-12. That represented a positivity rate of 22.1%,slightly higher than thestate average. Floridians ages 12 to 19 years old accounted for nearly 15,000 new cases that week. Their positivity rate also exceeded thestate number, at 24.3% to 19.3% overall. Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist, a former Florida governor running to win back his old job, responded to thestate board’s decision, describing thestandoff as a clash between courageous local officials,some of whom have been threatened with firings, and a power-hungry DeSantis.“He is overstepping the boundaries of his office to enforce his deadly political agenda on our lives, leaving ourschool boards andsuperintendents to bravely do what’s right andstand up against him,” Cristsaid in astatement. “Governor DeSantis lacks the compassion and commonsense to get us out of this pandemic. I continue tostand with teachers, parents, andschool boards doing what’s right for ourstudents. We need a leader, not a dictator.”Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, the onlystatewide elected Democrat in Florida and another potential DeSantis challenger next year, has alsosharpened her attacks on the governor asshe touts a federal lawsuit arguing, in part, that bans on mask mandates are in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act.“These unconstitutional threats from DeSantis and (Florida Education Commissioner Richard) Corcoran aren’t about individual rights or freedom,” Friedsaid on Wednesday. “They’re about pandering to the most extreme voices in order toscore political points at the expense of your kids, your family.”But even as the Delta-powered Covid-19surgeshows fewsigns of abating as theschool yearswings into gear, DeSantis is, much in the vein of former President Donald Trump, only becoming morestrident – and undermining of real-world data andscience that proves the utility of masks.“Politicians want to force you to cover your face as a way for them to cover their own asses,” hesaid on Wednesday. “That’s just the truth. They want to be able tosay they are taking this on and they’re doing this, even though it’s not proven to be effective they want to continue to do it.”",1,1,CNN
628,Some Texas Democrats ready to walk as GOP digs in on voting,-5.0,45.0,https://apnews.com/article/joe-biden-government-and-politics-texas-voting-c05ff78698d843674ec917085f6cc6da,https://adfontesmedia.com/ap-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,25,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) — The possibility of Texas Democratsstaging asecond walkout to againstop one of America’s most restrictive new voting measures grew louder Saturday, as hundreds of people waited hours to rail against the GOP’s plan in the largest turnout this year at thestate Capitol. As Republicans made clear they intended this weekend to advance a new election bill — which would prohibit 24-hour polling places, ban drop boxes andstop drive-thru voting —some Democratswho broke quorum in May are now describing it as their best, if not only, option again. Texas is amongseveralstates with GOP-controlledstatehouses where Republicans have rushed to enactstrict voting laws in response to former President Donald Trump’s false claims that the 2020 election wasstolen from him. Asecond walkout by Texas Democrats would mark a high-stakes escalation of their efforts to deny Republicans a major priority, and in turn, put more pressure on President Joe Bidento act on voting at the federal level. Beto O’Rourke, the Democratic former Texas congressman who is considering challenging Republican Governor Greg Abbott in 2022,said he has already offered help,saying he was ready to raise money “literally to feed and house the legislators” if they go that route.“Should westick around? Hell no. For what?” Democraticstate Rep. Jarvis Johnsonsaid. “There’s nothing being done in earnest. There’s nothing be done with the utmost respect for one another.”For weeks, Democratic leaders in the Texas Househavesaid they are not ruling out another revolt, but have also expressed hope of weakening the bill during the 30-dayspecialsession. Johnson, however, believes a large number of his colleagues are ready to deny Republicans a quorum for asecond time, though most continuespeaking cautiously.“You may know my next move, but you can’tstop it. You never knew when Mike Tyson was going to throw the uppercut, but you knew he was going to throw it,” hesaid. Another walkout may merely buy more time: Abbott could keep calling more 30-dayspecialsessions until voting measures are passed. Paychecks for nearly 2,000 Capitolstaffers could also be on the line, because Abbott vetoed funding for the legislative branch following Democrats’ late-night walkout. He hassignaled he will restore that funding thissummer — if lawmakers are around to put a bill on his desk. Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the elected head of the governing body for the county where Houston is located,said Abbott was “extorting” lawmakers to get the legislation passed. Hidalgosaidshe was wouldsupport Democratic legislators breaking quorum again to block the bill’s passage.“It is very important to me to recognize voting rightsshould be above politics,” Hidalgosaid. “We can do that with all manner of issues, but not voting, not democracy.”The last time Texas Democrats left thestate to deny a quorum was 2003, when they decamped to Oklahoma and New Mexico to try to block new GOP-drawn voting maps. They were gone more a month, but ultimately, Republicans passed a new redistricting plan. On Saturday, both the House and Senate were expected to advance the revived voting bills, which no longer include two of the most contentious provisions: prohibiting Sunday morning voting, when many Black churchgoers go to the polls, and language that would have made it easier for a judge to overturn elections. Hundreds of opponents packed overflow rooms at the Capitol and waited for hours to testify. It was the biggest turnout against a bill this year in Texas, where COVID-19 concerns have dampened crowds. Republicanstate Sen. Bryan Hughes defended the election proposals as refining and improving the voting process, andsaid newly added provisions increase early voting hours and provide opportunities to fix rejected ballots.“Your ballot issacrosanct,” Hughessaid. “Everything else in the election processshould be bathed insunshine.”Nacal Tatesaidshe woke up at 4 a.m. to drive fromsuburban Dallas to Austin to testify against the bill, even though it meant missing her grandniece’s birthday party. She was joined by June Jenkins, president of an NAACP chapter in Collin County.“Hopefully the impact of what we do today will be worth thesacrifice of what we needed tosacrifice,” Jenkinssaid. “My compromise is to kill it.”Acacia Coronado is a corps member for the Associated Press/Report for America Statehouse News Initiative.

629,Kyrsten Sinema Pressure Campaign Goes Up in Arizona,-20.0,40.33,https://prospect.org/politics/kyrsten-sinema-pressure-campaign-goes-up-in-arizona/,https://adfontesmedia.com/american-prospect-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-05,25,"Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call via AP ImagesSen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) is under pressure tosupport filibuster reform in the Senate. Nearly the moment that votes were tallied in Georgia, formalizing Democratic control of the Senate, West Virginia Democrat Joe Manchin began to object: to $2,000stimulus checks—which even President Biden himself pledged to pass—to filibuster reform, to thesize of thestimulus package, to passing it via budget reconciliation. Manchin, who frequently voted with President Trump, wanted to make it clear that he would be a willing obstacle to the Democratic agenda, according to his own whims and fancies. Just a handful of days later, in aseries of media appearances both national and local, Manchin vocalized an openness to checks, to the biggerspending package, and to passing it without Republicansupport. He even wavered eversoslightly on the filibuster. What changed? Aseries of radiospots went up in thestate, paid for and produced by No Excuses PAC, a group founded by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez alums Corbin Trent and Saikat Chakrabarti and Justice Democrats co-founder Zack Exley. The ads identified Manchin as the obstructionstanding between West Virginians and desperately needed relief. PerThe Intercept’s Aída Chávez, Manchin was “getting pounded at home by a brutal radio ad.” And, not inconsequentially, he changed his tune. Now, No Excuses is launching itssecond pressure campaign, targeting intransigent Democraticsenator Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona. Sinema has gone to perhaps even greater lengths than Manchin toshowcase her willingness to be an obstacle, and grabsome of thatspotlight from Manchin as the foremost Democratic opponent of filibuster reform in the Senate. And unlike Manchin,she’s doing it from a purplestate Joe Biden won in 2020. The group is up with radio ads across thestate of Arizona, informing voters that theirsenator is one of Washington’s top obstructionists. It hammers Sinema not just on hersupport of the filibuster, but on the broad embrace of inaction that the filibuster necessitates. “Sheseems to think the Senate needs to do more talking and less doing,”said Trent, co-founder of the group and the voice-over artist on the adspot. “Countless hours of partisan bickering and back-and-forth, they don’t prevent one case of COVID, they don’tstop one death, they don’t create one job,” the ad asserts. “It’s time Kyrsten Sinemastood up for the people andstood against the filibuster.”The new ad is part of a multi-week multimedia campaign in Arizona. No Excuses has also taken out adspace in, thestate’s largest newspaper, to drive home the message. And this time, the messaging comes with a recruiting pitch: No Excuses is looking for candidates who could primary Sinema from the left when her term is up in 2024. Thestrategy is a new addition to Democratic politics, where it has not been commonplace to hit representatives back home for their work in Washington outside of an election cycle. While progressive primary challenges have pressured Democrats to move left in the House, the Senate, with itssix-year terms, is moresheltered from that threat. No Excuses is hoping thisstrategy will make the left-wing presence a more persistent one, and help facilitate primary challenges of moderates if need be. “We’ve gotta create a little political gravity on thatside of them,”said Trent. Sinema’sstubbornness is especially confounding, at least compared to Manchin, given the respective political contexts of theirstates. Manchin is one of the only Democrats left at any level in arguably the country’s reddeststate, one that has run away from Democrats at an astonishing pace. While Arizona can credibly be called purple, Joe Biden won thestate in November, and it nowsports Democrats in both of its Senateseats. Arizona’s fast-growing metropolitan areas and large Latino population, combined withsignificant organizing networks and popular movement groups, mean it’s astate where the progressive agenda has purchase now, and it will likely have even more in the future. Thestate recently legalized recreational marijuana and passed asubstantial tax increase on high earners via ballot measure. Sinema won in 2018, a wave election for Democrats, who rebuked Trumpism and overachieved all over the country. She beat extremely unpopular Republican Martha McSally, who went on to lose to Democrat Mark Kelly two years later for thestate’s other Senateseat. Sinema, a former Green Party member who then became a conservative Democratic vote in the House, portrayed herself in the campaign as an independent. But the notion that a maverick Democrat can only win in Arizona through a willingness to defy the party’s priorities makes littlesense in the current political climate. Most importantly,said Trent, it brings “very little benefit for the peopleshe represents,” which is the message Arizonans are now hearing over the airwaves. Sinema has gone to perhaps even greater lengths than Manchin toshowcase her willingness to be an obstacle. Insomesense, the No Excuses operation buttresses the Biden administration’s, and helps the president and party enact their agenda. Bidendispatched Vice President Kamala Harristo West Virginia for a media tour and pressure campaign of their own, hoping to drum up publicsupport tosway Manchin. (Harris, who is not popular in West Virginia, did a clumsy job of it, talking about “abandoned land mines” instead of “abandoned mine land” when extending an olive branch to coal country.) If the party had better message discipline or could be counted on to vote the party line as Republicans do, none of this would be necessary. But that’s not the Democratic Party that exists. So far, the inside-outside gameseems to be working, at least in a limited fashion. Manchin has not had a total political epiphany. Justyesterday, he did a YouTube livestream where he refused tosupport ending the filibuster and championed the legacy and reputation of notorioussegregationist Robert Byrd as a roundabout way ofsupporting the Byrd Rule and the filibuster’s broadscope. And he appears to be the main obstacle to increasing the minimum wage to $15 an hour within the COVID relief package. But he’s fallen in line on the overall bill, which was in no way a certainty. Even Republican West Virginia governor Jim Justice recently called on him tosupport the biggerstimulus package. Whether it will be enough to change Sinema’s tune is yet to beseen. But already, frustration is mounting in Arizona. Activist groups made up an important part of the coalition that helped Sinema across the finish line just over two years ago, and they’ve made their displeasure with herstance on the filibuster known. It’s clear that it will be harder for Democrats to hide behind claims of Republican obstruction, when they are well within their abilities to enact meaningful legislation. Doingso immediately is a top priority, given the fragile trifecta Democrats currentlysport. With redistricting looming and a fearsome 2022 midterm cycle, inaction would be tantamount tosuicide for Joe Biden’s agenda. If Sinema and Manchin, under threat of relentless public pressure, do come around, it will mark another lesson from the mistakes of the Obama years that Democratsseem to be learning, grudgingly.",1,1,American Prospect
630,Deficits Likely to Be Bigger Than Biden’s Budget Projects,2.0,45.33,https://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2021/06/02/Deficits-Likely-Be-Bigger-Biden-s-Budget-Projects,https://adfontesmedia.com/fiscal-times-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-02,25,"President Biden’s budget request for fiscal year 2020 projects a $1.8 trillion deficit next year and annualshortfalls of more than $1.3 trillion over the rest of the next decade. Actual deficits could be even larger, writes Howard Gleckman, asenior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center — and not because ofsome extraordinarily rosy economic assumptions, as has often been the case in the past. “Instead, Biden masked what likely will be the true increases in deficitssimply by usingstandard Washington budget accounting and by assuming that all of his proposed tax increases will become law, when they almostsurely will not,” Gleckman writes. He explains that Biden’s budget “makes two big assumptions.” One, as we noted last week, is that individual tax cuts in the 2017 Republican tax law will be allowed to expire as currentlyscheduled at the end of 2025. Biden has pledged not to raise taxes on people making less than $400,000 a year and he may not ultimately want all of those 2017 individual tax cuts to expire. Even if he does, many in Congress won’t. “In reality, Congress may allowsome to expire butsurely will extend many others,” Gleckmansays. “And there is a lot of money atstake. A back-of-the-envelope calculation based on theJoint Committee on Taxation’s 2017 TCJA revenue estimates, which assume the individual provisions do expire after 2025,suggests extending them could add close to another $800 billion to the debt by 2031.”The other questionable tax assumption in Biden’s budget involves corporate taxes. The budget assumes that his proposal to raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28% gets enacted — even assome Democrats have pushed back on that hike andsaid they’d prefer a 25% rate. “Rough rule of thumb: That three percentage point difference would reduce projected revenue by about $300 billion,” Gleckmansays. “Similarly, Biden’s budget assumes about $500 billion from changes to the taxation of US-based multinational corporations. The biggestsingle provision would effectively increase the global minimum tax on multinationals from 10.5 percent to 21 percent.” But the minimum rate is tied to the base corporate rate, and could ultimately drop to about 18% or lower. “Add it all up and that $2 trillion in new corporate tax revenue is likely to look more like $1.5 trillion or less,” Gleckmansays. His conclusion: The 2031 deficit of 4.7% of GDP projected in the Biden budget is more likely tostay closer to 5% of GDP through the decade because revenues would be lower than forecast in the White House blueprint. Of course, Congress couldstill change that outlook byscaling back Biden’sspending plans or enactingsome unanticipated revenue measures. Read the full piece at the Tax Policy Center.",2,2,Fiscal Times
631,The economic threats that could derail the Democrats' election dreams,7.67,37.0,https://theweek.com/articles/981286/economic-threats-that-could-derail-democrats-election-dreams,https://adfontesmedia.com/week-bias-and-reliability/,2021-05-07,24,"Can Joe Biden ""reimagine and rebuild"" the American economy in just 550 days? Because that is how long it is until the 2022 midterm elections. And historysuggests a good chance Democrats will lose their narrow control of Congress, most likely by losing the House. Then gridlock resumes. It is doubtful that Republicans will have much interest in helping Biden further become a ""transformational president"" by passing more wish-list items from the progressive agenda. Democratssurely understand the clock is ticking. But they also have to be hoping that the extraordinary power of the emerging economic boom might make the 2022 midterms an exception to the political pattern. Moody is Analytics, for example, recently revised its 2021 real GDP growth outlook to nearly 7 percent and to over 5 percent next year. ""If we are right,"" chief economist Mark Zandi told clients in a report, ""and there is good reason to believe we will be, this will be thestrongest two years of growthsince 1950-1951 at the height of the post-World War II economic boom."" And Moody is is hardly alone in predicting warp-speed GDP and job growth this year and next. So we are really off the map here. Who knows, not only might the Biden Boom keep the House and Senate in Democratic hands, it might also make asecond Biden term (or a first Harris term, perhaps) a pretty good bet. And when you think about it, two presidential terms might be what Democrats need to pass key legislation and then makesure those programssurvive during an era of extreme partisanship. Democrats are already trying to undo the Trump presidency wherever possible,such as attempting to partially reverse the Trump tax cuts, restore environmental rules, and rebuild America is trade relationship with Europe.

But the political impact of an unprecedented economicsurge is not the only unknown here. Putting aside the possibility of a dangerous new COVID-19 variant, perhaps the greatest risk to the recovery — and thus the Biden legacy — is how Washington is helping generate that recovery. Thestimulus continues to flow even as consumers boostspending and businesses fully reopen. Andsome Democratsstill do not think there is enough federal dough beingspent,such as those who want recurringstimulus checks to besent out and the $2.3 trillion Biden infrastructure plan to be a$10 trillion plan. As is, the tsunami ofspending might yet boost inflation, resulting insurprise action from the Federal Reserve and an unexpectedslowdown. Imagining pre-election recessions during the first terms of Ronald Reagan, George W Bush, and Barack Obama creates a pretty interesting game of ""what if"" alternate history with Presidents Mondale, Kerry, and Romney. An inflationsurprise is hardly the only risk. While the recovery is currently generating gobs of jobs, the expansion will eventuallyslow. And it mightslow faster than necessary thanks to generous jobless benefits that could potentially discourage work and createshortages. The $1.9 trillion COVID relief package last Marchextendedsupplemental benefits of $300 a month through early September. It’s an argumentsure to gain momentum after Friday is wildly disappointing April jobs report thatshowed 266,000 net new jobs were created last month vs a Wall Street forecast of a million orso. Now fat unemployment checks might not be the main reason for that undershoot. Homeschooling, a lack of child care, virus fears, and data issues all might have played a role. But the report doessuggest whysome economists are worried about the labor-supply impact of impact of jobless benefits as the economy continues to gainstrength in the coming months. A workershortage would also add to the inflation threat. Again, many Democrats do notseem at all worried, at leastso far. Late last month, nearly 40 Democrats on Capitol Hillsent the Biden White House a letter proposing ""more generous and long-lasting jobless benefits on a permanent basis,""accordingto the. Then there is the proposed tax increases, more than $3 trillion worth — including a record increase in capital gains tax rates. A nation is tax burden matters. How an economy is taxed matters. What is taxed matters. Tax rates matter. And although the economy did notsoar after the Trump tax cuts, the impact of the business tax cuts might have been offset by the Trump trade war. It is generally accepted, however, that tax rates affect how much and where a company invests. More investment makes workers more productive and will, over time, boost their wages. There is an economic risk that these proposed Biden tax increases will hurt investment. While many Wall Street banks havesome pretty rosy economics forecasts, they are generally not incorporating any downside impact of the tax hikes. Thosesame firms are also, for the most part, assuming the economy returns to its modest pre-pandemic pace in 2023. So there could be less room for economic policy mistakes than itseems right now. And Democrats — pushing for more, more, more —should be worried a transformational presidency might just end up transition ing back to a Republican one.",1,1,The Week

At least he never claimed to have asilver tongue. Polling guru Nate Silver, founder and editor-in-chief of the FiveThirtyEight website, didn’t mince words responding to critics who are accusing him of misleading voters with election predictions thatseemed much more favorable to Joe Biden.“If they’re coming after FiveThirtyEight, then the answer is f–k you, we did a good job,” he told Galen Druke, host of the website’sPolitics Podcast. As did many polls leading up to the election, the outlet’s most recent predictionsshowed the Democratic nominee with asizeable lead over Trump. But the race turned out to be much tighter than many people expected, with the president outperforming Biden inseveralstates. FiveThirtyEight predicted, for instance, that the former vice president had a nearly 70% chance of winning Florida, which did not happen. Silver explained that thesite considered Biden “a fairly heavy favorite” nationwide because “he could withstand a 2016-style polling error or a bit larger” andstill win.“People have false impressions about how accurate polls are,” he told Druke on Wednesday.“On the one hand, you have the 2016 criticism, where maybe the polls were close but they were wrong directionally, and then in 2020say, ‘Oh, well the polls, I mean they may have been the right call, except in onestate, but the margins were off.’ That’s the better criticism, but you have to pick one of those two. You can’t do both.”Disappointed voters onsocial mediastill blamed Silver for not offering a precise forecast of how tight the race turned out to be.“But for real, how the hell does Nate Silver have a job?” author Dan Areltweeted.“Nate Silverspent all year analyzing congressional districts and polls and everything possibly related to the election.

Semiconductors, or computer chips, act as the brains that power our technological devices. These chips, nowsmaller than astamp and thinner than a piece of hair, have revolutionized the modern world. Innovation in the field has led tosmarter, faster, andsmaller technology (think pacemakers,smartphones,solar energy,self-driving cars, laptops, airplanes, just about everything you use). They’re also thesecond largest export in the US and are responsible for 2 million American jobs. A recentshortage ofsemiconductorssent companies, who usually rely on a lean inventory of the chips, around the world into crisis as the pandemic drummed up demand for laptops, cellphones, and other technological devices. The blockage of the Suez Canal in March only worsened deliveries. Industry leaders likeIntelCEO Pat Gelsinger expect things to get worse before they get better. They don’t expect any real hope for recovery until 2022. Now, auto companies likeGM and Ford have announced that they’re temporarilyshutting down plants because of asemiconductorshortage. And that’s exactly why Secretary Raimondo is worried. “We have fallen very far behind from where we need to be with respect tosemiconductors,”she explained this week atCEOI Collaborative discussion. “Semiconductors are the building blocks of our entire digital economy and unfortunately, we’re vulnerable now because we don’t make enough leading edgesemiconductors in America.”China is a net importer ofsemiconductors, largely from the US The country imported $350 billion in chips in 2020, an increase of 14.6% from 2019. But recent trade tension under President Trump has damaged the longstanding relationship andspurred China to begin accelerating and prio rit izing its own chip-making programs. In 2020, the former president cut off Huawei Technologies, the number twosmart phone maker in the world, from access to US chips in a fight over Beijing’s industrial practices. The Trump administration also publicly considered imposing export restrictions on Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation, the largest manufacturer ofsemiconductors in China. The hostilities came as China promoted its Made in China 2025 initiative and Guidelines to Promote National Integrated Circuit Industry Development, which create financial incentives, intellectual property and antitruststandards to develop the Chinesesemiconductor industry and end reliance on the US“What I most often get asked about is China,”said Raimondo. “The fact of the matter is we have to run faster in America, and that means investing in our innovation and tech and unleashing all the opportunity that we have here.”USsemiconductors accounted for half of all globalsales, or about$193 billion, in 2020, but only 12% of those chips are actually manufactured in the US So while the USstill leads in design,supply-chain issues have become a problem and gives China a lot of leverage over the US In February, President Joe Biden issued an executive order to review America’s industrialsupply chain, partially to review why there was ashortage of production in the USs. “It’s about makingsure there’s a level playing field,so that weshow every company can compete,”said Raimondo. But, more needs to be done to aid in research and development. “We have consistently fallen behind in terms of R&D as a percent of GDP,”shesaid. While Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore and China invest billions annually in theirsemiconductor industries, the federal government has beenslow to provide R&D funding and funding for domestic production. R&D now accounts for less than 1% of the US GDP but that would change under President Biden’s infrastructure bill, which proposes $52 billion invested in domestic manufacturing and another $50 billion in R&D funding to focus onsemiconductors and advanced computing. Still, Raimondo is weary. Even if the infrastructure bill were to pass as-is, $52 billion is not enough,shesays. The money is just “a piece of the puzzle,”she told. But while it’s “not nearly enough to do what we need to do,”she hopes it will be able to unlock andstimulate privatesector investment to the tune of $100 billion in the production ofsemiconductors and job training. Stimulating that innovation and enhancing innovative competition,shesaid, “is the bedrock of our capitalisticsystem, the bedrock of what has made America great.”Subscribe to Fortune Dailyto get essential businessstoriesstraight to your in box each morning.",2,2,Fortune
634,Newsmax CEO Chris Ruddy Claims Network Doesn’t Spread Pro-Trump Lies—Despite All Evidence,-12.0,38.33,https://www.thedailybeast.com/newsmax-ceo-chris-ruddy-claims-network-doesnt-spread-pro-trump-lies-despite-ample-evidence,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-beast-bias-reliability/,2021-01-08,25,"In fact, Ruddy claimed to The Daily Beast, the right-wing outlet hasso much journalistic integrity that it has pissed off President Trump in recent days. Donald Trump-friendly cable outletNewsmax—which has reaped massive ratings rewards for its refusal until recently to acknowledge Joe Biden as president-elect—has tried to exploit thatstance by repeatedly airing bogus claims that Trump didn’t lose the election and that anti fa and Black Lives Matter, not a violent mob of Trumpsupporters, are to blame for Wednesday’s lethal assault on the Capitol. At least one Newsmax commentator claimed after the mayhem—in which five people died, including a Capitol police officer—that George Soros wassomehow involved.“Stop right here,” Newsmax majority owner and chief executive Christopher Ruddy admonished The Daily Beast on Friday when asked to explain his channel’s enthusiastic platform ing of post-election falsehoods, especially in the aftermath of Wednesday’s insurrection. “We have acted very properly on this. We condemned the violence almost from the minute it was happening in real time. We weresaying every timesomebody raised anti fa [that] we have no evidence they were involved at all.”Despite Ruddy’s assertion, there are numerous examples in which Newsmax guests, paid contributors, anchors and correspondents have madespecious claims with nosuch disclaimers. On Friday, for instance, former New York Police Commissioner and convicted felon Bernard Kerik, a promoter oft he election-related conspiracy theory that Trump’s victory wasstolen by a deep-statesupercomputer named “Hammer,” told credulous Newsmax host John Bachman: “I was at the rally…but I can tell you that there were close to a million people on the Mall [aspectacular exaggeration] between where the presidentspoke and the Washington Monument, beyond the monument, and that area was completely peaceful.“Whatever happened, happened down at the Capitol, and I anticipate you’re gonnasee a lot of instigators and anarchists from Black Lives Matter and antifa,” Kerik continued. Instead of casting doubt, Bachman eagerly agreed.“Anybody who knows anything about these protests knows that there is a professional class of protestors,” he declared. “They have no ideology. They have no real morals. They don’t really believe in anything other than tearing down thesystem.”Kerik, the recipient of a presidential pardon last year afterserving prison time and pleading guilty to multiple counts of federal tax fraud and perjury, was only the latest Newsmax personality to go on air andspreadsham conspiracy theories—which in recent days have also included the Soros conspiracy by frequent guest CJ Pearson, a teenage Trump acolyte from Georgia.“George Soros [would] like tosee in the final days of what looks like will be Joe Biden’s quest tosteal this presidency than to make it look like Joe—that Donald Trump is trying to wagesome insurrection as the liberal media hassaid? It’s absolutely nonsensical. It’s a far departure from reality,” Pearson told highly rated Newsmax host Greg Kelly on Wednesday night,as firstspotted byleft-leaning press watchdog organization, Media Matters for America. On thesameshow, Kelly mused: “We’ve heard about outside agitators allsummer long with the Black Lives Matter protests that all the looting was done by, you know, foreignsources fromsome faraway place. Look, these don’t look like Trumpsupporters. Trumpsupporters don’t do these things.”On Thursday night, meanwhile, Kelly told viewers: “Sometimes the bank robber gets away with it. Joe Bidenstole this election. You know it. I know it. Tens of millions of Americans agree with us… Donald Trumpshould not concede because he didn’t lose.”Also on Thursday, Newsmax anchor Grant Stinchfield hosted InfoWars personality DeAnna Lorraine, a QAnon acolyte who, among other interesting observations, has argued that Bill Gates is aspace alien and Michelle Obama is a man.“I amso proud of… the people that went to the Capitol yesterday because we needed to do this,”she told Stinchfield. “We needed toshow them that we care, that our Constitution matters, that our America, our country matters. This is a foreign, hostile takeover and you know it. I know it. And it is time that westep up and that we fight.”Lorraine went on: “Yesterday, we told the truth. We were there at the Capitol, we were peaceful protesting. The violence was only coming from the police towards us who were there. And yet they arespinning this disgusting narrative that we are at fault or that Trump is at fault and this was domestic terrorism. No it was not. It was us fighting for our country. And we have never, ever been more at risk of losing our country.”Ruddy argued that it’s unfair to hold Newsmax accountable for giving free rein to those and othersuch baseless and reckless claims and Trump-reinforcing fever dreams.“We can’t control every guest that comes on Newsmax,” Ruddysaid. “You’re expecting that every guest that comes on CNN and MSNBC—weshould hold them accountable for all the bats hit crazy things theysaid about Russian collusion over the years?... C’mon. Is Newsmax responsible? Are we really pushing the anti fa thing? In all fairness! We have probablysaid three dozen times that we have no evidence that anti fa is involved.”Regarding Kerik’s remarks, Ruddy added: “I don’t know what Bernie Keriksaid. He’s the former police commissioner of the City of New York.” Kerik’s criminal record “doesn’t undermine the fact that he was the police commissioner and a law enforcement officer,” the Newsmax CEOsaid. “He has been completely pardoned for his crimes.”Ruddy added: “I don’tsee what thestory is. I really don’t.” He added that contrary to the general perception, Newmax has displeased Trump from time to time—including Ruddy’s recent column arguing that his friend the presidentshould concede and congratulate Biden—and has actuallyshown restraint in resistingsuch bogus claims as retractedstory that facial recognition technology had identified anti fa activists among the rioters. Ruddy added that his friend Trump, with whom he has dined at Mar-a-Lago, where he’s a longtime member, was upset when Newsmaxstarted referring to Biden as “president-elect” on December 14 after the Electoral College certified his victory.“I can tell you Trump’s not happy with Newsmax that we were calling Biden the president-elect,” Ruddy recounted, adding that hespoke to thesoon-to-be ex-president over the holidays. “Isaid to him that we were accepting the constitutional process and thought that heshould do that”—advice Trump rejected. Ruddy added thatsome Newsmax viewers have even complained about the channel’s alleged journalistic conscientiousness. Newsmax’s refusal to run the facial recognitionstory “has been fueling all the angst we’re getting from our viewers hip that we’re not covering this—that we’re part of the coverup. And now you’re calling me andsaying we’ve been fueling it. No one else is arguing this.”On Wednesday, as the rampage at the Capitol drew to a close, Newsmax anchor Tom Basile fervently promoted the antifa/Black Lives Matter canard: “So that you have a complete picture of what’s going on, the last couple of times we’veseen these rallies, it hasn’t just been the president’ssupporters. We haveseen antifa, we haveseen Black Lives Matter, we haveseen other leftist groups that have tried tostir up violence.”Newsmax White House correspondent Emerald Robinson chimed in: “That’s a great point, Tom, because I am hearing fromsome people on the ground that there is a question of, if anti fa has infiltrated the Trump rally-goers and are fomentingsome kind of unrest.”MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, meanwhile, assured Newsmax viewers that Wednesday’s riot was “very peaceful” and that there was “probablysome undercover anti fa that dressed as Trump people and didsome damage to windows and got in there.”Newsmax anchor Chris Salcedo concurred—“I’ve heard those reports, too”—never mind that there were nosuch reports, at least not from news organizations. Ruddy, who prefers that Newsmax be described as “center-right conservative” instead of “right-wing,” vowed that his channel will cover the Biden administration from the perspective of “the loyal opposition,” not as an illegitimate president.“I actually likesome of his Cabinet choices,” hesaid, mentioning attorney general-designate Merrick Garland andsecretary ofstate-designate Tony Blinken.“I’ve heard that Blinken is a good guy,” hesaid.

635,"With Abuse Victims Trapped at Home, Detroit Moves Restraining Order System Online",0.0,47.0,https://www.thetrace.org/2020/05/detroit-michigan-online-restraining-order-personal-protection-order-domestic-violence/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-trace-bias-and-reliability/,2020-05-29,16,"Before the pandemicspread, getting a domestic violence restraining order was an onerous process in Wayne County, Michigan, which includes Detroit, Dearborn, andseveralsmaller cities. Obtaining one required going in person to the court building to completeseveral pieces of paperwork, waiting around tosee if a petition was granted, and then finding out when a hearing would take place. The whole process could take all day. “It can be incredibly intimidating to file a personal protection order,”said Jeni Hooper, program coordinator of the community response team at First Step, an advocacy group in Detroit forsurvivors of domestic violence. The coronavirus has required courtsystems to adapt — and at a time when experts warn thatsocial isolation, economic uncertainty, anda historic wave of gun-buyingare driving up domestic abuse. Calls to the Michigan Coalition to End Domestic and Sexual Violencewere up102 percent in March and the first half of April, compared to thesame period last year. In Wayne County, officials accelerated plans to digitize the process for a personal protection order (PPO) as it is called locally. On April 17, three days before its courthouses closed to prevent thespread of the coronavirus, the Wayne County Circuit Courtlauncheda digital portal through which people can request ordersremotely. As part of theprocess, a petitioner can ask a judge to prohibit the respondent from purchasing or possessing a firearm. Themajority ofstateslack an automatic gun prohibition with an temporary pre-hearing order, even though experts warn that a failure to disarm abusers when an order isserved exacerbates the risks for victims. Kathleen McCarthy, the presiding judge in the family division of Wayne County Circuit Court whospearheaded the e-filing program,said that whenshe was deciding whether to temporarily close the courthouse last month, her biggest concern was how domestic violencesurvivors would be able to get restraining orders. Growing up in a household with domestic violence had made her particularly attuned to the risks,she added. The pandemic “turned everything on its head and forced everyone to learn and to acquire the technology to do these things in a more up-to-date fashion,” McCarthysaid. In 2018, Wayne County had the highest rate of reported domestic violence incidents by county in Michigan, according toa Trace analysis of the most recent available crimestatistics from the Michigan State Police and population data from the US Census Bureau. When astatestay-at-home orderstarted on March 24, officials and advocates in Michigan feared the problem would get worse. “A lot of times people need to get these personal protection orders and the person they need to get it against isstillsomewhere around them,”said Shelly Drain, an assistant prosecuting attorney in Wayne County.“The pandemic putssurvivors at a much more increased risk because they can be isolated with their abuser,” added Hooper. In April, the county registered aslight decline in reported incidents of domestic violence compared to the last year,accordingto an analysis of county data by theDetroit Free Press. But local crisis centers have reported an increase in calls about domestic violence in thesame period compared to last year, a possiblesign of underreporting. McCarthysays the e-filingsystem has been processing an average of 17 PPO applications per day, about thesame volume that came through the oldsystem in March. That’s down from a pre-pandemic average of about 25 per day,shesaid. Researchshowsthat when an abuser has access to a gun, the risk of homicide becomes five timesmore likely. Federal law bars convicted abusers and thosesubject to domestic violence protective orders from owning guns. But the law refers to permanent orders of protection that have been handed down by a judge, not orders that areserved prior to a hearing. Twenty-onestates either bar gun possession for peoplesubject to a PPO before a hearing is held, or allow a judge to authorize a gun prohibition. Michigan falls into the latter category. Most of the time, Drainsaid, judges in Wayne County order a gun prohibition even if a petitioner hasn’t asked for it. McCarthy added that allsitting judges in her jurisdiction must attend domestic violence training, where “it’s clearly taught that removing guns from the household is the number one way, if you can, to prevent a fatality.”Thee-filingsystem makes it much easier for petitioners, whether in a pandemic or not,said Hooper, whose group is one ofseveral domestic violence organizations available to help petitioners complete the process. They can file on behalf of a domestic violencesurvivor if that person is unable to access the forms themself. The courtwebsitealso makes it easier for petitioners to find court-approved processservers orsend documents by certified mail. Georgea Cole, an advocate for victims with the Americorps Urban Safety Domestic Violence Program at Wayne State University,spends the vast majority of her time helping domestic violencesurvivors file for PPOs, including through the newsystem. Normally,she works out of policestations throughout Detroit,speaking with people who are referred by an officer or via a domestic violence hotline. Shesays working from home has hindered her ability to connect withsurvivors. “You can’t get that kind of refuge virtually,”shesaid. But for othersurvivors who are unable to get to a physical place ofsafe harbor, the online filingsystem offers potentially life-saving access — even without the pandemic orstate of emergency. Colesaidshe thinks that the addition of online filing after thestate reopens can allow for the greatest access possible forsurvivors whose circumstances restrict different resources.“Wesee both of the methods work,” Colesaid. “But everything is not for everybody.”Wayne County is not the first place to add an e-filingsystem for personal protection orders. Macomb County in Michigan has hadsuch asystem in placesince 2018. Prior to the coronavirus crisis, threestates — Indiana, Minnesota, and Wisconsin — allowed people to electronically file restraining order petitions directly to the court without having to visit a courthouse or meet with a legal advocate, according to an analysis of data from theNational Center for State Courts. Since the pandemic began, others likeUtahhave also allowed temporary restraining order petitions to be emailed directly to the court. But onlinesystems remain unusual. And that largely comes down to funding,said Rachel Teicher, director of intimate partner violence intervention at the National Network For Safe Communities. “It costs money toset up thesesystems and adopt them and makesure they’resecure and that the process works,”said Teicher. Butshesaid the investment is worth it. “Itsaves victims a lot of time andstress.”Wayne County officials hope that other jurisdictions might follow their lead. Said Drain, “It can really be rolled out everywhere.”",2,2,The Trace
636,"The Child Tax Credit Is a Proven Boost to American Families, So Why Are Conservative Democrats Trying to Stop It?",-24.0,28.67,https://www.counterpunch.org/2021/10/07/the-child-tax-credit-is-a-proven-boost-to-american-families-so-why-are-conservative-democrats-trying-to-stop-it/,https://adfontesmedia.com/counterpunch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-07,25,"American families havestruggled for decades to make ends meet with wagessimply not rising as fast as the cost of living and a governmentsocialsafety net that has beenso deeply decimated that the US nows pends less on children than nearly any other wealthy nation. This year there was asmall glimmer of hope thatsuch a trend might be halted and even reversed. Democrats, using their razor-thin control of the Senate and marginal control of the House,passed an expanded child tax credit(CTC) in March 2021 as part of the American Rescue Plan that not only increased the tax refund received by families with young children but also begansending thema monthly advance instead of making them wait until they filed their annual tax return. By any measure, the amounts are embarrassingly modest and only offer an increase of $1,000 to $1,600 over the entire year. Families whose incomes are low enough to qualify and have children aged 6 through 17 are now receiving $3,000 a year instead of $2,000, while those with children younger than 6 are getting checks that add up to $3,600 a year. Putting cash, howeversmall an amount, into the hands of ordinary Americans is a win-win proposition for all but the most conservative pundits. As the 2020 CARES Act unemployment benefits—amounting to a $15 an hour wage—demonstrated, the economy as a whole is buoyed when people have more money in their pockets tospend on basic necessities. And, just as importantly, the benefits helped the most vulnerable, particularly Black and Latino workers, tostave off financial ruin. Now, the monthly CTC payments are alreadyshowingsimilar promise. The Center on Poverty and Social Policyat Columbia University documented “a notable drop in child poverty” after just the first month of payments. Additionally, the benefits are particularly helpful for Black and Latino children, who the center estimates have twice the poverty rate of white children. Still, because the CTC relies on tax returns filed in the previous year, white children benefited more than children of color as their families were “more likely to have filed taxes.”TheUS Census Bureaualso found that after just one month of payments, food insecurity among vulnerable families droppedsignificantly, and families receiving checks also had less difficulty paying for weekly expenses. So convincing are the expanded CTC’s proven benefits that nearly 450 economists wrote an open letter to Congressurging them to extend the program. The CTC payments benefit roughly39 million American families who are currently receiving monthly checks of up to $300 per child per month. Meanwhile, the cost of child care in the US is exorbitant, averaging at about $1,300 per month for infants and nearly $900 per month for preschool-aged children. For families with multiple children and parents in low-wage jobs, child care issimply out of reach, and the modest CTC payments don’t even come close to covering the costs. At thesame time,child care workers areso underpaid that in the wake of the pandemic, more than 120,000 havesimply quit their jobs nationwide. Even the US government isso concerned that theTreasury Department issued a report admitting that “the existing child caresystem in the USs, which relies on private financing to provide care for most children… fails to adequatelyserve many families.”This is not a new problem. In a2014speech at the White House Summit on Working Families, former President Barack Obama acknowledged that, “in 31states, decent child care costs more than in-state college tuition,” and that “there are other countries that know how to do child care well.”Child care issuch an important factor for families with young children that the latestHarris Pollsurvey found that 76 percent of working parents felt that child care decisions were a major factor in their employment decisions. The cost of raising a child is estimated to be nearly a quarter of a million dollars—asum that is wildly out of reach for low-income families. Combined with persistent wealth and income inequality, it is no wonder that, as per a recentCDC report, 2020 was “thesixth consecutive year that the number of births [in the US] has declined.”One 2009study concluded that cheaper child care is the key to reversing falling birth rates. There are twosimple ways to make child care cheaper: heavilysubsidize the child care industry (the US government, after all,subsidizes fossil fuel and agricultural industries), or put more money into the hands of parents with children. Currently, the expanded CTC benefits are valid only for a year, andsome Democrats want to make them permanent. But President Joe Biden wants them extended for only four years via a $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill called theBuild Back Better Act. Andsome conservative Democrats want to roll back the expanded benefit right away. Accountable. USidentifies nine House Democrats and two Senate Democrats opposing the extension of an expanded CTC Of these 11 naysayers, eight are millionaires. Inspite of its clear benefits, the CTC is in very real political danger of being rolled back. Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ), who is one of its biggest proponents,said,“There’s nothing bigger than this… if you just want to look at the impact of a child’s life, this is the biggest thing that we’re doing.” Indeed, it’s hard to argue against helping vulnerable American children, butsome Democrats like Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ) are managing to doso as theystand in the way of the current iteration of the CTC Manchin in particular has adopted a posture far closer to the Republican way of thinking: that benefits aimed at wealthy interests are good for the nation, while benefits to vulnerable individuals are effectively “entitlements.” Using Republican-favoredbuzzwords, Manchin recentlysaid that while hesupports theCTC in theory, “anything that can be addedshould be means tested,” and that it is important that the US not turn into an “entitlementsociety.” Onecritic explained that “‘Means testing’ is just a nicer way tosay, ‘We want people to jump through more hoops,so fewer people can get help.’”The West Virginiasenator exudessuch hubris in opposing his own party that in aNew York Timesinterview earlier this year, he essentially dared Democrats to try to oust him,saying, “What are they going to do, [are] they going to go into West Virginia and campaign against me? Please, that would help me more than anything.” With friends like Manchin, Republicans cansit out the discussion and have no clear policy position on the matter. With many progressive Democrats going on the defensive to protect the expansion of the CTC,some are going on the offensive in trying to get money into the hands of low-income and middle-income Americans by other means. Minnesota Democratic RepresentativeIlhan Omarin July introduced a guaranteed income bill that would ensure individuals making up to $75,000 a year receive $1,200 monthly checks. The SUPPORT Act, backed by progressivestalwartssuch as Cori Bush (D-MO) and Pramila Jayapal (D-WA), includes running a pilot program initially to prove that monthly payments would have a positive impact on families. Such approaches embody the opposite of thetrickle-down economic model long championed by many establishment economists in the face of progressive opposition. Now, the trickle-down model isso discredited that even Biden has explicitly rejected it. Rather than infusing the top tiers ofsociety with money, tax breaks andsubsidies, based on a fantasy that those riches will eventually reach the bottom tiers, policymakers are getting on board with direct benefits to vulnerable Americans. Whether or not the CTCsurvives Washington’s political wrangling remains to beseen, even as tens of millions of Americans rely on it.

The police wouldsoonsurround him. O’Neill andsix other Catholic peace activists had infiltrated the Kings Bay Naval Base in StreetMary’s, Georgia, with the goal ofsymbolically disarming the base’ssix Tridentsubmarines armed with first-strike missiles capable of holding 200 nuclear warheads. Some of the activistsstrung up crimescene tape and hung protest banners that read “The Ultimate Logic of Trident is Omnicide.” Others poured baby bottles of their own blood around the base. Using Google Maps, O’Neill and Mark Colville discovered a macabreshrine to nuclear ism consisting of a half dozenstatues of nuclear missiles that looked as if they weresuspended in motion justseconds after launch. Staring up at a replica of a Trident D5 intercontinental ballistic missile, O’Neill’s mind turned to the book of Exodus in the Bible: theshrine offered proof that nuclear weapons were modern-day idols more powerful than a golden calf. Unlike that emptysignifier, the pacifist recognized the immutable power of nuclear weapons. For him, it was thesame as worshipping death. Time was runningshort. O’Neillsprinted up to thestatue and beat it with the hammer. The missile wassolid cement and the hammerhead broke clean off.“It was a formidable idol,” recalled O’Neill. Catholic peace activists like the ones who infiltrated the naval base at Kings Bay in 2018 have attempted to topple the formidable idol of nuclear ism for 40 years, and they have paid a heavy price. Liz McAlister has alreadyserved 17 months behind bars and Father Steve Kelley continues to languish in a jail in Georgia. Afterspending more than 28 months under house arrest, O’Neill wasslapped with a 14-month prisonsentence in October. Carmen Trotta and Clare Grady willserve more than a year in prison, while Martha Hennessy expects to be incarcerated for 10 months. Mark Colville will besentenced in December. On top of that, the activists are grappling with an establishment media blackout that they fear could be reflective of Americans’ apathy towards nuclear abolition at a moment when the threat of a nuclear holocaust is at its highest point in decades. O’Neill and the other Catholic peace activists knew they possessed neither the tools nor the numbers to physically disarm the nuclear naval base at Kings Bay. Rather, the goal of the Kings Bay action, like every Plowshares action dating back to the movement’s inception, was to call attention to the omni cid al threat that nuclear weapons continue to pose for humanity. The Plowshares movement began in 1980 when Roman Catholic priests Philip and Daniel Berrigan andsix otherssurreptitiously gained access to the Re-Entry Division at the General Electric Space Technology Center in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania. Carrying only hammers and pints of their own blood tosymbolize the human cost of nuclear war, the activists pounded on nose cones that covered Mark 12A nuclear warheads and poured the blood over engineering blueprints and other documents. As their objective was to convert weapons of war into instruments of peace, the activists dubbed themselves the Plowshares Eight, a reference to a verse in the book of Isaiah in the Bible calling nations to “beatswords into plowshares.”The King of Prussia action captured the attention of the nation–thetocallit “one of the best-known antiwar incidents in this countrysince the Vietnam War”–and announced to the world the beginning of a bold new faction within the broader anti-war movement in the US that fused religion with non-violent direct action against nuclear weapons.“They were different. They were risky. They were costly,”said McAlister, a former Catholic nun and longtime Plowshares activist. Since 1980, dozens of Plowshares activists have repeatedly penetratedsites across the country ranging from military installations to missilesilos and in the process laid waste to the idea that nuclear weapons could ever bestoredsafely. The 2018 infiltration of the naval base at Kings Bay is estimated to be the 100th Plowshares action. Legal trials and prisonsentences that weresure to follow their acts of civil disobedience were viewed as opportunities for the activists to draw more attention to their cause and often revealed the extraordinary lengths the government took tosuppress dissent among those who dared to confront the American war machine.“You could count onserious time as a consequence,” McAlistersaid. “And [the federal government was] consistent aboutseeing to it that we did that time.”McAlister and Philip Berrigan were excommunicated from the Catholic church after they married in 1973 but theirsocial justice activism continued. McAlistersaidshe avoided participating in Plowshares actions at thesame time as her husbandso that one parent could be home with their children. The couple estimated that theyspent more than 10 years of their marriageseparated by the carceralsystem. McAlisterserved another two and a half years, including jail time for the Kings Bay action,since Berrigan died in 2002. When Grady first heard about the King of Prussia action, her initial reaction was alarm at the personal risks that the activists undertook to broadcast their message out to the public. Hersecond reaction wasskepticism that their actions, though brave, would lead to any concessions on the part of the American military-industrial complex. Aftersome consideration, Grady realized, “Oh, our friends are not asking the US government to do anything. They’re doing it themselves.”Two years later, Grady joined McAlister and five others in penetrating the Griffiss Air Force Base in New York in order to gain access to a B-52 bomber, which were once outfitted to carry nuclear payloads that could be dropped onto the former Soviet Union. Basesecurity did not appear until an hour after the activistsstarted beating on the hanger doors, which incidentally were unlocked.“In 1983, when we hammered on the B-52 bomber and related parts, that plane was actually frozen for evidence for five months,” Gradysaid. “That is one of the few moments where nuclear weapons with these actions actually were disarmed. I’m notsure that too many efforts could claim that at that moment.”The grassroots movement against nuclear weapons in the US reached a peak in 1982 when an estimated one million people converge din New York City for a massive demonstration. Grady remembered the thrill of being a part of the historic protest, whichstands instark contrast to the minoritystatus that anti-nuclearism maintains today.“People were very much aware at that time of the danger of nuclear weapons,” Gradysaid. “Nowadays, very few people know about it and very few people are organizing around it.”The dearth of activism against nuclear weapons in the US coincides with a new nuclear arms race as measures designed to mitigate nuclear proliferation that took decades tostitch together are being dismantled piece-by-piece. The world is currently just 100seconds away from global destruction, according to the Doomsday Clock created by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists in 1947 as a way to remind people about the threat of nuclear annihilation. Here in the US, a new nuclear threat, one potentially more cataclysmic than the first, is currently underway. And not unlike the nuclearsubmarines that pass innocuously through the waters of Kings Bay in Georgia, it is happening right under the noses of the American public.“What has happened is the end of the Cold War and the disappearance of asingle focused enemy with a peer competitor in the nuclear field,” Jessica T Matthews told. Matthews is the former president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.“Older people remember getting under their desks for nuclear drills when they were in elementaryschool and putting their coats over their heads. Growing up in the era of above-ground nuclear testing all the time. All that went away with the end of the Cold War and I think itseemed as though the threat of nuclear conflict went with it.”The USs ushered in the nuclear age in 1945 and despite deepening wealth inequality andskyrocketing unemployment resulting from the coronavirus pandemic, the country continues tospend billions of dollars to maintain its nuclear hegemony over the rest of the world. This new nuclear arms race is a reminder of how even in an era marked by entrenched partisan divisiveness, Democratic and Republican lawmakers remain united on maintaining America’s nuclearsupremacy regardless of the financial, environmental or human costs. In 2001, Republican President George W Bush withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, an arms control agreement dating back to the 1970s. President Obama, a Democrat,secured passage of the New START treaty limiting the number of nuclear weapons but only after hestruck a deal with Congress tospend $100 billion to refit American nuclear facilities and labs. That plan has now turned into an across-the-board modernization of the country’s nuclear apparatus, including the Trident II D5 nuclear missiles that are housed at the Kings Bay naval base, currently priced at $1.7 trillion, Matthewssaid. More than any other president, Trumpseemed bent on turning the clock back to the 1950s when the country maintained more than 30,000 nuclear warheads and bombs in itsstockpile, compared to roughly5,800weapons today. In May, Trump administration officialssignalled their interest in breaking the 28-year moratorium on nuclear testing to get China and Russia to agree to arms limitations under the New START treaty, which expires in 2021. President-elect Joe Biden will likely extend the treaty but the result of all these infractions upon our already threadbare nuclearsafety net amount to a running leap into asecond nuclear arms race that is expected to continue regardless of whosits in the White House.“It’s a train that’s in motion and it’s going to be very hard toslow it down or redirect it,” Matthews warned. So hard that barring any unforeseen conflicts that might actually bring us closer to the brink of nuclear war, Matthews is dubious that Plowshares actions and other grassroots organizing will be enough on their own to force the issue into the national discourse.“I think it’s a really hard time for that to happen,” Matthewssaid. “If there were a confluence of events…if the [Trump] administration decided to test [nuclear weapons] and then if Korea got hot, and ifseveral things happened at once, I can imagine it. But I just don’t think this is an issue whose time has come for public attention.”Calls to drop the charges against members of the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven elicitedsupport from figures like Daniel Ellsberg, whistle blower and longtime anti-nuclear activist, along with religious leaders, including Reverend William J Barber of the revived Poor People’s Campaign and former archbishop Desmond Tutu. Though he has not publicly commented on the legal fate of the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven, Pope Francis has embraced the Catholic peace activists’ once radical demand for the abolishment of nuclear weapons.“There is an urgent need to work for a world free of nuclear weapons,” Pope Francistoldthe UN in 2015, “in full application of the non-proliferation treaty, in letter andspirit, with the goal of a complete prohibition of these weapons.”Media coverage, meanwhile, has failed to keep pace. News about the Catholic pacifists’ bold act of nonviolent civil disobedience at Kings Bay and theirsubsequent trial appears predominantly in progressive or religious publications like theNational Catholic Reporter. Mainstream outlets, including those in Atlanta and nearby Jacksonville, Florida, havesteered clear of the Plowshares activists. The lack of coverage has promptedsome Plowsharessupporters to conclude theseven activists have become the victims of a media blackout. Journalist Jeremy Scahill recently gave voice to that concern following the recentsentencing of Kelley and O’Neill. Speaking in October on, Scahillslammedthe press’ refusal to cover the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven.“These Catholic peace activists, during the Trump administration, tried to confront that nuclear threat, and there was a total media blackout on the action that they did,” Scahillsaid. “And, you know, if we lived in a justsociety, the Kings Bay Plowshares activists’ trial would have been reported on as one of the most brave confrontations of the most dangerous aspect of this government, and particularly this administration.”O’Neill pointed to a 2019 hearing for the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven attended by the actor and Catholic activistMartin Sheen. Only one reporter from a local newspapershowed up to document Sheen’s publicshow ofsupport. Rather than a concerted effort by the media tosuppress the activists, O’Neill fears that the lack of press coverage is instead a reflection of how complacent Americans have become after 75 years of living on hair-trigger alert. In the absence ofsustained grassroots mobilization aimed at keeping the issue of nuclear abolition in thespotlight, O’Neill imagines news editors and journalists view the Plowshares activists as if they are political outliers or relics of a bygone era, with little incentive to cover them.“The media is not blacking us out,”said O’Neill. “They just made a conscious decision tosay we’re not worthy of coverage. It justsayssomething about how relaxed people are about being under theshadow of the nuclear arms race.”The deadly coronavirus pandemic compounds what issure to be an already arduous prisonsentence, posing an additional threat for members of the Kings Bay Plowshares Seven, all of whom are moresusceptible to COVID-19since they are over the age of 60. In October, USs District Court Judge Lisa Godbey Woodsentenced O’Neill to 14 months in prison. Since he lives at a Catholic worker house in Garner, North Carolina, O’Neill told that he preferred toserve out hissentence close to home at the nearby federal prison in Butner even though it has become a hotspot for coronavirus infections. More people at Butner have died from COVID-19–26 prisoners and onestaff member–than at any other federal federal correctional institution. Instead, O’Neill was ordered to report to the Elkton Federal Prison in Ohio. The facility was at the center of a COVID-19outbreakthat wasso bad with one in four prisoners infected that it drew legal action from the ACLU So far, nine prisoners have died from the coronavirus. O’Neillsaid he is appealing the order but clearly both options pose a risk to his health. When asked about whether the Kings Bay action was worth losing his life over, O’Neill echoed the words of past Plowshares activists whosaw a greater danger–in this case, the death of all living things–in notspeaking out.“There are people in the world working to change the direction of the world, to move the world away from nuclear ism and the development of more nuclear weapons and we’re very much in the minority right now,” O’Neillsaid. “But nonetheless, we’re not acting in vain.”“If we hadn’t gone to Kings Bay, people living in those communities there would never have given any thought to Kings Bay as being anything more than an employer, an economic boost. I think people now have tosort of think about things in a different light.”It is reasonable to think that at nearly 81 years old, McAlister’s 17-monthstretch for breaking into the navalsubmarine base at Kings Bay will be her last time behind bars for nonviolent civil disobedience. But McAlister knows just as well as anyone else that nuclear annihilation is not reasonable andshestoppedshort atsaying definitively whether Kings Bay would be her last Plowshares action. McAlister acknowledged her concern that fewer people are willing to join the Plowshares movement than they were 40 years ago at the height of anti-nuclearism. But just as the threat of nuclear war has notsubsidedsince the end of the Cold War, McCalister is hopeful that people of conscience will continue to fight for a nuclear-free world. A former nun, McAlistersaysshe never would have dared to undertake the risks that Plowshares activists must take if it weren’t for her faith in God. She firmly believes that it was God performing “minor miracles” that facilitated the entry of dozens of Plowshares activists into highlysecured nuclear facilities and enabled them to put their hands directly onto the doomsday machine.“These are the most deadly weapons in the world,”said McAlister. “How is it possible forsomebody like me to walk right in and be right next to them and pour blood on them? Use a hammer on them? But I’ve done it a number of times andso havesome of my friends and my husband.”“And please, God, others will continue to do it,”shesaid. One person who answered the call was Martha Hennessy. The 2018 infiltration of the Kings Bay naval base was her first Plowshares action, which makes her an anomaly among the other activists. Hennessy, though, is nostranger to the movement. In fact,she is the granddaughter of Dorothy Day, who was one of the principal driving forces behind the creation of the Catholic Worker movement in the 1930s. Growing up, Hennessy witnessed firsthand the evolution of the Plowshares movement under the guidance of Catholic peace activists like McAlister and the Berrigan brothers who dared to take astand against the threat of nuclear armageddon even in the face of assured retribution from the federal government. Her decision to infiltrate the Kings Bay naval base in a defiant act of civil disobedience against the world’s most powerful military came only after months of prayerful discernment, a kind of internal examination about what risksshe was willing to take on behalf of her religious beliefs and moral convictions. The integrity of the Plowshares movement gave Hennessy thestrength to take part in the Kings Bay action, a cohort thatshe believes will help hersurvive her 10-month prisonsentence.“You know, walking onto a military base was not the first thing I wanted to do in this resistance work for nuclear abolition,” recalled Hennessy. “But the power ofsuch an act canspeak for itself and we had to bring the body of Christ there to the base.”“It’s our obligation tospeak out,”she proclaimed.",1,1,Shadowproof

641,Computer hackers stole thousands of Lightfoot administration emails. Here’s a look at some of what they leaked online.,0.0,43.67,https://www.chicagotribune.com/politics/ct-lightfoot-administration-hacked-emails-closer-look-20210514-havyv352lfegrklmfi76a25wfi-story.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/chicago-tribune-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-05-14,25,"Hackers recentlystole a cache of thousands of city of Chicago em ails that were electronically transferred from Mayor Lori Lightfoot’s administration to the Jones Day law firm. City officials have declined to comment on individual hacked emails: “Reporting on materials compromised during a third-party vendor data transfer makes all of us lesssafe and encourages future bad actors to use nefarious means to gain information.”The hacked emails, now visible online, weresent or received by four former city employees over a two-year period and offersome insight into the inner-workings of the Lightfoot administration — howsome decisions are made, who was involved and what they were thinking. Here’s a closer look:‘Crapspot is putting it mildly, dude’Some of the em ailsshow Lightfoot advisers were at timesstuck between the mayor and their own ideas on certain issues. One example of the administration’s internal decision making involved Lightfoot’s campaign promise of imposing civilian oversight on Chicago’s police department. As a candidate,Lightfoot promised to pass a police oversight plan during her first 100 days in office butshe has not yet introduced a proposal. Lightfoot hassince backed away from a plan endorsed by the Grassroots Alliance for Police Accountability, thatshe oncesupported. Following lastsummer’s civil unrestspurred by the Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd, political consultant Joanna Klonsky emailed topstaff members just before 5 p.m. on Saturday, May 30. Shesaid the mayor had requested a resolution condemning Floyd’s death and calling for justice. Lightfoot officials began drafting the resolution over the weekend. At one point during the flurry of correspondence that followed, policy chief Dan Luriesaidsuch a resolutionshould have a policy attached to it, not just words, or it mightset the “wrong tone otherwise.”Luriesaid the mayor’s officeshould include a civilian oversight proposal, and asked former Deputy Mayor for Public Safety Susan Leefor her thoughts. “We cannot include GAPA,”she responded. Luriesaid it’s the “obvious policy response” that “everyone will ask” about,so a failure to commit on the issue in a resolution “might actually fail on votes and public opinion at thesame time.”“We cansaysomething vague about committing to the value of more civilian oversight but nothingspecific about GAPA,” Lee countered. In response, Luriesaid: “OK Realize you’re in a crapspot Susan. Just voicing concern that this might not help things. But knowshe asked for itso I’m coolsending it on with addition ofsome oversight language.”Her answer: “Crapspot is putting it mildly, dude.”On the evening of June 2, Lightfootgave a televisedspeech from her City Hall office and promised to implement aseries of long-stalled police reforms,some of which had been languishing for years. Sign up for The Spin to get the topstories in politics delivered to your in box weekday afternoons.“It is essentially dead”The “crapspot” email isn’t the first time the topic of moving forward with a proposal on civilian police oversight came up in the emails. In March 2020, Lee asked Lightfoot’s chief ofstaff Maurice Classen about the civilian oversight plan oncesupported by Lightfoot.“Whatshould we do with GAPA? I know there is no bandwidth for this but if we don’t do this in April, it is essentially dead for 2020 and probably 3 more years,” Lee wrote ahead of the April 2020 City Council meeting.“Not all deadlines are created equal.”How to respond to a federal consent decree which requires an overhaul of the Chicago Police Department, is an ongoing issue at City Hall. Officialsare often faulted for failing to meet deadlines though the city emphasizes it’s improving. In one exchange between former deputy corporation counsel Caryn Jacobs and former Lightfoot deputy presssecretary Pat Mullane, Jacobs took issue with the proposed plan tosteer the narrative on efforts to catch up on missed consent decree deadlines. Jacobssuggested downplaying the deadline response issue.“Why would we emphasize the 55% failure rate? We want move away from these kinds of metrics. Indeed, in talking points that I wrote for the police, wesay that not all deadlines are created equal,”she wrote.‘Indoor dining’Early in the pandemic, Lightfoot and Governor JB Pritzker repeatedly clashed in private on COVID-19 mitigation measures. They mostly presented a unified front in public. Behind thescenes, however, Lightfoot’s City Hall team lastsummer considered defying Pritzker’s indoor dining ban. Topstaff members evenscheduled a meeting to discuss howsuch a move would play out.“There has beensome discussion that the Cityshould permit indoor dining in restaurants, even if otherwise prohibited understate order. The purpose of this call is to discuss what it would mean for the City to doso and how this would be operationalized,” onestaffer wrote in June 2020 to top-ranking Lightfoot administration officials. The plan never came to fruition butLightfoot was publicly critical of the governor when he closed indoor dining again in the fall.“I am very, very focused on getting our restaurants reopened. If we look at the various criteria that thestate hasset, we are meeting most if not all of those. So that’s a conversation that I will have with the governor,” Lightfootsaid at a June news conference about the city’s COVID-19 vaccine distributionsites. “But I want to get our restaurants and our bars reopened as quickly as possible.”‘Reforming these communities’One of former corporation counsel Mark Flessner’s top deputies, Caryn Jacobs, was asked to weigh in on astatement about the mayor’s position on aspects of police accountability and curbing violence in communities. In her note,she commented on “reforming these communities.”“I actually agree with the idea of reforming these communities. God knows valuessuch as intact families, education, work ethic, religion, etc. are the building blocks ofsuccess in allsocieties,”she wrote. “As young people, we think this is old fashioned. As we mature, wesee it is not only true, but that the alternatives lead to chaos.”gpratt@chicagotribune.comTwitter@royalpratt",1,2,Chicago Tribune
