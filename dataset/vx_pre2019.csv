5192,Marijuana: A wet blanket over your emotions,0.0,35.0,https://www.coloradodaily.com/2010/05/23/marijuana-a-wet-blanket-over-your-emotions/,https://adfontesmedia.com/colorado-daily-bias-and-reliability/,2010-05-23,www.coloradodaily.com,15,"Pot separates you from your feelings as it dissociates your thinking from the meaningful world. Many people smoke dope to get in a better mood. We call this “self-medicating.” Angry? Anxious? Worried? Smoke a joint and forget your problems for a while. The problem, though, is that sometimes this doesn’t work and instead you feel extremely anxious, afraid and paranoid. Since our reasoning processes are now turned off, when a bad feeling comes along, we have no way to soothe ourselves or discern whether there is legitimately something to be anxious about. Appropriate feelings that are associated with real things and events become distorted, twisted and lost, especially since we can’t track, remember and organize our perceptions. This may have to do with pot’s actions on our serotonin system: first it suppresses serotonin, then later, when you get drowsy, it stimulates it. Less serotonin activity equals more agitation; more equals lower arousal. During this artificial messing around with our brain, feelings get repressed or buried. This may temporarily feel like an improvement, but meanwhile we have lost the opportunity to act based on our emotions. Where do they go? We don’t just lose those feelings. They don’t just take off and fly away like angry butterflies. They stay in our body and when we don’t express them, act on them or soothe them by actively processing them, weird things happen. They are like unhappy energy that will find a distorted or twisted way out sooner or later. Between periods of being stoned, people often become irritable and let these emotional charges out in sideways bursts that now have little or nothing to do with what’s going on. Pot is a wet blanket over your emotions. Over time, we lose the ability to respond and react to our feelings, surroundings and life in general. This becomes worse over time and a chronic problem. When potheads finally stop smoking, these buried feelings, usually bad ones, come flooding out. Several weeks of anger, anxiety and depression are the result. This is withdrawal from marijuana. This powerful and agitated irritability is difficult to get through and the urge to smoke more to cool it off will be intense, but that only extends the withdrawal. Long-term pot use makes people depressed. Add to this the responsibilities that we haven’t been taking care of, the things we haven’t been dealing with and the problems we’ve been neglecting, and you have a real mess on your hands. The suppression of emotions becomes a habit in your neuronal circuitry, which is learning that, “I guess he/she really doesn’t want to have any feelings.” After a while, it may occur to you that you no longer have much of a personality left, including that sense of humor where, in the beginning, everything seemed so hilarious. Heavy daily use of pot is guaranteed to produce depression and apathy (why bother?). No clear feelings equals no motivation. “I’ll just be a ski bum and bus tables the rest of my life.” It also creates impotence for the boys (by increasing estrogen and decreasing testosterone), messes with your sleep and dream cycles (can’t fall asleep, too busy in your brain; then can’t wake up and you forget about early morning appointments, classes, etc.). If you ever had an edge, it’ll be gone after smoking dope for a while. In the next article, we’ll explore more of the physical and quality of life issues with marijuana. John Gilburt is the director of theBoulder Alcohol Education Center Inc. FAQ based on articleNot necessarily. While marijuana use might alter your mood and emotions, it can also distort your feelings, making them less connected to reality. Feelings associated with real things and events may become twisted and lost, which might distance you from your true emotions. A2: Yes, weed can numb your emotions. The use of marijuana can repress or bury feelings, creating a disconnect between the user and their emotions. This emotional suppression can feel like an improvement initially, but it can also prevent the user from appropriately responding to their feelings and their surroundings. A3: Cannabis can interfere with the serotonin system. Initially, it suppresses serotonin, leading to agitation, and later it can stimulate serotonin when you start feeling drowsy, leading to lower arousal. A4: Yes, consistent usage of weed can numb feelings. It acts as a ‘wet blanket’ over emotions, resulting in a loss of the ability to respond and react appropriately to feelings and life circumstances. A5: Regular marijuana users may become irritable and display emotional outbursts that are disconnected from the current situation. This anger could be the result of repressed feelings that were not processed while under the influence of marijuana. A6: When regular marijuana users stop smoking, they often experience a surge of previously repressed feelings, usually negative ones. This can lead to several weeks of anger, anxiety, and depression, commonly known as marijuana withdrawal. A7: Yes, long-term use of marijuana to numb feelings can have severe consequences. It can result in depression, a loss of personality traits such as humor, decreased motivation, and an overall sense of apathy. Further, it might lead to other issues like impotence in males, disturbed sleep patterns, and forgetfulness. A8: Cannabis emotional detachment refers to the phenomenon where regular marijuana use results in the suppression or numbing of emotions. This can lead to the user feeling disconnected from their feelings and less responsive to their environment.

4826,Suspicions Growing Over Death of Journalist Probing NSA and CIA Abuses,20.67,30.33,https://thenewamerican.com/journalist-probing-nsa-and-cia-abuses-dies-in-mysterious-crash/,https://adfontesmedia.com/the-new-american-bias-and-reliability/,2013-07-08,thenewamerican.com,16,"Weeks after the fiery death of investigative journalist Michael Hastings (shown), who was probing abuses by the CIA and NSA and had recently informed others that he was being investigated by federal authorities, suspicions about his mysterious car crash are still swirling around the Internet. While police officially ruled the death an “accident,” serious questions are still surfacing — even in the establishment media and among prominent officials. Based on e-mails Hastings sent out shortly before he died about working on a “big story” and needing to go “off the radar,” it has become clear that he was worried, too. Hastings, who wrote for, BuzzFeed, Gawker, and other publications, was probably best known for his award-winning 2010 article “The Runaway General.” The piece helped bring down U. S. Gen. Stanley McChrystal, commander of American and NATO forces in Afghanistan. Despite his establishment credentials and what analysts called his “Democrat-friendly” reporting, Hastings had become extremely alarmed about the “surveillance state” and other troubling developments in recent months. His last published story: “Why Democrats Love To Spy On Americans.”When the Obama administration was exposed spying on journalists earlier this year, the investigative reporter blasted what he referred to as the president’s “war” on journalism. “The Obama administration has clearly declared war on the press. It has declared war on investigative journalists — our sources,” he said during arecent TV interview, blasting the administration’s lawless behavior, obsession with secrecy, and vicious persecution of whistleblowers. Beyond simple criticism, though, Hastings openly said it was time for journalists to fight back.“I think the only recourse to this kind of behavior by the government is to say back to the government, ‘we declare war on you,’ and from this point forward, we should no longer — the media as a whole — cooperate in any manner with the government,” he continued. “We should withdraw all our cooperation and we should publish everything we know, because it’s a free press, it’s not a free-except-for-when-the-government-tells-me-to-do-it press, and we’ve been way too easygoing with these guys.”Less than 24 hours before his death, Hastings made it crystal clear that he was concerned about his own well-being. In ane-mailsent to numerous contacts and his employer, for example, Hastings noted: “The Feds are interviewing my ‘close friends and associates.’” He also said that if authorities show up, it “may be wise to immediately request legal counsel before any conversations or interviews about our news-gathering practices or related journalism issues.” The subject line read: “FBI investigation re: NSA.” Perhaps most alarming of all, the e-mail concluded with this: “Also: I’m onto a big story, and need to go off the rada[r] for a bit.”While some friends and family members are reportedly too frightened to speak out, at least one recipient of the e-mail has gone public. Staff Sgt. Joseph Biggs, who became friends with Hastings while the journalist was embedded with his unit in Afghanistan in 2008,toldKTLA that the “very panicked” message “alarmed me very much.” According to Biggs, “I just said it doesn’t seem like him. I don’t know, I just had this gut feeling and it just really bothered me.”Biggs has spoken toFox Newsand other major media outlets as well, saying Hastings was working on “the biggest story yet” about the CIA and that Hastings’ wife vowed to “take down whoever did this.” Apparently Hastings “drove like a grandma.” In anextended interviewwith radio host Alex Jones, Biggs also said he knew Hastings was receiving “death threats” from military brass. The retired staff sergeant added that he was extremely suspicious about his friend’s death and vowed to do everything in his power to find out what happened. Heavy-hitters from the government sector have expressed concerns, too. Former U. S. National Coordinator for Security, Infrastructure Protection, and Counter-terrorism Richard Clarke, for example,toldin late June that the deadly car crash was “consistent with a car cyber-attack.” Intelligence agencies for major powers — including the U. S. government — almost certainly know how to remotely seize control of a car, he added.“What has been revealed as a result of some research at universities is that it’s relatively easy to hack your way into the control system of a car, and to do such things as cause acceleration when the driver doesn’t want acceleration, to throw on the brakes when the driver doesn’t want the brakes on, to launch an air bag,” Clarke continued. “You can do some really highly destructive things now, through hacking a car, and it’s not that hard…. So if there were a cyber-attack on the car — and I’m not saying there was — I think whoever did it would probably get away with it.”So far, the FBI has denied that it was investigating Hastings. However, on June 19, the day after the mysterious crash, WikiLeaks released what has been interpreted as a bomb-shell to some analysts monitoring the investigation. “Michael Hastings contacted WikiLeaks lawyer Jennifer Robinson just a few hours before he died, saying that the FBI was investigating him,” the whistleblowing organizationsaidthrough its official Twitter account, sparkingworldwidepress coverage. The allegation has not been independently confirmed. According to the official investigation of the crash, Hastings ran a red light and was driving over 100 miles per hour in his brand-new Mercedes in the early morning when he suddenly crashed into a tree, causing his car to burst into a bizarre fiery inferno. The engine was found more than 150 feet from the wreck. Local news outlets in California, meanwhile, are reporting that the police report is still not publicly available and that officials have been ordered not to comment on the case. The crash itself has also been ringing alarm bells among experts and analysts. On San Diego 6 News, national security reporter Kimberly Dvorak, for example, recently took to the air andtalked about her conversations with sourcessurrounding the crash after spending a day in Los Angeles investigating. Noting that the police report was not available, she said law enforcement and fire department officials refused to comment, with some saying they had been instructed not to say anything. “That kind of stands out; we look at the NSA, the government says if you have nothing to hide, don’t worry,” she said. Military officials, meanwhile, told Dvorak that the fire was “extremely hot” and “not something we normally see,” the reporter continued. The fact that the engine was between 150 and 250 feet behind the car was also strange, according to university physics professors she spoke with — it should have been in front, if anything. Another interesting fact highlighted in the report: There were no skid marks at the accident scene. Mercedes, she added, insists that their cars do not blow up. In fact, the company has a reputation for building some of the safest cars in the world, but Mercedes has not yet been contacted by authorities, according to a statement. Citing a 2010 study from a California university, Dvorak also noted that it is possible to “hack into the car system and operate the accelerator, the brakes, windshield wipers, light, steering,” and more using a simple iPad. Car experts have also expressed skepticism about the official narrative. “I’m here to state that I’ve seen dozens of cars hit walls and stuff at high speeds and the number of them that I have observed to eject their powertrains and immediately catch massive fire is, um, ah, zero,”notedJack Baruth, editor of. “Modern cars are very good at not catching fire in accidents. The Mercedes-Benz C-Class, which is an evolutionary design from a company known for sweating the safety details over and above the Euro NCAP requirements, should be leading the pack in the not-catching-on-fire category.”“Nor is the C-Class known for sudden veering out of control into trees and whatnot,” continued Baruth, who has a professional racing license as well. “Mr. Hastings’ aggressively Democrat-friendly storytelling has the Internet already considering the idea that his death was engineered somehow. I can’t say it’s totally unlikely. As noted above, the reported (and videotaped) behavior of the C250 was not in line with what we’d expect.”It would not be the first time that a prominent journalist taking on the establishment has died under suspicious circumstances. Conservative-leaning alternative-media giantAndrew Breitbart, for example, promised to reveal information that would destroy the Obama machine. Shortly before the highly anticipated release, the 43-year-old died of “heart failure.” Two months later, the county coroner who conducted Breitbart’s autopsy waspoisoned. Before that, investigative journalistGary Webb, who exposed CIA cocaine trafficking, supposedly “committed suicide” with two bullets to the head after publicly expressing his concerns that he would be killed. The list could go on. Of course, it is now common knowledge that the administrationbelievesit can extra-judicially murder anyone — including Americans — whom Obama claims is a threat to the “Homeland.” No charges or trial are required, and indeed, the president has alreadyopenly murdered Americanslike Anwar al Awlaki and his young son without even charging them with a crime — let alone securing a conviction by a jury in a court of law. Whether Hastings was murdered remains uncertain, but there is little doubt that the circumstances of his death were extremely suspicious. The New American, covering economics, politics, and more.

5155,"8chan, the central hive of Gamergate, is also an active pedophile network",-3.33,42.0,https://www.dailydot.com/debug/8chan-pedophiles-child-porn-gamergate,https://adfontesmedia.com/daily-dot-bias-and-reliability/,2014-11-17,www.dailydot.com,15,"The banner of free speech flies high above8chan.co, the central hive of Gamergate, where thousands of users have converged in recent weeks to build their movement. But clinging to that noble First Amendment ideal is a community of pedophiles, walking just barely on the right side of the law. On numerous public forums, 8chan users share graphic images of children, plus links to hardcore child pornography. No content is hidden. Thousands of posts are accessible within two clicks of the homepage.8chan’s founder, Fredrick Brennan, created the site in response to what he sees as the ongoing and vast loss of free speech on the Internet. On 8chan, “anyone can say what they want and mean,” Brennan told the Daily Dot. It’s easy to find what Brennan calls “proof” of his ironclad commitment to free speech: numerous forums filled with radically sexualized images of little girls and boys. Alongside photos of children in varying states of undress, guided intomodel poses by unseen older hands, user-submitted stories chronicle their interactions with children.• • •8chan has been around since Oct. 2013, but it was4chan’s expulsion of Gamergate, a group of anti-feminist crusaders, that set off an explosion in 8chan’s popularity. The site is now the indisputable home base of a popular but divisive online movement. Gamergate has been described as a modern culture war between left and right. The side that most 8channers land on is clear. Advocates say Gamergate champions fairness and transparency in journalism. Critics call it a delusional and violent harassment campaign against women in the gaming industry and their allies. The discussion first spread on 4chan’s video game forum after a blog post inspired death threats against a female game developer. 4chan founder Christopher “moot” Poole banned the conversation, allegedly because it violated 4chan’s rules against harassment. The promise of unrestricted chatter led Gamergate to 8chan. Brennan welcomed the group with open arms, and some of the Internet’s right-leaning political activists made 8chan a cause celebre. Brennan now calls 8chan a “free-speech-friendly 4chan alternative.”It’s odd for some to hear 4chan thought of as a restricted community. The site, known for years of high-profile online pranks against everything from major corporations to 11-year-old girls, has always had a mainstream reputation as an anything-goes free-for-all. Brennan unceremoniously rejects that idea. He called 4chan “authoritarian” and accused it of turning into a soulless for-profit venture.• • •Free speech, two simple words that evoke a torrent of political emotion in the West, is simultaneously the flag raised above our most important self-expression and the shield protecting some of humanity’s most nauseating acts. When some of the biggest and most influential websites on the Internet—such as massive communities like 4chan andReddit—are criticized for hosting abhorrent material, you can be sure you’ll hear those two words repeated ad nauseum in their defense. When redditors postupskirt photos of unsuspecting women in public: free speech. When 4channersharass a preteen girlto the point of needing police protection: free speech. When one of Reddit’smost popular communitiesis dedicated to a celebration of bigotry: free speech. Of course, the issue is often more complicated than a simple two-step like that. Pageviews, profit motives, corporate parents, public relations, and the basic morality of community administrators all influence site rules and enforcement. Reddit and 4chan have defended grisly content in the past with the words “free speech,” but each has adopted a progressively stricter rule set as it’s grown more popular.“We stand for free speech,” Reddit’s former CEO Yishan Wong oncesaidin response to a wave of controversy that washed over the site because of a forum dedicated to surreptitious, sexualized shots of women on the street known as “creepshots.”Still, many redditors don’t feel that the site adequately allows them to exercise their right to free speech. So that movement, too, migrated in a small way to 8chan. It’s shown up several times on 8chan but has died off repeatedly because of inactivity. In truth, creepshots is still anactive movementon Reddit. Under increasingly bright spotlights, both Reddit and 4chan now regularly ban some technically legal but controversial content that was once deemed acceptable.8chan strives to be different.• • •On 8chan’s pedophile forums, users insult and dismiss most anyone who might object to the content they’re sharing, calling them “moralfags.”Moralfags, the thinking goes, are not worth listening to because the self-described pedophiles, hebephiles, and ephebophiles (each word specifies the age of children that an adult is sexually attracted to) who populate these forums have heard “moralfag arguments” a million times already. No amount of indignant Internet posting, they reason, changes the fact that they’re attracted to children, or that they want to look at sexualized images of them. So ignoring or berating the inevitable crusaders is the only retort they have. Several 8chan forums feature children as young as toddlers dressed in swimsuits or thongs and posed suggestively. If this isn’t outright illegal hardcore child pornography, it’s walking up to the line of the law and spitting over it with a smirk.8chan’s userbase leans conservative, says Brennan, although there are left-leaning forums too, such as /marx/ and /leftypol/. 8chan’s supporters laud the aggressive political allegiance to free speech. According to Brennan, “the very fact that the boards are full of things that your average person (myself included) would find reprehensible” proves his site is dedicated to unrestricted conversation. “Once you get past all of the terrible content posted by teenagers to feel cool, you get to very interesting discussions and opinions that could simply not happen on Reddit or Facebook,” he said. Public traffic data for 8chan.co is not available, but Brennan said the site “has held steady at a little over 1 million page views per day, 35,000 unique visitors per day, and 400,000 posts per week for the last few weeks.”The site’s biggest boards are not pedophile-centric. Instead, many of 8chan’s most active boards are political. These are where Brennan’s “very interesting discussions” occur. Self-described conservatives make up the majority of these boards. “Our largest politics board, /pol/, is very right-leaning,” Brennan explained. I checked into /pol/ to take a sampling of the content. I saw discussion of small-government Republicanism, angry criticism of “n****r culture,” a long thread saying Bill Cosby’s alleged rape victims are faking it, and multiple rants against Muslim immigration to the West. Brennan is himself a registered Republican, he told me, but only so that he could vote (for Ron Paul). 8chan has boards visited by people across the political spectrum, but there’s no doubt where the majority weighs in. The right-wing ideology that permeates the site is made evident by 8channers’ preoccupation with feminism and other liberal ideologies, which they see as the root of evil. That’s not a surprise, given that Gamergate was the major catalyst for 8chan’s popularity.• • •“I don’t give a shit about what any news agency has to say about me or my website,” Brennan told me. “I only care what law-enforcement agencies have to say.”He said he expects regular backlash, but “I don’t care about media crocodile tears for pageviews.”With that, he dismissed the idea that a journalist might have genuine concern about a website hosting photos of what many would call sexual abuse of small children. In his caricature of the media, reporters aren’t human beings so much as they’re digital machines fueled by advertising dollars. I asked him about a forum called /doll/, which hosts provocative photos of barely clothed little girls.“If you want /doll/ shut down,” he countered, “you should instead focus on the studios who are producing this content. Some of them are even legally based in the USA. That’s the real story here, not some perverts posting them online after the fact.”The photos already exist, Brennan argues. So what if he’s building a directory through which they can be shared and discussed? In other words: Someone else is in the wrong already, and he’s merely using the fruits of that labor. Brennan’s 8chan hosts no advertising, it should be noted, but he does solicit donations on top of every page on the site. According to records fromhis Bitcoin walletandPatreon page, Brennan receives about $1,500 in monthly donations from 8chan’s users. In Brennan’s eyes, his only responsibility is to free speech and the laws that govern the United States, where his website is hosted. If the laws get too restrictive, he noted, other options are available. Do thoroughly sexualized images of small children qualify as free speech? The images found on 8chan are often legal “softcore” photos in which the content does not definitively qualify as sexually explicit, i.e. featuring simulated sex, intercourse, and visible genitalia. The tone and context of 8chan’s forums make the sexual references clear, however, and there are multiple threads throughout the site in which users discuss and link directly to hardcore child pornography. Much closer to a pure free-speech issue are 8chan forums like /younglove/. Rather than feature photos of children, this forum emphasizes safe discussion between pedophiles, the sort of interaction that many can’t get in real life. On /younglove/, pedophiles gather to discuss their urges, lament what they perceive as their persecution, and ask about how others interact with children.“I tend to do ‘childish’ things that tend to annoy other adults,” one anonymous poster wrote. “People constantly complain that I’m ‘making noises’, tapping on things, playing with the buttons, windows and vents while in a car. One time at a party I was just kinda sitting there ripping up the dirt with a stick. A cute girl about 5 came over and asked me why I was doing it and wanted to join me. So I was wondering if it might be some kind of unintentional thing pedos to do ‘attract’ kids.”Some observers doubtlessly read conversations like this as sharing strategies for grooming children to become victims, but the pedophiles themselves see it differently. The discussions are, they say, a chance to open up in ways that they simply can’t in day-to-day life. The freedom to post sexualized images of children on sites like 8chan is a signpost not just for those who enjoy them. The fact that those photos are fair game sends other users a clear message straight from the top of 8chan: Brennan is truly dedicated to his ideals of free speech with as few limits as possible. Pedophiles, likelythe Internet’s most reviled subculture, are among the digital groups most heavily targeted by police. Wherever in cyberspace they are able to survive despite pressure from the law, it’s seen as signal to others that the coast is clear. When law enforcementshut down 27 Dark Net sitesin a global police operation last week, the chaos led many to wonder if theToranonymity network had been profoundly compromised. One early sign that Tor was not totally broken was that the Dark Net’s biggest child pornography sites survived and even thrived under the police pressure. Much of the rest of the Dark Net’s diverse population, even those whose stomachs turn at the very mention of child porn, took that as a sign that all was not lost. I asked Brennan if child pornography and the kind of pedophilic content found on 8chan are inevitable fixtures in the landscape of hardcore free-speech zones like his website.“Unfortunately, yes,” he said. “I don’t support the content on the boards you mentioned, but it is simply the cost of free speech and being the only active site to not impose more ‘laws’ than those that were passed in Washington, D. C.”Brennan sees his site as a bulwark against an Internet that he believes is in rapid decline, one losing free speech and gaining surveillance.“I hope that with my help we’ll [be] heading towards more free speech, but I fear that the reality is that we’re heading towards less,” he explained. “All the major discussion sites are owned by large money-grubbing corporations, and their platforms are closed source. It’s incredibly toxic.”Toxicity that, in Brennan’s opinion, warrants the images of child abuse his users are sharing right now.• • •Brennan’s personal dream of free speech is idealistic and popular, but ultimately an abdication of responsibility for the role consumers of this content—and administrators of these websites—play in a realm where children are victimized.8chan’s servers run within the United States, but the site is not bound by the U. S. Constitution. Brennan has no obligation to the First Amendment. The rules that govern his website are strictly his own decision. As such, there’s one person who is ultimately responsible for what is allowed on 8chan: Brennan himself.",3,Reliable,0.1228580366080366,0.4908640646140649,2954,2954
4380,What’s the right way to ask whether someone is gay?,-1.67,45.67,https://www.cjr.org/the_experiment/whats_the_right_way_to_ask_whether_someone_is_gay.php,https://adfontesmedia.com/columbia-journalism-review-bias-and-reliability/,2015-05-01,www.cjr.org,18,"Should you care if your celebrity crush is gay? When a journalist inquires about someone’s sexual preference, the question can seem intrusive. The awkward moment when Barbara Walters once pushed Ricky Martin to say he’s gay is best left back in 2000. Ten years later, Walters said publicly, “Unless someone is openly gay and happy to talk about it, it’s nobody’s business—including mine.” In a recent interview with Out magazine, Jack Falahee, an actor from, was asked if he’s gay. He described the question as “reductive.”On the other hand, Diane Sawyer’s ABC interview with Bruce Jenner about his transgender identity exemplifies the potential for increasing diverse LGBTQ media representation. So isn’t it a journalist’s job to ask about their sources’ true identities, even if that means inquiring about who they sleep with? “That’s often the mistake. It’s not a question about sex,” says Lucas Grindley, editorial director and vice president of Here Media, which ownsandOutmagazine. “It’s definitely a visibility issue, it matters,” says Grindley. The ethical challenge shouldn’t be about whether to ask or not, but about whether this question fits into the story. The media has entered an experimental age. The means by which we gather information, filter our thoughts, write our stories or produce our videos, all of it has changed. But what has received far less attention is the basic ethical rules of the road that have governed journalism for decades. It is not just the conventionally forbidden “gay” question, but the media’s approach to privacy in general, its ambiguity over how to appropriately use social media as a reporting tool, and its vague frame for evaluating what the standard for “objective” ought to be. The presumption is that it shouldn’t matter because it’s such a small detail. But if it’s such a small detail, then why shouldn’t the question be asked?These ethical dilemmas confront journalists on an almost daily basis. What details are necessary to the audience’s understanding of a story? What about getting information from tweets or by friending sources on Facebook or Instagram in order to gain information? The transparency of social media can easily turn salacious, or at least blur the lines between journalist and source. The internet gives overlooked voices the ability to connect directly and in real time with journalists, or to publicly complain about what they read. And as a result, journalists are subject to a new system of checks and balances, not just from their editors but from an engaged and connected audience. And for journalism to better serve audiences, ethical standards that have bound us for decades must be re-evaluated. Do the old rules of keeping your opinions separate from your work still matter to modern consumers? How do journalists reconcile their increased access into the private lives of sources, through social media, and keep a professional distance?Kelly McBride, vice president of academic programs at The Poynter Institute, says the ethical code of journalism is part of an ongoing conversation. “Ethics is not something that you fix and then you’re done with it,” says McBride. “The reason that you can get a masters degree in journalism but you can’t get a masters degree in plumbing is because journalism is this highly complicated, theoretical phenomenon that has real-life, practical, daily implications.”Illustration by Raúl AllenIn the category of what’s appropriate and what’s not during an interview, questioning both gender and sexual identity is clearly a current topic. Think transgender actress Laverne Cox, who is one of the most popular characters on, or Oregon Gov. Kate Brown, the first openly bisexual governor in US history. Yet, asking about someone’s sexuality is still debated among journalists. Publications such asThe AdvocateandOuthave specific political slants, and they lean toward asking. “The presumption is that it shouldn’t matter because it’s such a small detail,” saysThe Advocate’s Grindley. “But if it’s such a small detail, then why shouldn’t the question be asked?”An individual’s sexuality isn’t always a key descriptor for every story. “I would almost always say that a person’s sexual orientation is irrelevant,” says Poynter’s McBride. “You have to demonstrate that the person’s sexual orientation is relevant to the story and in most cases it’s not going to be.”Relevance is also the deciding factor for Mike Semel, local editor of. Semel says he would defer to the individual’s right to privacy unless sexual identity is directly relevant to the story. “If we’re doing a story about the cherry blossom festival, we’re not going to ask the sexual orientation of the guy organizing it,” says Semel.s coverage of the NSA shooting in Washington, DC in March presented Semel and his staff with a unique decision: “We didn’t have any names but we wrote that the two guys [who were actually trans women] in the vehicle had spent the night with another guy in a motel on Route 1 in Howard County and stolen his car.” Semel says the vehicle detail made this background relevant, but no assumptions were made about the men’s sexual activities or identities. “We say what we know and people might draw their own conclusions from that, but we did not say that there was sex going on,” says Semel. There is, however, an important distinction to be made between sexual practice and sexual identity. Steven Petrow, a columnist forand former president of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalist Association, says, “For all too long, journalists have thought that questions about someone’s sexual orientation were off the grid—not to do so renders LGBT people invisible, which has other consequences, too.” Petrow recalls howThe New York Timesself-censored its obituary of Father Mychal Judge, a beloved priest killed during the Sept. 11 World Trade Center attacks. Though Father Judge’s sexual orientation was an important part of his identity, says Petrow, this detail was left out of theTimes’article. Petrow’s work with the NLGJA involved reaching out to newsrooms to normalize this conversation around sexual identity. The solution, says Petrow, is asking about identity in a manner that applies to anyone: Do you have a partner or spouse? “If you’re going to do it for a heterosexual person, how do you do it the same way, and why shouldn’t you do it the same way, for an LGBT person?”The problem is when we depend on a label as the only thing that defines us. Jase Peeples recently wrote an op-ed for Advocate.com in reaction tomagazine’s February interview with Falahee, arguing that Falahee’s answer is flawed. Since Falahee plays a gay character, fans speculate about his sexuality in real life. In the interview, Falahee states, “I don’t think answering who I’m sleeping with accomplishes anything other than quenching the thirst of curiosity.”But his interviewer, Shana Krochmal, also disagrees. “It matters for people who are still continuing to look for themselves or a version of themselves in media and representation and don’t see themselves there as much as they feel like they would want to,” says Krochmal. As a contributor toand executive editor of ETOnline.com, Krochmal’s business is writing for an audience that wants to know celebrities inside and out. And that includes sexuality.“I don’t think there’s anything rude in a context where you’re talking about someone’s personal life to ask them about their sexuality or who they’re dating,” says Krochmal. “I don’t think it should be a question that is only asked by an outlet like.” As long as the question isn’t asked with some hidden agenda, says Krochmal, it’s a journalist’s job to ask the questions that everyone else is wondering. Peeples says that we can’t afford to be cavalier and pretend it’s not a problem. It’s easier for people living in urban, progressive cities such as Los Angeles or New York to be open about their sexuality, says Peeples, but not every person has that luxury. “What about that 15-year-old kid in the middle of Kansas, who perhaps doesn’t have access to basic information about LGBT people and is afraid to look it up because their parents keep an eye on what they look at online?”Beyond the ethics of directly asking about sexuality, journalists can now search Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and other platforms for information that a source might not want to tell a reporter. Is it appropriate for a reporter to peer into the lives of their subjects, just because social media gives them a wide-open window? Journalists now write for audiences that are increasingly socially active and capable of engaging with reporters and editors on their own turf. That 15-year-old from Kansas could tweet about something he believes the writer did wrong, and within an hour that tweet could go viral. What hasn’t changed is the philosophy around what social media material should and shouldn’t be used by journalists. This question is further complicated when sources are underaged. McBride says journalists and editors for the most part no longer question the use of social media, but rather how the platforms are used. “It’s a tool just like the telephone or email,” says McBride. “You can’t just call people up on the telephone and trick them into talking to you, right? It’s generally accepted that you’ll reveal who you are.” Along those same lines, says McBride, a reporter can’t just walk into a high school cafeteria and start interviewing students without proper permission. So what’s the difference between that and walking into the social media life of a teenager through their Facebook or Twitter account?On the other hand, public social media accounts can provide invaluable insight about a journalist’s subject. Semel says one of the first timesfirst used social media was during the Virginia Tech shooting. People inside the building were posting on Facebook, giving reporters unique access. “Before we were able to make the four hour drive down to Blacksburg, we were interviewing these people on the phone,” says Semel. For Nicole Santa Cruz, areporter who writes The Homicide Report, social media is also useful but Santa Cruz says she doesn’t use it as a crutch in her reporting. “I’ve seen tons of stuff on social media which I could use if I wanted to, but how much is it going to add and what’s the public’s right to know versus the privacy of the individual?” In reporting for features on homicide victims, Santa Cruz says she has used information from public social media accounts, but only to supplement victim descriptions. Santa Cruz has followed hashtags that memorialize a victim or link to gang member profiles because these windows are especially useful in reporting on closed-off communities. In a feature about two South LA men killed by gang violence, Santa Cruz included a description of a video from one victim’s Instagram account. Another Homicide Report article was about an Orange County shooting victim, and Santa Cruz reached out to the girl’s friends through Facebook to interview them. Andy Carvin is another journalist whose reporting brings him in close contact with social media. Carvin’s coverage of the Arab Spring through Twitter received a lot of attention, mostly—but not all—good. “I think there are plenty of reasons to debate and critique my methods, but I only know of a few people who completely reject outright how I work—but I don’t lose sleep over them.”At the end of 2014, Carvin launched reported.ly, a six-person social media reporting team based in the US and Europe. Carvin says he views his team’s work, which reports through social media platforms such as Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit, as a complement to traditional reporting rather than a challenge. “We managed to tackle thestory less than 48 hours after our launch,” says Carvin. “We’re taking bits and pieces of traditional newsgathering and production and figuring out how to make them work when dealing with social media.”The ethical challenge shouldn’t be about whether to ask, but about whether this question fits into the story. As journalists find smart new ways of benefiting from direct relationships with their audiences, they must also monitor their own digital personas. A common feature on the Twitter profiles of countless journalists is the phrase “All opinions are mine,” an effort to uphold that elusive goal of objectivity. But McBride argues that social media challenges objectivity since the whole point is to share your experiences and be transparent about who you are. “How authentic can you be as a journalist on social media?” says McBride. “Social media is your front yard, not your backyard, but it feels like your backyard.”While the ethics of social media are complicated, there’s another question that has defined journalism up until now: How do we draw the line between our own opinions and the subject we’re reporting on? Our audiences can now choose from an increasing selection of information sources, some objective and some slanted. Perhaps the age of objectivity is ending. But for many news organizations, objective reporting is important for their business model. Advertisers are more willing to buy space when they know their content will reach a broad, rather than niche, audience. At, objective reporting is also an ethical requirement. “If you have some sort of personal stake in something, you’re not going to cover that issue forThe Washington Post,” says Semel. “If you’re on the board of a college, you’re not going to cover higher education issues.”But do these ethical standards still apply when an issue crosses over from opinion to personal experience? In February, Diane Rehm, host of the NPR-distributed, came under fire for contributing to fundraising campaigns for an end-of-life organization, a subject she reported on after her husband died last year due to Parkinson’s disease. Rehm’s support for the organization violated a newly clarified NPR ethics code that prohibits all NPR journalists from speaking at fundraisers that challenge the impartiality of their reporting. McBride disagrees with this stance. “She lived this experience,” says McBride. “Why would you not let her act on it and then as an organization figure out a way to still present a neutral product to your readers or your consumers?”NPR’s Ombudsman and Public Editor Elizabeth Jensen says the underlying issue of a journalist’s objectivity is earning the audience’s trust. “If you feel so strongly about an issue (one that you regularly cover) that you choose to raise money for it then your opinion has crossed a line,” says Jensen. “There’s a difference between opinion and advocacy.”Objective journalism, without any slant, is a matter of presenting facts accurately, honestly, and with professionalism, says Jensen, but impartial reporting is a trickier concept. “The answer to a biased study from one side of the political spectrum is not an equally biased study from the other side,” says Jensen. “It’s one thing to state an opinion, another to state it constantly without acknowledging other opinions, or to spend excessive amounts of time on it.” On the other hand, Jensen says there’s room for both kinds of journalism, since known facts can be combined with opinion to form an argument with a point of view. Ultimately, the ethical issues of journalism are best handled case by case, using what Jensen describes as those “ ‘you know it when you see it’ judgment calls.”That’s no doubt true. But to see it, journalists must dare themselves to break from past protocols and establish a set of ethics in sync with today’s era of experimental media.",3,Reliable,0.1027294311917744,0.4275028539568284,3387,3387
1813,The War Was Won Before Hiroshima—And the Generals Who Dropped the Bomb Knew It,-13.33,29.33,https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/why-the-us-really-bombed-hiroshima/,https://adfontesmedia.com/nation-bias-and-reliability/,2015-08-06,www.thenation.com,25,"Visitors to the National Air and Space Museum—America’s shrine to the technological leading edge of the military-industrial complex—hear a familiar narrative from the tour guides in front of the Enola Gay, the plane that dropped an atomic weapon on the civilians of Hiroshima 70 years ago today. The bomb was dropped, they say, to save the lives of thousands of Americans who would otherwise have been killed in an invasion of Japan’s home islands. Hiroshima and Nagasaki were largely destroyed, and the lives of 135,000 to 300,000 mostly Japanese women, children, and old people were sacrificed—most young men were away at war—as the result of a terrible but morally just calculus aimed at bringing an intractable war to a close. This story may assuage the conscience of the air museum visitor, but it is largely myth, fashioned to buttress our memories of the “good” war. By and large, the top generals and admirals who managed World War II knew better. Consider the small and little-noticed plaque hanging in the National Museum of the US Navy that accompanies the replica of “Little Boy,” the weapon used against the people of Hiroshima: In its one paragraph, it makes clear that Truman’s political advisers overruled the military in determining how the end of the war with Japan would be approached. Furthermore, contrary to the popular myths around the atomic bomb’s nearly magical power to end the war, the Navy Museum’s explication of the history clearly indicates that “the vast destruction wreaked by the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the loss of 135,000 people made little impact on the Japanese military.” Indeed, it would have been surprising if they had: Despite the terrible concentrated power of atomic weapons, the firebombing of Tokyo earlier in 1945 and the destruction of numerous Japanese cities by conventional bombing killed far more people. The Navy Museum acknowledges what many historians have long known: It was only with the entry of the Soviet Union’s Red Army into the war two days after the bombing of Hiroshima that the Japanese moved to finally surrender. Japan was used to losing cities to American bombing; what their military leaders feared more was the destruction of the country’s military by an all-out Red Army assault. “The use of this barbarous weapon…was of no material assistance in our war against Japan.” —Adm. William Leahy, Truman's Chief of Staff The top American military leaders who fought World War II, much to the surprise of many who are not aware of the record, were quite clear that the atomic bomb was unnecessary, that Japan was on the verge of surrender, and—for many—that the destruction of large numbers of civilians was immoral. Most were also conservatives, not liberals. Adm. William Leahy, Truman’s chief of staff, wrote in his 1950 memoir I Was There that “the use of this barbarous weapon at Hiroshima and Nagasaki was of no material assistance in our war against Japan. The Japanese were already defeated and ready to surrender.… In being the first to use it, we…adopted an ethical standard common to the barbarians of the Dark Ages. I was not taught to make war in that fashion, and wars cannot be won by destroying women and children.” The commanding general of the US Army Air Forces, Henry “Hap” Arnold, gave a strong indication of his views in a public statement 11 days after Hiroshima was attacked. Asked on August 17 by a New York Times reporter whether the atomic bomb caused Japan to surrender, Arnold said that “the Japanese position was hopeless even before the first atomic bomb fell, because the Japanese had lost control of their own air.” “It was a mistake.... [the scientists] had this toy and they wanted to try it out, so they dropped it.” —Adm. William “Bull” Halsey Fleet Adm. Chester Nimitz, the commander in chief of the Pacific Fleet, stated in a public address at the Washington Monument two months after the bombings that “the atomic bomb played no decisive part, from a purely military standpoint, in the defeat of Japan.” Adm. William “Bull” Halsey Jr., the commander of the US Third Fleet, stated publicly in 1946 that “the first atomic bomb was an unnecessary experiment…. It was a mistake to ever drop it…. [The scientists] had this toy, and they wanted to try it out, so they dropped it…” Gen. Dwight Eisenhower stated in his memoirs that when notified by Secretary of War Henry Stimson of the decision to use atomic weapons, he “voiced to him my grave misgivings, first on the basis of my belief that Japan was already defeated and that dropping the bomb was completely unnecessary, and secondly because I thought that our country should avoid shocking world opinion by the use of a weapon whose employment was, I thought, no longer mandatory as a measure to save American lives.” He later publicly declared, “It wasn’t necessary to hit them with that awful thing.” Even the famous hawk Maj. Gen. Curtis LeMay, the head of the Twenty-First Bomber Command, went public the month after the bombing, telling the press that “the atomic bomb had nothing to do with the end of the war at all.” The record is quite clear: From the perspective of an overwhelming number of key contemporary leaders in the US military, the dropping of atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki was not a matter of military necessity. American intelligence had broken the Japanese codes, knew the Japanese government was trying to negotiate surrender through Moscow, and had long advised that the expected early August Russian declaration of war, along with assurances that Japan’s emperor would be allowed to stay as a figurehead, would bring surrender long before the first step in a November US invasion could begin. Historians still do not have a definitive answer to why the bombs were used. Given that US intelligence advised the war would likely end if Japan was given assurances regarding the emperor—and given that the US military knew it would have to keep the emperor to help control occupied Japan in any event—something else clearly seems to have been important. We know that some of Truman’s closest advisers viewed the bomb as a diplomatic and not simply a military weapon. Secretary of State James Byrnes, for instance, believed that the use of atomic weapons would help the United States more strongly dominate the postwar era. According to Manhattan Project scientist Leo Szilard, who met with Byrnes on May 28, 1945, “[Byrnes] was concerned about Russia’s postwar behavior…[and thought] that Russia might be more manageable if impressed by American military might, and that a demonstration of the bomb might impress Russia.” History is rarely simple, and confronting it head-on, with critical honesty, is often quite painful. Myths, no matter how oversimplified or blatantly false, are too often far more likely to be embraced than inconvenient and unsettling truths. Even now, for instance, we see how difficult it is for the average US citizen to come to terms with the brutal record of slavery and white supremacy that underlies so much of our national story. Remaking our popular understanding of the “good” war’s climactic act is likely to be just as hard. But if the Confederate battle flag can come down in South Carolina, we can perhaps one day begin to ask ourselves more challenging questions about the nature of America’s global power and what is true and what is false about why we really dropped the atomic bomb on Japan.",1,Questionable,0.0451288610379519,0.4412378026014389,1577,1577

The claim was made in arecentarticlewhich looks into Trump's relationship with his older brother Freddy, who died in 1981 at the age of 43 following years of alcoholism. The article mentions an episode which occurred after the death of Fred Trump Sr, Donald and Freddy's father, in 1999. Following the death of Freddy, his son, Fred III, got married and had a child. Shortly after birth, the baby began having seizures which later developed intocerebral palsy. The Trump family pledged to pay for the child's medical bills, but that came to an end after the reading of Fred Sr's will, which Donald Trump had reportedly helped draft while his father was still alive. In Fred Trump Sr's will, much of the inheritance, believed to be around $20 million, was divided between four of his five children and their descendants - leaving Freddy explicitly excluded from receiving any of the money. GettyReutersPAUL J. RICHARDS | AFP | Getty ImagesGettyGetty ImagesAPAFPGetty ImagesReutersGetty ImagesPAGetty ImagesGETTYAfter this came to light, Freddy's children sued, claiming Donald Trump (their uncle) and his siblings had wielded ""undue influence"" over Fred Sr, who suffered from dementia in the last years of his life. It is alleged that a week later Donald retaliated by withdrawing the funds that were meant to pay for the healthcare of his nephew's ill child. Explaining this decision, Donald told the paper: ""I was angry because they sued,"" adding Freddy's exclusion from the will was down to his father's dislike for Freddy's ex-wife. Fred III did not offer a comment to the paper, but Donald said that the lawsuit over the will was settled ""very amicably.""He added that he was fond of his nephew, and had grown to appreciate his brother later in his life, telling the paper that Freddy ""would have been an amazing peacemaker if he didn't have the problem, because everybody loved him.""has contacted Donald Trump's campaign for a comment.

4834,One little change in how you talk to your kids can help them be more successful.,0.0,46.67,https://www.upworthy.com/one-little-change-in-how-you-talk-to-your-kids-can-help-them-be-more-successful,https://adfontesmedia.com/upworthy-bias-and-reliability/,2016-01-14,www.upworthy.com,16,"It's so simple, but a lot of people have no idea it's even a thing. Why didn't anybody tell me this? When expecting a child, a lot of parents tend to read anything they can get their hands on to figure out what to expect during pregnancy and the first few years of life. They tell you how to feed your baby, how often to take them to the doctor, and how to prevent choking tragedies and all kinds of other hazards. But very few people are spreading the word about one simple thing you can do to help your child be successful. Dr. Carol Dweck, a researcher pioneering a shift in how we view motivation in humans, is one of the few evangelizing about how to instill a growth mindset instead of a fixed mindset. Her talk on this was turned into an RSA Animate video. Another public figure trying to spread the word is Sal Khan from Khan Academy. The quickest way to explain what it means to instill a growth mindset is: Praise your child explicitly for how capable they are of learning rather than telling them how smart they are. For instance, here are how some conversations would play out to instill one type of mindset over the other: FIXED MINDSET: 'You read that sentence in the book — you are so smart!' GROWTH MINDSET: 'You read that sentence in the book — you worked so hard to learn how to do that and now you can! Congratulations!' FIXED MINDSET: 'You finished that puzzle so quickly — what a smart kid!' GROWTH MINDSET: 'I'm sorry I wasted your time with an easy puzzle — let me find another one that will give us a bigger challenge. I know we can do it!' FIXED MINDSET: 'You got an 80% on your test.' (And then moving on to the next chapter immediately.) GROWTH MINDSET: 'You got an 80% on your test; that means you are well on your way to knowing this stuff! If you review the ones you missed and take the test again tomorrow, I bet you'll get closer to a 100%.' It's a subtle shift in messaging, but the difference it makes can be huge. When you change your approach to praise, you're changing the achievement marker (reading a sentence or getting an 80% on a test) from a value judgment on the inherent intellect of the child to a series of messages throughout your child's life that instead places value on the process of learning. It means a child's self-worth and confidence in trying things for the first time doesn't become tied to how well they can immediately perform or how inherently smart they are because they know they have more than one chance to prove themselves. This isn't just a theory or some New-Age hippie-dippie parenting trend. Through field research with a class of seventh graders, Dweck has begun proving that a growth mindset can make a significant difference. She and her team tracked a group of kids who entered their school year with almost identical test scores and noted which kids displayed growth mindset attitudes at the beginning and which ones held the beliefs of a fixed mindset. Check out how the kids' grades fared over two years: The top line is for the kids with the growth mindset, and the bottom line is for the kids with the fixed mindset. A healthy mindset has measurable, positive affects on a student. Why such a clear difference, though? As Dweck explains in the RSA Animate video: 'We measured their mindsets — we saw whether they believed intelligence was fixed or could be developed. … They had entered seventh grade with just about identical achievement test scores. But by the end of the first term, their grades jumped apart and continued to diverge over the next two years. The only thing that differed were their mindsets. ... They had completely different goals in school. The number one goal for kids in the fixed mindset is 'look smart at all times and at all costs.' So their whole lives are oriented toward avoiding tasks that might show a deficiency. But in a growth mindset, where they believe intelligence can be developed, their cardinal rule is 'LEARN at all times and at all costs.'' How early should you start instilling a growth mindset and is it ever too late? I'm not immune to looks like this as an adult either. Khan Academy's Sal Khan says it's never too early and it's never too late. He's passionate about providing resources to all children so they can learn, but he realizes that they only use the resources if they're excited and empowered to believe they can learn. There are a couple of ways you can go about promoting a growth mindset, as Khan tells Upworthy: A growth mindset can be instilled from the beginning. 'I think you can start from as soon as they can understand language. I think children naturally have a growth mindset. What I think happens very early, and maybe earlier than the school system is we project onto our kids where we say, 'Look she's so smart, she did that,' and that can be good positive reinforcement but it has a risk of the child getting addicted to that type of feedback so they don't want to take a risk where they might not get that feedback...or they don't want to shatter their parents' perception of them being smart.' And it can be practiced and introduced in later years, too. 'It gets a little harder but you can. Everyone has a growth mindset about some things and a fixed mindset about other things. I might have a growth mindset already about math or science or academics because I've experienced it multiple times and know that if I struggle, that the pain will pay off. But in basketball, as a kid, I probably had a pretty fixed mindset. I didn't touch a basketball until I was 11. [I thought] 'All the other kids are so much better, I'm never going to be [like them] ...' I had a fixed mindset but it was only in high school that I thought ... if I go out there and keep practicing and put myself out there and take myself out of my comfort zone ... and it pays off.' Whether you are a parent or plan on being one, are a teacher or a learner, or maybe even if you just struggle with impostor syndrome, this video may be the key to unlocking potential you've been feeling blocked from.",3,Reliable,0.0966474059794371,0.4626899350649352,1415,1415

In the fall of 2013, tens of thousands of unaccompanied minors traveled to theU. S.southern border, in flight from poverty and gang violence in Central America. At least six of those children were eventually resettled on an egg farm in Marion, Ohio, where their sponsors forced them to work 12 hours a day under threats of death. Local law enforcement uncovered the operation last year, prompting the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations to open an inquiry into the federal government’s handling ofmigrants.“It is intolerable that human trafficking — modern-day slavery — could occur in our own backyard,” SenatorRob Portman, Republican of Ohio and the chairman of the subcommittee, told the New YorkTimes.“But what makes the Marion cases even more alarming is that aU. S.government agency was responsible for delivering some of the victims into the hands of theirabusers.”As detention centers became incapable of housing the massive influx of migrants, the Department of Health and Human Services started placing children into the care of sponsors who would oversee the minors until their bids for refugee status could be reviewed. But in many cases, officials failed to confirm whether the adults volunteering for this task were actually relatives or good Samaritans — and not unscrupulous egg farmers or child molesters. The department performed check-in visits at caretakers’ homes in only 5 percent of cases between 2013 and 2015, according to thereport.

I stood outside the doors to the chapel. My heart was racing, and I felt my eyes fill up with tears. I can’t do this. Before I could turn and run, the doors flung open. I was caught off guard as 80 expectant faces turned to look at me. I scanned the crowd. I saw my family and friends. I saw my dad and stepfather waiting in front of the altar to give me away. But I was going to have to walk down the aisle alone, and that was not how it was supposed to be. I don’t know how long I paused there. I felt like I couldn’t move. Then my eyes found my future husband, Joe. And right next to him, I saw a single candle burning on a tall candelabra. Gulp. I looked back at Joe and decided that if I could make it down the aisle to him, I’d be OK. I felt as if my knees might buckle, but somehow I began walking. It was surreal. I felt as if I were floating, but I eventually made it down the aisle. Me and my husband-to-be on my wedding day. All photos from the author and used with permission. 18 months earlier, my 16-year-old brother was diagnosed with a rare pediatric bone cancer. The diagnosis was grim. The prognosis was not good. He was quick to rally. He was going to be fine. He was going to live his life. He was still planning a future. He packed a lot of living in a short time. 10 days before my wedding, he lost his fight. Now, I look back and I don’t know how my family and I made it through both a funeral and a wedding in such a short span of time, but we did. There would be no postponing of the wedding as I’d suggested. Every single member of my family told me in no uncertain terms that my brother would never want me to put it off. He always said he 'didn’t have time for cancer.' He didn’t let it stop him from doing the things he wanted to do, and he would be highly pissed if I let cancer stop my wedding. So, even though we were still in a state of shock, we had a wedding. There were tributes to my brother throughout the wedding, including the single candle that stood where he was supposed to stand as a groomsman. We read a beautiful poem in his memory during the ceremony. We played his favorite song at the reception. And we danced. And we drank. And, inexplicably, we had fun. 15 years have passed since that day. 15 years and I’m still trying to figure out how to move through life without him. 15 years and I’m still learning about how this 'after part' works. A school picture of my brother. I would gladly trade the things I’ve learned to have my brother back, but I learned a long time ago that bargaining doesn’t work. So usually, I choose to appreciate the lessons I’ve learned instead. 1. I’ve learned to cut people some extra slack. You really don’t know what people are going through. You don’t know what they have endured. You don’t know what battles they may be fighting. There were the times during my brother’s illness when I would find myself driving 15 mph in the left lane. I’d be lost somewhere between grief and exhaustion, and I would arrive home with no idea how I got there. There were times when I’d look up distractedly at the grocery store, only to realize that I’d been standing in the middle of the aisle, lost in thought, for 10 minutes. I used to be the person who honked impatiently and threw dirty looks as I zoomed past a slow driver, but not anymore. Now I know what it's like to really have a bad day, to be so lost in a world turned on its head that you’re completely unaware of your surroundings. I learned that we all have bad days. Some of us have really bad days. Most of us are just trying to make it to tomorrow. 2. I’ve learned that true compassion and grace are about suspending judgment. Over and over, I saw that real compassion is giving people the benefit of the doubt: granting them access, assisting them when you don’t know them, being patient and kind even when you don’t know what they're actually going through. If you have to know the behind the scenes? If you have to know their story in order to be kind? If your kindness is based on an assessment of their pain and if it is conditional? Then it’s not truly kindness; it’s just judgment. I didn’t get this before. I wasn’t cruel, and I wasn’t mean-spirited, but I was impatient and I was easily irritated. That was before I realized the depths in which people can be trapped while still looking completely normal to the rest of the world.3. I’ve learned that comfort sometimes comes from unexpected places. There are people who had a huge impact on me, who helped me through difficult times, and they probably don’t even know the significance of their actions. Sometimes, for me, it was the soft-spoken coworker who offered me a hug as I was leaving to meet my family at the hospital. He was shy and reserved, but he wrapped me in a big bear hug when I was overcome with emotion. I knew this small gesture was not easy for him to give, but his effort to offered me solace. In another moment, that solace came from my brash, loud, jokester boss who let me take off as much time as I needed to be with my brother at the hospital. Another time, it was my friend from work who calmly assured me that I would feel joy again after I tearfully confided my fear and pain to her. And often, solace came from my husband’s brother and my sister-in-law, who drove 12 hours to attend my brother’s memorial service. I learned that an act of kindness, no matter how small, is never wrong. Sometimes it’s the thing that can help someone put one foot in front of the other.4. I’ve learned that I can still, even 15 years later, be blindsided by the cruel reality of it all. Sometimes I’ll be sitting at my kid’s swim practice when a memory knocks the wind out of me. The next thing I know, I’m wiping away tears and hoping no one notices. Sometimes I’ll be eating dinner at a restaurant and the waiter might look just like my brother. I’ll feel the loss and pain take over and overwhelm me. And in these moments, I’m always surprised at the cruel force of grief’s ability to blindside me. Sometimes I'll see him when my kids do something especially mischievous, and my thoughts unwillingly flicker to images of my brother, to memories of the antics of a little boy long ago. Me and my brother as young children. Then, I start imagining what could have been: him egging them on, encouraging their exasperating behavior. And I can almost hear him laughing, enjoying every second of finding a way to torture me as an adult like he did as a little kid. You can bottle yourself up and try to insulate yourself from it, but let me tell you: It’s not going away, so you might as well let it happen. You’ll feel it, you’ll hurt, but I’ve learned that you’ll also be OK. You will be OK.5. I’ve learned that I’ll probably feel my brother’s presence forever. I'll still see him in each of my children, in their personalities, in their senses of humor, which is what my brother was known for. I'll still feel him when my family is together and my sister and my parents are laughing and we’re giving each other a hard time. I often feel the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I feel a warmth come over me, a warmth hard to describe because it’s unlike any sensation I’ve felt before. And I hope I'll still feel him, forever, kicking me in the ass when I’m about to chicken out on doing something that scares me. I can almost hear what he would say to me in those situations: Don’t give up. You’re better than that. I’ve learned to recognize these moments, when I feel him with me. They are bittersweet. They are welcome. And they tug at my heart because they will never be enough.6. What I’ve realized most of all, after all of these years, is that there didn’t need to be a replacement for my brother. When we knew, in those last weeks, that it would not be possible for him to walk me down the aisle, I contemplated other options. But in the end, I decided there was no understudy, and there would be no last minute stand-in. I couldn’t imagine replacing him in that role. And as always, even though my brother wasn't physically there, he showed up. He kicked me in the ass a little and told me not to be scared. He reminded me that I didn’t have time to let my pain stand in the way of my wedding, my happiness. Me and my husband walking down the aisle after our marriage ceremony. In the end, my brother was still there with me on one of the best days of my life because he always has been.",3,Reliable,-0.0126286566968385,0.4849018759018759,2029,2029

1180,My Democratic Problem With Voting for Hillary Clinton,-28.67,34.33,https://time.com/4402823/glaude-hillary-clinton,https://adfontesmedia.com/time-bias-and-reliability/,2016-07-12,time.com,25,"I am not voting for Hillary Clinton,regardless of her endorsement by Bernie Sanders. My decision isn’t because of the scandal around her emails or because of some concern over her character. My reasons are pretty straightforward. I don’t agree with her ideologically. Democratic values centered on economic and racial justice shape my own politics. I’m not convinced those values shape hers. Nothing Clinton says or intends to do if elected will fundamentally transform the circumstances of the most vulnerable in this country—even with her concessionsto the Sanders campaign. Like the majority of Democratic politicians these days, she is a corporate Democrat intent on maintaining the status quo. And I have had enough of all of them. What has Clinton offered the American people as a substantive alternative to the status quo? How would her position on free trade, her view of foreign policy, on immigration, her call for “common sense policing” in the face of the murders ofAlton Sterling in Baton Rouge or Philando Castile in Minneapolisredirect our course as a nation? Transform the condition of black and brown communities?Given the state of the country and of black and brown communities, these questions must be asked. But for many, especially for Clinton supporters, these questions reek of the unreasonableness of the American left or of people like me: that somehow to ask them reveals that we don’t understand the incremental nature of American politics or that we have crossed over into some forbidden realm of politics. Nothing of the sort is said when Republicans reject Trump on ideological grounds. Many, like Jeb Bush,argue that Trump isn’t a true conservative, and that they will not vote for him or Clinton. This is seen as reasonable, and pundits rarely question the integrity of those who hold such views. But to argue something similar about Clinton is immediately dismissed. We are labeled electoral nihilists. That difference reveals the spectrum of American politics: that it moves from the center to the far right. There seems to be little room for genuinely progressive politics left of center in this country. (The legacy of the Democratic Leadership Council ensured that.) We are told that our only viable option is Clinton. Get behind her or risk the future of the nation, they say. Political hokum. This narrowing of the political field joins with a celebration of an easy form of identity politics. Many laud the fact that Hillary Clinton would be our first woman president. But, beyond the symbolism, what would that mean for women at home and abroad?We have seen a version of this movie before, right? In 2008, the country celebrated the election of Barack Obama as the nation’s first black president. But that celebration did not come with a demand for actual policies that might substantively affect the lives of African Americans in this country. Many just felt good about the idea of a black president. Now, as Obama prepares to leave office after eight years, African American communities lay in ruins, and we continue to find ourselves engaged in this haunting ritual of grieving in public for another black life killed by the police. It is not enough that Hillary Clinton might be our first woman president. Symbolically that would be significant, but the more important question rests with how her economic policies would affect the lives of working, poor women and children here in the United States and around the globe. How would she shift the frame of US aid policy and its impact on developing countries? How might her hawkishness affect the lives of vulnerable women and children? If none of that matters, then we might as well celebrate Margaret Thatcher, the Iron Lady, because she was a woman. Anti-racism and anti-sexism have become easy positions for Democratic political elites. We hear politicians talk about voting rights or, or stand in the pulpit with black preachers or express solidarity with women around the world, and we assume that their policies reflect their rhetoric. On closer examination, nothing could be farther from the truth. It’s just the latest instance of a puerile multiculturalism that changes little and allows a few people to feel good about themselves. I am not suggesting that anti-racism or anti-sexism (or identity politics generally) don’t matter. But they can’t provide cover for business as usual—a version of neoliberalism dressed in multicultural Chanel. Perhaps the most persuasive reason to vote for Hillary Clinton is Donald Trump. Trump is worse. I know that. The prospects of a Trump presidency—what would be a deadly combination of arrogance and ignorance—ought to frighten anyone. It frightens me. But my daddy, a gruff man who has lived all of his life on the coast of Mississippi, taught me that fear should never be the primary motivation of my actions. It clouds your thinking, and all too often sends you running to either safe ground when something more daring is required, or smack into the danger itself. (I learned a similar lesson after reading William Faulkner’s “The Bear” in.)Thedanger goes beyond the demagoguery of Trump and the racist bile of some of his supporters. The danger is that the way we live our lives as Americans, no matter our optimism about the future, isno longer sustainable. We can’t continue to live with the current level of income inequality. Hard working people are working longer hours for less pay. And politicians and their benefactors continue to argue for trade policies that have decimated the working class in this country. We can’t continue to lock up black and brown people or watch them killed in cold blood by people sworn to protect us or fail to publicly educate all of our children. We can’t continue to bomb people around the world into oblivion. We can’t even approximate a robust idea of the public good when filthy rich people believe that the only role of government is to facilitate the transfer of public dollars into private hands, and the function of politicians is to make us believe that it is in our best interest that we allow such a thing to happen. In the end, Donald Trump is just an exaggerated indication of the rot that is at the heart of this country. That fact of Trump alone, and the democratic anguish that goes with it, cannot be the only rationale to support Hillary Clinton. Something more substantive is required of us—. Many, despite what I’ve written, will still vote for Clinton. I do not fault them—especially if they live in a hotly contested state like Ohio or Florida. Vote for Clinton to keep Trump out of office. I completely understand that. But I can’t vote for her. I will vote down ballot, focusing my attention on congressional, state, and local elections. And I will leave the presidential ballot blank. I have to turn my back on the Democratic Party that repeatedly turns its back on the most vulnerable in this country, because the Party believes they have nowhere else to go. That false belief betrays a fundamental misunderstanding of this period of democratic awakening. We find ourselves in a peculiar moment in American history, crystallized by profound grief and the hard, pressing work of imagining a future under siege by the callousness and greed of the present. A renewed democratic faith in each other is required to change our course. Thin imaginations will seal our fate. But, I see that faith blossoming throughout the country (even with all the tears and anguish). The Sanders’ campaign was just one bloom. Everyday people are standing in democratic opposition, shouting with Melville’s Bartleby Scrivener, “I prefer not…”I will say the same to Hillary Clinton come election time.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0491729941134702,0.4320593978332074,1585,1585
940,The Republican Milgram Experiment,-6.0,38.0,https://newrepublic.com/article/135694/republican-milgram-experiment,https://adfontesmedia.com/new-republic-bias-and-reliability/,2016-08-01,newrepublic.com,25,"Donald Trump’s increasingly grotesque behavior is not just the defining aspect of his presidential campaign, it’s an ongoing test of character for the elected Republicans who have endorsed him. The stakes of that test reached a new plateau when Trump attacked the family of a Muslim American soldier killed in Iraq, after his parents’ appearance at the Democratic convention. Khizr Khan’s Thursday speech has, somewhat unexpectedly, become themost iconic momentof either convention, his searing indictment of Trump—“you have sacrificed nothing, and no one”—compared to theimmortal wordsthat helped unravel McCarthyism: “Have you no sense of decency, sir?”Trump’s response was an offensive non-sequitur intended to degrade and dismiss his victims and enemies. In interviews withTheNew York TimesandABC News, he mocked Khan’s faith with the suggestion that Khan had forbidden his wife, who stood silently by his side on the stage, from speaking in public. This was horrifying enough, but the thing that made it vintage Trump was that it was premised on a lie. After the convention, but before Trump had gone on the attack,Ghazala Khan had spoken freely, through incredible grief, inan interview with MSNBC. “I told him, ‘don’t be a hero, go safely and come back as my son.’ He cameback as a hero.”The reaction from Trump’s GOP enablers tracked their statements about nearly every Trump controversy. As usual, electorally vulnerable Republicanscondemned Trump unequivocally, while party leaders like Mitch McConnell and Paul Ryancontradicted his words only, as if they’d been uttered by a disembodied voice, rather than by the standard bearer of their party. None of them revised their view that Trump should be the next president. This weak-kneed response surprises and disappoints all manner of opinion makers and anti-Trump Republicans. But the real surprise will come if, in the midst of a closely contested election, Trump’s chief party backers ever experience an epiphany and rescind their endorsements. As stipulated above, this is a test, but it’s one we’ve seen before, and the results are a disaster for those hoping Ryan and McConnell will begin to exhibit daring leadership. In the early 1960s, the American social psychologist Stanley Milgram set about to understand why German enablers of Adolf Hitler were so bendable to orders from figures of authority. Each run ofMilgram’s famous experimentinvolved three participants: an administrator, a subject, and an actor portraying another subject. The real subjects were intentionally misled into believing they weren’t subjects at all, but mere functionaries, testing the actors’ capacity to learn and whether the penalty of painful electric shocks would help jog memories. In reality, the point was to determine if people who believe themselves to be functionaries will participate in acts of evil, and how willingly. Trump is an increasingly dangerous electrical current, administering shocks to civic norms, and Republican leaders are letting it flow. The Milgram experiment may be the most famous social-science experiment ever conducted. But despite its pervasiveness, its findings remain startling. When an actor’s memory “failed,” the subject was instructed to administer a shock; each successive shock was 15 volts stronger than the previous one, topping out at 450 volts. Along the way, the subject would hear the actors wailing in agony from an adjacent room. Eventually the screaming would stop, as if the person on the receiving end of the shock had lost consciousness or died. Nearly every subject at some point expressed concern for the actor’s well-being, and reservations about continuing the experiment. When they did, the administrator would admonish them to continue—and reiterate that they would not be held responsible. About two-thirds of the subjects heeded the orders all the way up to the potentially fatal maximum voltage. There was nothing unique about Germans, it turned out, that made them unusually susceptible to fascism; most people will figure out ways to justify things they believe are required of them, even if they know those things to be wrong. Republicans like McConnell and Ryan, and the vast majority of elected members of the party, are the unknowing subjects of their own Milgram experiment in 2016—except in this instance there are real victims, including vital civic norms, and innocent people whose only sin is finding themselves in Trump’s way. In this metaphor, Trump himself is an increasingly dangerous electrical current, and Republican leaders are allowing it to flow by continuing to support his campaign, making his depredations seem acceptable. The administrator isn’t an individual, per se, as in the Milgram experiment, but the mixture of incentivesthat impel party actors to do what they believe is necessary to win. No single person is telling Republicans they must enable Trump; lust for power and aversion to loss are motivating them, and in this case, these forces make a toxic brew. Trump’s attack on the Khans represents another incremental uptick in voltage. In June, when Trumpclaimedan Indiana-born federal judge overseeing a fraud case against Trump University couldn’t be impartial because he’s “Mexican,” it was a shock, but the response was relatively muted, because the judge, Gonzalo Curiel, was unable to respond himself. In this case, the pain is expressed widely, but most hauntingly by Ghazala Khan herself. “My husband asked me if I wanted to speak, but I told him I could not,”she wrote. “Walking onto the convention stage, with a huge picture of my son behind me, I could hardly control myself. What mother could? Donald Trump has children whom he loves. Does he really need to wonder why I did not speak?”Ryan’s response to the controversy omitted the word “Trump” and paid lip service to the Khan family, saying Captain Khan’s “sacrifice—and that of Khizr and Ghazala Khan—should always be honored. Period.” But honoring their sacrifice, in Ryan’s mind, is fully compatible with walking into a booth 100 days from now and casting a vote for someone the Khans are pleading with him to disavow; someone who wants to ban Muslims like them from entering the country. Neither Ryan nor McConnellresponded to Khizr Khan’sdirect appeal to their sense of duty to country over party, but as it happens, Ryan has addressed the point in the past. At a regular Capitol press briefing one month ago, after Ryan had decided to endorse Trump,Todd Zwillich, of The Takeaway public radio showasked him, “have you ever thought about whether someone in your position needs to reject [this] for the health of the country, and not party or election?” Ryan responded by explaining why he feels it’s appropriate for him to follow partisan orders.“If I lead a schism in our party, then I am guaranteeing that a liberal progressive becomes president, and continues these policies, which I think are extremely detrimental to the country. I think losing the Supreme Court for a generation is detrimental. And I’ve said all along, we want to see the campaign improve; we want to see the campaign improve in tone, in approach, in every respect. … When I see and hear things that I don’t agree with, that I think are contrary to our principles as conservatives, as Americans, I’m going to speak out on those things—I’m going to be really clear. You know that. But at the same time, the last thing I want to do is help Hillary Clinton become president of the United States.”He’lladmit to being worried about the stranger begging for his life in the next room, in other words, but he won’t do anything to stop the current from flowing. Viewed from the outside, this tepid response strikes Trump’s opponents, and anti-Trump conservatives in particular, as a remarkable demonstration of moral cowardice—the kind of thing people watching imagine they’d never do. But if anything is truly surprising about it, it’s just how neatly it all conforms to what theory tells us about how people who see themselves as functionaries view themselves and one another.“To disobey would bring no material loss to the subject,” Milgramwrotein the concluding discussion of his findings. “No punishment would ensue. It is clear from the remarks and outward behavior of many participants that in punishing the victim they are often acting against their own values. Subjects often expressed deep disapproval of shocking a man in the face of his objections; and others denounced it as stupid and senseless. Yet the majority complied with the experimental commands.”One of the seminal findings of the Milgram experiment is that spectators, like Ryan and McConnell’s critics, consistently overestimate the moral firmness of their fellow man. The results were “unexpected to persons who observed the experiment in progress, through one-way mirrors,” Milgram continued. “Observers often uttered expressions of disbelief upon seeing a subject administer more powerful shocks to the victim. These persons had a full acquaintance with the details of the situation, and yet systematically underestimated the amount of obedience that subjects would display.”Republican leaders are cogs because most people are cogs. We can interpret their actions as evidence of their humanity, rather than evidence of pure cynicism or villainy. But that doesn’t mean they ought to be forgiven. Most humans don’t seek to become leaders of major political parties—and political parties that elevate cogs, rather than leaders, into positions of power deserve our condemnation. By failing to repudiate Trump, Ryan and McConnell have revealed themselves to be pliant men—figureheads rather than stewards of their party. As such, the surprise would be if they finally did reach a breaking point and took a definitive stand against Trump. That is only likely to happen, though, if Trump’s antics damage him so badly that supporting him becomes more harmful to the GOP’s interests than opposing him. Butabout 40 percentof the country, andnearly 90 percentof self-identified Republicans, want Trump to win the presidency. Trump’s offenses to decency and democratic norms will eventually reach the equivalent of a 450-volt shock, and elected Republicans will find a way to justify directing it right at the heart of American democracy.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0346990311276025,0.4801108613608613,2245,2245

1411,A Cure for High Health Care Costs,-8.0,36.33,https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/marchaprilmay-2017/introduction-a-cure-for-high-health-care-costs/,https://adfontesmedia.com/washington-monthly-bias-and-reliability/,2017-03-01,washingtonmonthly.com,25,"Republicans have long articulated a case for reforming American health care. That case, in short, is this: Too many people are buying too many health care services with other people’s money. The key to controlling health care spending, according to this view, is to give individuals “skin in the game”—that is, financial incentives to be more prudent health care consumers. This theory underlies virtually all of the GOP proposals floating around Washington, including House Speaker Paul Ryan’s plan, revealed in February, to “repeal and replace” Obamacare and transform Medicaid. The basic idea is to limit the federal government’s role (and financial stake) in health care by shifting more of the costs and burdens onto individuals via measures such as high-deductible health care plans. Make health care “consumers” feel at least some of the pain of paying for their care, the thinking goes, and they will shop for better deals and stop demanding care they don’t need. This, in turn, will force providers to be more efficient, reduce their prices, stop pushing unnecessary care, and thus lower the nation’s health care bill. Special Report: Health CareMissouri, CompromisedHome RemedyStanford’s Big Health Care IdeaMind-Body ConnectionsRepublicans are right about the desperate need to control health care spending, which is eating away at both the federal budget and the livelihoods of individual Americans. But their theory of change rests on a peculiar vision of human nature, which, not to put too fine a point on it, assumes that most Americans are hypochondriacs. While we all know somebody who fits that description, most of us are actually not eager to hand our bodies over to be punctured with needles, probed with instruments, and cut open with scalpels. We do so only when the pain gets bad enough or when our doctors say we should. And when it comes to making health care purchasing decisions, our own judgment isn’t necessarily the best guide. A recent study of workers whose Fortune 500 employer switched them to a high-deductible health insurance plan found that employees never learned to do price comparisons, and while they reduced their health care spending, they did so not only by cutting back on wasteful services like unneeded CT scans, but also by forgoing necessary care, such as a follow-up visit after a diagnosis of diabetes. Even if policy changes could somehow make Americans savvier medical consumers, the effect on overall health care costs would be surprisingly small. That’s because the vast majority of Americans aren’t big users of the health care system. Rather, statistics show that 5 percent of the population accounts for fully 50 percent of all health care spending, and 20 percent of individuals consume fully 80 percent. Who are these people? They are our elderly parents, whose health is slowly deteriorating and who need help coping with their worsening illnesses. They are younger people, most of them still working, who suffer from multiple chronic conditions, such as diabetes, lung disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Many of these patients have mental health problems that make it a challenge for them and their doctors and families to deal with their chronic physical ailments. These are people who, almost by definition, can’t use their purchasing power to fix an out-of-control health care market, because they rapidly spend down their deductibles on necessary care, leaving the bulk of the cost to be paid by insurance. These folks have plenty of skin in the game—their own skin. The real source of our spending problem is not a nation of hypochondriacs, nor even the sickest 5 percent of Americans. It’s our sick health care system. American medicine is the best in the world at “acute care,” saving the lives of victims of car accidents and heart attacks. But it is remarkably bad at caring for people with chronic conditions, whose symptoms can be controlled but rarely cured and who require routine help in managing their health. Without that help, they will inevitably be hit with sudden health crises that leave them nowhere to go but the emergency room and the hospital. And that’s the most expensive place to treat them. There are many reasons American health care is doing such a bad job, one of them being the way insurers—both private companies and Medicare and Medicaid—pay for the majority of the care we receive. Most doctors and hospitals are paid on a “fee-for-service” basis; that is, they charge a fee for each individual office visit, test, drug, minor procedure, major surgery, and hospitalization. This means that the more patients a primary care doctor sees in a day, the more she makes; the more stuff that gets done to patients in a hospital, the higher its revenue. Providers are rewarded for delivering more care, not better care. Fee-for-service has made it difficult for even the most ambitious and well-meaning hospitals, clinics, and clinicians to transform their practices to provide the routine, largely low-tech, often home-based care the 5 percent really needs. In thisWashington Monthlyspecial report,we offer four examples of health care programs that have walked away from this broken system. They employ “low-tech, high-touch care,” much of it provided by non-doctors, that not only improves the day-to-day lives of people with chronic illnesses, it also saves money for the government and private insurers. Each takes advantage of an alternative payment model, which opens the door to “wraparound” care that can keep the sickest 5 percent out of the emergency room and hospital. InSan Diego, the Transitions program, run by Sharp HealthCare, provides extra care at home that helps elderly people who are not yet sick enough for hospice avoid frequent hospitalizations. AtStanford, a clinic coordinates doctors, nurses, and medical assistants to care for university employees with multiple chronic illnesses. A “health home” inMissourimakes sure that people with mental illness get the treatment that enables them to manage their physical health challenges. And inPennsylvania, four counties run an innovative program that has dramatically improved the coordination of physical and mental health care for patients with serious mental illness. Each of these programs is at risk if Congress repeals the Affordable Care Act or tinkers in the wrong way with Medicare or Medicaid. In addition to covering nearly thirty million people who previously had limited or no access to health insurance and adequate care, the ACA supports novel payment schemes that can break the cycle of neglect toward the chronically ill. If these programs are dismantled, or even slowed, we will continue to see rising health care spending—and worsening health in America. If the GOP is serious about lowering costs, it should reconsider its assumptions about how the health care market works. The lives of millions of American patients, and the financial health of the whole system, are riding on it.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0578877454936776,0.4655299973096584,1479,1479
5292,Chapter Two of Trump’s Presidency: The Next 100 Days,-12.75,36.25,https://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/chapter-two-of-trumps-presidency-the-next-100-days/77048,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2017-04-30,www.ozy.com,25,"Take a breath. It’s been a hectic first 100 days of Donald Trump’s presidency. We have a new Supreme Court justice, Obamacare is still standing (for now), the U. S. military struck Syria with Tomahawk cruise missiles, and Saturday Night Live has material for ages thanks to the tweeter in chief — and press secretary Sean Spicer. We’ll leave further recaps to others and take a look at Trump’s next 100 days, with the standard caveat that this president lives to be unpredictable. The biggest misconception about Kim Jong-un is that he’s insane. Waving around a nuclear arsenal like a child brandishing a new toy, allegedly ordering the assassination of a half brother with a nerve agent in another country’s airport, warehousing 100,000 political prisoners in forced-labor camps — these are not the actions of a well-adjusted world leader. But North Korea’s accelerating nuclear ambitions and provocations toward South Korea and the United States are perfectly rational as the authoritarian regime seeks to satisfy its elites, rally the masses and hold onto power. They’re also the most explosive test of Trump’s foreign policy over the next 100 days. But short of preemptively bombing missile sites — Trump has indicated he’s willing to do it, with the Syria strike and “mother of all bombs” drop in Afghanistan under his belt — there’s little direct impact the U. S. can have. China, then, is the key. China has long helped prop up the rogue nation for fear of the instability a collapse would bring, but there are signs that Beijing is growing tired of Kim’s antics. China announced this year it was cutting off coal imports from its neighbor. The next step could be to halt crude oil exports to North Korea. If China won’t move, Trump could impose second-order sanctions on Chinese companies that deal with North Korea— locking banks out of the critical U. S. financial system, for example. Previous administrations have avoided such a step for fear of angering Beijing. For its part, North Korea shows no signs of changing course as it tests missiles and threatens nuclear war. “When you normalize provocations, and then people will think, ‘Oh, yeah, the North Koreans, they are just doing what they do,’ that’s great for North Korea,” says Kent Boydston, a Korea expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Beware the crazy-uncle excuse. It was one of his first and most prominent pledges: a big, beautiful wall on America’s southern border, which would be paid for by Mexico because of the Donald’s negotiating acumen. Within days of taking office, Trump signed an executive order to start “immediate construction of a physical wall” along with other border security measures. But he needs Congress to follow through with the money, as Mexico’s president has made it clear he’s disinclined to write a check for the wall. Trump has responded with vague pledges about how Mexico might pay indirectly. So how much will the great wall cost? The Trump administration requested $4.1 billion over two years, but that’s a fraction of what a physical barrier across the entire border would cost. Senate Democrats extrapolated from prototype proposals that a 1,827-mile wall would cost at least $64 billion — and $150 million more per year to maintain. An internal Department of Homeland Security analysis, Reuters reports, pegged the cost at $21.4 billion to shore up the 1,250 miles of the border that are not already fortified. Democrats are digging in, vowing to block any spending bill that includes wall money — and for more than fiscal reasons. “It stems from a value: Are you somebody who sees the humanity in our neighbors, or are you not?” asks Faiz Shakir, national political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is pushing Democrats to stand firm. The result was Trump backing off his demand to include wall funding in a government spending bill, postponing the fight. This is in part because even border-state Republicans who are hawkish on immigration say electronic surveillance in some places might be preferable to a barrier. And the government would have to seize some property under eminent domain to build a wall, a tactic not likely to sit well with landowners. The Houston Chronicle recently quoted House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, telling local college students: “I don’t think a 30-foot concrete wall is going to be the answer.” The topic was serious, the tone sober when Republican Sen. Richard Burr shared a news conference podium with Democrat Mark Warner to talk about Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their investigation of it. But Burr wore a slight smirk when setting a ground rule in his light North Carolina drawl: “We will not take questions on the House Intelligence Committee.” As the Russia investigation unfolds, it’s the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence who will be charged with maintaining the professionalism and bipartisanship critical to making the probe credible. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who soaked up the attention during the first 100 days, showed himself too chummy with Trump to assess impartially whether the president’s campaign collaborated with foreign interests, and he stepped aside from leading the probe. Thus, Burr has taken center stage in the casual manner he handles most everything else. Burr is known around the Capitol for his quirks — wearing loafers without socks, driving a 1974 open-air Volkswagen Thing — and for being tight with former house speaker John Boehner. Burr took over the chairmanship of the intelligence committee early in 2015. It’s a job that makes one privy to the nation’s darkest secrets and biggest fears, and it requires lots of time locked away with classified materials, unreachable to the outside world. Burr’s longtime political consultant Paul Shumaker tells OZY that Burr told him early on: “There would be times in his re-election that we would have to run a campaign without a candidate, because he was going to put that responsibility of the committee chairmanship first.” Burr’s lack of interest in campaigning was often interpreted in D. C. circles as laziness, but he won an unexpectedly tight race last year and says his third term in the Senate will be his last. Though he typically votes the party line, Burr is now free of political shackles as he pursues the ties between Moscow and Trump Tower. Last year Burr was more steadfast than many GOP senators in supporting Trump, and Yahoo! News recently reported growing frustration among the committee’s Democrats that Burr is slow-walking the probe. If it appears to be tainted by politics, pressure will grow for a special prosecutor to come in. Ask Ken Starr and Bill Clinton how that works out. When trade bluster meets policy China Shipping Lines Cargo Ship Summer loading at the Port of Oakland Source shutterstock In late April, Trump sat at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office surrounded by steel industry honchos to sign an executive order to “prioritize” an investigation into the effects of low-cost steel imports, implicitly targeting China, a familiar trade foe. Then Trump’s focus shifted to what appeared to be handwritten notes and an unusual target inspired by a visit to Wisconsin two days earlier: “In Canada, what they’ve done to our dairy farm workers is a disgrace.” The “NAFTA disaster,” as Trump termed it, has to do with our northern neighbor’s market protections for its dairy farmers. Then last week, he slapped a tariff on Canadian soft lumber imports. Along with cheap Mexican manufacturing, it’s part of his argument to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has been in force since 1994. Trade policy was one of the most consistent planks of Trump’s campaign. He immediately pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership upon taking office, but that treaty was never ratified. Trump last week said he was backing off plans to pull out of NAFTA altogether, and would start fresh negotiations with Ottawa and Mexico City. Opening up a long-standing deal will take more time and finesse, though commerce secretary Wilbur Ross recently said a revamped NAFTA might look a lot like what Mexico and Canada agreed to in the TPP — such as tougher labor and environmental standards. Though most of Trump’s moves so far have been rhetorical, with pledged reviews and investigations, the Canadian lumber action is the first sign of teeth, with more to come over the next 100 days. But in the wake of the summit with President Xi Jinping, Trump notably backed down from a campaign pledge to label China a currency manipulator, a move that would lead to tariffs and other punishments. The policy whiplash is often seen as the reflection of the internal struggle between senior counselor Steve Bannon’s economic nationalism and a more moderate approach from chief economic adviser Gary Cohn’s crowd, a debate not likely to go away anytime soon. From swing vote to porch swing? Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy shakes hands with Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch as his wife Marie Louise Gorshuch and President Donald Trump look on during a ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House April 10, 2017 in Washington, D. C. Source Eric Thayer/Getty Washington’s most scrutinized — and at times inscrutable — octogenarian has a choice to make in June. Anthony Kennedy will decide whether to hang up his robe as the Supreme Court’s swing justice. Though high court retirements are as tough to predict as their decisions, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the head of the Judiciary Committee that would consider a replacement, recently told constituents in Iowa that he expects a SCOTUS vacancy this summer. On an evenly split court, Kennedy has tilted conservative on some issues (gun rights, campaign finance) and liberal on others (gay rights, affirmative action). Most critically for the fight to come over his seat, Kennedy has repeatedly upheld a woman’s right to an abortion. Add an antiabortion justice, and the legally questionable 1973 ruling Roe v. Wade easily could tumble. The filibuster already has fallen for Supreme Court nominees in this year’s partisan battle over Neil Gorsuch, so the next justice will face a 50-vote threshold in the Senate. Still, the higher ideological stakes than the Gorsuch–for–Antonin Scalia swap means “the battle for Kennedy’s seat will be Armageddon and will likely take a long while in the Senate,” says Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. If Armageddon arrives, keep an eye on whether Trump sticks to the list of conservative Federalist Society–approved judges he put out during the campaign, and the signals from GOP moderates Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. And remember Kennedy himself was Ronald Reagan’s third choice, after the defeat of the severely conservative Robert Bork and the withdrawal of Douglas Ginsburg who — gasp! — admitted to smoking marijuana a few times. If you take a walk, I’ll tax your feet President Donald Trump signs an executive order identifying and reducing tax regulatory burdens. Source Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post via Getty For decades, blowing up the tax code has been the Washington equivalent of Tantalus’ apple from Greek mythology: always just out of reach. Everyone — except, perhaps, the nation’s accountants — agrees that the code is too complex, but every deduction has a lobby attached. Just before the end of his first 100 days in office, Trump announced an outline to slash tax rates for individuals and corporations. Now comes the hard part: steering it through Congress. Republicans propose that most families will be able to fill out their taxes on a postcard, with a juiced-up standard deduction or itemized deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving but nothing else. Democrats have sent mixed signals about whether they’d be open to working with Republicans on the plan. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he wants Trump to release his own taxes first — an exceedingly unlikely proposition and a nod to Democrats’ protest-minded base. Republicans remain divided over the “border adjustment tax” on imports, designed to help American manufacturers and offset the deficit impact of the rate cuts. “There’s no pleasant way to raise $2 trillion,” says Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and an OZY contributor. Norquist adds that his reply to any business complaining about a border tax when the corporate rate has been cut from 35 percent to 15 percent would be: “Shut up.” The border adjustment tax was not in last week’s White House outline, which on its own is likely to increase the deficit, meaning congressional rules would force the tax cuts to expire after 10 years rather than become permanent. As the debate unfolds, look out for competing analyses from the White House predicting huge growth and lower deficits and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Another barometer to watch: the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It has jumped more than 10 percent since Election Day, in part on the promise of a regulation- and tax-slashing presidency. Trump has started to deliver on the former. The latter will be a slog. Those are the issues we can see coming. Because it’s Donald Trump, there’s always the chance for a wild-card moment, particularly as the country gorges on the latest dramatics in As the West Wing Turns. Perhaps Bannon will end up ambassador to Liechtenstein by the time we hit Day 200.",2,Generally Reliable,0.0921018498137141,0.4078753230448148,2893,2893

But Owens was criticized by progressives concerned the site, Social Autopsy, could be abused to “dox” innocent people. The backlash led in part to her political conversion. She watched as mainstream outlets shamed her, in her view. The only site that covered the story accurately was the “white, nationalist” Breitbart News, she said to Dave Rubin, a YouTube news personality. This was in April 2016, and Owens found confirmation in Trump, who was on the television near daily claiming the media was lying. “I realized my friends were my enemies, and my enemies were my friends,” Owens says. We are living in such a special time. We are watching the slow, and painful, death of the mainstream media. Candace Owens Owens says she spent a year to “rebuild as a person,” shell-shocked by the negative coverage of Social Autopsy. Now she is a brimstone-raining headliner for Republican rallies. Her first video, featuring her satirically “coming out” to her parents as a conservative, drew a quarter-million views after its posting last August. It has since spawned dozens more under her channel, Red Pill Black, a nod to The Matrix and her purported political awakening. Armed with undeniable charisma and a well-sculpted persona, her online popularity has led to appearances on Fox News and dozens of radio, TV and online appearances, carried on the back of videos like “How to Escape the Democrat Plantation” and, her most popular one thus far, “WTF? Black Lives Matter Has a List of Demands for White People!” The director of urban engagement for Turning Point USA, a nonprofit engaging young conservatives, Owens appears poised to break through from internet famous to actual famous. In the whirlwind of CPAC, she took selfies with Chris Loesch (husband and manager of media personality/NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch), rubbed elbows with Sebastian Gorka (bombastic fired Trump White House aide turned Fox News pundit) and then sprinted off to a meeting at the Trump hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. The latter trumped an interview with OZY, as it turned out, though she texted us her apologies: “This day has been impossible.” It’s not difficult to see why Owens is in such demand. Outspoken Black conservatives often soar to stardom quickly as Republicans seek to elevate their comparatively few minority voices. Their moments can be fleeting, but the former Vogue employee and University of Rhode Island journalism grad has the chops to stick around. Her direct-to-camera appeals are filled with fury, but also an acerbic wit reminiscent of Tomi Lahren’s star-making “final thoughts” segments on TheBlaze — except more clever. In that sense, Owens is more Omarosa Manigault-Newman, the skilled if confounding agitator who turned her Apprentice appearances into a White House gig, than Diamond and Silk, the YouTube personalities who opened Trump campaign rallies with a shtick crossing into the absurd. Owens praises Trump’s tax cuts and his cultural stances, but rarely advocates specific policies (she has said she supports gay marriage but hasn’t arrived at a position yet on abortion). Her online persona’s most consistent belief is outrage. “Black people are not a monolith,” she says in another broadside aimed at “the media.” “We all have different ideas, and I hope they keep pretending we don’t exist, because that’s the exact market I’m after.” But her authenticity has come under question. Other vloggers note that Owens once wrote the tea party was “bat-shit crazy” in a post for Degree180, a news site she helped found after leaving a private equity firm in 2015. Her overnight ascent has frustrated other African-American Republicans, inspiring intense, and perhaps envious, reactions. Wayne Dupree, a conservative blogger and award-winning podcast host, interviewed Owens. But when asked by email to comment on her, he wondered why this story wasn’t about him. Eugene Craig, a former vice chairman of the Maryland GOP, said he considers Owens “an opportunistic person who, for the development of her own celebrity, uses and attacks Black culture while claiming to do minority engagement.” He criticizes her for posting videos mocking Colin Kaepernick, the protesting quarterback. “So original,” Craig gripes. “She’s a Tomi Lahren in blackface.” Of course, Lahren, now a Fox News contributor, has achieved incredible success to ease her notoriety for racially charged statements. And Owens could too, helped by a shift from traditional media — which the Edelman Trust Barometer recently reported has become “the least trusted institution” globally — that has buoyed the careers of everyone from Lahren to Ben Shapiro, the Daily Wire editor in chief and popular podcaster. As conservatives have gone from railing against the mainstream media to abandoning it altogether, they’ll tune in to new platforms and new people like Owens. “We are living in such a special time. We are watching the slow, and painful, death of the mainstream media,” she said at CPAC, joining a co-panelist to “wave goodbye” to the media gathered in the back. “It was fun standing up there and pointing to them, saying, ‘You’re fake news! You’re fake news! You’re fake news!’” Owens said in her subsequent radio interview with Dupree, reveling in the spectacle. “I felt like Donald Trump there for a second.”",2,Generally Reliable,0.0600674325674325,0.4628232184482183,1331,1331

Carter, the nation's 39th president andoldest-living formerpresident in U. S. history at 98 years old, lives a fairly normal and frugal life,The Washington Postreported in 2018. In fact, Carter still lives in the ranch house he built himself in 1961. The home, in rural Plains, Georgia — about a two-and-a-half hour drive south from Atlanta — is a two-bedroom ranch assessed at just $167,000, which is ""less than the value of the armored Secret Service vehicles parked outside,"" the Post reports. It's also a lot less than the median home price in Georgia, which is $319,431 in 2022, according to real estate siteZillow. Carter's other frugal tendencies include spending weekends dining with neighbors on paper plates with bargain-brand wine,the Postsays. In addition, it says he and wife Rosalynn make their own yogurt. Carter has also been known to buy his clothes at his local Dollar General store, according to a 2011Rolling Stonestory — heshowed up for the store's openingin Plains in 2004 — and he often flies commercial. In recent years, Carter has made much of his income from writing books, the Post reported; he has published at least 33, including a children's book and reflections on his presidency. (Thriftbooks.com lists52 books.)Carter also receives a $221,400 annual pension, as do all former presidents, plus the federal government gives all ex-presidents an allowance for things like travel and office space. In 2017, Carter got more than $230,000 in such allowances, according to the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, a conservative advocacy group. Carter's modest lifestyle is sharply different from those of other living former presidents. Donald Trump, the most recent president to vacate the White House, spends most of his time these days living on his 17-acre South Florida luxury resort, Mar-a-Lago, which Forbes values at roughly$160 million. Barack Obamapurchased an$8.1 million mansionin Washington, D. C. in 2017. The Obama familyreportedlyfollowed that with the 2019 purchase of a nearly $12 million estate in their favorite summer vacation spot: the picturesque (and pricey) Martha's Vineyard. And whileBill Clinton saidhe left the White House $16 million in debt, he swiftly erased that debt thanks to his lucrative paid speeches and book deals. NPRreported that in Clinton's first year out of office, he gave 57 speeches and raked in a whopping $13.7 million from his ""speaking and writing business,"" according to a 2001 tax return. Clinton'sreal estate portfolioincludes a $1.7 million home in Chappaqua, New York, and a home in D. C. his family purchased for$2.85 millionin 2000. Former presidents can earn significant income on speaking circuits. George W. Bush pulled in roughly $15 million in his first two years out of office, according toCBS. Bush's primary residence is his sprawling,1,600-acre ranchin Crawford, Texas. But fancy living isn't Carter's style.

It’s pure Tucker Carlson, a move I’ve seen hundreds of times in the over 40 hours ofTucker Carlson Tonightclips I’ve watched on Fox News in recent months. Reporters go on his show believing they’ll be discussing health care or Donald Trump’s mental health, only to be met with the question,“Do you think you are practicing journalism?”Reeling guests stumble and fall. “Answer the question,” Carlson demands. “Answer the question!” But the question is unanswerable. What happened to Tucker Carlson?People in media ask themselves this question with the same pearl-clutching, righteous tone they use when discussing their aunt in Connecticut who voted for Trump. In a tweet, Jon Lovett of Crooked Media andPod Save America,noted, “Tucker Carlson’s transition from conservative serious-ish writer to blustery CNN guy to Daily Caller troll to race-baiting Fox News host is like ice core data on what led to this moment in our politics.”In June, Conor Friedersdorf wrote inThe Atlantic, “Carlson squandered hisconsiderable God-given talentfor scrupulously true commentary, opting instead for clickbait at The Daily Caller or dumbed-down demagoguery at Fox.”There’s something to all the liberal hand-wringing. In a speech Carlson gave to CPAC in 2009, he pleaded with conservative journalists to focus on reporting rather than punditry. He held upTheNew York Timesas a standard bearer, begging writers “to go out there and find what is happening….not just interpret things they hear in the mainstream media.” His pleas were met with boos. But just six years later, Carlson was calling outThe New York Timesforpro-Clinton advocacy, and in June 2018 accusedthe paper of blatantlylying to the American people about Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction, Bashar Al-Assad, and Russian interference in the 2016 elections. If we can figure out how an intelligent writer and conservative can go from writing National Magazine Award–nominated articles to shouting about immigrants on Fox News, perhaps we can understand what is happening to this country, or at least to journalism, in 2018. If you ask his former editors, they’ll say they’re wistful when they think about the old Tucker Carlson. Mark Warren, who edited him atEsquire:“He is an extremely talented writer. [Tucker’s] writing was done with such energy and vitality.”Paul Greenberg, who edited Carlson atThe Arkansas Democrat Gazette: “Tucker was a pleasure to work with. I knew he would fit right in in Arkansas when I discovered that he chewed tobacco.”Adam Myerson,Policy Review:“Tucker was an enterprising, hard-working shoe-leather reporter.”Tina Brown, who worked with Carlson at her short-livedTalkmagazine: “Tucker is a tremendously good writer and I always thought it was a real shame that he kind of like got sucked into this TV mania thing. “Perhaps fearful of what Carlson has become, few of his former editors were willing to talk on the record about his evolution, except for Brown, who noted crisply in an efficient, six-minute phone interview, “I really think Tucker is better than that.”Ask Tucker Carlson whatever happened to Tucker Carlson, and he gets upset.“Who thinks I’ve changed?” he demands. I didn’t want to give up any of my sources, a few of whom still count him as a friend, so I stammered out my editor’s name.“Uh, Kyle Pope,” I said.“Is Kyle kind of dumb?” Carlson responds.(Editor’s note: Arguable.)The question,What happened to Tucker Carlson?is worth answering. If we can figure out how an intelligent writer and conservative can go from writing National Magazine Award–nominated articles and being hailed by some of the best editors in the business, to shouting about immigrants on Fox News, perhaps we can understand what is happening to this country, or at least to journalism, in 2018. Tucker McNear Swanson Carlsonwas always going to be a journalist, if only through inertia and nepotism; the talent was a bonus. Carlson is the son of Dick Carlson, a media executive, who used to direct the Voice of America and is a formerCEO of The Corporation for Public Broadcasting. Tucker was born in 1969, the older of two boys. Their mother, Lisa McNear Carlson, left the family when he was six. “Totally bizarre situation—which I never talk about, because it was actually not really part of my life at all,”Carlson toldThe New Yorkerin 2017. When Tucker was 10, Dick remarried to Patricia Swanson of the Swanson frozen dinner fortune; her uncle was Senator J. William Fulbright. Carlson and his brother Buckley went to the Rhode Island private school St. George’s and, later, Tucker attended Trinity College, where, as he told the CJR in an interview, he spent his days mostly drunk. He graduated in 1992 and married his high school sweetheart, Susan Anderson. Carlson applied to the CIA, but his application was denied, so he turned to journalism. “You should consider journalism,” his father told him. “They’ll take anybody.”And they did. Carlson began working forPolicy Reviewas a fact-checker. “I ended up working for this magazine because the standards are so low,” he explains. The quip is Carlsonesque—disarming, self-effacing, self-aggrandizing, and a tad insulting. I’m a single mom, a freelance writer with two kids, swiftly facing a future with no healthcare. I’m cobbling together ghostwriting jobs, but it’s not enough. I tell Carlson this and he tells me it’s “all impressive.” The implication is clear. It’s fine for me, buthe’snot good at that sort of thing.“I have all kinds of problems with authority and being told what to do,” he says. “I was not suited for that kind of work.”I think about the application I just filled out for Starbucks. Me neither. Yet Carlson insists he, too, was motivated only by the needs of a growing family. He maintains that if someone handed him $5 million he wouldn’t have gotten out of bed. (And he’d be easy to believe, if he wasn’t, in fact,worth over $8 million, and hadn’t himself stood to inherit enough to keep him in a rotating series of beds until retirement.)But it’s the story he’s sticking to. He had to do what he had to do. He didn’t have a choice. He has kids. DC has terrible public schools. His hands were tied. So, in addition to his staff positions, he took freelance jobs. He didn’t want to disappoint his family.“I think this is true of almost everybody unless you happen to inherit a bunch of dough at a young age.” Carlson sounds cavalier as he says this, like the plight of sending kids to a private school in DC is the most relatable thing in history. I wonder about my own career in media. If providing for my kids was my only goal, I’d be back in my marketing job. Which reminds me, I need to check my bank account to make sure I can afford back-to-school shoes and after-school care. I wonder which one of us is supposed to be the liberal elite media. But Carlson’s story is the story of the working man. He is, in this way, a Trumpish avatar—roguish, rich, independent, and confusing as hell. Despite his pedigree, or more likely because of it, Carlson has managed to become a vox populi of the deplorables. His show attracts an audience of 2.7 million people who see him as a voice of independent Americans. His bookShip of Fools, which rails against the liberal media establishment, is due out in October. The man’s voice and his power are only growing. SinceBill O’Reilly was fired from Fox Newsin October 2017, Carlson has cannibalized O’Reilly’s audience. According to Nielsen Media Research, the top-rated markets for the show are Ft. Myers, Florida; Knoxville, Tennessee; Jacksonville, Florida; West Palm Beach, Florida; Las Vegas, Nevada; Birmingham, Alabama; Orlando, Florida; Atlanta, Georgia; Greenville, South Carolina; and Buffalo, New York. Only half of these cities went for Trump in the 2016 election, but they are (with the exception of Birmingham and Atlanta) overwhelmingly white and middle class, with an average age of 36. A large part of the jobs held by men in each city are in retail or construction. Despite his pedigree, or more likely because of it, Carlson has managed to become a vox populi of the deplorables. His show attracts an audience of 2.7 million people who see him as a voice of independent Americans. These fans consider themselves independent thinkers, like Carlson; they love him for his unanswerable questions. Colleen H., from Utah, told me through Facebook Messenger, “I like the way he has his guests on and they can’t say anything but the truth. He asks them a simple question and they go round and round the truth. He stays right on top of the subject at hand, if his guests don’t…. They only have so long to answer. When they don’t, they’re gone.”A man who goes by the name The Watchman on Twitter, and lives in West Virginia, explained that he likes Carlson because “he seems honest and sincere. I like how he always [asks] what seems to the Democratic Socialist/Liberals as tough questions and they never answer him.”Carlson also has one very big fan in the president of the United States, who watches his show and gleans policy ideas. Only weeks ago, after Carlson spoke on his show about a South African policy of seizing property from white landowners, the president tweeted that he was having his Secretary of State look into the matter. (Both Carlson and Trump misinterpreted the policy. Carlson later clarified his remarks on the issue;Donald Trump has not.)Other vocal fans of Carlson include Richard Spencer, David Duke, and white nationalist website The Daily Stormer. On August 24, 2018, The Daily Stormer published a post that noted gleefully, “Tucker Carlson is basically ‘Daily Stormer: The Show.’ Other than the language used, he is covering all of our talking points.”Pointing out the similarities between Nazi supporters and positions advocated by Carlson has become a subgenre of DC media. The most thorough examination was by Carlos Maza, a journalist for Vox, whorecently broke down the waysin which Carlson’s talking points resonate with professional racists. His video is worth watching in full, but he points out how Carlson’s show cherrypicks stories of immigrants committing crime and ties illegal immigration to the crime rate. (Studies from the FBI and the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, have proven no link betweenimmigration—illegal or otherwise—and crime.)Buthe’snot a racist, Carlson insists. It’s bogus. Just because he believes everyone should be able to say what they want without being punished for it, doesn’t mean he supports them.“If you think my views are bad tell me how. But [my accusers] don’t, because they’re either too dumb or they don’t care. They are trying to silence people they disagree with…And they are leading the effort to silence people they disagree with, without any debate, with out any intellectual due process, not legal, intellectual due process.”Carlson’s voice is rising. He begins to mimic liberals in a higher pitched voice. “Shut up, Nazi. I get to punch you now.”That, he says, is where the world is going. So is he a racist? “My god, I’m not a racist. I hate racism. Tell me how.”He kept going, mimicking the debate he believes his accusers/liberals/me are having about him. “It’s like ‘Oh, creepy people like your show. Therefore, you shouldn’t have a show.’ What? How could you go along with that? I don’t understand. Like, that’s the lowest form…that’s so contemptible. And it’s, it’s amazing to me that that kind of goes on uniformly. Shut up. You’re a bad person. Go away. You’re fired now. What? Tell me what he did wrong. Speak slowly so that I can understand. What did he say that’s untrue? What did he say that’s not allowed? What’s the right position? Why don’t you explain it to me? Shut up, Nazi.”His publicist calls after our interview to make sure I know that Carlson is not a racist. Like many white male journalists,Carlsonused to idolize Hunter S. Thompson. And his own early journalism is indeed gonzo-like: freewheeling, voice-driven, squibbish narratives. It is as if Thompson donned a bow-tie, and thought maybe poor people should work a little harder. AtPolicy ReviewCarlson made a mark for himself with pieces like a cringeylook at Dunbar High School in Washington, DC. Carlson depicts the historically black high school as on the decline. Fair enough. The high school is one of DC’sworst-performers. But then he traces the roots of the decline to the desegregation of DC schools. The kicker of the article reads, “By heeding its past, Dunbar could once again inspire greatness.”That past is one of segregation. He advocated this line of thinking again in 1996 in an article about the “Lost Black Aristocracy” of Washington. According to Carlson, desegregation meant the loss of rich black people in the city. These black aristocrats, Carlson notes, “had both light skin and, like their ancestors, profoundly integrationist views—seemed like museum pieces in a city whose local politics were increasingly defined by black nationalism.”With them gone, Carlson mourns, “no force remained to keep the excesses of the civil rights class in check. Political leaders stopped identifying with bourgeois values and began pandering in earnest to the underclass.”Carlson leftPolicy Review, to work under Pulitzer Prize–winning columnist Paul Greenberg at the ArkansasDemocrat Gazette. In 1995, he left to work for theWeekly Standard,where he profiled James Carville. The 1996 article, “James Carville: Populist Plutocrat” skewers Carville for getting rich off his message of populism. It’s a fun piece. Carlson writes with the hooks and jabs he’s famous for on TV, but they’re rendered more deftly on the page:A wine aficionado (northern Rhones are his favorite), Carville once consumed no fewer than 11 drinks in the company of a reporter on a flight to Los Angeles. He and his wife (former Bush partisan and talk-show host Mary Matalin) have what he calls a “country house” in rural Virginia. He enjoys quality room service, plush bath towels, and cars that come with drivers. He’s a frequent patron of The Palm, one of Washington’s most expensive restaurants. And, as if to make the caricature complete, he loves to play the stock market. Then, in case you think he’s a conservative in good standing, in 1999, Carlson profiled George W. Bush for Tina Brown’sTalkmagazine. He quoted Bush saying “fuck” a lot and had him mimicking a panicked Karla Faye Tucker, a murderer on death row, pleading for her life. Carlson writes: “Please’, Bush whimpers, his lips pursed in mock desperation, ‘don’t kill me.’”Karen Hughes, Bush’s communications director, denied Carlson’s version of the events. But it was enough to mark Carlson as a journalistic rascal. “He really could’ve been one of the very great journalists,” Brown says. “You know because he had an amazing eye for observation. He’s terribly funny and you know he’s just a great stylist. There was a kind of flair to it that I thought was great.”Probably the pinnacle of this journalism career wasa 2003 articleabout traveling to Liberia with Al Sharpton; Cornel West; and Franzo King, archbishop and lead sax player of the St. John Coltrane African Orthodox Church, in San Francisco. About King he writes, “King tends to speak in riddles and dictums and parables, and at an almost inaudible volume. One day I told him that I considered some person or other a bit of a phony. King looked at me intently for a moment, then put his hand on the back of my head and pulled my ear to his lips. ‘Is a tree phony because it loses its leaves in winter?’ he whispered.”In this article, Carlson all but accuses Sharpton of reverse racism. His argument in the article, 15 years ago, will sound familiar to anyone who watches his show today. “The idea that I’d be responsible for the sins (or, for that matter, share in the glory of the accomplishments) of dead people who happened to share my skin tone has always confused me,” he wrote. “Racial solidarity wasn’t a working concept in my Southern California hometown. Most people barely had last names, much less ethnic identities. I grew up feeling about as much connection to nineteenth-century slave owners as I did to bus drivers in Helsinki or astronomers in Tirana. We’re all capable of getting sunburned. That’s it.”For this, he was nominated for a National Magazine Award. He didn’t win, but who cares? “I can’t imagine a less coveted accolade than an award from sad, alcoholic former newspaper editorialists, you know?”Go on. “I don’t respect my peers at all. I mean, I just can’t imagine a group whose approval I’m less interested in, because I think so many of them are just so unbelievably mediocre. I mean, mediocre.”“It’s like ‘Oh, creepy people like your show. Therefore, you shouldn’t have a show.’ What? How could you go along with that? I don’t understand. Like, that’s the lowest form…that’s so contemptible. And it’s, it’s amazing to me that that kind of goes on uniformly. Shut up. You’re a bad person. Go away. You’re fired now. What? Tell me what he did wrong. Speak slowly so that I can understand.”Despite the loathing of his own profession, Carlson went to Pakistan forNew Yorkmagazineright after 9/11and almost died in a plane crash. He traveled to Iraq and wrotea sympathetic profile of military contractorsandinterviewed Paul Ryan, both forEsquire. (None of those assignments, it seems obvious to say, would likely go to Carlson today.)Along the way, Tucker pivoted to video. Which, in some estimations, was (and is always) a big mistake. To hear Carlson tell it, he stumbled into television the same way he wandered into journalism, because it was quick, easy, and they’d take him. In his 2003 bookPolitics, Partisans, and Parasites: My Adventures in Cable News, Carlson recounts that his first television appearance happened because he came home early from lunch. I was heading back to my desk with a take-out hot dog one afternoon when I ran into the receptionist. She asked me what I knew about the O. J. trial. My instinct was to answer honestly (“just about nothing”), but for some reason I caught myself. I asked her why she wanted to know. Well, she explained, Dan Rather’s booker just called looking for an O. J. expert to go on 48 Hours tonight. Everyone else is still at lunch. Can you do it?After that, Carlson was on TV regularly as a talking head. Five years later, in 2000, he was asked to go on CNN to give commentary after the Lieberman-Cheney debate. That analysis launched the CNN showThe Spin Room,co-hosted by Carlson and Bill Press. It aired at 1 in the morning, then 11 and 11:30 at night, before finally coming to rest at 10:30. The show was short-lived, and little-loved: “Press is a hopeless, dithering wimp who makes Carlson’s bow-tied twit look like The Rock,” wrote a critic inEntertainment Weeklyin 2001. “Between them, Carlson and Press would be hard-pressed to win a debate with network weatherman Flip Spiceland over whether or not the sun is out in Atlanta.”But somehow, despite the cancellation of his debut show, Carlson’s career as player in political TV was on. In 2001, Carlson was asked to co-hostCrossfirewith Paul Begala. He also hosted a weekly public affairs show on PBS,Tucker Carlson: Unfiltered. The most notable moment ofCrossfire, the one everyone remembers, aired on October 15, 2004. That was the day Jon Stewart came onCrossfireand called Tucker Carlson a dick. It’s an infamous moment in cable news history. Carlson and Begala seem to think Stewart is there to promote his book, but he immediately begins criticizing the show. Any attempt by the co-hosts to retake control comes off as weak and wheedling. They try to bait him, but Stewart won’t budge. He defends himself as saying he’s just entertainment, a defense that in hindsight feels misleading considering the wayThe Daily Showchanged news and comedy. In response, Carlson stutters. He’s defensive. He laughs nervously, an early sign of what would become a trademark tic.“Stop, stop, stop, stop hurting America,” Stewart begs Begala and Carlson. The conversation escalates from there, with Stewart lecturing the duo on their cable news theater which masquerades as journalism. Begala says little. It’s Carlson who tries to parry Stewart’s blows. But Stewart does what Carlson would later learn to do so well, he comes out of the gate with an impossible line of questioning and a disingenuous defense. At one point, Carlson notes, “I do think you’re more fun on your show. Just my opinion.”Stewart doesn’t miss a beat. “You know what’s interesting, though? You’re as big a dick on your show as you are on any show.”Carlson clearly still has scars from the exchange. “Jon Stewart was far more popular than I was,” he says, “and so he was recorded as having won the argument. But I never understood what the argument was.”The argument, of course, was that Carlson was hurting America with his rhetoric. And in some ways, that’s still the argument. The power dynamic has changed. And now, Carlson is the one making people stutter defensively. Though Stewart has long been off the air, the parallels between the two men still resonate. Today on his show, Carlson often comes right out of the gate with impossible and leading questions, like Stewart did. He recently asked Julissa Arce, an immigrant rights activist and author, if she had regrets for committing a felony. Andhe asked law professor Ekow N. Yankahwhen it became acceptable to generalize about people based on race. In 2004, people saw Stewart as a rogue, a truth teller, someone who skewered both sides equally. Carlson sees himself the same way. “I think you’ll find a lot of people who say I’m repugnant or expired or whatever, but I don’t think I’m fake.”Crossfirewas cancelled a few months after the Stewart appearance, and former CNN President Jon Klein tells CJR that yes, he did agree with Stewart. He cancelled the show in order to change the culture at CNN. “The original premise that two intelligent people from opposite sides of the spectrum could shed some fascinating light on the issues of the day had devolved in a predictable Punch and Judy show.”Then he goes even further. “CancelingCrossfirewas one of the best decisions I made,” says Klein. In response to Klein, Carlson shot back, “I was long gone from CNN and employed at another network by the timeCrossfiregot canceled. But for the record Jon Klein is a small and dishonest person.”For about a second, the moment marked a watershed for Carlson. He seemed to change. He got an MSNBC show and told people it would be different. He wouldn’t shout. He ditched the bow tie. In a 2005 interview about his now-cancelled MSNBC show, Carlson toldTelevision Week, “This is not ever a show that will ever have guests debating each other. Ever. That is the form in cable news. We’re never doing that. Ever. That’s a worn-out format, and I am not going to do that…I’m right, you’re wrong.’ I hate that.” That same article described Carlson as saying “no” to shouting matches. He then went onDancing with the Starsand was immediately voted off. After MSNBC cancelled Carlson’s show,in 2008, he and his college roommate, former Dick Cheney aide Neil Patel, launched a media start-up, The Daily Caller. The Caller was supposed to be a new kind of conservative outlet—thoughtful, responsible, researched. They hired Megan Mulligan fromTheGuardianto run the day-to-day editorial operations, and for awhile at least, Carlson was hands on. He’d go to editorial meetings with note cards full of ideas. But the site was probably doomed from the beginning. To start with, The Daily Caller was funded by conservative philanthropist Foster Friess, who is famous for telling Andrea Mitchell that in his day, “gals” used toclutch aspirin between their knees as a form of birth control. Editorially, Carlson insisted the site would be independent, and in March 2010, the Caller ran a story about RNC chair Michael Steele using party funds on a private plane and an evening at a bondage-themed nightclub. The story was poorly sourced and drew more skepticism than accolades. When writer Mickey Kaus published an article criticizing Fox News, Carlson immediately removed it. Carlson had a contract with the network as a commentator and, according to Kaus, he said he couldn’t criticize Carlson’s employer. So much for independence. Kaus insists he respects Carlson’s decision and that it’s all “water under the bridge,” but the dream of a rogue outlet of hard-hitting, conservative journalism was never realized. And the site withered from there. Right now the site highlights sensationalist stories about “illegal aliens,” justifiable homicide, and a hit piece on Beto O’Rourke. What The Daily Caller became, a former employee told me, was far different than what it was intended to be. “They used all the technology that told them who was reading the site and what they wanted. So, they gave the people what they wanted.”Which brings us to where we find Carlson today and what the hell happened to him. Every segment and every outburst that “media elites” criticize just make his fans love him more. The more outrage he inspires, the braver, the bolder, the more courageous he seems to his audience. So, the questionWhat happened to Tucker Carlson?is, in the words of Carlson,Are you dumb?If you are asking it, he isn’t for you, and perhaps he was never for you. The two ways of seeing Tucker Carlson are best explained through the titles of YouTube videos:“‘The Day CNN Will Never Forget’ Jon Stewart Wrecks CNN to Pieces”one Tucker Carlson clip is titled. “FLASHBACK: Tucker Brutally Exposes Hypocritical Stewart on Crossfire” another claims. They both link to essentially the same video footage, the day Carlson was lectured by Stewart. Similarly,“Tucker Carlson Meets His Maker Lauren Duca”and“Tucker Slays Crazy Lauren Duca”show the same clip. These clips are a lesson in the disconnect between the Americas. For his fans, the criticisms of him and the controversy drummed up by the show create the perception of Carlson (a rich white man who owns multiple homes and could inherit even more money) as an underdog. A charming rogue. Someone who succeeds no matter what the liberal media tries to smear on him. “My role is really simple,” he tells me, “I want to tell the truth as I see it. I want to be as honest as I can. I don’t think of myself as representing any group of people anywhere.”Every segment and every outburst that “media elites” criticize just make his fans love him more. The more outrage he inspires, the braver, the bolder, the more courageous he seems to his audience. And who doesn’t love a rogue? Since the day Hermes stole Apollo’s cattle, people have always loved a renegade. Hell, America voted for a rogue as president. In that way, Carlson is perfect for this moment in history. A man without loyalties, except to the truth. And for what it’s worth, Carlson has always characterized himself this way. He belongs to no clubs except a fly fishing one. He belongs to no party. He even says he has a spotty history of voting. A former co-worker likens Carlson’s appeal to that of a rowdy prep school frat boy. “What’s the reputation of frat boys? They go get drunk, chase after women, okay?… What’s not to like? What’s not to identify with? It’s basically what a lot of American culture is about.”And Carlson has a rowdy frat-boy reputation. He is rumored to havedumped a drink on the head of Grover Norquist, after Norquist insulted his father. (Carlson clarified to me through his PR person that it was not water.) Carlson also once gave a party for Jack Abramoff, as a way to spit in the eye of the DC elite. Additionally, according to an account he wrote about inPolitics, Partisans, and Parasites, he was almost brought down by scandal when was accused of raping a woman in Indiana. The woman, whom he names in the book, Kimberly Carter, accused Carlson of drugging and raping her at Harper’s Restaurant in Louisville, Kentucky. CJR tried to speak to Carter about the incident, but was unable to reach her and her lawyer did not return calls and emails requesting comment. But according to the book, the incident was groundless. Carter and Carlson were never in the same room together, the charges were dropped and Carter recanted. The book itself is a frustrating compilation of anecdotes that includes a vigorous defense ofGary Conditand the line, “I couldn’t imagine [Monica Lewinsky] wearing a thong. I couldn’t imagine wanting to see it.”I’m sorry, are you offended? That’s the whole point of the book—his irascible and contrarian humor. And if you don’t find it funny, well, he writes, “Liberals used to be funny. They edited magazines likeNational Lampoon. They had a claim on cool. Then something happened. They became sour and earnest and neurotic about secondhand smoke. The Democratic party became the party of the uptight establishment, the that’s-not-funny-young-man party, the party of no fun.”Immediately after his musings on the dour moralizing of liberals, Carlson describes a drunk Jim Traficant’s attempting to assault a cable news employee. It’s a funny anecdote for him. “It was always acceptable to be amused by Jim Traficant, and I usually was,” he writes. It’s the equivalent of a man telling you to go make him a goddamn sandwich, then calling you uptight when you cross your arms and frown. I can imagine Carlson telling me I was humorless for writing this. He’d be bored by my moralizing, and as a former employee of his told me, “Tucker hates to be bored.”It’s like Carlson wrote about Bill O’Reilly: “[He is a] guy who tells the truth and demands that others do the same. A man who won’t be pushed around or take maybe for an answer … And like everyone in media he has a schtick … It works. But there’s a price. O’Reilly’s success is built on the perception that he really is who he claims to be. If he ever gets caught out of character, it’s over.”He then concludes that O’Reilly won’t get caught out of character, because his real life persona and TV character have merged. It’s an insight that feels jarring in light of O’Reilly’s sexual misconduct allegations. And it’s something I heard people say over and over about Carlson—that on TV he was a persona. But by the time I spoke to him, I couldn’t see the difference. It’s a Shakespearean conundrum, one Hamlet grappled with as he pretended to be mad. Insisting, until the end, that he knew a “hawk from a handsaw.”Spoiler alert: The stories of O’Reilly and Hamlet don’t end well for anyone. Yet whatever grand unified theory of Carlson you believe impacts how you see his career. How you see America. And we could go round and round. All theories seem to be truth and untrue. But this wily incongruity of Carlson—his refusal to be pinned down, his legendary contrarianism—is why his audience loves him. He’s an independent thinker, just like them. He’s not loyal to a party, just like them. He tells them to think for themselves. To trust no one. The mainstream media is lying to you, he says. Everyone, except him of course. It’s like the scene in the movie,The Life of Brianwhere Brian, tells a crowd of people, “You are all individuals.”“We are all individuals!” they yell in unison.“Well not me,” one man pipes up from the back. Carlson’s “independence,” says Richard West, professor of communications at Emerson College and author of five books on interpersonal communications, is “change-the-subject conservatism.” Meaning that Carlson’s deftness in defying any one party or ideology and is more about a winning rhetorical strategy than a noble enterprise.“It’s quite a remarkable tactic,” West explains, “because you don’t give people an opportunity to digest … I do believe he’s a conversational narcissist. He hijacks the conversation and contorts it to his own value structure.”Carlson, through his PR person, stated, “I have no idea what that means and West is welcome to come on the show anytime. But I bet you dinner, he is too afraid.”What Carlson’s fans hear, in response to that kind of intellectual moralizing from West, is just another boring lib who doesn’t get it. In a Kindle single titledBill O’Reilly and Tucker Carlson: The Transition of Very Different Conservative Hosts at Fox Newsthe author, Richard West (but not the communications professor from Emerson), revels in Carlson’s tricksterism. This West notes that in August of 2017, Carlson stated that Donald Trump staring at the eclipse without protective eyewear was the “the most impressive thing a president has ever done.“This comment catalyzed a lot of people to mock Carlson. But for Carlson and his supporters, it was an inside joke. Carlson later told Business Insider, “It was a test to see if liberals are really as slow and humorless as people claim,” Carlson said. “Turns out they are.”It’s a neat trick. Say something and when challenged, insist it was a joke. As if jokes themselves rise above criticism. Or by not laughing you are a humorless bore—a liberal. It’s just a play on another Carlson rhetorical move: Say something and then, when criticized, insist that criticism is an attempt to infringe on free speech. This was the circle of hell I found myself stuck in during my interview with Carlson. I had expected a genial conversation. Every profile of Carlson depicts him as a lovely, rational man—fly fishing,making pancakes, leaning back in a chairand chewing Nicorette. Sources have told me he’s charming. He’s engaging. He’s fun and interesting. And all of that was from people who think his politics are abhorrent. My editor offered to send me out to meet him, but Carlson declined. I got a phone call instead. Which, okay, maybe he was busy and besides, I’m not famous. But after our initial conversation about how much we both love Cheetos and both wish we had more kids, the conversation devolved into a lecture on free speech. It was a kind of boring lecture, the kind Carlson abhors. It seemed like a moot point. He has a large platform and all the money and privilege. Who is censoring him? And by that token, conservatives have won. They have the White House and congress. So much winning, right?After our initial conversation about how much we both love Cheetos and both wish we had more kids, the conversation devolved into a lecture on free speech. But according to Carlson, censorship is everywhere. Liberals are suppressing free speech in America by saying they are offended by everything, he tells me. The tech guy at Google,he says, who was fired for exercising his free speech. Carlson is referring to the ex-Google employee James Damore who wrote posts on an internal company message board attributing psychological differences between men and women as the reason there was a gender gap at Google. Damore, Carlson argues, was fired for exercising his free speech. He was the epitome of diversity. And he got fired in the name of diversity. America, what a country. It’s totally Orwellian. And did I know that biologists have proven there are only two genders? Just two. And no high school teacher in the world would tell me otherwise. But it makes liberals mad when you say the truth. Get a biologist to say he’s wrong and he’ll listen but until then. No. I point out that sexuality and gender are inherently different and maybe he’s conflating the two. “Look biological reality is… super deep and exists apart from whatever social construct you’re buying into…and that comes with all kinds of physical consequences,” he explains, explaining nothing. After the interview, I sent his PR persona link to an article that explainshow science has indeed concluded that gender is not binary. His PR person told me “he has no comment on that.”Carlson sees himself as brave for pointing out these truths in the minefield of liberal feelings. He likens it to Galileo, put to death for saying the earth is round. “You should be allowed to say what is provably true and I guess if you don’t agree with that…. that’s by definition irrational and it freaks me out when a large organization punishes people on the basis of irrational belief, because once that starts happening, like, why not kill the people that disagree with you?”“Is this censorship,” I manage to ask, “or just consequences? Doesn’t speech have consequences?” But Carlson dodges.“You agreed there are some things we are not allowed to say because of diversity,” he says.“No, I don’t agree with that.”“You did.”“No. No. No. No.”“Because consequences. Yeah you did.”So apparently, by asking, I’m censoring. I think about the power imbalance. This man. Who has money. Status. 2.7 million viewers. He holds the attention of the president. And me? I might be “the liberal elite,” but I buy groceries at Wal-Mart, live in Iowa, and after 12 years of working as a writer, I still can’t get many outlets to even respond to my pitches. Carlson’s PR person was concerned about silencing, too. She demanded that Carlson be able to respond to every criticism in this piece. And then, if the people who made those criticisms had a response, that Carlson be able to respond to that.“You want him to have the last word?” I asked.“Yes!” she shouted. She was shouting at me, too. I told her he has a show. He has a large audience. He has a website. He has a Twitter following. I was sure he’d be able to find a way to respond without an endless feedback loop. She insisted. She didn’t want him to be silenced. But Carlson isn’t being silenced. He’s plenty loud enough. And anyway I don’t want to silence him. I don’t want to end free speech, I just want to tell him speech has consequences. I tell him that a year after Trump was elected I ended my 12-year marriage to a Republican.“I’ve seen speech have real disastrous consequences. I am going through a divorce right now because of the way speech and politics and religion have worked out in my own marriage. So yes, I see intellectually, free speech. But personally, I see the deep pain. Like everyone, I see a problem in America and I don’t know a way around it.”“You don’t know,” says Carlson, “Well, I do know… You oughta let people say what they think and you shouldn’t punish them for that, period. That’s how I feel.”I am trying to listen. I am trying to understand. I want to understand. If I can figure out what happened to Tucker Carlson, how he went from successful magazine writer to contrarian journalist to raving Fox News host, I believe I will understand what happened to my country, my life even. What happened to make a rich white man the vox populi? How did I, a mom in the Midwest who can’t afford health care, become the humorless, censoring, liberal elite? How are the winners still insisting they are losers? What happened to this whole mess of a world? So I listen and listen. But I get no answers. Most of the quotes I get don’t make any sense. And I’m no closer to an answer now than when I started. All I know is, he was definitely shouting. The New York Times Magazine. He went to Pakistan forNew York.",3,Reliable,0.1092833238590814,0.4941937781634756,9604,9604
853,Political Extremists Are Using YouTube to Monetize Their Toxic Ideas,-15.0,35.33,https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/09/political-extremists-are-using-youtube-to-monetize-their-toxic-ideas/,https://adfontesmedia.com/mother-jones-bias-and-reliability/,2018-09-18,www.motherjones.com,25,"YouTube has become a breeding ground for political extremism. Anadolu Agency/Getty ImageIf you search for “Federal Reserve” on YouTube, one of the first videos to surface is titled “Century of Enslavement.” Using archival footage and the kind of authoritative male voice heard in countless historical documentaries, the 90-minute video espouses the idea the Federal Reserve was formed in secret by powerful, often Jewish, banking families in the early 20th century, causing America to spiral into debt. With over 1.6 million views, the video is categorized as “News and Politics.” It was created by a channel called the Corbett Report, which also boasts documentaries touting conspiracy theories, including that 9/11 was staged by the US government and that global warming is a hoax. Watching the video quickly leads users down a rabbit hole of “recommended videos” that detail Illuminati conspiracy theories and blame Israel for 9/11. The incendiary Federal Reserve video, flagged by MSNBC hostChris Hayesearlier this month, is just one of many examples of how political extremists have mastered YouTube’s algorithms and monetization structure to spread toxic ideas ranging from conspiracy theories to white supremacy. The video “Why Social Justice is CANCER,” for instance, appears after searching for “social justice.”According to a new report entitled “Alternative Influence: Broadcasting the Reactionary Right on YouTube,” researcher Becca Lewis details how the site has also become home for live-streamed, difficult-to-moderate debates on topics such as “scientific racism,” where the two sides typically seem to reach agreement with no alternative position discussed. Over 10,000 active viewers watched a four-hour January debate between several YouTube creators, including white nationalist Richard Spencer and his opponent, Carl Benjamin, a commentator who criticizes identity politics and goes by the name Sargon of Akkad. “Spencer has had years of experience arguing his racial theories and spoke with more confidence than Benjamin,” Lewis writes in the new report characterizing YouTube as a largely uncritical platform for racist ideology. Benjamin asserts that his position in the debate did not advance any white nationalist or racist theories.*YouTube’s parent company, Google, had a limited presence duringJuly’s Congressional hearingson social media’s role in propagating misinformation and political bias, while Facebook and Twitter were the primary targets. But YouTube as an individual company has managed to avoid much scrutiny. With nearly 2 billion unique users a month, the platform is used by 94 percent of 18-24 year olds regularly, and one in five members of this group go to YouTube first to get their news, according to the Pew Research Center. With such a large audience and little oversight, many political extremists have turned to YouTube to spread their views and make money doing it. In thereport, released todayby tech instituteData and Society, Lewis examines how political extremists have created a deeply connected “alternative influencer network” on YouTube. They have used collaborations, like staged debates, to tie together users who promote a range of political positions, some of which are extremist. YouTube posters like “Roaming Millennial” co-opt language from the left to try to radicalize viewers. YouTubeLewis, who is a doctoral candidate in communications at Stanford University, spent a year analyzing more than 80 YouTube channels that connected users with positions ranging from mainstream liberalism to white supremacy. She found that YouTube hasn’t just provided a platform for ideas formerly relegated to anonymous internet forums like 4chan—it’s helped monetize them. Through YouTube’s network, content from so-called “dark web intellectuals”—like anti-feminist psychology professorJordan Peterson—quick leads users to more radical ideologues, like white nationalist Richard Spencer, who broadcast what Lewis describes as “extremely harmful—in many cases, racist and sexist—content.” Content creators adopt the position of being marginalized cultural underdogs while reaching an audience of millions. By appearing on each other’s channels and collaborating on staged debates, these alternative content creators have created an intricate network that makes political extremism easily accessible on YouTube.spoke to Lewis about her report and how YouTube has become a breeding ground for political extremism. It seems YouTube gets much less attention than Facebook and Twitter when we talk about political extremism and misinformation. Why is that?We’ve gotten a really clear picture of the type of fake news that disseminates on Facebook [when it’s]created by Macedonian teenagers. We’ve gotten a really clear idea of what can happen when Donald Trump retweets a tweet that originated from an anti-Semitic meme on an anonymous forum. We don’t have as clear a picture of what’s happening on YouTube and Google. It is important to bring to the fore some illustrations of the problems that do exist on these platforms. I’m trying to show there are fundamental issues we need to be addressing with YouTube in the same way we have recognized fundamental issues with Facebook and Twitter. YouTube is also one of the only platforms that offers financial incentives to creators through its Partner Program, which allows them to make money off ads on their videos. Can you explain how this incentivizes more extreme behavior?One of the troubling implications of the report is that these issues can’t be fixed with a simple tweak here or there because they are built into the monetization structure of YouTube. One thing that makes YouTube so appealing to influencers and viewers alike is the fact that viewers can interact directly with the people making content and have a more intimate relationship than viewers or readers have with mainstream news outlets. At the same time, an influencer who is making content, in most cases, is also trying to make money off it. So when they have viewers whoare telling them to keep making more and more extremist content, they have a direct financial incentive to do so. It speaks to the larger culture of metrics in newsrooms and the emergence of clickbait, but it’s particularly pronounced in a very specific way on YouTube. And I think you see people going down these [ideological] paths they might not otherwise because they’re financially incentivized to do so. One way these posters define themselves is by saying they are underdogs who are being attacked by mainstream society. Do you have any thoughts on how to de-platform or de-monetize these creators if they just turn around and point to those efforts as examples of the very discrimination they can use to bolster their claims?That’s a fundamental question that has been plaguing academics and tech firms alike. My interpretation is that the framing of social underdog paranoia thrives when content moderation and platforming happens inconsistently and without a clear explanation. And the fact is that if [extremists] were being consistently de-platformed, they wouldn’t be able to make content about it. Someone who has talked a lot about censorship is Paul Joseph Watson, an influencer on YouTube who is affiliated with. Most recently, after Alex Jones was removed from YouTube, Watson made a video called “(((Censored))),” which signals anti-Semitic themes while discussing alleged conservative bias on social media platforms. But at the same time, he has over 1 million followers, 1 million subscribers on YouTube. And as part of the YouTube Partner Program, he has received a plaque from YouTube for influencers who passed 1 million followers. So here he is able to provide that narrative of censorship while getting influencer treatment from the platform. There’s been a lot of discussion in Congress about how to best regulate social media platforms. Do you have any thoughts on what actions should be taken by either tech companies or lawmakers to rein in this problem?Up until now these platforms have largely been given carte blanche; they have evaded regulation to a large extent. So even the shifting nature of the conversation, the fact these platforms are now facing pressure externally, is a promising sign. Even though you could debate how much actually came out of the congressional hearings, I think it’s a promising sign that they have started. In terms of talking about solutions, we need to be approaching these problems from multiple tracks. I absolutely think reassessing the algorithms [that surface extremist content] is one step that needs to be taken. Assessing what government regulation options are available is absolutely worthwhile, and then thinking about how YouTube monetization structures incentivize certain behaviors is something that needs to be done. It needs to be a multi-pronged solution.",2,Generally Reliable,0.1223014963561181,0.3394466294676379,1804,1804
784,"Proud Boys founder denies inciting violence, responds to whether he feels responsible for group's behavior",-2.0,47.67,https://abcnews.go.com/US/proud-boys-founder-denies-inciting-violence-responds-feels/story?id=59758209,https://adfontesmedia.com/abc-news-bias-and-reliability/,2018-12-12,abcnews.go.com,25,"Gavin McInnes sat down with ABC News' Paula Faris for ""Nightline.""There’s a rite of initiation taking place across the country. “I’m a proud Western chauvinist,” these men declare, following with, “I refuse to apologize for creating the modern world.”Some of them will go into the next stage through a bizarre ritual: the pledge must rattle off the names of five breakfast cereals while being punched by current members.“Proud of your boy!” some might shout. These are parts of the induction process for men who want to join the controversial self-described fraternity called the Proud Boys. Their rallying cry is what they call “Western chauvinism,” which the group’s founder, Gavin McInnes told ABC News’ Paula Faris to mean “inordinately patriotic” to Western civilization.“Ninety-nine percent is meeting in a bar once a month and drinking beer just like everyone else,” McInnes said. “The other 1 percent is escorting conservative speakers to and from their cars or wherever they’re going.”McInnes, formerly of Vice Media, founded the group in 2016. He is known for what some call incendiary claims, such as telling viewers of his Rebel Media show to “be dubious of Muslims, if you see something, say something,” and that “The data says that women have become less happy since feminism. And I blame them being ripped out of the kitchen.”In the two years since the Proud Boys’ founding violence has seemed to follow in its wake. In recent months, its members have participated in street brawls during protests in Portland, Oregon, Seattle and New York City. The New York City incidentwhen a violent confrontation broke out between members of Proud Boys and the anti-fascist group Antifa after a speech McInnes gave at the Metropolitan Republican Club. The Proud Boys claimed Antifa members attacked them, but now 10 Proud Boys are facing criminal charges and some of them could face possible jail time, according to authorities. That incident led to McInnes announcing last month that he was quitting the group.“I’m officially disassociating myself from the Proud Boys, in all capacities, forever, I quit,” McInnes said in a resignation video posted online. “I’m told by my legal team and law enforcement that this gesture will help alleviate their sentencing… We are not an extremist group and we do not have ties with white nationalists.”McInnes, a conservative media personality himself, has given speeches during his Proud Boys tenure. In one he gave at New York University last year after a clash with Antifa, in he said, ""Violence doesn't feel good, justified violence feels great, and fighting solves everything.” In another speech he gave in Feb. 2017, he said, “I want violence. I want punching in the face.”But McInnes denied that he is inciting violence, saying that his statements “are pretty mainstream things as far as I'm concerned. Justified violence is protecting some woman who was getting beaten up.”When asked if the Proud Boys reveled in violence, he responded, “I think the Proud Boys do enjoy a good brawl.”McInnes was firm in saying that the Proud Boys are not racists, misogynists, a hate group, “hipster Nazis,” white supremacists nor extremists. The group’s founder, Gavin McInnes has used his show to evangelize the Proud Boys manifesto, which outlines various mottos such as, “legalize drugs,” “close the borders” and “venerate the housewife.”“I believe that 95 percent of women would be happier at home,” McInnes told Faris. “I’m fine with being perceived as a misogynist. That’s fine. [But] extreme radical hate group… that’s nuts.”And at the heart of the Proud Boys is the belief that “the West is the best.”“Russia sucks, China sucks, the Middle East is not my cup of tea,” McInnes said. “I think it’s inarguable that the West is superior. The West is built on liberty and meritocracy, and busting you’re a--.”McInnes said he sees himself as a “provocateur” that does “satirical commentary.”“I talk about the news,” he said. “I make jokes.”But some believe he uses jokes as a cover for dangerous ideas, citing certain statements he has made, including on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast, in which he said “Mexico sucks because of Mexicans. What have they contributed to society in the past 100 years?” But McInnes says that comment was taken out of context.“Someone was b----ing about how America and their foreign policy, and it’s ruined all these countries, and it’s ruined Mexico, and I said, ‘America did not ruin Mexico. Mexicans are responsible for Mexico. Mexicans ruined Mexico,’” McInnes told Faris. “That’s the tone there, but when it’s taken out of context, it sounds like some sort of reverend of hate.”McInnes claims the group was meant to be nothing more than a benign gathering of politically incorrect, conservative men full of sophomoric antics and a lot of beer drinking. Admist the controversy, he claims that the group, which even adopted the song “Proud of Your Boy” from the musical “Aladdin” as its anthem, now has over 10,000 members worldwide. His move to start the group coincided with President Trump's candidacy and McInnes called election night 2016 “one of the greatest nights of my life.”“We love Trump,” he said. “[Election night 2016] was just heaven, and we thought, ‘finally, all of this politically correct pandering, all this pedantic social justice warrior stuff, it’s going to at least take a break.”Their chapters hold monthly meetings that are closed to the public and ban women. But a select group of Proud Boys members agreed to meet with “Nightline” at a bar in New York City to talk about what the group means to them.“We are the most misunderstood group in America… First it's like [we’re called], ‘far-right group,’ then it's like, ‘far-right hate group,’ ‘far-right white supremacist group,’ ‘far-right gang,’” said one member named Mantis, who believes those labels are not accurate. “We stand against white power, for sure.”“[It’s] an organization that doesn’t care who you sleep with, what god you pray to,” said another member named Yosef. “All we care about is that you have a good time… and improve yourself.”Proud Boys members are often photographed displacing a certain hand gesture commonly known as the symbol for “OK,” but is also perceived as a white power hand symbol. But the members “Nightline” spoke with said the “white power hand symbol” was a “joke” that was started and spread by 4-chan, an online forum often linked to the extreme right where users post anonymously.“If you see back in 2016, people were doing that, and that's because when you see Trump talk he's like, ‘This is the greatest country in the world,’” Mantis said, as he demonstrated the symbol. “So that was what it was originally, and then 4chan thought it would be funny to make you guys believe that it was racist, so they said that this was like a P, and this was a W, and it was a white power thing.”These Proud Boys members claimed that 4chan spread this meme with the intention of riling up the left. When asked if continuing to display the gesture deepens what they say is a misunderstanding about the group, the Proud Boys members defended their position.“They don't like that we exist, so why am I trying to prove myself to people that are offended at my existence?” Mantis said. “The fact that I support Trump, the fact that I'm a conservative, I mean everything that I am triggers the left. It gets to the point where I just don't care anymore.”When “Nightline” asked McInnes about the hand gesture, he said, “If I was their [Proud Boys] boss, I'd say, ‘Guys, this is causing too much trouble. Please stop doing it in photos.’”At least one former member says there is something more insidious taking over the Proud Boys.“As soon as I saw what the trajectory was, I had that kind of gut feeling and I started moving myself away from them,” said Dante Nero, a comedian and self-described relationship guru, who has made appearances on McInnes’ show, “The Gavin McInnes Show,” which ended last year. Nero had been referred to as the Proud Boys’ “pope,” but he said he has left the movement, saying what happened at theinfamous Unite the Right rallyin Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer is a cautionary tale. Before that notorious rally, Jason Kessler, the rally organizer, had appeared on McInnes’ show and is reported to have attended Proud Boys meetings in Virginia.“Everybody is not perpetuating violence, but the complicitness in knowing that there's violence going on, the complicitness in that you're not checking people who have racist and violent tendencies makes you part of the problem,” Nero said. “So is… the Proud Boys solely responsible for Charlottesville? Absolutely not. There are members who just—I’m quite sure there are members who just joined because their friend was in it.”The group’s “philosophy,” Nero said, “emboldened” those who believe the group provides “a safe haven for those kinds of racists ideas.”But McInnes said he quickly disavowed any Proud Boys that were associated with the events in Charlottesville.“If anyone from our group showed up at Unite the Right, they were instantly booted, never spoken to again, ex-persona non-grata. And I made that clear months before,” he told Faris. But after McInnes’ departure, the Proud Boys elected a member named Enrique Tarrio as its chairman, who did attend the Unite the Right rally, though hetold ABC’s Miami-based affiliate WPLGthat he had misgivings about the torchlight march and did not participate in it. But when asked if he thought white supremacy existed in the U. S., McInnes said, “not to any measurable degree.”“Everyone always says [Richard Spencer, David Duke], everyone always says those two guys and the KKK, let’s get them all together. You’re lucky if they fill up a living room,” he said. McInnes’ wife, who asked not to be named due to safety concerns, said it’s a relief to no longer have her husband be part of the Proud Boys.“This is impeding on the peace for my opportunity to raise my kids,” she said.“It’s my fault,” McInnes replied. His wife said she was raised in a “liberal household” and is a “diehard Democrat.” She said the way her husband’s politics have evolved over the years have been a “challenge” and have had a negative impact on her.“I respect anyone's right to have their opinion,” she continued. Meanwhile, McInnes’ account was suspended from Twitter in August, he was banned from Facebook in October, and this week, his YouTube account was terminated for what they say is copyright infringement. He was also ousted from Blaze TV after less than a week at the conservative network. McInnes responded in a statement to these social media bans by saying he was a victim of “lies and propaganda,” adding, “I’m finally out of platforms and unable to defend myself.”When asked if he bore any responsibility for what the Proud Boys have become, he said, “Yes, I do bear any responsibility. I'm not guilt-free in this,” adding, “There's culpability there. I shouldn't have said ‘violence solves everything’ or something like that without making the context clear and I regret saying things like that.”Still, Mcinnes remained firm in saying he was not apologizing for the group, and that he would not take anything back. “No, that ship has sailed,” he said.",3,Reliable,0.2027766140669366,0.5431587767071638,2774,2774
