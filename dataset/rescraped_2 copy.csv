But, the show, known for the eager crowds, will look very different this year. This year’s hybrid format includes panels and select events that can be viewed online. The four-day festival will still feature exclusive events and celebrity panels. Celebrities including “Star Trek”‘s William Shatner and George Takei and “The Suicide Squad”‘s John Cena will be on hand for other appearances and autographs. “Stranger Things’” David Harbour and Hayden Christensen from the “Star Wars” prequels and Jurnee Smollett from “Lovecraft Country” and “Birds of Prey” will be in attendance. Fans have been buzzing about the “Star Trek: Prodigy” event, where they’ll be able to see the first episode of the new “Star Trek” series a week before it airs on Paramount+. Due to the festival being held at Javits Convention Center in Manhattan, proof of vaccination is required to enter for those over age 12. Those under 12 must show proof of a negative COVID-19 test. Masking inside the venue will be mandatory. NYCC has also reduced capacity with wider aisles, enhanced cleaning and larger areas between creators. The San Diego Comic-Con is set to return in November."

You can watch Dr. Anthony Fauci’s full interview with Leland Vittert in the player above Dr. Fauci and the National Institutes of Health are facing scrutiny from Republican members of Congress and others over grant money paid to a lab in Wuhan, China in the early 2000s, as scientists increasingly question whether COVID-19 emerged from the lab. But Fauci said the research, which looked into the risk of bat coronaviruses being transmitted to humans, is being inappropriately connected to the Chinese military. “We’re not talking about the Communist Chinese party. We’re not talking about the Chinese military. We’re talking about scientists that we’ve had relationships for years,” Fauci said. The grant in question was given to a group called EcoHealth Alliance in 2002, which then paid the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which collects genetic material from wildlife and experiments with live viruses in animals to gauge human susceptibility. Fauci argued the amount of NIH funding which went to the lab was relatively low. “The Wuhan lab is a very large lab, to the tune of hundreds of millions if not billions of dollars — the grant that we’re talking about was $600,000 over five years,” Fauci said. To reduce the risk of pathogens escaping, the facility is supposed to enforce rigorous safety protocols, but even the strictest measures cannot eliminate such risks. While testifying before a Senate committee last Wednesday, Fauci acknowledged it wasn’t possible to tell if the grantee was lying about what the funds were used for, but said Wednesday the quality of reports issued by the lab suggested they were used appropriately. “I can’t guarantee everything that’s going on in the Wuhan lab, we can’t do that, but it is our obligation as scientists and public health individuals to study the animal-human interface because we had a very difficult experience that we lucked out that we didn’t get hurt too badly with the original SARS in 2002 and 2003,” Fauci said. Fauci said working with the lab was necessary in order to find out the potential for the viruses to infect humans, “which might then damage the United States.” “You don’t want to go to Hoboken, New Jersey or to Fairfax, Virginia to be studying the bat-human interface that may lead to an outbreak, so you go to China,” Fauci said. President Joe Biden has ordered American investigators to submit a report looking into the origins of COVID-19 within 90 days, and pledged to release the results of their findings publicly. China responded by accusing the U.S. of playing politics with the virus. Also this week, thousands of Fauci’s emails from early in the pandemic were released to news outlets including Buzzfeed and The Washington Post under a Freedom of Information Act request. They show Fauci’s communications with officials, reporters, celebrities and even concerned citizens as the pandemic unfolded. “The only trouble is they are really ripe to be taken out of context where someone can snip out a sentence in an email without showing the other emails and say, ‘based on an email from Dr. Fauci, he said such-and-such,” where you don’t really have the full context,” Fauci said. Looking ahead, Fauci said if the U.S. meets President Joe Biden’s goal of 70% of adults with at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine by Fourth of July, it will be a “giant step towards” returning to normal but the pandemic won’t be completely over. “Even though the virus is not going to disappear, it will diminish greatly as a public health threat, which means we can get closer to normality and we feel that by the time we get to the summer it will get better and better,” Fauci said."

(NewsNation Now) — If you show up to the Gillette, Wyoming Workforce Center any day of the week, you’ll meet people like Joe Clingan. “Right now I am unemployed. I don’t know for certain when I am going back. I have talked to the boss more than once,” Clingan said. Clingan is an electrician who was laid off from an oil field and is now looking for work. “Until they figure out this pandemic and what President Biden’s plans are, we don’t know if it is feasible to go back to work,” Clingan said. Wyoming is one of the top energy producing states in the nation, but the mining jobs have been disappearing. Wyoming lost 5,700 mining and logging jobs in just the last year. “It is really hard and it affects everyone in the county because these are well paying jobs,” Rick Masheim with the Workforce Center said. Mansheim said good mining jobs pay around $80,000 to $90,000 per year. There are not other industries in the area that pay nearly that without significant training. Miners in the area worry President Joe Biden’s new energy and climate change plans will make the unemployment situation even worse. The only option for many of the miners is to relocate, or come up with an entirely new career. Ray Burger is one the miners who reinvented himself. He worked at a mine for almost four decades. “It was 36 years, 10 months, and one week when the doors were closed at Black Jewel,” Burger said. Burger had experience on the mine rescue team and it led him to enroll in nursing school. “I’m not the first student from the mining experience who has gone into the nursing program. I’m not the last. I’m not even the oldest,” Burger said. Burger works the nightshift as a janitor at an elementary school to support his family, and then goes to nursing school at Gillette College during the day. It might sound like a lot — but he was used to working 12 to 14 hour shifts at the mine. “It isn’t necessarily that the miners are able to adapt, I think it is humans. We humans can adapt to change,” he said. The Workforce Center pays Burger’s tuition. They said other miners have had success going into construction and trucking jobs, but they are hoping to also attract factory and industrial jobs to the area."
78,Beto O’Rourke considering run for Texas governor,-2.33,40.33,https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/beto-orourke-considering-run-for-texas-governor/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsnation-now-bias-reliability/,2021-01-29,www.newsnationnow.com,25,"EL PASO, Texas (NewsNation Now) —Former Congressman and 2020 Democratic presidential candidate Beto O’Rourke said he may enter the race to unseat Texas Gov. Greg Abbott next year. O’Rourke stated for the first time publicly that he’s considering a run for governor in 2022, during a radio interview on KLAQ’s “The Buzz Adams Morning Show” in El Paso Monday. “You know what, it’s something I’m going to think about,” he said near the end of 15-minute interview. O’Rourke suggested Gov. Abbott’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic may affect his own thinking about getting into the race. “This state has suffered perhaps more than any other in the midst of this pandemic, in the midst of the worst recession since the Great Depression. It is particularly galling to me…that El Paso has in one of the hardest-hit states was, if not is, the hardest-hit city,” O’Rourke said. “So many people dying so quickly that you set up 10 mobile morgues. You have to call in the National Guard to haul the dead bodies, and you have a complete indifference on the part of Gov. Greg Abbott to what local leadership, including our county judge, Judge Samaniego, are trying to do to literally save the lives of the people in our lives,” added O’Rourke. O’Rourke, a Democrat, gained national attention when he narrowly lost the election to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz in 2018, finishing two percentage points behind the Republican incumbent. He also ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic presidential nomination and ended up endorsing President Joe Biden’s candidacy. Texas State University confirmed O’Rourke would begin teaching a Texas politics class during the spring 2021 semester. The University of Texas at Austin also shared O’Rourke would teach a seminar at the LBJ School of Public Affairs. O’Rourke echoed his earlier statements on Twitter Thursday after the interview. “Whether or not I run, I will do everything in my power to elect a Governor who looks out for everyone, keeps Texans safe, answers to the people instead of the special interests & guarantees that we all have equal opportunity to achieve our best in life,” O’Rourke said in a Twitter thread. NewsNation affiliate KXAN reached out Thursday afternoon to Abbott’s office for comment and had not heard back at the time of publication. According to reporting from The Texas Tribune, Abbott has said he is “100%” running for reelection but more recently breathed new life into long-lingering rumors he is thinking about a White House run. After 2022, Abbott said in a recent radio interview, “We’ll see what happens.” NewsNation affiliate KXAN contributed to this report."
79,Capitol Police bolstering travel security for lawmakers,-4.33,44.33,https://www.newsnationnow.com/politics/capitol-police-bolstering-travel-security-for-lawmakers/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsnation-now-bias-reliability/,2021-01-29,www.newsnationnow.com,25,"WASHINGTON (NewsNation Now) — The Capitol Police are boosting security at Washington-area transportation hubs and taking other steps to fortify travel security for lawmakers in response to the fallout from the Capitol riots. Capitol Police will be stationed at area airports and Washington’s Union Station railway hub on busy travel days, the House’s chief law enforcement officer wrote in an email obtained Friday by The Associated Press. Timothy P. Blodgett, the acting sergeant at arms, wrote that officials were setting up an online portal so lawmakers can notify them of travel plans and urged legislators to report threats and suspicious activity. “Members and staff should remain vigilant of their surroundings and immediately report anything unusual or suspicious,” said the email, which was sent late Thursday. Blodgett’s letter said lawmakers have previously been advised that they can use office expense accounts to pay for security to protect their offices and events in their districts and protect themselves while they are performing official duties. It also cited a 2017 Federal Elections Commission opinion that they can use campaign contributions to install security systems at their homes. President Joe Biden is in “close touch” with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., about congressional security, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said. Also Thursday, the acting chief of the Capitol Police said “vast improvements” are needed to protect the Capitol and adjacent office buildings, including permanent fencing. Such barricades have ringed the complex since the Jan. 6 riots, but many lawmakers have long resisted giving the nation’s symbol of democracy the look of a besieged compound, and leaders were noncommittal about the idea. The message was sent the same day House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told reporters that lawmakers face threats of violence and said money would be needed to improve security. Pelosi’s comments were a startling acknowledgment of escalating internal tensions between the two parties over safety since the Jan. 6 Capitol attack. Pelosi focused her comments on the anxiety and partisan frictions that have persisted in Congress since Trump supporters’ breach of the Capitol. She told reporters she thinks Congress will need to provide money “for more security for members, when the enemy is within the House of Representatives, a threat that members are concerned about.” Asked to clarify what she meant, Pelosi said, “It means that we have members of Congress who want to bring guns on the floor and have threatened violence on other members of Congress.” Some lawmakers who voted for this month’s House impeachment of Trump have reported receiving threats, and initial moves to enhance safety procedures have taken on clear partisan undertones. Some Republicans have objected to having to pass through newly installed metal detectors before entering the House chamber, while Pelosi has proposed fining lawmakers who bypass the devices. Pelosi did not say whom she meant by her reference to an “enemy” within the House, and a spokesperson provided no examples when asked. First-term Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has also come under scrutiny this week for social media posts in recent years before she took office that supported violence against Democratic politicians, including Pelosi. Asked to comment, Greene sent a written statement accusing Democrats and journalists of attacking her because she is “a threat to their goal of Socialism” and supports Trump and conservative values. Yogananda D. Pittman, acting chief of the Capitol Police, said in a statement that based on security assessments by her agency and others, some changes should be lasting. “In light of recent events, I can unequivocally say that vast improvements to the physical security infrastructure must be made to include permanent fencing, and the availability of ready, back-up forces in close proximity to the Capitol,” said Pittman, whose agency provides security for Congress. Pelosi took no immediate stance about Pittman’s proposal for permanent fencing. Drew Hammill, the speaker’s spokesperson, said she would await a Capitol security review led by retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré “to understand what infrastructure changes are necessary.” Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., took the same approach, telling reporters he would “defer to the experts.” Others panned the permanent fencing suggestion. Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., said she was “adamantly opposed” and had heard no justification for its need. First-term Rep. Jake Auchincloss, D-Mass., a former Marine, said it would be wrong to turn the Capitol into a ”fortress.” The public is barred from carrying firearms on Capitol grounds. Members of Congress can keep guns in their offices or transport them on the campus if they’re unloaded and securely wrapped. The Associated Press contributed to this article: Reporting by Alan Fram."

(WGHP) — A North Carolina couple will never forget July 27, 2020. Around 4:30 a.m., Patricia Middlebrooks awoke to a strange noise coming from her husband, Bobby. “It scared me, so I got up and cut the bathroom light on, and I watched him,” Middlebrooks said. “He was still breathing real shallow-like.” She yelled for their son who was asleep in another room, and the pair called 911. “They told him to massage his heart, which we didn’t know CPR,” Middlebrooks said. “So we moved the bed over and laid him flat on the floor because that was the instruction, and my son was counting, pressing on his chest. And I was just overwhelmed with what I was looking at.” Just a few blocks away, High Point Police Officer Derik Huffman heard the call come over the radio and raced over. “Usually we get there and EMS has already beat us there. But this time, I was the first on the scene,” Huffman said. “Due to the severity of the call, training just kicked in.” By the time Huffman got into the bedroom, Bobby wasn’t breathing and didn’t have a heartbeat.“The son was trying to do CPR, and I could hear the dispatcher (on speakerphone) explaining to them CPR, and I remember using that, using the reps as I was doing CPR because I could hear her just giving out the cadence to stay on to,” Huffman said. He said it “was a matter of maybe a minute” or two until his partner, Master Officer Robyn Shute, arrived. “I said, ‘OK, I’ll take over now,’ and he stood up and I could tell he was out of breath,” Shute said. “You don’t realize when you’re training, but when you’re in the moment and doing real compressions on a real person, it’s a lot harder than you think it is.” The two worked together until EMS arrived.They took over. They hit him one time with an electroshock, and you could just hear him take this breath, like “a loud snoring breath,” Huffman said. “And just this big rush of relief comes over you at that time because you know that he’s now breathing on his own.”EMS told the officers had they not started chest compressions when they did, Bobby likely wouldn’t have survived. Bobby was placed in a medically induced coma for 24 hours and spent six weeks recovering in the hospital and getting stronger. Six months later, Bobby has a pacemaker and visits the hospital multiple times a week to participate in a heart health program. Bobby doesn’t remember the ordeal, but he and his wife are very aware this could’ve had a much different outcome. “I did make it back. I did receive that kind of attention,” Bobby said. “Nobody gave up on me, and it worked out for my benefit.” “I know God put these people in place for this. I knew he had the right people to do the job,” Patricia said. “I couldn’t ask for two better people to walk through the door.”"
81,"Fauci warns virus variants are ‘a wake-up call’, scientists must be ready to tweak vaccines",0.0,43.67,https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/coronavirus/bidens-covid-19-response-team-to-brief-public-after-south-africa-variant-detected/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsnation-now-bias-reliability/,2021-01-29,www.newsnationnow.com,25,"WASHINGTON (NewsNation Now) — A team of scientists and public health experts assembled by President Joe Biden briefed the public on the nation’s COVID-19 response efforts Friday, just one day after a new variant was identified in the U.S. Dr. Anthony Fauci said the emergence and increasing spread of coronavirus mutations means that vaccine makers must be ready to make new shots to stay ahead of the public health crisis. “You can be almost certain that as long as there is a lot of virus circulating in the community, there will be the evolution of mutants, because that is what viruses do,” the government’s top infectious disease expert said Friday. “This is a wake-up call to all of us,” says Fauci, noting government scientists will be working to keep pace with virus mutations. The nature of viruses is to change in ways that promote their spread, Fauci says. The evolution of mutant versions means scientists need to be “nimble” and ready to make tweaks to vaccines. So far, the mutants haven’t overwhelmed the protective power of vaccines. Moderna said Monday that its vaccine is effective against emerging variants of coronavirus that have appeared in the United Kingdom and South Africa. But it said it would test a vaccine booster and an altered booster against the South African variant in pre-clinical trials to see if that would be more effective in boosting antibodies against the variant and other future variants. Fauci also said the latest results of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine trial were “encouraging”. J&J said Friday that in the U.S. and seven other countries, the single-shot vaccine was 66% effective overall at preventing moderate to severe illness, and much more protective — 85% — against the most serious symptoms. Fauci urged people to look beyond the vaccine to vaccine efficacy results, noting “is a single shot vaccine in which you start to see efficacy anywhere from seven to 10 days.” Senior advisor Andy Slavitt said seven states had provided the first vaccine dose to more than 10% of their adult populations. The states Slavitt listed were: Alaska, West Virginia, New Mexico, Connecticut, North Dakota, Oklahoma and South Dakota. The White House COVID-19 Response Team held a briefing earlier this week, when the variant first identified in South Africa hadn’t yet been detected in the country. State health officials in South Carolina confirmed two cases of the strain on Thursday. Public health officials said it’s almost certain that there are more infections that have not been identified yet. They’ve also expressed concern that this version spreads more easily and that vaccines could be less effective against it. The two cases were discovered in adults in different regions of the state and do not appear to be connected. Neither of the people infected has traveled recently, the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control said Thursday. South Africa first detected the variant in October. Since then, it’s been found in at least 30 other countries. Viruses are constantly mutating, with coronavirus variants circulating around the globe, but scientists are primarily concerned with the emergence of three of them. Other variants first reported in the United Kingdom and Brazil were previously confirmed in the U.S. Some tests suggest the South African and Brazilian variants may be less susceptible to antibody drugs or antibody-rich blood from COVID-19 survivors, both of which help people fight off the virus.

82,Limited indoor dining in NYC restaurants to make return on Valentine’s Day,0.0,47.33,https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/northeast/limited-indoor-dining-in-nyc-restaurants-to-make-return-on-valentines-day/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsnation-now-bias-reliability/,2021-01-29,www.newsnationnow.com,25,"NEW YORK (NewsNation Now) — After a monthslong ban, indoor dining at New York City restaurants will return by Valentine’s Day at 25% capacity if infection rates continue to drop, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Friday. New York City is home to roughly 24,000 restaurants, and many owners have complained that the ban that went into effect Dec. 14 was destroying their livelihoods. At the current trajectory of coronavirus rates for the state, indoor dining is projected to resume Feb. 14 reported NewsNation affiliate WPIX. Cuomo said the timing also allows restaurants a period of time to prepare before reopening. The announcement follows the easing of restrictions Wednesday in other parts of the state where Cuomo erased the handful of remaining “orange zones” where tougher pandemic restrictions had been in place because of the fast spread of COVID-19. The orange zones had been in central and western New York, Staten Island and Westchester County. Cuomo said he’s launching several yellow zones, which require schools to launch testing programs, in certain New York City neighborhoods and a part of Orange County where hospitalizations and infections are increasing. Now, outside of the yellow zones, the entire state faces most of the same COVID-19 restrictions: from a 10-person limit on private residential gatherings to a 10 p.m. curfew for restaurants and bars, to a 50% capacity limit for houses of worship. “We’re talking about livelihoods and the economy and billions of dollars,” said Cuomo Wednesday. “We make decisions based on the facts today… The holiday surge came. The holiday surge is over. We’re not back to where we were but nobody’s back to where we were.” The Democrat cited a post-holiday dip in the number of infections, after a period in which rates had surged to more than 114,000 new cases in one week. Statewide COVID-19 hospitalizations have dropped by 916 since Jan. 19 to 8,357. “All the models project that numbers to continue to drop,” Cuomo said Friday. But many restaurant owners were hoping to open up sooner. “Restaurants are broken hearted that they need to wait two weeks until Valentine’s Day to open at only 25% occupancy in the city, while permitting 50% occupancy in dining rooms around the rest of the state where infections and hospitalization rates from COVID-19 are higher,” Andrew Rigie, executive director of the NYC Hospitality Alliance, said in a release. On Friday, Cuomo also said the 50-person limit on wedding receptions is set to be raised to 150 people on March 15, as long as the venue remains at 50% capacity or under. The celebrations must be approved by the local health department, and everybody who attends needs to take a COVID-19 test, according to the governor. “Promise of marital bliss is returning,” Cuomo said.

The Louisiana-based restaurant chain is trying to hire 10,000 new workers over the next 50 days at locations across the country. “The first thing we teach new hires at Cane’s is that we are all Fry Cooks & Cashiers, and this week, we are proving that,” said chief operating officer AJ Kumaran in a statement published by QSR magazine. Raising Cane’s is just one of many employers struggling to find workers to fill a surge in job openings — with a record 10.9 million reported nationwide in July. “It’s no secret that today’s hiring market is a challenge,” Kumaran in a statement obtained by Bloomberg. “Ahead of our massive growth next year, having the support we need is critical.” Massive aid from the federal government and the rollout of vaccines has supported an economic recovery, providing consumers with the financial wherewithal to spend and the confidence to return to restaurants, bars and shops. The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits dipped last week to 326,000, in another sign that the U.S. job market and economy continue their steady recovery from last year’s coronavirus recession. However, they are still above the 200,000-250,000 range that is viewed as consistent with a healthy labor market. Raising Cane’s has 530 locations across the country.

(NewsNation Now) — The coronavirus pandemic led leaders from many companies to announce employees will continue to work from home this year. Thanks to technology, many people can work almost anywhere, and now city leaders in Tulsa, Oklahoma, are trying to capitalize on that trend. City leaders are offering people $10,000 to relocate to Tulsa. Nestled between the Osage Hills and the Ozark Mountains, about 100 miles northeast of Oklahoma City, lies Tulsa. It’s the state’s second-largest city, and it bears a storied past, from its Native American settling and the Tulsa Race Massacre of 1921 to the drilling boom that made it the “oil capital of the world.” It’s a utopia for those torn between wanting big-city splendors and the charms of small-town life. “We’ve got a top 10 opera in the nation, we’ve got a beautiful ballet, we’ve got museums,” said Grant Bumgarner, Tulsa Remote’s community manager. “We’ve got incredible amenities; the only difference is they’re cheaper and easier to get to, and there’s a stronger community built around them. In the language of the Creek Tribe, Tulsa means “old town,” and in an effort to bring new life, diversity, and perspective to the energy-sector city, Tulsa visionaries created Tulsa Remote. “We basically pay people $10,000 to do the job they’re already doing, just from Tulsa, for one year,” Bumgarner explained. That’s right, Tulsa Remote will pay people $10,000 to move to the city and continue to work remotely. The program quickly became appealing to candidates like Obum Ukabam and Bobby Reyes.“It did seem too good to be true, and one day when I was going to work on the bus, it was like six o’clock, I was like, why not. So, I filled out the application, did everything, and sent it off,” said Reyes. “It was destiny, I was destined to find it—because I found it on a Facebook post that I could have just missed,” said Obum. Both men got accepted. Ukabam moved from California two years ago; he’s one of the original Tulsa Remote members. He worked his remote gig for about a year before landing a job at Tulsa’s Holberton School for aspiring software engineers who dream of making it big in Silicon Valley. “I remember looking over at my wife, and I said, ‘This city looks pretty cool, this program looks pretty cool; if I get in would you consider uprooting our lives and moving to Oklahoma? Is that okay?’ and she was like ‘yeah,’” said Ukabam. Reyes is a new member and software designer. He and his partner moved in November, uprooting a comfortable life in Chicago to take a chance on Tulsa. He says he’s been pleasantly surprised by the city’s people, opportunities, and Tulsa’s food scene. “Except for like deep dish (pizza), that’s a really big thing for me. I had to deliver Lou Malnati’s here, so for pizza Friday that’s like what we do,” Reyes said. Reyes and Ukabam are two of more than 400 Tulsa remotes. Bumgarner helps choose applicants; he says the program has exploded. “We were surprised, we thought maybe the first year we’d bring in 20-25 people. We ended up bringing in 70 people out of 10,000 applicants the first year, and the second year we brought in over 350 individuals from those 25,000 applications,” Bumgarner said. In its third year, Tulsa Remote now has a lower acceptance rate than any college in the country, with less than 2% of applicants getting accepted. “We have people from bankers to software engineers to opera singers from Japan,” Bumgarner said. Although there have been restrictions due to the COVID1-19 pandemic, Ukabam and Reyes are finding new and individual ways of getting involved and expanding Tulsa’s horizons. In return, they’re taking advantage of all that’s at their fingertips. “The things that you would think you would miss in other cities are here, that’s the misconception. We went to concerts, sports engagements, ballet, things we didn’t even get to do in California because of the cost of living,” Ukabam said. Both are now planting new roots in Oklahoma soil.

85,Supply crisis drives Walmart and rivals to hire their own ships,0.0,45.67,https://www.newsnationnow.com/business/supply-crisis-drives-walmart-and-rivals-to-hire-their-own-ships/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsnation-now-bias-reliability/,2021-10-07,www.newsnationnow.com,25,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) — The Flying Buttress once glided across the oceans carrying vital commodities like grain to all corners of the world. Now it bears a different treasure: Paw Patrol Movie Towers, Batmobile Transformers and Baby Alive Lulu Achoo dolls. The dry bulk cargo ship has been drafted into the service of retail giant Walmart, which is chartering its own vessels in an effort to beat the global supply chain disruptions that threaten to torpedo the retail industry’s make-or-break holiday season. “Chartering vessels is just one example of investments we’ve made to move products as quickly as possible,” said Joe Metzger, executive vice president of supply-chain operations at Walmart, which has hired a number of vessels this year. The aim is to bypass log-jammed ports and secure scarce ship space at a time when COVID-19, as well as U.S.-China trade ructions, equipment shortages and extreme weather, have exposed the fragility of the globe-spanning supply lines we use for everything from food and fashion to drinks and diapers. More than 60 container ships carrying clothing, furniture and electronics worth billions of dollars are stuck outside Los Angeles and Long Beach terminals, waiting to unload, according to the Marine Exchange of Southern California. Pre-pandemic, it was unusual for more than one ship to be in the waiting lane at the No. 1 U.S. port complex, which handles more than half of all American imports. Other big retail players, such as Target, Home Depot, Costco and Dollar Tree, have said they are chartering ships to deal with the pandemic-driven slowdown of sea networks that handle 90% of the world’s trade. Or, as Steve Ferreira of shipping consultancy Ocean Audit describes the escalating concern: “Containergeddon.” U.S. retailers’ traditional lifeline from Asia is freezing up due to a resurgence of COVID-19 in countries like Vietnam and Indonesia, plus a power-supply crunch in China. The supply snarls coincide with booming demand as consumers spend more on goods than going out, and the festive shopping frenzy nears. Burt Flickinger, managing director at retail consultancy Strategic Resource Group, said at least 20-25% of the goods stuck on ships were unlikely to make it onto shelves in time for the Nov. 26 Black Friday kickoff for the holiday shopping season, a period when retailers make more than a third of their profits. ROUTE FOR GREAT PROFIT The biggest chains are taking matters into their own hands. In a typical year, Walmart would have moved those toys from China to Los Angeles in hundreds of 40-foot cargo boxes stacked like colorful Lego bricks on gigantic container vessels that serve multiple customers. But 2021 is far from typical. Incoming cargo at the Port of Los Angeles is up 30% from last year’s record levels. Trucks and trains can’t remove it fast enough, leading to logjams, said the port’s Executive Director Gene Seroka, reflecting the surge in consumer demand. “It’s like taking 10 lanes of freeway traffic and squeezing them into five,” Seroka said. Chartered ships that offer valuable cargo space and can sidestep the container terminals play a critical role in this second pandemic holiday season, particularly for time-sensitive goods like Christmas sweaters that won’t sell if they arrive too late. The Flying Buttress, for example, entered Los Angeles waters on Aug. 21. It got stuck in a queue outside the port before it bypassed clogged terminals and unloaded its goods at a separately operated bulk cargo dock nearby on Aug. 31, according to Refinitiv data and shipping records. During that voyage, Walmart circumvented the shortage of 40-foot containers typically used for global shipping by switching to bigger 53-foot containers that are almost exclusively used to move goods by truck and train within the United States. Other companies are also playing the shipping game, including Home Depot, which said it was “creatively working to obtain additional capacity.” The home improvement retailer dodged the Los Angeles gridlock by sending its Great Profit charter ship nearly 125 miles south to the Port of San Diego. On Sept. 15, the ship’s onboard cranes hoisted 7-foot Halloween “Spellcasting witches,” Christmas lights and other holiday decor onto docks there, said Ocean Audit CEO Ferreira, who helps shipping customers claw back overpayments. “This is the home stretch. They’re doing whatever it takes” to win in an overheated market, he said of retailers. WHY PORT SIZE MATTERS Yet, there is a limit to such workarounds. Great Profit moored at a terminal that handles everything from sugar to windmill blades but can only accommodate a maximum of 500 containers from one to two ships per month between now and the end of the year, said Greg Borossay, the port’s maritime business development principal. That’s because San Diego, like many other U.S. seaports, doesn’t have the towering gantry cranes needed to pluck boxes from massive ships. Rail service is equipped for autos and other specialty cargo. And, roads in surrounding commercial and residential areas aren’t set up for the fleets of trucks needed to whisk thousands of containers to other parts of the country. “We’d have a very unhappy community if we had 3,000 (boxes) coming off a ship,” Borossay added. Not all retailers will hire ships to support sales, and other factors could be significant in picking out potential winners and losers. Clothing and accessory retailers have seen their inventories decline even as sales have accelerated, stoking worries about sell-outs, said Jason Miller, associate professor of logistics at Michigan State University’s business college. General merchandise retailers like Walmart and Target, on the other hand, have done a better job of keeping inventory on pace with sales, he added. PAYING $20,000 PER CONTAINER The global supply crunch is providing lucrative opportunities for bulk cargo ship operators, though; they are cashing in on a record spike in container shipping rates that has sent freight costs above $20,000 per box on the biggest liner vessels. Global container shipping players like AP Moller Maersk and Hapag Lloyd are flush with cash from the soaring rates. Major lines are “putting in every ship we can find,” Hapag Lloyd CEO Rolf Habben Jansen said. Several shipping sources said other firms were snapping up second-hand container vessels of all sizes. Hong Kong-based Taylor Maritime, which according to shipping databases, manages the Flying Buttress, did not respond to a request for comment. Dry bulk transporters have a short window of time to prepare decks to safely secure and carry cargo boxes. They typically transport commodities in below-deck cargo holds. Genco Shipping & Trading is seeking approval from its ship safety certifier to prepare some of its own dry bulk vessels to carry containers. Genco isn’t going all-in on container shipping, said CEO John Wobensmith, who called the project “opportunistic.” Separately, agribusiness giant Cargill said it is looking into using some of the dry bulk ships it charters to hold containers instead, if only as a temporary solution, to “alleviate bottlenecks.” Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles, Jonathan Saul in London and Siddharth Cavale in Bengaluru; Additional reporting by PJ Huffstutter in Chicago; Editing by Pravin Char © Copyright Thomson Reuters 2023."
86,Zodiac Killer: Police refute investigators’ claims they found the serial murderer,0.0,41.67,https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/zodiac-killer-police-refute-investigators-claims-they-found-the-serial-murderer/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsnation-now-bias-reliability/,2021-10-06,www.newsnationnow.com,25,"SAN FRANCISCO (NEXSTAR) – A team of investigators calling themselves The Case Breakers say they know the identity of the Zodiac Killer, but law enforcement is refuting their claim. The serial murderer killed five people in Northern California in 1968 and 1969, taunting investigators with with a series of cryptic notes. The Case Breakers, a group of 40-plus members led by retired FBI agents, have varied backgrounds in law enforcement, according to their site, and work to solve some of the country’s most notorious cold cases. The Case Breakers have previously attempted to tackle the D.B. Cooper case and the death of Jimmy Hoffa, according to FOX. The self-described task force identified an Air Force veteran who lived near Northern California’s Sierra Nevada as the Zodiac Killer in a story first reported by FOX News on Wednesday. The man they named died in 2018. (Nexstar is opting not to name the man in The Code Breakers’ report in light of refutation from law enforcement). The group said it also believes the Air Force veteran is responsible for killing a sixth victim, 18-year-old Cheri Jo Bates on Oct. 31, 1966 in Riverside, California and stated that detectives recovered “hairs, skin and blood” from under her fingernails. The group is calling on the department to test the alleged evidence – which they say is stored in the Northern California city of Vallejo – against that of the person it identified in the case. Riverside Police Officer Ryan Railsback told Nexstar that his department is unaware of any such physical evidence and questioned where the cold case team was getting its information. Railsback said that Riverside investigators have worked closely with the labs and law enforcement teams to investigate any possible link. “If the Cheri Jo Bates case was actually related to the Zodiac Killer, we wouldn’t be holding that back, especially 55 years later,” Railsback said. “Unequivocally, we are saying that the Cheri Jo Bates case and the Zodiac Killer case are not related.” Railsback said that the Riverside Police Department’s Cold Case Unit did receive a handwritten letter in 1967 that initially led investigators to believe the Zodiac Killer might have been behind her murder. The department received a second letter, this time typed, apologizing for the letter and saying it was written as a “sick joke.” In 2020, the Riverside Cold Case Unit and the FBI Los Angeles Investigative Genealogy Team used DNA evidence from the stamp on the 2016 letter to track down the author and confirm that he wrote both letters. The letter writer, who was a teenager in 1967, wasn’t involved in the murder of Bates, investigators determined. There is a standing $50,000 reward for information leading to Cheri Jo Bates’ killer set to expire Jan. 31, 2022, according to Riverside police, who said that a lawyer working with the The Case Breakers had inquired about in September. The Riverside Police Dept. is asking anyone with tips on the Zodiac Killer to contact the FBI instead. A Vallejo police spokesperson said the department could neither confirm nor deny Wednesday’s report from The Case Breakers, and added that they would announce any major developments. San Francisco police and the FBI also cast doubt on the Case Breakers’ announcement to the San Francisco Chronicle. “The Zodiac killer case remains open. We have no new information to share at the moment,” the FBI told the newspaper Wednesday. Several conflicting theories have emerged in the decade since the Zodiac crimes. The San Francisco Chronicle – which received coded ciphers at the time of the killings – says it has received piles of letters “naming hundreds of suspects” over the years. According to the Fox News report, the team of cold case specialists say new forensic evidence, decoded notes and photos from the suspect’s own darkroom led them to the identity of the Zodiac Killer. In one case, The Case Breakers removed the letters of the Air Force veteran’s full name and discovered a message in the remaining text. “So you’ve got to know [the suspect’s] full name in order to decipher these anagrams,” said Jen Bucholtz, a former Army counterintelligence agent. “I just don’t think there’s any other way anybody would have figured it out.” In December 2020, a cryptographer and two software engineers cracked a cipher sent to the San Francisco Chronicle more than 50 years ago, the FBI confirmed. The Zodiac would write notes, often threatening to kill, in a cryptogram composed of a bizarre series of letters and symbols. The killer signed the letters with a circle divided by a cross. Subsequent letters began, ″This is the Zodiac speaking.″ His last authenticated letter to the San Francisco Chronicle arrived Jan. 30, 1974. Police say at least five people are believed to have been murdered by the Zodiac, although the killer claimed at least 37 victims since 1966 in his letters. The killing spree has since been the subject of numerous theories, podcasts and even major motion pictures. NewsNation Prime spoke with Bill Proctor, who is part of The Case Breakers, Wednesday.

87,When can my kid get vaccinated? Here’s what we know,-1.0,47.33,https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/when-can-my-kid-get-vaccinated-heres-what-we-know/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsnation-now-bias-reliability/,2021-10-07,www.newsnationnow.com,25,"(NEXSTAR) — School-aged children could be fully vaccinated before the start of 2022 if Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech get approval to administer the shots to children as young as 5 years old under emergency use authorization. Pfizer officially asked the Food and Drug Administration for clearance after testing a lower dose vaccine – about a third of the standard dose given to adults – on elementary school children, according to the Associated Press. After their second dose, children ages 5 to 11 developed coronavirus-fighting antibody levels just as strong as teenagers and young adults, Dr. Bill Gruber, a Pfizer senior vice president, told the AP. So what happens now? While there is no set timeline for the emergency use authorization approval, we do know that the initial EUA for adults was submitted in November 2020 and approved for Americans 16 and older on Dec. 11. Additional studies allowed the companies to request a drop in the age threshold to 12 in early April of this year. That approval was granted a month later. The FDA’s advisers are scheduled to debate the evidence on Oct. 26, the AP reports. A decision could follow within days. “For an EUA to be issued for a vaccine, for which there is adequate manufacturing information to ensure quality and consistency, FDA must determine that the known and potential benefits outweigh the known and potential risks of the vaccine,” the FDA said of the emergency use vetting process. The FDA has provided an overview of the emergency use authorization process on its website. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is the lone vaccine to move past the EUA and earn full approval from the FDA. The two-shot Moderna and single-shot Johnson & Johnson vaccines remain under emergency use authorization for older age groups. Moderna is also studying its shots in elementary school-aged children. It remains to be seen how quickly parents will rush to get their children vaccinated once the lower dose injections are approved. As of last week, 56% of eligible children between the ages of 12 and 17 had received at least one vaccine dose, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Rare instances of heart inflammation have been reported with mRNA vaccines, such as Pfizer’s, but the AP reports that the company’s lower dose study of 2,268 kindergartners and elementary school-aged kids isn’t large enough to detect such extremely rare side effects. As of Sept. 30, 5.9 million children had tested positive for coronavirus, according to the AAP. Nearly 850,000 children tested positive over the last four weeks of September."

(NewsNation Now) — The Laundrie family attorney Tuesday said Brian Laundrie’s parents now believe they last saw him Sept. 13, a day earlier than they’d previously told investigators. “The Laundries were basing the date Brian left on their recollection of certain events,” their lawyer, Steven Bertolino, told NewsNation. “Upon further communication with the FBI and confirmation of the Mustang being at the Laundrie residence on Wednesday Sept. 15, we now believe the day Brian left to hike in the preserve was Monday Sept. 13.“ Bertolino also explained why Brian Laundrie left his girlfriend Gabby Petito in the middle of a cross-country road trip, just weeks before her body was discovered at a camping area in the Bridger-Teton National Forest in Wyoming. “Brian flew home to Tampa from SLC on 08/17 and returned to SLC on 08/23 to rejoin Gabby,” Bertolino said in a series of texts to NewsNation. “To my knowledge Brian and Gabby paid for the flights as they were sharing expenses. Brian flew home to obtain some items and empty and close the storage unit to save money as they contemplated extending the road trip.” Bertolino’s texts came as Brian Laundrie’s sister, Cassie Laundrie, took questions from a small group of protesters outside her home Monday and clarified questions around the timing of her brother’s disappearance. She confirmed that Brian Laundrie flew home to Florida from the Western U.S. on Aug. 17, five days after he and Gabby Petito were pulled over and separated by police in Moab, Utah. The group asked whether Cassie Laundrie believed her brother killed Gabby Petito, and whether she thought he was still alive. Her answers to both questions were the same: “I don’t know.” Watch Cassie Laundrie’s interview here. The FBI has issued an arrest warrant for Brian Laundrie. He is wanted for “use of unauthorized access device” related to his activities following Petito’s death. The FBI says he used a debit card and a PIN to access two bank accounts Aug. 30 and Sept. 1. He is also the sole person of interest in Petito’s murder. Brian Laundrie’s parents now say they last saw him Sept. 13 as he headed for a hike at the Carlton Reserve in Florida, though they did not report him missing until a few days later. Investigators have focused an intensive search on the area. Petito vanished while on a cross-country road trip with Brian Laundrie in a converted camper van. The trip was well documented on social media until it abruptly ceased, allegedly somewhere in Wyoming. Petito, 22, was reported missing Sept. 11 by her parents after she did not respond to calls and texts for several days. Her body was discovered days later near Grand Teton National Park.

The video, shared exclusively with NewsNation, was taken by a man who claimed to know the Petito family. You can watch the full video in the player above. Cassie Laundrie confirmed that Brian flew home to Florida from the western U.S. at some point on or before Aug. 17, five days after he and Gabby Petito were pulled over and separated by police in Moab, Utah. The group asked whether Cassie Laundrie believed her brother killed Gabby Petito, and whether she thought he was still alive. Her answers to both questions were the same: “I don’t know.” She told the group she did not know anything was wrong until police began questioning her family Sept. 11. She said she saw Brian Laundrie on Sept. 1 when he and their parents arrived in the family Mustang, not the van he and Petito had been traveling the country in. She also saw him at a family vacation Sept. 6, but said she had no reason to suspect any problems. Cassie Laundrie talked with the group for nearly 20 minutes, and admitted doing so likely wouldn’t please their attorney, but she said the protesters’ persistence was upsetting her children and neighbors. “This is not what we want to be doing,” Cassie Laundrie said. “This is not how we want the world to find out when we’re angry and upset. But I can’t have my kids be crying for three days in a row.” She also said news media misconstrued her answer to a question about the last time she saw Brian Laundrie. In an interview with ABC News on Sept. 16, she said “I haven’t been able to talk to him.” That was taken to mean she hadn’t heard from him since Petito disappeared. But she said Monday that answer was in response to a question along the lines of, “What has been the weirdest thing of all of this?” and not “Have you spoken to your brother since Petito vanished?” The family’s attorney, Steven Bertolino, said Friday that Cassie Laundrie was with the family at Fort De Soto on Sept. 6, which she confirmed to the group confronting her home. She said she has not been able to speak with her family during the investigation and was critical of Bertolino’s statement. You can watch Marni Hughes and Brian Entin break down the interview in the player below. “I’m in the boat where I’m getting ignored by my family and thrown under the bus by my family’s attorney,” she said. When asked for comment, Bertolino said, “I do not represent Cassie Laundrie. Cassie’s comments can only be attributed to the press twisting my words and hers, which were only given to clarify prior mischaracterizations by the press, with the hopes of further sensationalizing this tragic story.” A person in the group asked what she thought when she began to put the pieces together Sept. 11, but she said that’s something she was “not allowed to answer.” She said she was “just as baffled and blown away as everybody else” at her parents’ public silence thus far. She also told the group Brian Laundrie was never violent or “abusive” toward Petito or anyone else that she saw. During the exchange, Cassie Laundrie asked the group to stop harassing their neighborhood. “The thing about it is, we know Gabby’s family,” the man recording the video said. “We do, too,” Cassie Laundrie replied. “What do you want us to do? We cooperated with the police. We’re not supposed to talk to anybody and you’re making my children cry.” “We would like to give [Brian Laundrie’s] nephews an answer to when they can see their grandparents again,” said Cassie Laundrie’s husband, James Luycx. “When you know, [they can] see their uncle or anything that. He was their hero.” At the end of the video, the group vowed to leave and not come back."
90,Missing in America: Lauren Cho ‘walked away’ from her California Airbnb,0.0,40.33,https://www.newsnationnow.com/missing/lauren-cho-missing-in-america/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsnation-now-bias-reliability/,2021-10-06,www.newsnationnow.com,25,"(NewsNation Now) — It has been 100 days since Lauren Cho was reported missing from an Airbnb located down a dirt road in California’s Yucca Valley. Despite multiple searches and increased interest in her case, Cho’s disappearance remains a mystery. Those who know Cho well are desperate to know where she may be. “None of it makes sense to me. None of it makes sense to any of us,” said Len Gherardi, who went to high school with Cho in New Jersey and later worked with her at a shop, tattooing and piercing. “All of her friends and family know that she wouldn’t have just walked away from her life, she wouldn’t have just evaporated,” Gherardi said of the 30-year-old also known as “El”. “She wouldn’t have just disappeared like this.” Cho’s ex-boyfriend reported her missing on June 28th at around 5 p.m., telling authorities they had an argument three hours earlier and then she left the Airbnb where they were staying. Later, in a phone interview with the Hi-Desert Star, the ex-boyfriend said “there was a 10-minute window there and she evaporated.” According to Mara Rodriguez with the San Bernadino Sheriff’s Department, “she basically walked away with just the clothes she had on. No cell phone, no personal items, no money, no nothing.” Cho was wearing jean shorts and a yellow t-shirt. She was reportedly last seen at the remote intersection of Hoopa Road & Benmar Trail in Yucca Valley, where the terrain and temperatures are unforgiving. On the day she went missing, it would have been about 110 degrees. “It’s very hot out in the summer months and even in the evening,” Rodriguez said. “So being out there with no water, nothing to make contact with anybody, that’s going to be an issue.” In an exclusive interview with NewsNation, the housekeeper at the Airbnb compound expressed doubt that there was any foul play on the property. “People show up from different countries. People show up, whoever they are, they just get along,” Traci Cloud, who has worked as a housekeeper at the compound for nearly five years, said. “Nothing violent? No, never. never, never.” Cloud believes she saw Cho the morning she went missing before leaving for work. “Evidently they had started drinking in the daytime, early in the day or whatever, and she had drank too much,” Cloud said. “When she wanted to leave [her then-boyfriend] wouldn’t let her take the vehicle and evidently, that’s when she got upset.” Cho and her ex-boyfriend were a couple when they traveled across the country earlier this year, targeting the area around Joshua Tree National Park, eager for a fresh start. Cho had expressed dreams of operating a food truck. Her early years were largely focused on singing and performing. While attending Westminster Choir College in New Jersey, she became close friends with Kaitlyn Borden. “One of our favorite things to do is find little gifts for people,” Borden said. “Silly small things that will make them smile.” Up until late June, the two friends stayed in touch, sharing memes every day and talking every week. Borden had heard all about the Airbnb where Cho was staying in California. “She had asked me to go visit her out on this Airbnb compound. And I said I’m a little bit scared about going to the desert in the middle of summer. I’m very pale,” Borden laughed. But the Airbnb compound is known for more than its exposure to the sun. According to the Airbnb listing, there is an “‘open” and “liberal” environment at this evolving collection of vintage trailers. The owner describes it as adults only and clothing is optional. The housekeeper describes the locals as “all musicians or artists, sculptors.” “They’re all very mellow, Cloud said. “They’re like a different breed of people. They really are.” Cho was known to be artistic and have eclectic tastes. “Her purse that she carries around is just like a rubber chicken. It’s like a rubber chicken purse,” her high school friend Gherardi said. “And that’s what she carried every day.” The sheriff’s office has its special investigations unit focusing on Cho’s case. There have been multiple air and ground searches over the past three months, including at the Airbnb compound. For now, there is no evidence of foul play. Authorities are appealing to people who were in the area around the time of Cho’s disappearance in late June. “You don’t know what you don’t know, Rodriguez said. “So if you have anything that you think might be helpful, we absolutely want to hear from you.” “Go ahead and do the right thing,” Gherardi pleaded to anyone who may have information leading to Cho’s whereabouts. “Come forward and maybe talk about what they noticed or saw. And let’s get the real narrative of what happened that day.” The Cho family is maintaining a public Facebook page, but they are not doing interviews.When NewsNation reached out to Cho’s ex-boyfriend, he responded immediately, “no comment”. NewsNation asked viewers to send us cases that we should be featuring on “Missing in America.” Our team is already sifting through hundreds of tips we have received."
91,Wiretaps of alleged ringleader in college admissions scandal played in court,0.0,40.67,https://www.newsnationnow.com/sports/wiretaps-of-alleged-ringleader-in-college-admissions-scandal-played-in-court/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsnation-now-bias-reliability/,2021-10-06,www.newsnationnow.com,25,"BOSTON (NewsNation Now) — Closing arguments in the first trial of the so-called “Operation Varsity Blues” case took place Wednesday in a Boston federal courtroom. It’s been more than two years since the FBI arrested 50 parents, athletic coaches and others in a scheme targeting elite universities across the country. One of the biggest parts of the prosecution’s case were the words of the alleged admissions consultant at the center of the scheme — William “Rick “Singer. His words were secretly recorded by the FBI and played in court Wednesday. “To be honest, it feels a little weird,” said Gordon Caplan, the former co-chairman of Willkie Farr & Gallagher, who admitted to paying a bribe to doctor up his daughter’s ACT score. Singer replied: “I know it does. I know it does. But when she gets the score and we have choices, you’re going to be saying, “OK — I’ll take all my kids.” One of the voices played came from one of Singer’s well-known clients, former Staples and Gap Inc. executive John Wilson, who now heads a Massachusetts private equity firm. Wilson is charged with paying $220,000 to have his son designated as a USC water polo recruit and an additional $1 million to buy his twin daughters’ ways into Harvard and Stanford. Wilson’s lawyers said he was tricked by Singer and he believed he was making legitimate donations. Prosecutors say the parents were well aware their payments were designed to get their kids into school as athletic recruits with fake or embellished credentials as part of Singer’s so-called, side-door scheme. So far, 33 parents have pleaded guilty in the college admissions scandal, including actors Felicity Huffman, who served 11 days in prison, and Lori Loughlin, who served two months. A new Netflix documentary called, “Operation Varsity Blues: The College Admissions Scandal,” is based on the same FBI recordings from Singer. Prosecutors say the tapes remove any doubt about what Singer was up to. In one recording, Singer said, “I can send him your $500,000.00 that you wired to my account to secure a spot for one of your girls.” Wilson laughed, then added, “So, Stanford actually got to have some sailors, huh?” Singer replied, “Yeah, so that Stanford doesn’t catch on to what he’s doing.” At least 47 people have either pleaded guilty in the college admissions scandal or agreed to do so. An additional six trials are scheduled for later this year and they are expected to continue into 2022."
92,"‘Why are you attacking me?’: Transgender girl, 8, asks Texas lawmakers to oppose sports ban bill",-3.0,45.67,https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/southwest/why-are-you-attacking-me-transgender-girl-8-asks-texas-lawmakers-to-oppose-sports-ban-bill/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsnation-now-bias-reliability/,2021-10-08,www.newsnationnow.com,25,"AUSTIN, Texas (KXAN) — After a marathon hearing Wednesday that lasted more than 10 hours, a Texas House committee advanced legislation that could bar transgender athletes from competing in sports using the gender they identify with. During the hearing, a transgender child pleaded with Texas House lawmakers to halt the bill that would prevent her from playing in sports with girls. Gov. Greg Abbott added the legislation to the special session agenda again after it failed to pass three times this year. Sunny Bryant traveled with her mother, Rebekah, from Houston to join dozens of others testifying at the House Select Committee on Constitutional Rights and Remedies. “Why are you attacking me?” the 8-year-old said into the microphone lowered to match her height. “I’m really great.” Bryant said she previously testified against the legislation, and this time she told the committee members that her family may move to another state with more accepting policies toward transgender people. “My first visit to the Capitol should have been on a school field trip, not defending my right to exist,” she said. “But if I don’t show up, you won’t see the real stories. Kids like me whose futures will be crushed, opportunities taken away even before I’m given a chance to try.” She suggested that the lawmakers pursuing this legislation should get to know more people like her. “I think maybe you need more trans people in your life. Every time I meet trans kids and grownups, my heart grows,” Bryant said. “Don’t be a Grinch. Let your heart grow.” Before Bryant’s testimony began, the hearing started with a presentation from Texas Rep. Valoree Swanson (R). She explained the contents of the legislation and argued it’s about fairness because she said transgender student-athletes put girls at a disadvantage in competitions. She was asked for, but could not provide during the hearing, definitive examples in Texas where a trans person either took someone’s spot in a sport or caused them to lose an athletic scholarship. She told questioners she would get back to them. Without this bill, Swanson said Title IX, which guarantees equal educational opportunity in federally-funded programs, is “in danger.” She also equated the legislation to preventing another energy crisis like the one that gripped the state in February when millions lost power for days during Winter Storm Uri. “Our constituents expect us to see problems that are coming and not wait until there’s a disaster until everything falls apart, and then try to fix it,” Swanson said. “I think we can all think about what happened last February, when we did not properly anticipate what could happen to the electric grid, and I think our constituents are not happy that we didn’t anticipate that. So it’s not leadership to wait until everything is falling apart.” Texas Rep. Joe Moody (D) told Swanson that he believed the bill would raise the risk of trans youth harming themselves. The Trevor Project, a suicide prevention organization working with LGBTQ youth, released a report last month that revealed it received more than 3,900 crisis contacts this year from young people who identify as transgender and nonbinary in Texas. The report stated that many of them said they felt stressed and considered suicide due to legislation being debated in the state. Bryant’s mother, Rebekah, spoke after her daughter, saying the 8-year-old began suffering anxiety because of the ongoing debates about this particular legislation. “None of the people for this bill know a trans person, much less a child who will be cut off from the joy of playing sports and living a full life,” Rebekah said. “My child did not choose to be who she is. She just is.” After hearing from hundreds of witnesses Wednesday, the House select committee ended up voting 8-4 along party lines to advance HB 25 onto a vote in the full House. Speaker Dade Phelan previously told The Texas Tribune that he believes there are enough votes right now for it to pass. The Texas Senate already approved the bill during this latest special session. Equality Texas, one of the state’s LGBTQ advocacy groups, slammed the lawmakers for passing HB 25 out of committee. Ricardo Martinez, the organization’s CEO, said in a statement Thursday, “Transgender children participating in sports is not a national emergency or a Texas emergency; these attacks on trans kids and the ongoing trauma to the trans community certainly are. This is unconscionable. We will continue to show up to the Capitol in opposition of these bills and will do everything we can to ensure they are defeated once and for all.” There is no date set yet for when the House will vote on this legislation."

(WAVY) — For a group of neighbors in a Virginia Beach neighborhood, silence is golden. According to police, a frustrating situation among neighbors in a cul-de-sac in the Salem Lakes neighborhood of Virginia Beach has “voluntarily ceased.” For more than a year, a neighbor’s loud music and other offensive sounds coming over the speakers tormented several residents. NewsNation affiliate WAVY went to the neighborhood to investigate. In the past, Jannique Martinez said music would play loudly over her neighbor’s speakers, shaking her home. After alerting police about the music, Martinez said her neighbor retaliated by playing racial slurs and monkey noises. However, since WAVY’s story originally aired — and went viral — police say the loud music and offensive sounds have ceased. Police released a statement on Twitter Thursday detailing the results of their response. When WAVY inquired about the situation on Jessamine Court last month, police said they were limited in what they could do. While the sounds were annoying and offensive, police said the issue didn’t rise to the level that warranted criminal charges. In Thursday’s update, Police Chief Paul Neudigate said the neighbor’s “horribly offensive behavior” had “voluntarily ceased” as of Sept. 23. Neudigate, in a release from the department, said he was able to speak directly with the complainant and assured her that she should call police again if the behavior reoccurs. The police department said a thorough investigation was conducted by the Virginia Beach Police Department, and the city attorney, magistrate, and commonwealth’s attorney, and all entities agreed the neighbor’s behavior didn’t rise to the criminal level. “The VBPD will continue to monitor the situation and if this conduct arises in the future, it will again evaluate the facts and evidence and take whatever steps possible to bring it to an end. Additionally, the VBPD has continued to explore other avenues of redress, including contacting the Federal Bureau of Investigation to see if there was anything actionable from a Federal standpoint,” the department wrote in the release. Separately, the civil division of the Virginia attorney general’s office is investigating the matter. After our original reporting on Friday, an investigator with Housing Opportunities Made Equal of Virginia reached out to WAVY looking to make contact with the Martinez family. They are actively looking into the situation to see what can be done for them. According to their site, a division of their team works to protect minorities from harassment in their neighborhoods. They say harassment can include interference, coercion, threats or intimidation. Police also released a timeline of the various calls to the neighborhood for the issue. Read the details here."
95,City in Michigan urged to use bottled water due to lead risk,0.0,47.33,https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/city-in-michigan-urged-to-use-bottled-water-due-to-lead-risk/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsnation-now-bias-reliability/,2021-10-08,www.newsnationnow.com,25,"(NewsNation Now) — Michigan on Wednesday urged residents of Benton Harbor to use only bottled water for cooking and drinking, a major shift in response to the city’s elevated levels of lead. The state recently said it would distribute free water and filters in the southwestern Michigan city. But federal regulators now are reviewing how effective the filters are in removing lead from water at certain levels, according to the health department. The state said more than 15,000 cases of water will be delivered in coming days to the predominantly Black and mostly low-income community. “We think they probably are effective,” health department director Elizabeth Hertel said of the filters. “Right now, don’t use the water for cooking or drinking, even the filtered water, until we can guarantee the efficacy of those filters,” Hertel told The Associated Press. She didn’t know how long it would take. Filters so far have been given to more than 2,600 homes, the department said. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it’s evaluating how filters perform specifically on Benton Harbor’s water chemistry. “Certified filters that are properly installed and maintained are very effective in reducing lead concentrations in drinking water,” the EPA said, citing studies. A local activist, the Rev. Edward Pinkney, said he has boxes of filters at his church. He’s pleased with the state’s emphasis on bottled water but said residents need to hear a stronger message. “The water is unsafe to use. Period. Any use. That will get more attention around here,” Pinkney said. Benton Harbor, population 9,600, is in Berrien County, 100 miles from Chicago. Pinkney and environmental groups have accused Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s administration and local officials of failing to adequately respond since lead contamination was discovered three years ago. Whitmer has called for spending $20 million in Benton Harbor to replace nearly 6,000 service lines, most suspected of containing lead, within five years. Lead is considered harmful at any level, and children are particularly vulnerable because it can slow growth and result in learning and behavior problems. Two hundred miles away in Flint, lead contamination occurred in 2014-15 because water pulled from a river wasn’t properly treated to reduce corrosion in old pipes. The river was tapped as a cost-saving move by managers appointed by then-Gov. Rick Snyder. Benton Harbor, like many communities in Western Michigan, gets its water from Lake Michigan. The problem apparently is the condition of the water after it is treated and moves through an aging distribution system into homes. While recommending that residents use bottled water, the state still urged them to run their faucets or bathtubs daily to keep tap water moving."

In discussion, officials are considering a color guard, military band and 21-gun salute for the event. Trump had already announced that he would not be attending Biden’s inauguration — breaking tradition — after spending months making unfounded allegations of widespread election fraud. In a video address Thursday Trump said his focus was on “a smooth, orderly and seamless transition of power.” He also unequivocally condemned the violence seen last week at the U.S. Capitol in a video message Wednesday asking everyone who has supported his agenda to look for ways to ease tensions. Vice President Mike Pence is expected to attend the inauguration. Trump is expected to remain in Florida with a small group of aides."

Here are the top headlines you should know for Thursday, Oct. 7. Robert DuBoise, a former death row inmate who was exonerated after 37 years, is now suing the City of Tampa, officers on the case and a forensic consultant for allegedly framing him for the rape and murder of Barbara Grams. DuBoise was 18 years old at the time and was convicted in 1985. According to the Florida Innocence Project, DuBoise was sentenced to death by Judge Harry Lee Coe III, despite a jury recommendation of a life sentence. In August 2020, an attorney with the Conviction Review Unit in the Office of the State Attorney for the 13th Judicial Circuit found rape kit samples that had not been used during DuBoise’s trial. They were submitted for DNA testing by the Innocence Project and showed that DuBoise’s DNA was not present. Instead, genetic evidence in the sample came from two other men. DuBoise was released from prison on Aug. 27, 2020. Leilani Lutali, a patient on the kidney transplant list, was moved to inactive status by the University of Colorado Hospital for not receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. Her living donor, Jaimee Fougner, is also unvaccinated and UCHealth said both need to be vaccinated for the transplant process to continue. Lutali expressed religious concerns with the vaccines, as well as concerns that the vaccine would not be effective after receiving immunosuppressant drugs post-surgery. “Both from a religious standpoint, and from doing some reading, I’m not certain that this is the right way to go,” she said. “The shot’s relatively new, and as a consumer, I’m not an early adopter, I wait and see what’s going on. I feel like I’m being coerced into not being able to wait and see, and that I have to take the shot if I want this life-saving transplant.” The University of Colorado Hospital told Lutali she has 30 days to begin the vaccination series. If she decides to refuse COVID-19 vaccination she will be removed from the kidney transplant list. In that case, she will continue to accrue waiting time, but will not receive a kidney offer while listed as inactive. A teacher in Lancaster County was hit in the back of her head by an elementary school student as part of a viral TikTok challenge, Lancaster School District officials said. “This type of behavior is just like theft and destruction of property that is not a prank. It’s criminal behavior,” said Lancaster County School District and Transportation Director Bryan Vaughn. Vaughn said students who physically assault a staff member will be held responsible “both legally and by board policy.” Assaulting a school staff member is an expellable offense. “We share this information with parents so you can educate your kids on the issue and monitor their social media habits,” said Vaughn. “We also hope parents will speak with their kids about the serious repercussions of making poor decisions and peer pressure.” Videos on the social media platform have shown similar or worse damage happening at schools around the country. TikTok said it was working to remove those videos."
98,Dr. Fauci says concert venues could see crowds return by this fall,1.0,45.33,https://www.newsnationnow.com/health/coronavirus/dr-fauci-says-concert-venues-could-see-crowds-return-by-this-fall/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsnation-now-bias-reliability/,2021-01-15,www.newsnationnow.com,25,"SACRAMENTO, Calif. (KTXL) — As the coronavirus vaccines rollout across the U.S., many people are wondering when venues will fill up with fans listening to live music again. Dr. Anthony Fauci’s estimate is based on 70-85% of the population getting vaccinated against COVID-19. Fauci thinks concert venues and theaters could reopen their doors by “the time we get to the fall of 2021.” It’s not music to the ears of anyone hoping to attend a spring or summer concert — though venue operators remain hopeful. “As long as cases keep going down, I’m going to keep being optimistic about it,” said Robert Alvis, the general manager of the Crest Theatre in California. Alvis said the concerts currently on the calendar are 2020 shows that have been rescheduled for this year. “Now some of those shows that have been postponed going on two or three times are now starting to just go, ‘We’re moving to 2022,’” Alvis said. In the meantime, Alvis said he is looking into scheduling movies on an off-site, outdoor screen, as well as other alternatives. “Hopefully, when we get to the red tier when we’re allowed to have people inside, we’re hoping to do some live stream concert stuff,” he explained. “Trying to be as creative as we can to build that bridge from here to there.” Also helping to bridge the gap is the recently-passed Save Our Stages Act, which provides which provides relief for independent concert venues amid the COVID-19 pandemic. “They had a bi-partisan understanding that these independent venues are the quickest that can go away and they’ll be the longest to come back,” Alvis said. “So, we’re very fortunate that it got passed in the last stimulus. And we’re hoping that when we apply for that grant, we’ll get some much-needed revenue.” Dr. Fauci also said ventilation is something many venues will need to consider before reopening their doors. “The kind of airflow that essentially blows up and out as opposed to on top of the people,” he said. That’s where Alivis says his venue has a built-in advantage. “We’re actually fortunate with how old our theater is. It was built when you were allowed to smoke indoors,” Alvis explained. “So, there’s a giant ventilation system in the attic used to suck all the smoke out of the building. So, we can turn that on and, essentially, suck all the air from inside the auditorium out through the roof, and you’re constantly then getting fresh air in from outside.”"
99,More states observing Indigenous Peoples' Day,-2.33,48.67,https://www.newsnationnow.com/us-news/more-states-observing-indigenous-peoples-day-along-with-or-replacing-columbus-day/,https://adfontesmedia.com/newsnation-now-bias-reliability/,2021-10-08,www.newsnationnow.com,25,"CHICAGO (NewsNation Now) — Columbus Day celebrations in the United States — meant to honor the legacy of the man credited with discovering the New World — are almost as old as the nation itself. However, since the 1990s, a growing number of states have begun replacing Columbus Day with Indigenous People’s Day — a holiday meant to honor the culture and history of Native Americans. Indigenous Peoples’ Day has grown in popularity, either replacing or being celebrated along with Columbus Day in towns, cities, states and schools across the nation, according to the History Channel. According to the History Channel, as of 2021, the holiday is observed or honored by states including Virginia, Maine, New Mexico, Vermont, Alaska, Hawaii, Oregon, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan and Minnesota. In addition, North Carolina, Wisconsin, and South Dakota celebrate Native Americans’ Day. Hawaii celebrates Discoverers’ Day, and Alabama celebrates American Indian Heritage Day. The earliest known Columbus Day celebration took place on Oct. 12, 1792, on the 300th anniversary of his landing. President Franklin D. Roosevelt made Columbus Day a federal holiday in 1937. However, Columbus Day has long been a controversial holiday. Activists have argued that holidays, statues and other memorials to Columbus “sanitize his actions — which include the enslavement of Native Americans — while giving him credit for “discovering” a place where people already lived,” according to the History Channel. President Joe Biden on Friday issued the first-ever presidential proclamation of Indigenous Peoples’ Day, lending the most significant boost yet to efforts to refocus the federal holiday celebrating Christopher Columbus toward an appreciation of Native peoples. The day will be observed on Oct. 11, along with Columbus Day, which is established by Congress. “For generations, Federal policies systematically sought to assimilate and displace Native people and eradicate Native cultures,” Biden wrote in the Indigenous Peoples’ Day proclamation. “Today, we recognize Indigenous peoples’ resilience and strength as well as the immeasurable positive impact that they have made on every aspect of American society.” The Associated Press contributed to this report."
250,The Next Robert Mueller … or a Liberal Brett Kavanaugh?,-10.33,40.33,https://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/the-next-robert-mueller-or-a-liberal-brett-kavanaugh/93473,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2019-04-17,www.ozy.com,25,"Shakespeare couldn’t have written two better foils when Elizabeth Prelogar and Brett Kavanaugh squared off in a makeshift courtroom that December night in 2016. The former Miss Idaho was a prosecutor — an appellate attorney to the U.S. solicitor general — and a Democrat who had donated to the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. Kavanaugh, then a judge with the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, was a member of the conservative Federal Society who would later spark liberal outrage with his appointment to the Supreme Court by Donald Trump.  Despite their differences, fate had brought them to Washington’s Shakespeare Theatre Company for a mock trial of Friar Laurence for the “wrongful death” of Romeo and Juliet. And through the comedic evening, their similar wit emerged. When Prelogar introduced Taylor Swift’s “Love Story” into the record, Kavanaugh noted that the song replaced Shakespeare’s tragic ending with a happy one. “This court can’t rewrite history like that — we’re not the Ninth Circuit,” he said, a dig at the West Coast appellate court’s progressive bent. “They have tried to impugn [the friar’s] character. And to that I say: When they go low, he goes high. Really, really high. He’s with Him,” Prelogar said, pointing to the heavens with a political nod (to Michelle Obama) of her own. If all the world is a stage, then Prelogar is poised to become one of its major players. The 39-year-old fluent Russian speaker worked as a top prosecutor for special counsel Robert Mueller in his investigation into Moscow’s meddling in the 2016 election while on loan from the U.S. Solicitor General’s office, reportedly tasked with research and interviewing key witnesses. Before that, she clerked for Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Elena Kagan. Kavanaugh, too, clerked on the highest court (for Justice Anthony Kennedy) before serving on a special counsel investigation (for Ken Starr’s Bill Clinton probe). Which makes it worth wondering: Is Prelogar headed toward a future that looks more like Mueller’s or Kavanaugh’s? “There are several facets that are important to presidents when they nominate — and some of that dovetails with Elizabeth,” says Adam Feldman, a court scholar who runs the blog Empirical SCOTUS (neither Prelogar nor the solicitor general’s office responded to requests for comment). While any such forecast is fraught with hypotheticals, Prelogar seems poised for a possible judgeship or a long career as a prosecutor, particularly under a potential future Democratic president. She has already argued six Supreme Court cases since 2014, including the historic first argument of the 2016 term, which had an equal number of men (five justices) and women (three justices, two attorneys) considering a case bearing on the issue of double jeopardy in Bravo-Fernandez v. United States. The year prior, less than 20 percent of the lawyers appearing before the court had been women. Feldman is aware of only one other instance where women stood on equal footing with men in a Supreme Court case. That experience, plus her youth, is an advantage. “The legacy aspect is big,” Feldman notes: Presidents want to see their picks stay on the court for decades.  “She definitely has a stage presence that is not typical for a high-powered lawyer … she is personable, has a lot of wit,” says David Lat, the founder of the legal profession news site Above the Law, who has met Prelogar and followed her career. Her work at high-powered law firm Hogan Lovells could pay off during a confirmation, Lat says, when she can retort to Republicans: “How much of a leftist can I be?” Still, the donations to Obama and Clinton could hurt her if she ever faces a nomination process from a Republican Senate, or if she’s ever considered as a Mueller-style, nonpartisan figure to investigate a president. And before she gets on any Supreme short lists, she’d likely need to serve time as a judge to show the kind of reliable ideological bent presidents have come to count on for their high court nominees.  Regardless, there is time for Prelogar to don a judge’s robes — a far cry from the gowns she wore years ago as a head-turning beauty queen. She shone there, too, winning the “Triple Crown” of pageants: Miss Teen Idaho (1998), Miss Idaho USA (2001) and Miss Idaho (2004). As a slogan-bearer for the state, Prelogar honed her voice, showing a particular softness to the children she met. “As long as I brought the crown with me, it was easy to get them to listen,” she told Emory College, where she was an undergraduate, after becoming a Rhodes Scholarship national finalist in 2002. “Then afterward, they would all want to try it on — even the boys.”  Following a master’s in creative writing at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland, she was accepted to Harvard Law — but deferred to pursue a yearlong Fulbright Scholarship in St. Petersburg, where she won an Overseas Press Club Foundation award for an essay documenting censorship of the Russian press. Her interest stemmed from wanting to read the great Russian authors in their native language. “Now I can read poetry in the original, which is wonderful because in poetry especially so much is lost in translation,” she told Emory. An interesting twist to Prelogar’s story is her Forrest Gump–like cameos in the lives of those making news in national politics today. She was a contender in the 2001 Miss USA contest where Trump (who owned the competition as part of the Miss Universe umbrella) was later accused of purposefully walking in on half-dressed and naked contestants on multiple occasions. And before working for Ginsburg and Kagan, Prelogar clerked for Merrick Garland, the D.C. Circuit Court judge Republicans famously refused to consider for the Supreme Court in 2016.  Those instances, in addition to her comedic bout with Kavanaugh and others, matter more than mere kismet. They illuminate her status as a capital insider, Feldman says, which bodes well for her chances of being nominated to the D.C. Circuit one day — a feeder for the highest court: “If that’s an interest of hers, she knows the right people.” Soon her mock court sparring could become Washington reality.  Read more: What’s next for the special counsel?"
254,Chapter Two of Trump’s Presidency: The Next 100 Days,-12.75,36.25,https://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/chapter-two-of-trumps-presidency-the-next-100-days/77048,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2017-04-30,www.ozy.com,25,"Take a breath. It’s been a hectic first 100 days of Donald Trump’s presidency. We have a new Supreme Court justice, Obamacare is still standing (for now), the U.S. military struck Syria with Tomahawk cruise missiles, and Saturday Night Live has material for ages thanks to the tweeter in chief — and press secretary Sean Spicer. We’ll leave further recaps to others and take a look at Trump’s next 100 days, with the standard caveat that this president lives to be unpredictable. The biggest misconception about Kim Jong-un is that he’s insane. Waving around a nuclear arsenal like a child brandishing a new toy, allegedly ordering the assassination of a half brother with a nerve agent in another country’s airport, warehousing 100,000 political prisoners in forced-labor camps — these are not the actions of a well-adjusted world leader. But North Korea’s accelerating nuclear ambitions and provocations toward South Korea and the United States are perfectly rational as the authoritarian regime seeks to satisfy its elites, rally the masses and hold onto power. They’re also the most explosive test of Trump’s foreign policy over the next 100 days. But short of preemptively bombing missile sites — Trump has indicated he’s willing to do it, with the Syria strike and “mother of all bombs” drop in Afghanistan under his belt — there’s little direct impact the U.S. can have. China, then, is the key. China has long helped prop up the rogue nation for fear of the instability a collapse would bring, but there are signs that Beijing is growing tired of Kim’s antics. China announced this year it was cutting off coal imports from its neighbor. The next step could be to halt crude oil exports to North Korea. If China won’t move, Trump could impose second-order sanctions on Chinese companies that deal with North Korea— locking banks out of the critical U.S. financial system, for example. Previous administrations have avoided such a step for fear of angering Beijing. For its part, North Korea shows no signs of changing course as it tests missiles and threatens nuclear war. “When you normalize provocations, and then people will think, ‘Oh, yeah, the North Koreans, they are just doing what they do,’ that’s great for North Korea,” says Kent Boydston, a Korea expert at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Beware the crazy-uncle excuse. It was one of his first and most prominent pledges: a big, beautiful wall on America’s southern border, which would be paid for by Mexico because of the Donald’s negotiating acumen. Within days of taking office, Trump signed an executive order to start “immediate construction of a physical wall” along with other border security measures. But he needs Congress to follow through with the money, as Mexico’s president has made it clear he’s disinclined to write a check for the wall. Trump has responded with vague pledges about how Mexico might pay indirectly.  So how much will the great wall cost? The Trump administration requested $4.1 billion over two years, but that’s a fraction of what a physical barrier across the entire border would cost. Senate Democrats extrapolated from prototype proposals that a 1,827-mile wall would cost at least $64 billion — and $150 million more per year to maintain. An internal Department of Homeland Security analysis, Reuters reports, pegged the cost at $21.4 billion to shore up the 1,250 miles of the border that are not already fortified. Democrats are digging in, vowing to block any spending bill that includes wall money — and for more than fiscal reasons. “It stems from a value: Are you somebody who sees the humanity in our neighbors, or are you not?” asks Faiz Shakir, national political director of the American Civil Liberties Union, which is pushing Democrats to stand firm. The result was Trump backing off his demand to include wall funding in a government spending bill, postponing the fight. This is in part because even border-state Republicans who are hawkish on immigration say electronic surveillance in some places might be preferable to a barrier. And the government would have to seize some property under eminent domain to build a wall, a tactic not likely to sit well with landowners. The Houston Chronicle recently quoted House Homeland Security Committee chairman Michael McCaul, R-Texas, telling local college students: “I don’t think a 30-foot concrete wall is going to be the answer.” The topic was serious, the tone sober when Republican Sen. Richard Burr shared a news conference podium with Democrat Mark Warner to talk about Russian meddling in the 2016 election and their investigation of it. But Burr wore a slight smirk when setting a ground rule in his light North Carolina drawl: “We will not take questions on the House Intelligence Committee.” As the Russia investigation unfolds, it’s the chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence who will be charged with maintaining the professionalism and bipartisanship critical to making the probe credible. Rep. Devin Nunes, R-Calif., who soaked up the attention during the first 100 days, showed himself too chummy with Trump to assess impartially whether the president’s campaign collaborated with foreign interests, and he stepped aside from leading the probe. Thus, Burr has taken center stage in the casual manner he handles most everything else. Burr is known around the Capitol for his quirks — wearing loafers without socks, driving a 1974 open-air Volkswagen Thing — and for being tight with former house speaker John Boehner. Burr took over the chairmanship of the intelligence committee early in 2015. It’s a job that makes one privy to the nation’s darkest secrets and biggest fears, and it requires lots of time locked away with classified materials, unreachable to the outside world. Burr’s longtime political consultant Paul Shumaker tells OZY that Burr told him early on: “There would be times in his re-election that we would have to run a campaign without a candidate, because he was going to put that responsibility of the committee chairmanship first.”   Burr’s lack of interest in campaigning was often interpreted in D.C. circles as laziness, but he won an unexpectedly tight race last year and says his third term in the Senate will be his last. Though he typically votes the party line, Burr is now free of political shackles as he pursues the ties between Moscow and Trump Tower. Last year Burr was more steadfast than many GOP senators in supporting Trump, and Yahoo! News recently reported growing frustration among the committee’s Democrats that Burr is slow-walking the probe. If it appears to be tainted by politics, pressure will grow for a special prosecutor to come in. Ask Ken Starr and Bill Clinton how that works out. When trade bluster meets policy China Shipping Lines Cargo Ship Summer loading at the Port of Oakland Source  shutterstock In late April, Trump sat at the Resolute desk in the Oval Office surrounded by steel industry honchos to sign an executive order to “prioritize” an investigation into the effects of low-cost steel imports, implicitly targeting China, a familiar trade foe. Then Trump’s focus shifted to what appeared to be handwritten notes and an unusual target inspired by a visit to Wisconsin two days earlier: “In Canada, what they’ve done to our dairy farm workers is a disgrace.” The “NAFTA disaster,” as Trump termed it, has to do with our northern neighbor’s market protections for its dairy farmers. Then last week, he slapped a tariff on Canadian soft lumber imports. Along with cheap Mexican manufacturing, it’s part of his argument to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has been in force since 1994. Trade policy was one of the most consistent planks of Trump’s campaign. He immediately pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership upon taking office, but that treaty was never ratified. Trump last week said he was backing off plans to pull out of NAFTA altogether, and would start fresh negotiations with Ottawa and Mexico City. Opening up a long-standing deal will take more time and finesse, though commerce secretary Wilbur Ross recently said a revamped NAFTA might look a lot like what Mexico and Canada agreed to in the TPP — such as tougher labor and environmental standards. Though most of Trump’s moves so far have been rhetorical, with pledged reviews and investigations, the Canadian lumber action is the first sign of teeth, with more to come over the next 100 days. But in the wake of the summit with President Xi Jinping, Trump notably backed down from a campaign pledge to label China a currency manipulator, a move that would lead to tariffs and other punishments. The policy whiplash is often seen as the reflection of the internal struggle between senior counselor Steve Bannon’s economic nationalism and a more moderate approach from chief economic adviser Gary Cohn’s crowd, a debate not likely to go away anytime soon. From swing vote to porch swing?  Supreme Court Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy shakes hands with Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch as his wife Marie Louise Gorshuch and President Donald Trump look on during a ceremony in the Rose Garden at the White House April 10, 2017 in Washington, D.C. Source  Eric Thayer/Getty  Washington’s most scrutinized — and at times inscrutable — octogenarian has a choice to make in June. Anthony Kennedy will decide whether to hang up his robe as the Supreme Court’s swing justice. Though high court retirements are as tough to predict as their decisions, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the head of the Judiciary Committee that would consider a replacement, recently told constituents in Iowa that he expects a SCOTUS vacancy this summer. On an evenly split court, Kennedy has tilted conservative on some issues (gun rights, campaign finance) and liberal on others (gay rights, affirmative action). Most critically for the fight to come over his seat, Kennedy has repeatedly upheld a woman’s right to an abortion. Add an antiabortion justice, and the legally questionable 1973 ruling Roe v. Wade easily could tumble. The filibuster already has fallen for Supreme Court nominees in this year’s partisan battle over Neil Gorsuch, so the next justice will face a 50-vote threshold in the Senate. Still, the higher ideological stakes than the Gorsuch–for–Antonin Scalia swap means “the battle for Kennedy’s seat will be Armageddon and will likely take a long while in the Senate,” says Larry Sabato, head of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. If Armageddon arrives, keep an eye on whether Trump sticks to the list of conservative Federalist Society–approved judges he put out during the campaign, and the signals from GOP moderates Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. And remember Kennedy himself was Ronald Reagan’s third choice, after the defeat of the severely conservative Robert Bork and the withdrawal of Douglas Ginsburg who — gasp! — admitted to smoking marijuana a few times. If you take a walk, I’ll tax your feet President Donald Trump signs an executive order identifying and reducing tax regulatory burdens. Source   Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post via Getty For decades, blowing up the tax code has been the Washington equivalent of Tantalus’ apple from Greek mythology: always just out of reach. Everyone — except, perhaps, the nation’s accountants — agrees that the code is too complex, but every deduction has a lobby attached. Just before the end of his first 100 days in office, Trump announced an outline to slash tax rates for individuals and corporations. Now comes the hard part: steering it through Congress. Republicans propose that most families will be able to fill out their taxes on a postcard, with a juiced-up standard deduction or itemized deductions for mortgage interest and charitable giving but nothing else. Democrats have sent mixed signals about whether they’d be open to working with Republicans on the plan. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he wants Trump to release his own taxes first — an exceedingly unlikely proposition and a nod to Democrats’ protest-minded base. Republicans remain divided over the “border adjustment tax” on imports, designed to help American manufacturers and offset the deficit impact of the rate cuts. “There’s no pleasant way to raise $2 trillion,” says Grover Norquist, the president of Americans for Tax Reform and an OZY contributor. Norquist adds that his reply to any business complaining about a border tax when the corporate rate has been cut from 35 percent to 15 percent would be: “Shut up.” The border adjustment tax was not in last week’s White House outline, which on its own is likely to increase the deficit, meaning congressional rules would force the tax cuts to expire after 10 years rather than become permanent. As the debate unfolds, look out for competing analyses from the White House predicting huge growth and lower deficits and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. Another barometer to watch: the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It has jumped more than 10 percent since Election Day, in part on the promise of a regulation- and tax-slashing presidency. Trump has started to deliver on the former. The latter will be a slog. Those are the issues we can see coming. Because it’s Donald Trump, there’s always the chance for a wild-card moment, particularly as the country gorges on the latest dramatics in As the West Wing Turns. Perhaps Bannon will end up ambassador to Liechtenstein by the time we hit Day 200."
255,This Conservative Convert Dishes Out ‘Red Pills’ Online,15.5,35.0,https://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/this-conservative-convert-dishes-out-red-pills-online/85410,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2018-04-05,www.ozy.com,25,"It was the very first event of the Conservative Political Action Conference in February, and Candace Owens could hardly believe she was speaking. “I uploaded a video onto YouTube five months ago, and I am sitting on the CPAC stage today,” the 28-year-old said, a made-to-inspire nod to more than 1,000 acolytes gathered for her panel titled “An Affair to Remember: How the Far Left and the Mainstream Media Got in Bed Together.”  Two years ago, she was a liberal in Stamford, Connecticut, trying to start an online database to allow social media users to report online bullying — a nod to her own traumatic racial harassment as a high school track athlete and cheerleader. But Owens was criticized by progressives concerned the site, Social Autopsy, could be abused to “dox” innocent people. The backlash led in part to her political conversion. She watched as mainstream outlets shamed her, in her view. The only site that covered the story accurately was the “white, nationalist” Breitbart News, she said to Dave Rubin, a YouTube news personality. This was in April 2016, and Owens found confirmation in Trump, who was on the television near daily claiming the media was lying. “I realized my friends were my enemies, and my enemies were my friends,” Owens says.      We are living in such a special time. We are watching the slow, and painful, death of the mainstream media.     Candace Owens Owens says she spent a year to “rebuild as a person,” shell-shocked by the negative coverage of Social Autopsy. Now she is a brimstone-raining headliner for Republican rallies. Her first video, featuring her satirically “coming out” to her parents as a conservative, drew a quarter-million views after its posting last August. It has since spawned dozens more under her channel, Red Pill Black, a nod to The Matrix and her purported political awakening. Armed with undeniable charisma and a well-sculpted persona, her online popularity has led to appearances on Fox News and dozens of radio, TV and online appearances, carried on the back of videos like “How to Escape the Democrat Plantation” and, her most popular one thus far, “WTF? Black Lives Matter Has a List of Demands for White People!” The director of urban engagement for Turning Point USA, a nonprofit engaging young conservatives, Owens appears poised to break through from internet famous to actual famous. In the whirlwind of CPAC, she took selfies with Chris Loesch (husband and manager of media personality/NRA spokeswoman Dana Loesch), rubbed elbows with Sebastian Gorka (bombastic fired Trump White House aide turned Fox News pundit) and then sprinted off to a meeting at the Trump hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. The latter trumped an interview with OZY, as it turned out, though she texted us her apologies: “This day has been impossible.”  It’s not difficult to see why Owens is in such demand. Outspoken Black conservatives often soar to stardom quickly as Republicans seek to elevate their comparatively few minority voices. Their moments can be fleeting, but the former Vogue employee and University of Rhode Island journalism grad has the chops to stick around. Her direct-to-camera appeals are filled with fury, but also an acerbic wit reminiscent of Tomi Lahren’s star-making “final thoughts” segments on TheBlaze — except more clever.  In that sense, Owens is more Omarosa Manigault-Newman, the skilled if confounding agitator who turned her Apprentice appearances into a White House gig, than Diamond and Silk, the YouTube personalities who opened Trump campaign rallies with a shtick crossing into the absurd. Owens praises Trump’s tax cuts and his cultural stances, but rarely advocates specific policies (she has said she supports gay marriage but hasn’t arrived at a position yet on abortion). Her online persona’s most consistent belief is outrage. “Black people are not a monolith,” she says in another broadside aimed at “the media.” “We all have different ideas, and I hope they keep pretending we don’t exist, because that’s the exact market I’m after.”  But her authenticity has come under question. Other vloggers note that Owens once wrote the tea party was “bat-shit crazy” in a post for Degree180, a news site she helped found after leaving a private equity firm in 2015. Her overnight ascent has frustrated other African-American Republicans, inspiring intense, and perhaps envious, reactions. Wayne Dupree, a conservative blogger and award-winning podcast host, interviewed Owens. But when asked by email to comment on her, he wondered why this story wasn’t about him. Eugene Craig, a former vice chairman of the Maryland GOP, said he considers Owens “an opportunistic person who, for the development of her own celebrity, uses and attacks Black culture while claiming to do minority engagement.” He criticizes her for posting videos mocking Colin Kaepernick, the protesting quarterback. “So original,” Craig gripes. “She’s a Tomi Lahren in blackface.” Of course, Lahren, now a Fox News contributor, has achieved incredible success to ease her notoriety for racially charged statements. And Owens could too, helped by a shift from traditional media — which the Edelman Trust Barometer recently reported has become “the least trusted institution” globally — that has buoyed the careers of everyone from Lahren to Ben Shapiro, the Daily Wire editor in chief and popular podcaster. As conservatives have gone from railing against the mainstream media to abandoning it altogether, they’ll tune in to new platforms and new people like Owens. “We are living in such a special time. We are watching the slow, and painful, death of the mainstream media,” she said at CPAC, joining a co-panelist to “wave goodbye” to the media gathered in the back. “It was fun standing up there and pointing to them, saying, ‘You’re fake news! You’re fake news! You’re fake news!’” Owens said in her subsequent radio interview with Dupree, reveling in the spectacle. “I felt like Donald Trump there for a second.”"
258,Why China Will Decide the New Black,-0.67,46.67,https://www.ozy.com/fast-forward/why-china-will-decide-the-new-black/93550,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2019-04-17,www.ozy.com,25,"Gildo Zegna, CEO of luxury Italian brand Ermenegildo Zegna, recently declared that his firm was moving its test market to China. While Chinese consumers were already a key demographic for the famed menswear brand, early responses from Chinese customers will now dictate what new product lines Zegna launches around the world. This shift east, which is shaking up the global fashion industry, is driven by a combination of factors: the evolution of China’s own market, manufacturing strategies, technologies and spending power. With Louis Vuitton, Gucci and Burberry shopping bags in tow, top fashion brands are now turning to China as a litmus test for their global plans. The country’s emergence as a major consumer market for luxury fashion brands makes it a strong choice. But China also offers a younger population than the West — and has more disposable income than in other young developing nations — and is armed with tech innovations that in some cases are ahead of the developed world. That makes the country ideal for these brands to test how to sell themselves to a younger, tech-obsessed and highly demanding audience globally. Gucci and Calvin Klein have both launched tailored ad campaigns on Chinese platforms over the past six months, before later adapting them for an international audience. In 2018, Nicolas Versloot, the regional managing director for Levi Strauss, made it clear China would be at the forefront of the denim brand’s innovation going forward.     WeChat’s built-in functions allow an integrated one-stop purchasing experience, and this is very helpful to luxury brands.     Rachel Lou, social media analyst The seamless integration of e-commerce functionalities into social media platforms, exemplified by China’s giant multipurpose app WeChat, doesn’t yet exist outside China, but is the direction in which global social media and e-commerce sites are moving, experts say. So using China as a test market means these fashion brands are ready for the shift. In June 2018, luxury Italian accessories label Tod’s tested the sale of a restricted number of limited edition bags through a mini-program within the WeChat app. It sold bags worth 3.2 million yuan ($480,000) in six minutes. Burberry is now focusing its marketing strategy around optimizing integrated platforms like WeChat. “With shortened attention spans, Chinese consumers would want to speed up their luxury purchasing journey,” says Rachel Lou, social media analyst at marketing firm Dragon Social. “WeChat’s built-in functions allow an integrated one-stop purchasing experience, and this is very helpful to luxury brands as the growth in physical stores is stagnating.” Fashion has often served as an early pointer to broader social and economic shifts. From Gandhi in India to a series of African leaders, anti-colonial icons used local textiles to propel a larger revival of their countries’ domestic manufacturing sector. The fashion industry was an early adopter of the rental model — companies like Rent the Runway in New York and a slew of Swedish firms in Stockholm led the charge — that has now expanded even to toy sharing. It embraced technologies such as 3D printing, virtual reality and augmented reality — in part for marketing campaigns to target millennials — before most other retail sectors. This reputation as an industry that’s both a weather vane and ahead of the curve suggests that luxury fashion brands might be only the first to shift test markets to China and that others might follow. After all, many of the advantages China offers to luxury brands would also help other international industries. One such benefit to testing marketing and sales strategies and technologies in China is the mountain of user data available, particularly through WeChat, used by more than 1 billion people daily. That means both huge potential exposure and feedback for brands, says Thomas Klein, chief operating officer of Beijing-based digital branding firm Creative Union. Brands can learn about the effectiveness of strategies and campaigns from an enormous audience almost in real time. That’s why digital marketing is increasingly where global fashion firms are investing in China. According to consulting firm Zenith Media, foreign luxury brands are expected to focus 68 percent of their advertising budgets in China on e-commerce channels in 2019, up from 53 percent in 2017. Most brands spend between 30 and 60 percent of that expenditure on WeChat. The maturing of Chinese consumers is also making them more typical of the international market — while still carrying the aspirational traits that make them representative of developing markets. “Chinese luxury consumers are not only cashed up, but they are also savvy and adventurous,” says William Chen, managing director at Luxion Media, a social media consulting agency. “They are always on the hunt for new brands with a story, with something unique that sets it apart.” Of course, it isn’t as easy as simply transplanting successful strategies from China to other markets. The country’s unique digital environment and consumer market provide great opportunities for brands to stay ahead of the curve by testing there. But until some of those tech-based sales tools also become common in the West, strategies shaped in China will still need tweaks to suit advertising and sales platforms in North America and Europe. That’s worth the wait for luxury brands that see the integration of advertising, personalization and e-commerce as the future, and so view China as the best test market for shaping their digital strategies. There are benefits in the immediate too — with WeChat spreading rapidly across other Asian countries, some of the strategies tested in China could find quicker application in other emerging economies. China’s own appetite for luxury fashion remains insatiable — never mind a slowing economy and the trade conflict with the U.S. — so any market research in the country is useful for these brands. So much so that China’s fashion market is expected to eclipse America’s for the first time this year, according to global consulting group McKinsey. What works and fails there is what might well determine the fashion lines you see at high-end stores next season in Milan and Madrid."
259,Why the GOP Gold Mine in Bush’s Backyard Is a Bust,-16.5,30.75,https://www.ozy.com/politics-and-power/why-the-gop-gold-mine-in-bushs-backyard-is-a-bust/92256,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2019-04-18,www.ozy.com,25,"Margaret Van Vliet had long known who Donald Trump was. She had seen him at a few well-to-do New York City parties, and often when she was visiting the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan for business. But it wasn’t until they crossed paths at a private Atlanta hangar that they spoke for the first time. Trump was going up a set of stairs: Van Vliet was going down them. As they passed each other, Van Vliet could feel Trump’s eyes scan her body. “Where do you think his eyes rested? Right on my crotch,” she says. The anger in Van Vliet’s voice is not what you would expect to hear on a quiet Saturday morning at Le Pain Quotidien in downtown Greenwich. But in this Connecticut town best known for its tony privilege, manners and restraint, Trump’s name inspires strong feelings of aversion even among lifelong Republicans like Van Vliet, who voted for every GOP presidential candidate from Ronald Reagan to Mitt Romney and whose grandfather was a GOP state senator. That sentiment is spreading across wealthy Fairfield County, commonly referred to as the Gold Coast of Connecticut. The concern isn’t just about a Trump-approved tax bill that disproportionately damaged wealthy homeowners in high-tax states like this, although for some, that was damning. No, the criticism is much more elemental. “His whole persona is just so insulting to me, and to the women in this area,” Van Vliet, 61, says. And that’s hurting the Republican Party in a former bastion. Indeed, the Gold Coast is where the Bush family had its roots, from Prescott to George Sr., and these ritzy towns spawned GOP Reps. Stewart McKinney and Chris Shays — before 2016, when they flipped from easy victories for Romney to landslide wins for Hillary Clinton. That leftward shift continued in the 2018 midterms, two years into Trump’s presidency. And while it likely won’t affect the Electoral College — no Republican has won Connecticut’s seven votes since George H.W. Bush in 1988, even when the Gold Coast voted red — it could affect the GOP’s purse strings in the 2020 presidential race and down ballot. That’s particularly so because the Nutmeg State has historically been a disproportionately lucrative gold mine for fundraisers: Despite being only the 29th-biggest state, Connecticut was the 19th-highest source of political donations last cycle. “The funds raised in Connecticut don’t stay in Connecticut,” says Gayle Alberda, a political scientist at Fairfield University. “They go to the swing states that are purple — and they need them to get across the finish line.” The numbers don’t lie: Conservative bankrollers have ceded serious ground since Trump became president. In the 2013–14 midterms, Connecticut donors gave $15 million to Democrats and $14 million to Republicans, essentially a draw. But in the 2017–18 midterms, Connecticut donors gave $24.5 million to Democrats and just $11.5 million to Republicans, according to Federal Election Commission data gathered by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics. In federal elections across the state, nearly four-fifths of all donations to candidates went to liberal contenders. The voting booth reflects a similar shift. Republican voter registration dropped in Hartford suburbs such as Simsbury and Glastonbury. Avon, one of those Gold Coast towns, saw Democratic registration increase by 100 while Republican registration fell from 4,145 after the 2016 election to 3,969. To add insult to injury, 22-year-old Democrat Will Haskell, a Georgetown graduate and recent intern to Sen. Chris Murphy, upset a two-decade incumbent to win the 26th state Senate district — held by Republicans since the 1970s. Trump has put a lot of Yankee Republicans in a “tricky situation, because you may still have traditional Republican values, but you don’t agree with the leader of the party,” Alberda says. That has alienated the Greenwich elite types while also helping the Republican Party see major growth in more rural parts of the state, such as eastern Connecticut, as well as in working-class regions like the Naugatuck Valley, reflective of the way Trump has recast conservatism nationwide. To be sure, Trump isn’t the only reason why the Gold Coast is changing its voting patterns. It’s a demographic effect too. The state is seeing a brain drain, with higher-earning residents leaving (oftentimes for lower-tax states), which leaves more small-donation voters who typically lean Democrat, says Alberda. An analysis by The Connecticut Mirror shortly after the midterms showed that cities and towns where Latinos made up more than 25 percent of the population saw significant increases in turnout. Connecticut is now 15 percent Hispanic, the 11th-largest share of any state and by far the most diverse in lily-white New England. Greenwich, in particular, has become a much more diverse city in recent decades, with non-White residents — who, on average, are much more likely to vote Democrat — growing from around 10 percent in the 2000 census to around 26 percent of the current population. Trump’s struggles with well-educated women make a Republican rebound even harder here. “I’m really morally opposed to him,” says Greenwich resident Kim Parent, a former Republican, who, along with her husband, can’t stomach backing Trump. “And I’m not that party-devoted that I would vote for it at any cost.” Will the party shift stick? Parent and Van Vliet say their vote is lost to this version of the Republican Party. It’s hard to forecast too far ahead though, and only time can tell if this is a lasting trend or a one-off. Either way, there’s still much at stake in Connecticut for the GOP. The state’s governor races and two of its five U.S. House seats are competitive for the right candidate. And across the country, every Republican candidate, from the president to dogcatcher, would love to mine the Gold Coast for donations once again."
260,Can Biden Win While Leaking Latinos?,-8.33,43.33,https://www.ozy.com/news-and-politics/can-biden-win-while-leaking-latinos/361227/,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2020-07-23,www.ozy.com,25,"By nearly every measure, Joe Biden seems like he is in a strong position to defeat President Donald Trump. The Democrat is ahead by nearly 9 percentage points on average in national polls, as Trump’s favorability ratings have cratered to some of the worst marks of his presidency amid the coronavirus crisis and economic woes. Aside from leading with Black voters, women and both city-dwellers and suburbanites, Biden has even eaten into Trump’s margins among older voters and white men, according to a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist Poll. Yet that same poll contains a kernel of concern for Biden, particularly compared to past Democratic candidates.  Subsequent polls have mirrored that soft support, including one conducted by Latino Decisions in six battleground states last month, showing Biden getting 60 percent of those voters, though Trump drew only 25 percent, with 11 percent undecided.  “We kind of have an unwritten rule of thumb as Democrats when it comes to the Latino electorate: You really need to win 65 percent,” says former Biden senior adviser Moe Vela, who now works as chief transparency officer of the technology company TransparentBusiness. The shift of suburban voters, particularly women, and people who voted for both Barack Obama and Trump, to Biden could be enough to make up for losing some Latino voters, Vela adds. However, it does make Biden’s margin for error thinner, particularly given that a Democratic nominee likely has to win the popular vote by more than a few percentage points to overcome GOP advantages with the Electoral College. The Biden campaign “needs, and has needed for several months, a tremendous amount of improvement,” Vela says.  The battle will be waged across the country, but particularly in Florida and Arizona, where more than 20 percent of eligible voters are Latino. As president, Trump has taken a hard line against the Cuban and Venezuelan regimes. And his campaign has in turn aggressively targeted Venezuelan and Cuban voters — many of whom fled those countries for Florida — with ad campaigns raising fears of socialism. It also has an interactive website dedicated to Trump-supporting Latinos. “As the daughter of a freedom fighter who fought against an oppressive, communist regime in Cuba, I have seen firsthand how socialism has destroyed prosperous nations like Venezuela,” said Mercedes Schlapp, one of Trump’s senior communications advisers, during an online Latinos for Trump event to celebrate the Fourth of July.   When the Biden campaign toured Pennsylvania and Iowa with a “Todos Con Biden” slogan last fall, they forgot to lock the URL down, leading to the Trump team taking over the site with a landing page that said “Oops, Joe forgot about Latinos.” And in July, the president ran ads defending Goya, a popular Hispanic foods brand, after its founder supported Trump and liberals threatened to boycott it.  The Biden team hasn’t responded meaningfully to the Goya controversy, but did make key hires back in May: former Clinton staffer Jason Rodriguez, as coalitions director, and former Kamala Harris backer Julie Chavez Rodriguez as a senior adviser on Latino outreach. Latinos overwhelmingly backed Bernie Sanders when the Democratic primary was still competitive, creating another challenge for Biden on the left.  “You have to remind them that … at the end of the day, we are actually with you,” Vela says. “That’s a different message than to an independent, or undecided, Latino.” The Latino Decisions poll showed that Latino voters with a high school education (or less) were slightly more likely to approve of Trump’s job performance than college-educated ones (though the vote share for Biden was consistent across all Latino education levels). If there is a trend of Hispanic voters becoming cozier with the GOP — despite Trump’s stark anti-immigrant rhetoric and policies, and having called Mexicans “rapists” when launching his first campaign five years ago — it may track with the larger shift of working-class voters switching from Democrats to Republicans over the last few decades.  That would be troubling for those “demographics are destiny” Democrats hoping that rising Latino populations across America will ensure liberal gains for decades to come. “People always forget that Latinos are not traditionally liberal. They are traditionally Democrats, and the reason is that sense of inclusion,” Vela says. He believes Biden will shore up his Latino support once the election nears, and he is more able to directly deliver a unifying message to contrast to Trump’s tactics. “I don’t think, at the end of the day, he will have weak Latino support,” Vela says."
262,What Colorado’s Huge Voter Engagement Can Teach the Nation,-4.0,40.33,https://www.ozy.com/the-new-and-the-next/who-cares-what-colorados-huge-voter-engagement-can-teach-the-nation/94260,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2019-07-29,www.ozy.com,25,"Drive-thru ballot boxes. Walmart election centers. Sheriffs dropping off ballots door-to-door. High schoolers serving as election judges. These are just a few of the things that have turned Colorado into one of the top voting centers in America. As part of our 2020 election coverage, OZY set out to pinpoint the most politically activated communities in the country to better understand what makes them tick. We discovered that Colorado was home to five of the top seven counties in the nation for voter turnout during the last presidential election, according to our exclusive voter participation analysis with Washington-based data and consulting firm 0ptimus.  Top counties by voter turnout (with estimated voting-age population) in 2016     Mineral, Colorado, 99% (660)      McMullen, Texas, 98% (510)     Harding, New Mexico, 97% (545)     Douglas, Colorado, 92% (203,340)     Elbert, Colorado, 92% (17,400)     Dolores, Colorado, 90% (1,390)     Broomfield, Colorado, 90% (41,770) Just 600 miles and a 12-hour drive encapsulate the heartland of American civic duty, from the northwestern suburbs of Denver to the eastern plains of Colorado and the Western Slope of the Rocky Mountains. Fascinatingly, their demographics and their politics vary as much as their vistas, ranging in size and geography. Four of the counties overwhelmingly voted for Donald Trump in the 2016 election, while Broomfield backed Hillary Clinton, who won statewide by 5 percentage points.  With such differences, what similarities allowed these five counties to be among the most engaged communities in the country? After spending a week crisscrossing the state and interviewing voters and election experts, OZY found some common motivations. An all-mail ballot system encouraged education on the issues. A referendum model put democracy directly in the hands of voters. A meddling-free election system and a postelection audit, led by a Republican secretary of state, fostered trust. colorado voters v1 Different states share some of these approaches with Colorado, but it is the only state where all these measures come together. According to the elections nonprofit Vote at Home, it is one of only three states (including Oregon and Washington) that have both same-day voter registration and an all-mail ballot. Of those, it had the greatest midterm turnout in 2018, the second-best in the nation at 63 percent trailing only Minnesota, which benefited from having a Senate race on the ballot.  Img 20190425 094239 There is also something special about these five counties, which turned out at a higher rate than the rest of the state in 2016 (when Colorado only had the country’s fourth-highest turnout at 72 percent). With uncommon creativity around getting people to the polls and inspiring issues on the ballot, these pockets of near-universal voting provide a valuable template for the nation embarking on a national election, where both parties will be doing all they can to bring people off the sidelines. The journey starts in Broomfield County, a half-hour northwest of the Denver airport. Colorado’s newest county, consolidated in 2001, is a land of outdoor malls and gleaming suburban houses. It’s tempting to credit its engagement to youthful exuberance: “The whole setup of the city and county is very citizen-focused,” says elections manager Todd Davidson. The library has an advisory board. So does the senior center. There is even an advisory board for the advisory boards.  Broomfield is a bedroom community to nearby Denver, Boulder and Fort Collins, which is typically not a recipe for civic involvement (some political experts believe voter turnout is lower for those who spend more time commuting and working in other jurisdictions). Among other things though, Broomfield voters are especially animated about oil and gas extraction in their county. In 2017, they passed Issue 301 by a 57 percent margin, amending the city’s charter to allow Broomfield to regulate oil and gas developments trying to work within its boundaries. The issue pitted the state of Colorado — which insists its decisions supersede local rule — against the suburban county. Some say the state is forcing oil on them against their wishes, while others see it as an economic boon from the state’s largest industry. “It’s a very active topic,” Davidson says, one that has led to ballot referendums in each of the last three elections. The lesson is simple: Give people the ability to vote on things that affect their lives, and they will. Perhaps no state does that better than Colorado. Elected officials can face recall elections if citizens sign a petition equal to a quarter of the total vote within two months. Colorado is one of only 14 states that put citizen referendums directly on the ballot, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. It allows voters to put any constitutional amendment, statute or veto referendum up for a vote if they can get enough signatures (as of now, 124,632). With seven citizen-led ballot initiatives in 2016, Colorado only trailed California, which had 16. And it is the only state where every proposed tax must be approved by voters, due to the Taxpayer Bill of Rights passed in 1992.  Everything from a minimum wage increase and right-to-die legislation to opening presidential primaries to independents was considered in 2016. “Even if you hated both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, if you smoked, there was a cigarette tax on the ballot,” says Wayne Williams, the secretary of state during the 2016 and 2018 elections. Williams, a Republican, adds that a full 5 percent of voters in the 2012 election filled out only two items on the ballot: their vote for president … and their vote on weed legalization.  Colorado can have as many as 50 local and statewide issues to vote on, which is why it’s helpful that citizens receive their ballots by mail 22 days before Election Day. With time to research, they can pay attention to what they want and scrap the rest. Yet while what’s on the ballot is important, there is another part of the equation that’s critical, say observers: faith in the system. “It matters,” Williams says. “If I don’t think my vote is going to be counted accurately, why would I be bothered to vote?” An hour south, clerk and recorder Merlin Klotz shows off why voters should have faith in their election system in Douglas County, the seventh-most populous county in Colorado and one of the wealthiest in America. The state allows same-day registration and an opt-in at the DMV, which allows it to compile a signature database. Voters sign their mail ballots and turn them in. A vote-counting machine cross-checks it without opening the envelope, and two election judges, Democrat and Republican, confirm it. Spectators can watch through clear windows and television monitors that show the judges’ screens to the public. “The biggest thing we’ve done is build trust,” Klotz says. Img 20190422 094934 That hokey sentiment also means citizens are more demanding. In neighboring Elbert County — a more rural area where rodeos and county fairs abound — dozens of voters came in furious after Trump questioned whether mail ballots were being counted during a speech in Greeley, Colorado, about a week before the 2016 election. “I had people saying, ‘You’re throwing my vote away!’” says Elbert elections manager Rhonda Braun. “It didn’t help that the national media was telling us our system was hacked all the time.” After that election, Williams helped Colorado implement nearly every safety measure suggested by national election experts. It was named the safest state to vote in by everyone from The Washington Post to Trump’s then Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen.  Comforting locations help too. After a 2006 election marred by long lines, Douglas County pioneered a first-in-the-nation program in which nine local high schools served as polling sites and used students as election judges, who were paid in public service credits and salaries donated to a school activity of their choice (as of the 2016 election, the model had raised $57,000). Elbert County worked out a deal with a local Walmart to host a 24/7 mail-vote drop-off box for a few years, although it later pulled out of the program without giving a reason, election officials say. The county’s current office is a former bank, which allows for drive-thru voting as easy as dropping off checks at an ATM. A statewide-sharing program means voters can drop off their ballot in any Colorado county and have it be counted, a system that only Oregon and Washington also have.  Especially in low-population rural counties, the actions of one person can make a huge difference. It was no accident Mineral County led the country; it often leads the state in voting, thanks mostly to the efforts of Eryn Wintz, a do-it-all county clerk who shames voters in grocery stores, drafts her children into painting ballot boxes and enlists local sheriffs to drop off and pick up ballots directly from voters’ homes. “We sort of become an island, we’re so removed and so remote,” she said in an interview published on the secretary of state’s blog in the last presidential election. But that hasn’t stopped the county from standing out. The tiny county has one tiny town (Creede, a silver mining outpost) and has been called the “Cheers of Colorado,” made up of 95 percent public lands in the heart of the Rocky Mountains and Rio Grande National Forest.  The state’s most successful voting reforms are thanks to the Colorado Voter Access and Modernized Elections Act, which was signed into law in 2013 by then-governor John Hickenlooper (he’s now running for president). Now former Denver elections director and Vote at Home executive director Amber McReynolds — a chief architect of that bill who worked on its final draft from a hospital bed hours after giving birth to her son — is spreading the gospel of those reforms with speeches everywhere from Chicago and Detroit to Lansing, Michigan, and Virginia Beach. Beyond the technical, the thrust of her message is simple: “Too many policymakers, all they care about is who wins and not who votes.” Colorado, particularly its most vote-happy areas, has proven otherwise.

263,The Asian Volunteer Army Rising Against China’s Internet Trolls,-4.0,30.33,https://www.ozy.com/around-the-world/the-asian-volunteer-army-rising-against-chinas-internet-trolls/334518,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2020-07-15,www.ozy.com,25,"Because it takes a troll to beat a troll. It all started with a retweet. In April, Thai TV star Vachirawit “Bright” Chivaaree reposted a series of four urban landscapes shot by a Thai freelance photographer, one of which called Hong Kong a country. It was a controversial move by Vachirawit, whose TV show 2gether: The Series — a romance drama revolving around two male college students — had been a hit in mainland China since it premiered in late February. A torrent of online abuse followed his retweet. Chinese fans slid into Vachirawit’s Instagram and other social media with comments “correcting” him. Vachirawit — like many before him worried about losing out on the Chinese market — apologized.     i’m feel so sorry about my thoughtless retweet too , i only saw the pictures and did not read the caption clearly. Next time there will be no mistake like this again.🙏🏼💙     — bbright (@bbrightvc) April 10, 2020 But then Vachirawit’s rumored girlfriend, Thai influencer Weeraya Sukaram — who goes by the name Nnevvy on Twitter — retweeted a Thai-language post asking why China would not let foreigners investigate whether or not the coronavirus had originated in a Chinese lab. That was it. Vachirawit’s outraged fans were replaced by a team of Chinese internet trolls, known as the Little Pinks, says James Buchanan, a researcher specializing in Thai politics at the City University of Hong Kong. The Little Pinks, known for their aggressive trolling, pointed to an exchange between Weeraya and Vachirawit on Instagram in 2017 that they claimed implied Taiwan isn’t part of China. The online hate grew. The number of Vachirawit’s followers on Weibo dropped from more than 600,000 to 430,000 in a couple of days. The insults multiplied on platforms otherwise banned in China, such as Twitter and Instagram, revealing the official support the troll army enjoys. Over the past few years, China’s troll armies have bullied and coerced countries, organizations and individuals into self-censoring or taking back anything they’ve publicly said that is critical of the Communist Party. A tweet last year by Daryl Morey, general manager of the Houston Rockets, that supported Hong Kong’s anti-extradition protests dragged the NBA into a diplomatic row with China, a major market for the basketball association. Morey deleted his tweet and the NBA apologized. But in the case of Vachirawit and Weeraya, the Chinese trolls hadn’t bargained for what happened next. Thai netizens used self-deprecating humor to counter the insults hurled by their online adversaries, winning, according to independent experts, this 21st-century war that’s being fought entirely online. Another Chinese troll army, the 50 Cent Army, tried to take the Thai digital activists on. But the Thai were quickly joined by activists from Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Philippines and other nations in what was dubbed the Milk Tea Alliance — a reference to the milky tea drunk by people in those nations. When Chinese trolls called Thailand “poor,” the Thai hit back, referencing how in 2018, China banned Winnie the Pooh after memes likening President Xi Jinping to the rotund Pooh were used to mock the country’s leader. After Chinese trolls called the Thai king “trash,” Thai online activists responded with a meme — happily accepting the opportunity to publicly criticize their leader, a right most Chinese don’t enjoy. “When the Chinese criticized the Thai government and the monarchy, it was as if they were doing the things that the Thai [online activists] wanted,” says Buchanan. To the now-classic Chinese insult “NMSL” (“your mom is dead”), Thai youths replied that they had at least 20 mothers, poking fun at their king’s rumored collection of mistresses. In fact, they posted so many “NMSLese” memes and tweets that the insult quickly became a part of Urban Dictionary. Support has also come from Hong Kong. And when the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok tried to threaten Thai online activists, Joshua Wong, the Hong Kong pro-democracy leader, hit back.     [The statement by Chinese Embassy Bangkok is sheer arrogance and ignorance.]     1/ It is indisputable that the #nnevvy saga was provoked by the Chinese nationalist trolls, by firstly doxing, insulting and demeaning the Thai celebrities and people in Thailand. pic.twitter.com/EvzjQz6sqZ     — Joshua Wong 黃之鋒 😷 (@joshuawongcf) April 15, 2020 In fact, it is Hong Kong where the online retaliation against the Chinese troll armies began. In July 2019, Diba — a group of pro-government mainland China netizens — targeted Hong Kong anti-extradition activists on Facebook and LIHKG, a Reddit-like forum, recruiting around 12,000 Chinese netizens. But Hong Kong netizens hit back by doxxing Diba administrators and publicly revealing their personal information, thereby yanking off the cloak of anonymity the Chinese trolls were hiding behind. That forced Diba to “dissolve the online army group,” the Chinese group told its followers on Weibo. Now, a year later, it’s Thailand’s turn."
264,Biden Faces No Shortage of Foreign Policy Problems,-3.67,47.0,https://www.ozy.com/news-and-politics/biden-faces-no-shortage-of-foreign-policy-problems/413857,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-01-02,www.ozy.com,25,"The incoming president doesn’t get a honeymoon period. He’ll have plenty to tackle from day one. President-elect Joe Biden faces a longer and more complex set of foreign policy challenges than incoming presidents typically encounter. Unlike most of his predecessors, he won’t have the luxury of several months to take stock of the issues. All the problems will hit him smack in the face on day one. Global Pandemic Dealing with the pandemic in all its aspects is Biden’s most urgent problem. The challenges range from constructing a national policy that addresses political opposition to measures such as mask-wearing, building consensus on preventive steps, organizing testing centers, getting the U.S. population vaccinated (Biden aspires to vaccinate 100 million people in his first 100 days in office) and stabilizing the economy. Biden also says he will rejoin the World Health Organization as part of a broader effort to prevent further global spread and to build defenses against future viral outbreaks. Climate Change Global warming is the other problem atop Biden’s list. With scientists warning that time is running out to keep global warming under the 2 degrees Celsius tipping point, Biden made clear he will take the U.S. back into the 188-nation Paris Climate Accord from which Trump withdrew in his first months in office. He wants to put America on track to be carbon neutral by 2050, using a mix of policies ranging from encouraging electric vehicle use and tightening industrial emission standards to rolling back many Trump-era actions that loosened restrictions on the carbon industry and drilling land use. China Trump is leaving Biden a trade war only partially resolved under a phase one agreement that has China buying more American goods in 2021 while both sides leave in place tariffs on an array of Chinese and American goods. Biden says he won’t lift tariffs before assessing the trade picture and targeting abusive Chinese practices such as intellectual property theft and illegal subsidies to Chinese companies. He will try to enhance leverage on China by restoring close coordination with our allies on China policy and putting in place domestic policies on research, education and infrastructure that enhance Washington’s ability to compete with Beijing. Russia Trump will hand Biden a muddled picture on Russia — sanctions and diplomatic expulsions (in response to Russia’s Ukraine invasion and its poisoning of opponents) softened by presidential deference to Putin that borders on adulation. Biden will be tougher and more direct with Putin, but his first order of business will be reaching agreement on how to keep alive the 2011 bilateral agreement limiting Russian and U.S. intercontinental nuclear weapons (New START), set to expire 16 days after Biden is inaugurated. To deter Russia, Biden is likely to focus on regaining the confidence of our NATO partners left stunned by Trump’s indifference and disdain toward the alliance. Iran Trump bequeaths to Biden an Iran that is weakened economically and seething at the U.S. following tit-for-tat military attacks (today is the first anniversary of the U.S. killing of Iranian Revolutionary Guards Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and worries abound that Iran is timing retaliation for now). Iran is also closer to developing a nuclear weapon than when Biden left the vice presidency in 2017. Trump quit Obama’s 2015 nuclear agreement with Iran, arguing it didn’t limit Iran sufficiently, but the move backfired when Iran responded by ramping up its enrichment of uranium. Although it now has 12 times the amount of low-enriched uranium permitted under the agreement, it has been careful not to cross the threshold to nuclear “breakout,” which means Tehran can still turn back.  Biden says he wants to revive the agreement, but cleaning up Trump’s mess, while working with the original partners — including Russia and China — could be as tough as the yearslong effort to build the 2015 pact. North Korea Trump’s odd bromance with Kim Jong Un has not made the slightest dent in North Korea’s nuclear arsenal, which the U.S. military publicly now puts at between 20 and 60 bombs. Moreover, test results in 2017 showed North Korea has at least one missile that can lift a nuclear weapon and with a modified trajectory could fly 8,000 miles and reach most parts of the U.S. (we don’t know whether it can survive the heat of atmospheric reentry and hit targets accurately). In October it displayed an even larger missile. A first test of this weapon could be Kim’s way of prodding Biden to see how much his approach will differ from Trump’s. It is sure to differ in the greater degree to which Biden will work with allies and partners while taking stock of what went on between North Korea and the Trump administration. For its part, Pyongyang’s media, true to form, is already calling Biden a “rabid dog.” Le président américain Donald Trump et le leader nord coréen Kim Jong Un Afghanistan Trump decided in November to reduce U.S. troop levels in Afghanistan from around 5,000 to 2,500 by mid-January.  Biden has not revealed much about what his approach might be. Some experts are concerned that the Taliban has done nothing to justify the reduction, which under the recently negotiated peace agreement is supposed to be based on Taliban cessation of violence, successful negotiation with the elected Afghan government and a demonstrated break with terrorist organizations like al-Qaida — all still to be established. If the agreement is finalized, all American troops are supposed to leave by May, which could pose another tough decision for Biden given that the Taliban say failure to comply would be a dealbreaker. Terrorism Trump’s National Defense Strategy shifts the threat focus to China and Russia. While not dismissing the terrorist threat, the strategy gives it less prominence than in recent years. While the Biden team rightly sees more-urgent problems, they will need to do a hard review of the foreign terrorist threat, which is very different from the 9/11 decade and dangerous in different ways. Al-Qaida and the Islamic State group have become more decentralized and are burrowing into local politics in less-governed parts of the world. Seven of the 10 countries with the highest rates of terrorism in recent years are in sub-Saharan Africa. U.S. facilities and personnel will be vulnerable in these and similar areas (remember, the al-Qaida problem first grabbed public attention with the bombing of our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998). Terrorism is not gone. These are only the most prominent problems awaiting Biden. He will of course be confronting devilish issues such as cybersecurity (Trump reduced the White House role on this substantially), Venezuela and Syria. The good news is that his national security team is shaping up to be one of the most experienced and tested in recent memory — and tested it will be.   "

For once, Sarkozy won’t be happy to find himself in the spotlight, after a court sentenced him to jail on Monday for trying to bribe a judge in 2014. While Sarkozy will appeal the ruling and can remain free in the meantime — though he will return to court this month on separate charges of evading campaign finance laws — the verdict is a jolt to those leaders who think they’re above the law. Today’s Daily Dose explores how corruption charges are catching up with multiple world leaders even as the COVID-19 pandemic has opened up fresh opportunities to cheat taxpayers. Read about the deep ties between war and corruption, meet unheralded heroes and understand why this battle is as old as civilization itself — and even God isn’t immune.  WHO’S NEXT AFTER SARKOZY? South Africa Holds A National Day Of Prayer For Nelson Mandela Donald Trump: The former U.S. president was acquitted by a divided Senate after a second impeachment last month on charges that he instigated the mob that attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6. But New York prosecutors are still investigating allegations of financial fraud by Trump, and Georgia prosecutors are exploring whether he broke the law by trying to strong-arm local officials into reversing the election results, as Trump no longer enjoys the de facto immunity that came with the presidency. At a time when Trump has indicated he’s open to running again in 2024, the outcome of the corruption probe could determine his political future. Benjamin Netanyahu: They call him Mr. Teflon. For years, no political scandal has seriously damaged the career of Israel’s longest-serving prime minister. But now, as he looks to retain power in a fourth national election in less than two years, Bibi, as Netanyahu is called, faces growing pressure to resign over allegations of corruption that have refused to go away. The charges range from accepting cigars and Champagne from businessmen in exchange for favors to helping media houses that showered him with positive coverage. Now he’s getting bad press for it.  Jacob Zuma: The controversial former South African president has long faced allegations of corruption during his time in office. Now, he finally faces a trial that’ll start in May, more than 16 years after first being implicated. Zuma has refused to cooperate with the probe into the allegations against him, and his defiance is part of a larger battle over the future direction of the nation and its ruling party, the African National Congress (ANC). Current President Cyril Ramaphosa has promised to crush corruption and has taken on Zuma’s ally and ANC Secretary-General Ace Magashule, who is widely seen as corrupt. Zuma’s political survival skills are legendary. But has his luck finally run out? Read more on OZY. Luiz Inácio ‘Lula’ da Silva: A former trade union leader, Lula is one of two former Brazilian presidents who’ve spent time in jail after corruption convictions in Latin America’s most expansive scam, the Car Wash scandal. But while the conviction meant he couldn’t contest the 2018 presidential elections, Lula remains wildly popular for his social welfare programs like the Bolsa Família cash transfers. And current President Jair Bolsonaro — arguably the biggest political beneficiary of the Car Wash probe — is now feeling the heat too. He shut down the investigation in February amid persistent allegations of graft against his own son.  Park Geun-hye: It was corruption at the highest levels possible. South Korea’s former president accepted a bribe from the heir apparent of the country’s largest firm, Samsung. Now they’re both in prison, Park for 22 years and Samsung scion Lee Jae-yong for 2 ½ years. But current President Moon Jae-in — who has promised to stamp out corruption — is now under political pressure to fire his top prosecutor after the prosecutor turned his attention to Moon’s own justice ministers.  Najib Razak: The former Malaysian prime minister didn’t worry about middlemen. He was sentenced last year to 12 years in jail for transferring $10 million from a state wealth fund directly to his personal bank account. The so-called 1MDB scam is the biggest to have rocked the Southeast Asian nation.   COVID CRONYISM Un-Masked: The U.K. High Court recently found Britain’s health secretary, Matt Hancock, guilty of withholding details of COVID-19 contracts, including a $350 million deal with a finance firm for the supply of 50 million face masks … which eventually couldn’t be used because of safety concerns. In South Africa, investigators found in September that 60 percent of “medical grade” face masks provided by companies hired for the task were substandard. And in Poland, health minister Lukasz Szumowski had to resign after it was revealed he bought useless masks for the country from a ski instructor friend.  Every Breath You Take: Someone might be minting money off it. How did a raspberry firm get a government contract in Bosnia-Herzegovina to buy Chinese ventilators that don’t work? The same way that the state of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil paid for 1,000 ventilators, most of which never arrived. Or how Indian authorities purchased hundreds of fake ventilators for public hospitals. Will these revelations fix pandemic corruption once and for all? Don’t hold your breath. Aid … or Paid? Indonesian social affairs minister Juliari Batubara was arrested in December for receiving at least $1.2 million in bribes from companies tasked with helping the nation’s pandemic aid efforts. Fraud has also hollowed out the small-business loans program that’s part of America’s COVID-19 recovery package.  The Hidden Link: It’s not just about looting the treasury. Corruption, the World Bank believes, is also fundamentally tied to how well different countries have responded to the pandemic. Consider the evidence. Slovakia, which boasts Europe’s lowest deaths from COVID-19 per capita, is also a pioneer in embracing a public transparency register that lists all beneficiaries of companies that want government contracts. New Zealand, the best-performing country on Transparency International’s Corruption Perceptions Index, is also a major success story in controlling the pandemic. As is Singapore, Asia’s most transparent nation.  BLOOD BOUNTY  Yemen’s Yes-Men: The arms business accounts for 40 percent of global corruption. And nowhere is that stunning statistic on more grotesque display than in the war in Yemen that’s leaving all of us poorer and less safe, suggests Andrew Feinstein, founding director of Shadow World Investigations. The sale of weapons to any side in the Yemen conflict — effectively a proxy war between Saudi Arabia and Iran — contravenes international humanitarian law, he says. And yet, the U.S., the U.K. and the European Union continue to supply tens of billions of dollars’ worth of weapons to Saudi Arabia and its ally, the United Arab Emirates, every year. “Every time a school is bombed in Yemen, politicians in the U.S. and the U.K. get a little bit richer,” Feinstein tells OZY. Greasy Graft: The Oil-for-Food program was the U.N.’s biggest humanitarian project, aimed at helping Iraq use its oil to feed its people amid global sanctions against the Saddam Hussein regime. But the biggest beneficiaries turned out to be corrupt companies and officials, from French auto giants like Peugeot and Renault, to India’s then-foreign minister Natwar Singh, who won shady contracts from an Iraqi regime that pocketed as much as $11 billion from the scam.   Corruption Intelligence Agency: The Soviet Union’s defeat in Afghanistan couldn’t have been achieved without bags stuffed with slush money sent by the CIA for different factions of the Afghan mujahideen. It’s an approach the American intelligence agency and its British counterpart, the MI6, have subsequently used to influence top Afghan officials by bribing them, even after the country’s transition to a democracy. The CIA has similarly been accused of spying out corrupt officials overseas … and then using them to wield influence in El Salvador, Iraq, Syria and Yemen, among other nations, as Douglas Valentine writes in The CIA as Organized Crime.  Times They Are a-Changin’: European regulations against defense corruption have driven arms scams underground. Mark Thatcher, son of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, was accused of receiving millions for an arms deal struck by his mother. On the other hand, points out Feinstein of Shadow World Investigations, “Tony Blair [prime minister in the 1990s] had to wait until he’d left office to receive a string of lucrative contracts and consultancies from Saudi-backed entities and other insalubrious regimes and companies.” It was worth the wait: Feinstein estimates that Blair — who has denied corruption — might have made more than $100 million from the arms industry and the fallout of the Iraq invasion that led to the deaths of over a million people.  CORRUPTION CRUSADERS copyright-chinwe-esimai-1portraits-by-demato-productions José Domingo Pérez: One former Peruvian president, Alan Garcia, killed himself rather than face the details of corruption exposed by this 44-year-old prosecutor. A second, Garcia’s predecessor, Alejandro Toledo, is fighting Pérez’s push for his extradition from the U.S., also on corruption charges. A third, Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, is under pretrial detention over graft allegations. And in February, Pérez expanded investigations against Keiko Fujimori, the daughter of a fourth former president, Alberto Fujimori. Robert Muller has nothing on him. Read more on OZY.   Chinwe Esimai: The murkiest of scams usually rely on those most regular of financial institutions: big banks. Nigeria-born Esimai is at the forefront of the banking sector’s attempts to reform itself. The Harvard-trained lawyer is Citibank’s first chief anti-corruption and bribery officer, and among the most powerful women of color in the white- and male-dominated world of banking. Read more on OZY.  Anjali Bhardwaj: When India introduced a Right to Information (RTI) law in 2005, modeled on the Freedom of Information Act in the U.S., it was a landmark moment for transparency in the world’s largest democracy. So when the current government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi introduced a set of steps to weaken the law, Bhardwaj, one of the country’s leading RTI activists, decided she had to speak out. And at a time when voices of dissent in India increasingly find themselves jailed, her voice has received amplification, with the U.S. State Department naming her as one of 12 winners of its new Anti-Corruption Champions Award in February.  Tech Tricks: From Ukraine to Armenia, activists in Eastern Europe are using drones to slip behind the high walls that corrupt judges and politicians use to shield their lavish mansions and ill-gotten wealth from public scrutiny. The use of cryptocurrencies for payments could improve transparency. In Nigeria, Ghana, Kenya and South Africa, governments are using blockchain technology to fight local corruption. And the Ethiopian government is turning to blockchain to better monitor its coffee supply chain. Read more on OZY.  Xu Zhiyong: The 47-year-old has made it a habit to call Chinese President Xi Jinping’s bluffs, whether on cracking down on corruption or tackling the coronavirus (he called Xi “clueless”). Among China’s most prominent civil rights and anti-corruption activists, the outspoken Xu frequently ends up in prison. But once released, he resumes his activism with the same intensity. On corruption in China, trust Xu, not Xi.   OLD AS THE HILLS Nedbank Golf Challenge - Day Four When in Rome: Corruption is often noted as one of the reasons for the fall of the Roman Empire. That extended from cheating in the ancient Olympics to looting taxpayers’ money. One famous example of corruption was Sicily’s governor Gaius Verres (120–43 B.C.), who is believed to have siphoned off 40 million sesterces (the average yearly salary was around 900 sesterces) from the Roman tax rolls. Bribing God: Forget pay for play: This is pay for pray. Visit most traditional Chinese homes, and you’ll find the image of the Kitchen God hung near the cooking stove. According to mythology, a week before the Chinese New Year, he rises to the heavens carrying a report card of the family’s behavior to the Jade Emperor. To sweeten the report, families offer a bribe of sugar to the Kitchen God — smearing the image with something sweet and then burning it, so it can ascend to heaven.     Sun City or Sin City? Home to four luxurious hotels, two Gary Player-designed golf courses and an artificial surfing beach, Sun City is South Africa’s (wilder) answer to Disney World. But those faux gold finishes are built on a crooked foundation. In the late 1970s, hotelier Sol Kerzner took advantage of apartheid-era rules to establish casinos in several supposedly independent Black homelands such as Bophuthatswana (gambling was outlawed in white South Africa at the time). Once built, Kerzner paid eye-watering sums to international musicians (Frank Sinatra, Queen, The Beach Boys) to bust the international sanctions imposed on apartheid South Africa and visit Sun City. Player, meanwhile, attracted a stellar field to what was then the world’s richest golf tournament. When apartheid ended, Kerzner used “a working relationship” with Nelson Mandela to ensure the sun never set on Sun City.  Russian Racket: What’s one thing the tsars, Soviet leaders and current Russian President Vladimir Putin have all shared — apart from residing in the Kremlin? A favorite holiday destination overlooking the Black Sea, where lies “Putin’s palace,” a sprawling mansion that now-jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny alleges was built with the “largest bribe in history” from the country’s oligarchs. Putin’s judo buddy Arkady Rotenberg claims he owns the palace, which is said to have cost more than $1.3 billion. "
266,Florida’s Unemployment ‘Dream Team’ Helps 50K Tackle a Broken System,-8.67,40.67,https://www.ozy.com/news-and-politics/floridas-unemployment-dream-team-helps-50k-tackle-a-broken-system/369464,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2020-08-15,www.ozy.com,25,"Because hundreds of thousands of people are not getting the money they're owed.     A network of women across Florida are helping tens of thousands of people navigate the state’s notoriously bad unemployment system.     Their fight is about to get tougher with the state implementing a new system and unemployment still stubbornly high. It’s late spring and Laura Tweed is sitting atop her Harley Davidson motorcycle pounding away on her phone as if it’s a laptop as she drafts a list of grievances to Florida’s Department of Economic Opportunity (DEO). The 55-year-old insurance agent was accompanied by Aimee Matz, 51, a bartender, and Tami Bohm, 55, a corporate compliance officer. After months of meetings on Zoom, Matz and Bohm decided to drive from their respective parts of the Sunshine State to better merge their ideas in person.  The result? A document called “The 24 Atrocities,” outlining the nightmares Floridians must endure to receive money that was promised to them from the state. “This just makes me sick. I can’t believe all the problems,” Tweed recalls thinking at the time. “It’s just the three of us from six-something at night till three-something in the morning, and I’m like ‘Can you believe we have 24 just sitting here that we can name off the top of our heads?’” Florida Since then, banding together with other volunteers across the state, they’ve helped more than 50,000 unemployed Floridians by troubleshooting their cases, walking them through the process on Zoom calls, compiling lists of contacts in the state’s byzantine bureaucracy and even throwing some political muscle around. Their fans started calling them the “Dream Team” of Florida’s benefits system. “I fight for the underdogs,” says Tweed, who has volunteered for years to help chronically or terminally ill veterans get benefits. “If I see something that’s not right, I say, that’s BS. Let’s fix this.”     Word quickly spread on social media that these women were getting results.  Tweed and her allies have chosen a formidable target. One aide to Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis called Florida’s unemployment system “a shit sandwich,” engineered by the prior Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican who’s now in the U.S. Senate, to save money rather than serve as a safety net — and it succeeded in reducing the unemployment taxes paid by Florida businesses. By 2015, just 18.7 percent of short-term unemployed Floridians actually received benefits — the fourth-lowest mark in the country. This is due in large part to the maddening architecture of the system. The unemployment assistance website, CONNECT, is dated and anything but user-friendly. “Until the pandemic, most people were only allowed to file claims electronically,” says Cindy Huddleton, an attorney who specializes in public assistance programs and a senior policy analyst at the Florida Policy Institute. “That created a lot of problems for people who are not technologically savvy or don’t have access to computers.” And let’s just say you make it through all the hoops and actually get a check. Floridians are not only receiving one of the lowest weekly payouts in the country, at $275, but in the shortest window too: 12 weeks, compared to 26 weeks in most states. But now that COVID-19 has leveled the unemployment playing field, the issue has suddenly become a priority for state leaders.  In the spring, DeSantis responded to the unemployment surge by temporarily contracting for thousands of call-takers and waiving the requirement that applicants prove they’re looking for a job. But many still haven’t gotten anything since the pandemic started. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis And Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez Hold Coronavirus Briefing The state has seen an unprecedented wave of unemployment applicants: 3.4 million unique claims since March, of which it’s paid out nearly 1.9 million. The state says it’s paid out 95 percent of eligible claimants, while the rest are not eligible for the money. But in many cases, the “Dream Team” found, applicants were simply never told what documentation they had to send — often by fax, as if this were 1995. So they coach people on whether they need to send their driver’s license, wage documentation or something else, and push back against denied claims. The quest began with Tweed’s own struggles with the system. Raised in Orlando (her father was a truck driver), she’s called Florida home for most of her life. A longtime insurance agent, she filed for unemployment benefits for the first time in March and her application “fell into a deep dark hole of nothing.” She eventually found out that the state was waiting on a response from her employer … even though she was self-employed. Tweed traveled to the state capital Tallahassee for a drive-around rally to protest the broken system. She got involved with unemployment groups online and started connecting with a network of women around the state who became the Dream Team. Word quickly spread on social media that these women were getting results. Tweed, who in her rare spare moments enjoys fishing and boating, describes her role as a project manager, making sure people with the right expertise tackle claims that suit them. Among them is Vanessa Brito, 37, a political strategist in Miami, who connects two to three times per week with people seeking benefits. She deploys her political connections to bring in people like state Sen. Jason Pizzo, a Miami Democrat, to escalate claims, while investing hours and days to produce the DEO agent email lists and telephone directories to help claimants find the right person to contact. But her real fear is what comes next. President Donald Trump’s recent executive order extending extra federal unemployment benefits comes with a twist — it requires states to set up a new system to administer the payments. “Without training, access and increased personnel, I am concerned about how the state will handle the implementation of a new ‘loss of wages’ program as mandated by the president’s executive order,” Brito says. And who got the $135 million state contract to administer the new program? Deloitte, the same consultancy that set up the original dysfunctional system. “You can’t fix stupid,” Tweed says. The Dream Team may need to recruit some reinforcements."

So we’re going to take the sage advice of children’s television legend Fred Rogers. When asked about his response to tragedy, Rogers said: “Look for the helpers.” Today, we’re empowering you, our OZY family, to become the helpers. Our Sunday Magazine explores a nation — and world — in need, while also arming you with ways to help. And while money is often a good solution, there are plenty other ways to pitch in as we try to build a better world in a time of despair. Read on and be inspired to take action. the stakes widespread_wreckage Grim Numbers. More than 15 million Americans are collecting unemployment insurance, and the official unemployment rate stands at 10.2 percent. Both figures have fallen since the apex of pandemic lockdowns in May, but they remain above the peak of the Great Recession in 2009. With eviction moratoriums ended and expanded federal unemployment benefits reduced, the next fear is a wave of people being tossed out onto the street: An estimated 30 to 40 million Americans are at risk of eviction. The coronavirus numbers have declined a bit in some key states, but much of the economy remains in a state of suspended animation until a coronavirus vaccine is approved and widely distributed.  Whither the Relief? Democrats in the U.S. House passed a $3 trillion bill to provide a fresh round of economic relief — direct payments to families, aid to states and localities, a U.S. Postal Service bailout and much more — but negotiations with Republicans in the Senate and White House ran aground. So last weekend President Donald Trump took executive action to back $300 per week of expanded federal unemployment insurance for many workers (down from $600), extend a suspension of student loan payments and other measures. But Congress would have to act for a more sweeping rescue, and Republicans remain divided on the size and scope of further relief — with no action likely until at least September. Florida’s Unemployment Dream Team. Florida’s famously terrible unemployment assistance system — one Republican called it a “shit sandwich” — has left hundreds of thousands struggling to get the benefits they are due. So several women with a very particular set of skills got together to help people navigate the system. Dubbed the “Unemployment Dream Team,” they’ve put resources together online and helped 50,000 people get their benefits. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Read more on OZY. Unequal Impact. The economic crisis is exacerbating America’s existing racial inequality. Black unemployment is now 15 percent (compared with 6.3 percent a year ago) while white unemployment stands at 9.4 percent (up from 3.6 percent). Black Americans are also far more likely to be frontline or “essential” workers, who are suffering a more severe impact from coronavirus. Watch OZY and OWN’s special town hall on COVID-19 and Black Women. Haves and Have-Nots. A number that’s looking pretty good right now? The stock market. The S&P 500 is flirting with an all-time high, and tech titans like Apple, Facebook, Alphabet and Netflix are soaring, an indication of just how far the stock market is removed from the regular economy. In fact, America’s 643 billionaires have gained a total of $685 billion in wealth — just since mid-March. Mother Jones puts it all in context, pointing out that hiring 50,000 teachers nationwide would cost just $30 billion. Mr. Bezos, can you please write a check? Unrest in Chicago. Amid concerns over police brutality and pandemic-heightened economic anxiety, cities have seen scattered outbreaks of violence and looting in recent months. More upheaval in Chicago followed last weekend’s police shooting of 20-year-old Latrell Allen, who is charged with attempted murder for allegedly shooting at officers and is expected to recover after being hit in the shoulder. After the incident, Chicagoans raided the high-end shopping district known as the Magnificent Mile. Political leaders roundly condemned the looting, but as one Black Lives Matter organizer put it, “That’s reparations.”  how you can help Hand3 Giving Guides.

There are plenty of places that are still seeking talent, or even thriving during the pandemic. The biggest banks in the U.S. and Europe hired 19,000 people during the first six months of the year, amid surging demand for loans and other products. Tech startups continue to expand in hubs like Seattle. At the other end of the wage spectrum, demand for farm workers is as strong as ever — though the jobs carry harrowing coronavirus risks.

After dictator Alexander Lukashenko declared election victory with a laughable 80 percent of the vote against popular challenger Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, Belarusians took to the streets. Their government responded with mass arrests and torture, while shutting off the internet and other communication modes. You can help by supporting the nonprofit Amnesty International, which is helping bring to light abuses within the country. Beirut Fallout. A devastating explosion — the exact cause of which remains unclear — killed 170 people, left 300,000 homeless in downtown Beirut and sparked increased unrest. The country was already teetering on the edge of economic collapse before the blast. You can help by backing any number of groups, including the International Medical Corps and UNICEF. Environmental Disaster in Mauritius. More than 1,000 tons of fuel oil spilled into the Indian Ocean last month after a Japanese tanker ran aground on coral off the island nation of Mauritius, causing the worst ecological crisis in the country’s history, with devastating implications for its biodiversity and tourist trade. There are crowdfunding campaigns to help locals, but hair salons are also chipping in — turns out human hair is a great material for soaking up oil. homelessness crisis homeless The Next Pandemic. The rent is due at last in America, and millions can’t pay. The telltale signs of people’s belongings piled on the sidewalk are indicative of the wave of evictions that are now wreaking havoc. In Ohio, 23 percent of people said they couldn’t make their rent or mortgage payment last month or had little or no confidence they’d make it this month. And there are eerie parallels to the mortgage crisis of 2008 in the government’s unwillingness to step in. Hotel Living. It seems like an easy enough fix: Hotels are vacant due to the pandemic, and the homeless population is surging — and particularly vulnerable to the virus. But housing the homeless in hotels is proving to be difficult in California, which instituted Project Roomkey with much fanfare this spring but has been slow to roll out due to bureaucratic stumbles. And housing the homeless in hotels among the well-to-do on the Upper West Side of New York has drawn some community backlash. Long-Running Crisis. America’s homeless problem long predates the pandemic, owing to skyrocketing housing costs and economic inequality. Early this year, OZY took a comprehensive look at the problem and some innovative solutions, from tiny houses for veterans to a chatbot for “the hidden homeless.”"
268,Butterfly Effect: Guess Who Gains From a Burning Jerusalem?,-4.67,39.33,https://www.ozy.com/around-the-world/butterfly-effect-guess-who-gains-from-a-burning-jerusalem/431711,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-05-13,www.ozy.com,25,"When the sounds of sirens in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv are accompanied by wails of crying mothers in Gaza, it means only one thing: Israel and militant Palestinian groups are trading bombs and rockets yet again. The death and destruction this week are mounting. By Wednesday morning, at least 83 Palestinians — including 17 children — and seven Israelis had died in the latest attacks and counterstrikes. Yet, while they say that there are no winners in war, the truth is that the current clashes help the cynical politics of Israel’s embattled prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the extremist Palestinian group Hamas. The irony? Their narrow gains actually represent a setback for the broader interests of Israel and of Palestinian hopes of a homeland. The current crisis has roots in a proposal to evict six Palestinian families from the East Jerusalem neighborhood of Sheikh Jarrah and restrictions placed by Israel on Muslim worshippers during the month of Ramadan. Palestinians have traditionally gathered at the historic Damascus Gate of the Old City after breaking their evening fasts during Ramadan. This year, they were blocked by barricades. Then, clashes between Israeli police and worshippers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque — Islam’s third holiest shrine — injured hundreds over the past week, injecting the added tension needed to ignite an all-out conflict. Hamas, which controls the Gaza Strip, is firing hundreds of rockets into Israel, whose sophisticated Iron Dome defense system helps it reduce casualties. The world’s only Jewish nation has responded with more lethal airstrikes on Gaza. Though Israel insists its attacks are targeted at militant commanders and weapons depots, they invariably kill innocent Palestinians too. Even as Egypt, Qatar, global powers — including the U.S. — and the United Nations try and mediate between the two sides, Netanyahu has vowed to escalate strikes on Gaza. Hamas, he said, “will be hit in ways that it does not expect.” Militants from Gaza, including the Islamic Jihad group, aren’t backing down either. But while the world understandably focuses on the unfolding violence and deaths, the intensifying crisis is quietly bolstering Netanyahu and Hamas politically. Last week, Israel’s longest-serving prime minister failed to pull together a ruling coalition after the country’s fourth election in two years. Centrist opposition leader Yair Lapid is trying to sew up a governing front that includes both a conservative Islamist party, called the United Arab List (Ra’am in Hebrew), and conservative Jewish groups opposed to Netanyahu. The clashes have dealt what could be a death blow to those anti-Netanyahu efforts. Lapid and other opposition leaders have been forced to fall in line with the government’s attacks on Gaza. That in turn has made Ra’am withdraw from negotiations. Meanwhile, Likud, Netanyahu’s party, and other right-wing groups have blamed the violence on the political discussions led by Lapid. Israel might well be headed toward a fifth vote since 2019, with the crafty Netanyahu still politically alive. Hamas is making its own calculations. The Palestinian Authority, led by octogenarian Mahmoud Abbas, controls the West Bank but has seen its legitimacy before ordinary Palestinians wane in recent years as it is thought to have accomplished little through its more peaceful approach. It has criticized the assaults on worshippers at the Al-Aqsa Mosque but has tried to control Palestinian protests against Israel. By contrast, Hamas gets to project itself as the true, fearless defender of Palestinian interests, willing to take on the might of the Israeli military. In recent days, Palestinian crowds in Jerusalem have chanted slogans in favor of Hamas and accusing Abbas of betraying them. Unlike the Palestinian Authority, Hamas has little global support. The violence forces the international community to include them in backroom negotiations, giving them much-sought diplomatic credibility. It’s a tactic America knows well — that’s exactly what the Taliban does in Afghanistan. So, what does all of this mean for Israel and for Palestinian dreams of statehood? Israel’s true strategic rival in the Middle East is Iran. At a time when the Biden administration is trying to revive the nuclear deal between Washington and Tehran, Israel would want to focus on building a broad coalition against those efforts. Yet the videos of the crackdowns at Al-Aqsa during Ramadan and the reports of dead children in Gaza will make Israel’s job much harder. Last year, it struck historic peace deals with the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Morocco and Sudan. All four have sharply criticized Israel’s actions in recent days. Meanwhile, prodded by the Biden administration, Saudi Arabia has begun talks with Iran. That both countries have publicly acknowledged those negotiations shows the geopolitical force pushing the traditional enemies together. Yet a stronger Hamas won’t help the Palestinian cause globally either. A vast majority of countries around the world back a two-state solution in the Middle East, but it’s hard for them to argue for it assertively while the militant group lobs rockets indiscriminately into civilian neighborhoods in Israeli cities. Still, this latest cycle of violence will further entrench the politics of Netanyahu and Hamas in the hearts and minds of Israelis and Palestinians, respectively. The already fading hopes of any long-term resolution to this historic conflict will continue to recede. The sirens and the wails will recur … again and again and again."
269,The Secret World of Cybersecurity,0.0,46.0,https://www.ozy.com/the-new-and-the-next/the-secret-world-of-cybersecurity/431841,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2021-05-12,www.ozy.com,25,"Jack Nicholson was playing the Joker, the Berlin Wall was about to fall and the first internet providers were emerging. It was 1989, and while plenty was happening on the world stage, it was also the year of the first recorded ransomware attack, which occurred when evolutionary biologist Joseph Popp mailed out 20,000 tainted floppy disks to a list that included medical professionals and organizations. Promising to give them info on AIDS, the disks instead threatened to lock files on infected computers unless the user sent $189 to a P.O. Box for the PC Cyborg Corporation in Panama. Three decades later, cyberwarfare is decidedly less playful. The Colonial Pipeline, which provides the East Coast of the U.S. with nearly half of its gas and jet fuel, was recently shuttered for days after ransomware attacks. As the White House scrambles and President Joe Biden considers executive orders to strengthen cybersecurity, it’s time to get up to speed on the digital frontier’s emerging combatants and battle lines. cyberwarfare’s new fronts Unspeakable Spread. German hospitals haven’t just been fighting COVID-19 over the past year. At one point, cyberattacks against Deutschland’s health facilities were so serious that police believed ransomware had led to a patient’s death. While investigators eventually ruled that the patient would have died anyway, the incident highlighted that hackers have the ability to infiltrate every facet of our lives — even sacrosanct ones like health care. In 2019, cyberattacks ranked behind only climate change and ISIS as the most feared national threat, according to a global Pew Research poll that collected information from 26 nations, including South Africa and Japan. Businesses that were proactive against cyberattacks saved an average of $2 million on data breach costs, which explains why cyber specialists are in high demand, with growth in the sector far outpacing that of other occupations. The Next El Chapo. Kidnapping, extortion, drug trafficking — these are crimes we expect to see from billion-dollar Latin American crime syndicates. But now, Russian and Eastern European hackers are giving way to nefarious coders in regions like Brazil and Mexico. A malware called Amavaldo, which first harried financial institutions in Spain and Portugal, began attacking Brazilian banks, too, in 2019. Ploutus, a Mexican malware, has attacked ATMs, while ransomware in Colombia and Venezuela have been used to blackmail executives. That’s led to fears that major criminal organizations, like the Sinaloa Cartel, once led by Joaquin “El Chapo” Guzman, could make cybercrime a bigger part of their portfolios. Overall, Latin American banks lost $809 million in 2018, with 92 percent of them reporting digital security breaches. Expensive Year. Hackers have also been refining an old trick. They install ransomware to hold an organization’s assets hostage, and the ransom can be steep. Cyber thieves demanded an average of $100,000 per attack in 2020, with record costs to companies, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. That led FBI officials to deem cyberattacks a national threat, with companies like Microsoft, Cisco and Amazon advocating for greater financial support and tighter oversight of cryptocurrencies often used by criminals to skirt traditional monetary systems. Local Skirmishes. College students in Montana and California have had their data compromised in various attacks in recent years, while the cities of Atlanta and Baltimore saw their public utility systems crippled by RobbinHood ransomware attacks in 2019. Cities have turned out to be particularly vulnerable. They have small budgets and mountains of valuable information, from the data used to operate power grids to citizens’ personal data. Although federal governments can provide advice on how to handle these attacks, there won’t be meaningful change at the local level until citizens demand that elected leaders better protect their data. Hackers Without Borders. No frontier is off-limits to hackers. Just take a look at the ones who mined Pfizer for COVID-19 data earlier this year. According to South Korean intelligence, North Korean hackers attempted to steal vaccine technology from the U.S. pharmaceutical giant. What makes the case more bizarre is that publicly, North Korea has established itself as a leader in COVID-19 denial. Even though the nation has yet to report a single case, it recently accepted 2 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine. British officials are hoping that a new facility opened by global comms giant Viasat in the U.K. will help the nation stave off similar attacks and protect its COVID-related government services. Hack the Vote. Opposition parties in India insisted in 2019 that the electronic voting machines used in the country, which is the world’s largest democracy, could be hacked. Some experts considered the voting machines vulnerable, while others pointed out that there’s only a risk if the machines are connected to the internet. Either way, this debate is likely to determine how we vote in the future, and could feed fraud fears that will undermine the credibility of democracy more broadly. Breaching the Big Leagues. The bigger they are, the harder they fall. In 2020, Microsoft, Intel and other major tech firms and global governments were hit by a sophisticated attack inserted into software from SolarWinds and Microsoft. Likely emanating from Russia, the attack, in which the malware masqueraded as a routine Orion software update, affected 18,000 customers, including major U.S. federal government agencies. The Biden administration responded with a slew of new sanctions against Russia, but the damage was already done to the United States’ cyberdefense credibility. Nuclear Head-Scratcher. The dangers of cyberwarfare were thrown into stark relief in 2010, when Iran’s nuclear sites were attacked by malware thought to have been launched by Israel and the U.S. The most perplexing part? The nuclear sites were offline, meaning the complex computer worm must have been delivered directly into the operating systems — an impressive, if terrifying, feat. cyber heroes cyber_2 Chris Kubecka. The half Puerto Rican, half Dutch former U.S. Air Force vet serves as a digital guardian angel, always on the lookout for global security risks from her Amsterdam apartment. She has developed cyberwarfare exercises and tackled threats for international organizations such as NATO and the European Union, and was credited with saving Saudi Arabia’s oil giant Aramco after it suffered massive losses during the Shamoon cyber offensive in 2012. A child prodigy who had learned to program by the time she was 6, Kubecka is now developing guides to help companies and their employees ensure their networks are secure. Michael Borohovski. A New York native and the only son of Russian immigrants, the 34-year-old is the co-founder of the software company Tinfoil Security. Since its launch in 2011, his company has sold automated security tools to tens of thousands of clients, ranging from small businesses to Fortune 500 companies. Had you known the MIT grad in his youth, you would have seen this career path coming. At 9, he taught inelegant programming languages like Visual Basic and COBOL to his sister — then a college sophomore. By the time he was a teen, he was already hacking video games for the win. At least U.S. citizens can rest easy knowing he’s on their side in the cyber cold war. Shivam Vashisht. The 24-year-old chose ethical hacking over college and today is a leading white hat hacker for several major companies, including Goldman Sachs, Starbucks, Twitter and Instagram. Born in India, Vashisht’s parents were initially concerned about him dropping out of school. But once they realized it was for a good cause — and after he used his earnings to help his dad retire and take his family traveling around the world — they got on board. Vashisht’s specialty is finding server-side and logical bugs, earning his first payday at 20. With cybersecurity specialists in high demand and companies willing to shell out for their expertise, more tech-savvy youngsters may choose this career over traditional paths like computer science. Eva Galperin. As director of cybersecurity at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Galperin protects vulnerable populations worldwide by writing security training materials and publishing research on malware for countries like Syria, Vietnam and Kazakhstan. Born in Latvia to Jewish parents who had fled the Soviet Union, her focus is on stalkerware — malware used by stalkers to track their victims, who are often survivors of domestic abuse. So far in her career, Galperin has launched an outreach effort for survivors of stalkerware and has shamed antivirus and security companies for refusing to act more aggressively against abuse. Marcus Hutchins. Hutchins single-handedly prevented a terrible ransomware attack on hundreds of thousands of computers globally — including those used by dozens of hospitals in the British National Health Service — by the aptly named WannaCry in 2017. Yet, while the then 22-year-old was lauded by many, his major ethical hacking win wasn’t enough to prevent his arrest several months later by U.S. federal authorities. His crime? A code he wrote as a teenager was used in a Trojan attack. Nevermind that his whole (albeit brief) adult life had been dedicated to fighting malware. Place this hero in the “no good deed goes unpunished” category after he was sentenced to one year of supervised release, a charge that held no prison time but did raise the possibility that the British citizen may not be allowed back in the U.S. unlikely threats … and successes Cyber_3 Ethiopian Intelligence. Although not known for its coding prowess, Ethiopia has long employed cyberattacks for political leverage. In 2015, amid protests, casualties and an eventual state of emergency, investigators discovered that the East African country was using spyware to snoop on journalists and advocates of the Oromo ethnic group in 20 countries. Provided to the Ethiopian government by the Israel-based defense outfit Elbit Systems Ltd., the malware could take screenshots, record passwords and operate a computer’s camera to record conversations held by targeted subjects, which included Ph.D. and law school students. Macedonian Backfire. Government hacks can have unintended benefits too — like exposing and bringing down a corrupt ruling party that has held power for decades. At least that was how events unfolded in this small Balkan country after the Macedonian opposition party revealed the Administration for Security and Counterintelligence had been using illegal widespread internet surveillance against its citizens. Journalists, nongovernmental organizations and politicians from all parties were targeted by sophisticated software, which recorded 560,646 telephone conversations on topics ranging from government-instigated violence against demonstrators to financial crimes that had decimated the state budget. Estonia. This northeastern European country is a world leader in cybersecurity and has developed training exercises used by the governments of Austria and Luxembourg, as well as NATO. The small former Soviet republic is perhaps more code-savvy than you’d expect. It even has an e-government infrastructure in place that emphasizes reliable digital identity and a mandatory security baseline for all government authorities. Estonia’s excess of cyber caution came after it faced what experts deemed the world’s first cyberwar in 2007. Part of the nation’s innovative recovery included setting up a unit of cyber volunteers — citizen hackers — to protect Estonian cyberspace. Now, the country of 1.3 million people is on its third national cybersecurity strategy, refining its tricks of the trade as the years go by. Murky Waters. Water treatment plants have become a new favorite target for hackers. In early 2021, hackers tried to modify chlorine levels at a treatment plant in Florida, an effort that could have poisoned an entire town of about 14,000 if not for the watchful eye of a local supervisor who noticed that an outsider had taken control of his cursor and ramped up sodium hydroxide levels a hundredfold. Similar attacks in Israel were foiled twice last year. These breaches highlight endemic failures in the water sector’s cybersecurity, and could mark a new frontier for cyberattacks. Bitcoin’s Rocky Start. Before Bitcoin became a mainstay on Wall Street, hacks targeting the cryptocurrency were hardly uncommon. In 2014, the Bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox, which handled about 75 percent of all Bitcoin transactions, was hacked, resulting in the loss of 850,000 coins — a tally worth approximately $47 billion at current Bitcoin valuations. The subsequent collapse of the exchange almost killed Bitcoin, as the currency lost some 80 percent of its value. But while rival exchanges saw massive sell orders, the dominant cryptocurrency has rebounded, reaching new highs in the past year."

Beginning in the ’80s, before Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was even born, there were four “Colored Girls” trailblazing in Democratic politics — the Reverend Leah Daughtry, the historic campaign manager Donna Brazile, the Clinton whisperer Minyon Moore and the Democratic National Committee exec Yolanda Caraway. Together, the fearsome foursome (co-authors of For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Politics) have met for weekly dinners in Washington, D.C., since the early 2000s — and along the way reshaped American politics, emerging from the civil rights era to help elect the first Black president and shape his rhetoric on race. And in recent weeks, the critical Democratic operatives were pushing behind the scenes for the woman who ended up as Joe Biden’s vice presidential pick: Kamala Harris.     [Black women] know how to lead; we’ve been doing it for years and it’s time for us to get the credit.     Leah Daughtry “I just think she’s been tested on the national stage … and she’s whip smart,” says Caraway in the latest episode of The Carlos Watson Show, hosted by the OZY co-founder and CEO. Harris, the former California attorney general and sitting U.S. senator, ran for president but dropped out in December while facing low polls and fundraising numbers. With her clear eye on the White House — and past cutting attacks on Biden — some Biden allies criticized Harris during the VP search process for her ambition, a line of attack Daughtry finds “really quite ugly.” “It just reminds us how far we as women, we as Black women have to go to be seen as equal. What’s wrong with a little ambition? We’re talking about a business that is all about ambition,” Daughtry says. And Brazile, a two-time DNC chair who made history as the first Black woman to lead a presidential campaign with Al Gore in 2000, points out that Black women make up a critical part of the Democrats’ winning coalition: “Because of our civic participation … we are the future of the Democratic Party.” The four Democratic operatives gave insight into the VP search process, with both Brazile (Gore, in 2000) and Moore (Hillary Clinton, in 2016) having personal experience. Scores of lawyers and accountants investigate the potential nominees, Brazile says, and once it was down to three candidates, the top campaign staff weighed in. Ultimately, it is always the candidate’s choice. “At the end of the day, at 4:30 in the morning, I had no idea he was going to choose Joe Lieberman,” Brazile says. Moore says the Clinton search was similar, and that Elizabeth Warren and Cory Booker were both finalists. “If it would have been [the search committee’s] choice, we probably would have said Cory Booker,” Moore says, but she believed Clinton “was just trying to calm the ticket down” with the uncontroversial Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. The four also talked about Black feminism, particularly with the backdrop of national racial justice protests. Daughtry says the marches have revived a conversation about what “good allies” look like. “We see our white sisters willing to have the hard conversations,” she says, a comment that causes Moore to chime in that those same women should have “kicked in” in 2016. “It kicked in for Black women. We saw a qualified white woman,” Moore says. Then “the numbers started rolling in. And we discovered that [52] percent of white women decided that she wasn’t good enough.” “For a long time, Black women have been leading, but we’ve been leading from the back as we push other people forward,” Daughtry says. “And now we are at an age and in an age where Black women are taking their place out front … not because other people can’t do it, but because we know how to lead, we’ve been doing it for years and it’s time for us to get the credit.” With Harris now cemented on the ticket, the credit is coming due."
272,American Fringes: How the Extremes Define Our Society,-8.33,36.67,https://www.ozy.com/news-and-politics/american-fringes-qanon-microchips-antifa/336012,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2020-07-27,www.ozy.com,25,"In 1984, a prize horse owned by the president of Destron Fearing, a Minnesota-based animal identification company, was stolen. Frustrated, he came up with a solution: an implantable chip that could help identify and recapture stolen animals. After hitting the market in the 1990s, the chip became a huge hit: Some 10 billion versions of the chip were used globally in 2018 alone, found in everything from lost pets to subway cards, electronic tolls and clothing retailers trying to prevent shoplifting.   But that horse theft had another, if unintended, effect. On the eve of the new millennium, the evangelical fundamentalist Kent Hovind published a book online titled Unmasking the False Religion of Evolution. He was followed by Katherine Albrecht, a Christian consumer advocate who wrote the 2005 title Spychips. And as credit cards and wireless payment methods have exploded, doomsayers have migrated from print to platforms like Facebook and YouTube, all warning the same general message: that soon the United States and other world governments will use the chip to track every man, woman and child without their permission. It’s a modern manifestation of the “Mark of the Beast” described in the apocalyptic Book of Revelation as a “mark on their right hands or foreheads” that would keep Christians from buying or selling goods and, in essence, participating in society.  Why does any of this matter now? Because in the last few months, the chip conspiracy has spiraled into an edition tailor-made for 2020; the conspiracy theory that billionaires like Bill Gates are using the COVID-19 pandemic, and an eventual vaccine, as a cover to implant millions of unwitting Americans with a chip containing the mark of the beast. It’s just one of the pseudoscience beliefs used to radicalize Americans against social distancing and health guidelines meant to help curb the spread of the coronavirus and save lives. And in case those conspiracists may seem like a small subset of society, consider this: a Yahoo News/YouGov poll conducted in May found that 44 percent of Republicans believe the Gates-microchip conspiracy to be true, as do nearly a fifth of Democrats and almost a quarter of Independents.      Many fringe movements throughout history eventually merge into the mainstream, a process that used to take decades but has been accelerated. Which is to say that America is now occupied territory. The proof begins in the names that form their own amber waves of grain across this strange fruited plain. The killed: George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and a haunted ledger over the decades. The wounded: countless protesters who have lost their eyes or limbs; journalists arrested, pepper-sprayed, shot at by police; those who saw their livelihoods battered by a pandemic and then burned down by looters; those who couldn’t hold the hands of, or bury, their 138,000 dead loved ones, and more, tomorrow.  However, America’s invaders aren’t foreign forces, despite the country’s recent obsession with Russian and Chinese interference. The enemy from within is neither the media, nor the boogeyman deep state, but rather those among us who are warring to make extremist ideologies commonplace. They are the American fringes. And they are quickly becoming the America of tomorrow.  Consider the scene from Baltimore, just two months ago. As cities like Chicago and Minneapolis saw violent proceedings, thousands gathered in the Charm City for a third day of overwhelmingly peaceful marches — a stark contrast to the Freddie Gray protests that lit much of north Baltimore aflame in 2015, and that still burden the city’s most vulnerable communities. “Power. Transformation. Miracles. I need it. I gotta have it. Right now,” a woman said over a megaphone, a chant that would be just as welcome in a Bible study group as it was at that Black Lives Matter rally. Still, there were other messages, some more aggressive and certainly stranger considering their historical context. In the middle of the procession, a black sedan carried its own messages in bright orange lettering: “BLM” plastered on the driver’s side door and, across its hood, “ACAB,” standing for “All Cops Are Bastards,” a slogan initially popularized by white skinheads. “Because non-racist skinheads … may use this acronym as well as racist skinheads, it should be carefully judged in the context in which it appears,” the Anti-Defamation League says, while listing it as a “hate symbol.” The popularity of the slogan, which has been echoed online, raises a simple question: How does an extremist slogan that gained prominence in the 1970s from radical, sometimes white supremacist, skinheads, become a rallying cry for a popular, anti-racist African American civil rights movement today? The answer lies in the reality that many fringe movements throughout history eventually merge into the mainstream, a process that used to take decades but has been accelerated in recent years as the fringe finds a home in virtual communities.     That’s why QAnon supporters and alt-right types find themselves emboldened — because they are part of the president’s coalition.     University of Miami political scientist Joseph Uscinski Sure, that can be the case for well-considered public policy: Just four years ago, Medicare for All sat well outside the mainstream. Today it’s a major plank within the Democratic Party and is supported by a majority of the American public.  However, fringe ideas can just as often turn violent. In early June, a joint terrorism task group apprehended three members of the “Boogaloo” — a militant online movement of far-left and far-right members who wear Hawaiian shirts under body armor, bring assault rifles to rallies and believe a second civil war is imminent — for allegedly planning to incite violence at a Las Vegas protest. The loose coalition — some of whom believe Black people are inferior and should be shot, others who stand with Black Lives Matter activists out of a shared disdain for the police — began on the extremist forum 4chan before propagating in Facebook groups and Discord channels. By the end of June, the movement had claimed its first confirmed murder, after a boogaloo boy was charged with gunning down a police officer in Oakland while using peaceful protests as cover. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump and his allies have fixated on the actions of Antifa, a loosely organized group of left-leaning vigilantes who advocate for direct violence in their fight against those they perceive as fascists, often including the police. Although some viral videos show Antifa members smashing windows and looting, particularly those who dress in all black as part of the Black Bloc, it’s worth noting that even the FBI (an organization not fond of leftist instigators) has found no intelligence tying Antifa to violence at the George Floyd protests. Regardless of the direct involvement of their members in these recent rallies, Antifa’s influence is evident — many left-leaning activists have mimicked their rhetoric, particularly their anti-cop chants, making the argument that because their name stands for “anti-fascist,” the fringe movement can’t be so bad. Complicating things further, white supremacist groups have posed as antifa groups online to stoke fears and undermine protest groups — another example of how the battle over the most extreme elements of society is fought as much digitally as it is in the streets. Protests At Open Carry Rally At Kent State University There are countless other fringe groups fighting set to become the bedrock of future American values, from the Three Percenters — an anti-government paramilitary group named after the belief that just 3 percent of colonists took up arms against the British in the American Revolution — to QAnon, a group organized around the conspiracy theory that there is a deep-state plot against Trump and his supporters led by pedophile elites. The latter is particularly troubling in its recent rise in prominence, considering that there are now at least 11 Republican nominees for Congress this year who have expressed support for the baseless conspiracy, a few of whom are poised to potentially win.  Many of these groups have their roots in the 2016 presidential election, when Trump openly courted voters outside of the mainstream. From leading the so-called birther movement that alleged President Barack Obama wasn’t actually born in the U.S. to tying GOP rival Ted Cruz’s father to the assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Trump frequently floated bogus conspiracy theories and embraced the fringe. “Now he has to dance with the one that brought him to the prom, so he continues with this rhetoric,” says University of Miami political scientist Joseph Uscinski, who studies mass media with a focus on conspiracy theories. According to a New York Times analysis published in late 2019, Trump retweeted accounts that peddle conspiracy theories, including QAnon, on at least 145 occasions. “That’s why QAnon supporters and alt-right types find themselves emboldened — because they are part of the president’s coalition,” Uscinski says. As the American fringes become more important than ever, OZY will spend the coming months investigating these groups as they fight to become the mainstream of tomorrow. We will look at the Michigan Militia and other gun-rights groups whose rallies against COVID-19 shutdowns have drawn global attention. We will surf the Intellectual Dark Web, a group of classically left-leaning professors and intellectuals fighting against what they see as a culture allowing politically correct rhetoric to supersede science. And we will look at the ways that extremist ideologies have infiltrated our public institutions, including the police, to help precipitate this era of conflict. In profiling these fringes, our goal is not to praise or condemn. Rather, it is to shed light on the forces battling for the attention and, ultimately, the hearts and minds of the American people. The final stanza of the Matthew Arnold poem “Dover Beach” describes society as “on a darkling plain, Swept with confused alarms of struggle and flight, where ignorant armies clash by night.” Only through understanding these strange, clashing forces can the extremist occupation of America end.

273,A Proud Belarusian’s Heartbreak,-0.33,40.33,https://www.ozy.com/news-and-politics/a-proud-belarusians-heartbreak/370831,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2020-08-18,www.ozy.com,25,"Because millions of Belarusians are watching with fear, hope and bated breath as protests unfold back home. This op-ed was not in OZY’s pipeline a week ago. Nor was it written by our usual editorial team. I’m dedicating this to the young nation of Belarus, the small, landlocked country in Eastern Europe that has been rocked by police violence after the authoritarian incumbent president, Alexander Lukashenko, claimed a landslide election victory widely viewed by the public as rigged. Nine days later, Belarus is besieged by a horrific level of violence, including more than 6,000 arrests and at least two confirmed deaths. Many more are likely being covered up by officials.     The popular myth that Belarusians simply aren’t strong enough to stand up for themselves has been debunked.  As a Belarusian citizen, my heart hurts, and my soul is tired. For several days, I watched in dismay as peaceful protesters calling for a recount were met with black-clad riot police wielding stun grenades and rubber bullets. Yesterday, I spent hours talking to some of the victims and their relatives, collecting True Stories of people who were directly affected, stories of broken bones, threats of rape, military trucks turned into gas chambers, sophisticated torture techniques and never-ending beatings. Belarus, which was the main Nazi-Soviet battleground for years, saw every fourth Belarusian die during World War II. Today, I am hearing comparisons between the methods of the Belarusian riot police and those of the Nazis’. This is not surprising to me, as Lukashenko has made security the top priority throughout his 26-year tenure as the country’s president and Europe’s longest-serving ruler, regularly arresting and imprisoning democratic activists and pro-Western leaders. The results are a puppet Parliament, censorship, firm centralization of business activities and finances, and the lack of an independent judicial system. Well, the day of reckoning has arrived. “We, the Belarusians, are peaceful people.” So goes the opening line to Belarus’ national anthem. These words summarize the nation’s spirit at its best. A week and a half into what has become the most widespread protests against the existing political order, you don’t see broken windows or burned-out cars. Instead, families march with young children, dressed in white, roses in their arms. The global Belarusian diaspora stands arm in arm with those back home. The violence unleashed by Lukashenko backfired. The police have retreated, but it may be too late for the president. The popular myth that Belarusians simply aren’t strong enough to stand up for themselves has been debunked. And now that patience and tolerance have run out, the country’s problems of economic stagnation, mishandling of the coronavirus crisis and the human rights violations have led to increasing demands for new leadership. Such is my hope. Stanislav Zmachynski is the head of finance for OZY Media"
274,A Blue Texas Runs Through This Valley,-1.0,40.33,https://www.ozy.com/news-and-politics/a-blue-texas-runs-through-this-valley/324011,https://adfontesmedia.com/ozy-bias-and-reliability-2/,2020-07-29,www.ozy.com,25,"Because if Beto had performed here as well as Hillary did, Texas might already be blue. The Rio Grande Valley is a place often forgotten or passed over. In pre-pandemic times, retirees (the so-called Winter Texans) and college kids would pass through on their way to cheap medicine and surgeries or spring break revelry south of the border. Now, the region with disproportionately poor, rural, majority-minority communities is being ravaged by the coronavirus. But Texas politicians avoid it at their peril: The valley is emerging as a crucial battleground for Democrats hoping to paint the (famously red) state blue in November. Polls are showing Joe Biden and Donald Trump neck and neck in the state. To see the valley’s electoral importance, all one has to do is look at the Senate race here in 2018, when Democrat Beto O’Rourke lost to Republican incumbent Ted Cruz by just 3 percentage points. “What people don’t realize is that [O’Rourke] underperformed Hillary Clinton levels in the Rio Grande Valley. If he had the Hillary 2016 vote there, and continued with the suburban push he got, he would have had enough votes to flip the state,” says Abhi Rahman, communications director of the Texas Democratic Party. “It’s kind of how you win Texas.” And there’s a huge tranche of available votes: The four core Rio Grande Valley counties all had voter turnout of 46 percent or less in 2016, putting them near the bottom of the country. That’s according to an exclusive county-by-county analysis of voter turnout across America for OZY’s “Who Cares?” project, in partnership with data firm 0ptimus. Hidalgo, Willacy, Starr and Cameron counties all ranked in the bottom 10 percent of America’s 3,000-plus counties when it comes to voter turnout in each of the last four election cycles. “Brownsville [in Cameron County] has always been bottom of the barrel when it comes to resources,” says Kim Hunter, an immigration lawyer who works in the area. “Everything about the valley is so isolated.”     The people being missed in previous elections were disproportionately Democrats and disproportionately people of color. And a huge portion of them are in the Rio Grande Valley.     Hudson Cavanagh, data director, Texas Democratic Party In March, before the COVID-19 pandemic began gripping the nation, Democrats spoke about their plans to target the valley. The state party had already done a public outreach campaign during the primary, using Spanglish mailers for the first time — leaning into the local dialect fusing English and Spanish. They were planning to field 1,000 staffers across the state in November, with at least a fifth of them being in the Rio Grande Valley. Those specific numbers could change by the fall, depending on how social distancing guidelines alter campaign tactics. Still, the party has also invested in a voter targeting model to fill in the gaps where the national party database is lacking, and it has a valley emphasis too. “It’s the first time a state party has built a machine-learning model like this,” says Hudson Cavanagh, data director for the Texas Democratic Party. “The people being missed in previous elections were disproportionately Democrats and disproportionately people of color. And a huge portion of them are in the Rio Grande Valley.” The Democratic National Committee has named Texas one of its top 10 battleground states for the 2020 election, and has already tripled its investment in the state from four years ago. The Biden campaign recently started spending a bit of money on TV ads in Texas as it seeks to expand the electoral map. But it remains a massive undertaking, trying to turn out low-propensity voters in a state that takes 12 hours to drive across. That task becomes even more difficult when trying to reach valley voters who often have less access to quality home internet or face significant language barriers. Republicans continue to dominate the scene in the state. And they’re working hard to paint Democrats such as Biden and MJ Hegar — who won the nomination last week to face Republican Sen. John Cornyn — as too extreme for the state. “They stand for far-left ideas like government-run health care, taking away our right to self-defense, and taxing policies which would kill the Texas economy,” Republican Party of Texas Chairman James Dickey said after the March presidential primary election. There’s also a nagging polling concern for Biden that is particularly acute here: He isn’t performing as well as Clinton did among Latino voters. Hidalgo, Willacy, Starr and Cameron counties are all at least 88 percent Latino. For Democrats, winning Texas at the presidential level for the first time since 1976 would be icing on the electoral college cake — it would mean Biden already won big — but it would represent an existential crisis for Republicans, given its 38 (and growing) electoral votes. And the path runs through this forgotten valley."
321,President Trump and first lady test positive for COVID-19,-3.33,51.67,https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/president-trump-and-first-lady-test-positive-for-covid-19,https://adfontesmedia.com/pbs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-10-05,www.pbs.org,25,"WASHINGTON (AP) — President Donald Trump said early Friday that he and first lady Melania Trump have tested positive for the coronavirus, a stunning announcement that plunges the country deeper into uncertainty just a month before the presidential election. Trump, who has spent much of the year downplaying the threat of a virus that has killed more than 205,000 Americans, said he and Mrs. Trump were quarantining. The White House physician said the president is expected to continue carrying out his duties “without disruption” while recovering. Still, Trump’s diagnosis was sure to have a destabilizing effect in Washington and around the world, raising questions about how far the virus had spread through the highest levels of the U.S. government. Hours before Trump announced he had contracted the virus, the White House said a top aide who had traveled with him during the week had tested positive. “Tonight, @FLOTUS and I tested positive for COVID-19. We will begin our quarantine and recovery process immediately,” Trump tweeted just before 1 a.m. “We will get through this TOGETHER!” Vice President Mike Pence tested negative for the virus on Friday morning and “remains in good health,” his spokesman said. Trump was last seen by reporters returning to the White House on Thursday evening and did not appear visibly ill. Trump is 74 years old, putting him at higher risk of serious complications from a virus that has infected more than 7 million people nationwide. The president’s physician said in a memo that Trump and the first lady, who is 50, “are both well at this time” and “plan to remain at home within the White House during their convalescence.” The diagnosis marks a devastating blow for a president who has been trying desperately to convince the American public that the worst of the pandemic is behind them. In the best of cases, if he develops no symptoms, which can include fever, cough and breathing trouble, it will likely force him off the campaign trail just weeks before the election and puts his participation in the second presidential debate, scheduled for Oct. 15 in Miami, into doubt. Trump’s handling of the pandemic has already been a major flashpoint in his race against Democrat Joe Biden, who spent much of the summer off the campaign trail and at his home in Delaware because of the virus. Biden has since resumed a more active campaign schedule, but with small, socially distanced crowds. He also regularly wears a mask in public, something Trump mocked him for at Tuesday night’s debate. “I don’t wear masks like him,” Trump said of Biden. “Every time you see him, he’s got a mask. He could be speaking 200 feet away from me, and he shows up with the biggest mask I’ve ever seen.” There was no immediate comment from the Biden campaign on whether the former vice president had been tested since appearing at the debate with Trump or whether he was taking any additional safety protocols. Trump and Biden did not shake hands during the debate, but stood without masks about 10 feet apart for the 90-minute event. World leaders offered the president and first family their best wishes after their diagnosis, as governments used their case as a reminder for their citizens to wear masks and practice social distancing measures. On Friday, Trump had been scheduled to receive an intelligence briefing, attend a fundraiser and hold another campaign rally in Sanford, Florida. But just after 1 a.m., the White House released a revised schedule with only one event: a phone call on “COVID-19 support to vulnerable seniors.” Trump’s announcement came hours after he confirmed that Hope Hicks, one of his most trusted and longest-serving aides, had been diagnosed with the virus Thursday. Hicks began feeling mild symptoms during the plane ride home from a rally in Minnesota on Wednesday evening, according to an administration official who spoke on condition of anonymity to disclose private information. She was isolated from other passengers aboard the plane, the person said. Hicks had been with Trump and other senior staff aboard Marine One and Air Force One en route to that rally and had accompanied the president to Tuesday’s presidential debate in Cleveland, along with members of the Trump family. The Trump contingent removed their masks during the debate, in violation of the venue rules. Multiple White House staffers have previously tested positive for the virus, including Vice President Mike Pence’s press secretary, Katie Miller, national security adviser Robert O’Brien and one of the president’s personal valets. But Trump has consistently played down concerns about being personally vulnerable, even after White House staff and allies were exposed and sickened. Since the coronavirus emerged earlier this year, Trump has refused to abide by basic public health guidelines — including those issued by his own administration — such as wearing face coverings in public and practicing social distancing. Instead, he has continued to hold campaign rallies that draw thousands of often mask-less supporters. “I felt no vulnerability whatsoever,” he told reporters back in May. The news was sure to rattle an already shaken nation still grappling with how to safely reopen the economy without driving virus transmission. The White House has access to near-unlimited resources, including a constant supply of quick-result tests, and still failed to keep the president safe, raising questions about how the rest of the country will be able to protect its workers, students and the public as businesses and schools reopen. U.S. stock futures fell on the news of Trump’s diagnosis. Questions remain about why it took so long for Trump to be tested and why he and his aides continued to come to work and travel after Hicks fell ill. Trump traveled to New Jersey on Thursday for a fundraiser, potentially exposing attendees to the virus. Trump’s social media director Dan Scavino and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who were originally set to join him on the trip, were replaced at the last minute by other aides. It is unclear where the Trumps and Hicks may have caught the virus, but in his Fox interview, Trump seemed to suggest it may have been spread by someone in the military or law enforcement. “It’s very, very hard when you are with people from the military or from law enforcement, and they come over to you, and they want to hug you, and they want to kiss you,” he said, “because we really have done a good job for them. And you get close. And things happen.” The White House began instituting a daily testing regimen for the president’s senior aides after earlier positive cases close to the president. Anyone in close proximity to the president or vice president is also tested every day, including reporters. Yet since the early days of the pandemic, experts have questioned the health and safety protocols at the White House and asked why more wasn’t being done to protect the commander in chief. Trump continued to shake hands with visitors long after public health officials were warning against it, and he initially resisted being tested. Trump is far from the first world leader to test positive for the virus, which previously infected Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who spent a week in the hospital, including three nights in intensive care. Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi was hospitalized last month while fighting what he called a “hellish” case of COVID-19. While there is currently no indication that Trump is seriously ill, the positive test raises questions about what would happen if he were to become incapacitated due to illness. The Constitution’s 25th Amendment spells out the procedures under which the president can declare himself “unable to discharge the powers and duties” of the presidency. If he were to make that call, Trump would transmit a written note to the Senate president pro tempore, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. Pence would serve as acting president until Trump transmitted “a written declaration to the contrary.” The vice president and a majority of either the Cabinet or another body established by law can also declare the president unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office, in which case Pence would “immediately assume the powers and duties of the office as Acting President” until Trump could provide a written declaration to the contrary. Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this report."
327,"Iraqi Navy SEAL Interpreter 'Code Name Johnny Walker' to Gain Citizenship, Reveal His Real Name",24.0,30.5,https://pjmedia.com/tyler-o-neil/2019/03/19/iraqi-navy-seal-interpreter-code-name-johnny-walker-to-gain-citizenship-reveal-his-real-name-n64475,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,pjmedia.com,25,"In a PJ Media exclusive, the Iraqi native turned Navy SEAL interpreter and bestselling author who goes by the code name “Johnny Walker” told his story and made a huge announcement: he will receive his U.S. citizenship on Wednesday morning! At that time, he will also reveal his real name. (This article will be updated with that name when it becomes public.) “It’s a big honor,” Walker told PJ Media. He is looking forward to posting videos of the ceremony and predicted a beautiful moment where “people from different backgrounds and different religions” will be united by loyalty to the United States. Walker was born and grew up in Iraq and he started working with the U.S. military after the invasion began in 2003. He worked as an interpreter — called a “terp” — until 2009. That year, the military finally cleared him and his family to come to America. While he lived in Iraq, he kept his work for the U.S. military a secret. If he had been exposed, it could have cost him his life. Since he will receive his citizenship Wednesday, however, Walker and his family will finally be safe, so he can go public with his name. (The Johnny Walker code name came from the Iraqi-American’s love for Johnnie Walker whiskey.) In 2014, Johnny Walker released a bestselling book, Code Name: Johnny Walker: The Extraordinary Story of the Iraqi Who Risked Everything to Fight with the U.S. Navy SEALs. In his interview with PJ Media on Tuesday, Walker explained how the American dream entered his imagination. When he was a kid, his parents encouraged him to play basketball to let out some of his youthful energy. “I started to love it,” Walker told PJ Media. “I started watching the Harlem team [the Globetrotters], listened to Country music, watched John Wayne movies.” “It gave me the American dream in my mind, built it in my imagination,” the Iraqi-American said. When the U.S. military came to Iraq in 2003, he saw Americans as a liberating force. “The SEALS were targeting bad guys in my city I didn’t know about. They came thousands of miles to clean my city and I was born in this city,” Walker told PJ Media. “I was disappointed in myself.” He suggested he didn’t take sides. “I didn’t support American or Iraqi or anyone, I supported the good side versus the bad side,” the Iraqi-American said. He saw the damage Al Qaeda and the Islamic State (ISIS) left behind. “They will destroy us. They are the enemy of human beings.” Walker told PJ Media he saw signs of ISIS even before Americans arrived in 2003. As the U.S. military fought insurgents, he saw the moral differences between the terrorists and what he saw as the forces of civilization. “When we caught the bad guys and I saw the weapons — the C-4, the dynamite, the RPGs — all of it is against humanity, there is no future beyond it,” he said. Walker recalled a conversation with a captured terrorist. “I asked him, ‘Why are you doing that? The Americans can help us to be like Germany and Japan.’ He had no answer besides, ‘We have to kill them and everyone like them.’ Killing is not how you build a nation. Civilization collapsed because of savagery and killing,” he told PJ Media. When a terrorist is “so savage he wants to kill kids, the human being in you is going to push you to do the right thing to protect kids.” Al Qaeda, ISIS, and the insurgents do not represent Islam in his mind — they represent evil. Johnny Walker doesn’t see his support for the Americans as a betrayal of his country or its people. “Navy SEALS fought for the right reason, to free these people from dictators,” he said. “I’m not against my people. Al Qaeda and ISIS are not f**king my people. They’re savages. They want nothing.” He said it would be absurd for someone to demand that a white man support the mosque shooter because he is white. “Why do you not support your people?” Walker jokingly asked. John Shattuck, a former Navy airman and president of the real estate firm Advanced Appraising, told PJ Media he helped “Johnny Walker” finally get his citizenship. In fact, he said, “Johnny Walker introduced me to Keith Barry.” Last September, Navy SEAL Keith Barry was finally acquitted after serving years in the Naval Consolidated Brig (a military prison) for being falsely convicted in a rape case. Shattuck had wanted to meet Walker for some time, and it was a fascinating coincidence that he met Barry at the same time. Shattuck described Walker as a true American hero. “He’s a guy that would give his life for any guy on the team. He would love to be a citizen, but he was focusing on his family more than himself,” Shattuck said. He also said Walker was an unusual “terp,” because he knew how to handle a firearm. Shattuck has done some hostage negotiation work and he is well connected, so he decided to do what he could to get this Iraqi-American hero his long-denied citizenship. “I do not have a law background. What I have is a south-side Chicago common sense background,” he told PJ Media. “I got the right people to listen. That’s all I ever do.” Shattuck also said he also helped Keith Barry overturn his conviction. He also helped free Americans from prison in Haiti. Shattuck told Walker not to worry but to compile his paperwork. “Lots of folks were attesting to his character — it’s incredible what was in there,” he said. “I took his paperwork to the Pentagon, I got it to the right people.” “If you think about a Johnny Walker that has been vetted to the Nth degree — you know who he is. How much more do you need to vet him?” Shattuck asked. He also noted that the Iraqi-American “could never go back to Iraq, because if he did, they would kill him. In his interview with PJ Media, “Johnny Walker” freely called Iraq a “sh*thole country,” but expressed love for the people. “Iraq needs a new government,” Walker said. “The people in Iraq, they are amazing. But they have no option but to live under dictators or corrupt government.” He also lamented the unnecessary divisions between Sunni and Shia Muslims. They coexist in his own family! “I am Sunni, she is Shia,” he said of his wife. “We get married and after 6, 7, 8 years I told her, can I talk with my kids? I need to ask them something specific. I told them, ‘Hey guys, we can have a vote: who’s going to be Sunni and who’s going to be Shia?'” “If I have Allah, the Quran, and Mohammed, why do I worry about any other sources?” Walker asked. “After that is just a political agenda. I consider that bulls**t.” But that political bulls**t continues to wreak havoc on the Middle East. “Right now, Iran destroyed all the countries around her because they want to export Islamic Revolution to those countries,” he said. This Iraqi-American had a few political ideas as well. He is a big fan of President Donald Trump’s wall. “The wall, it’s something personal. I don’t want to have AK-47s every time I take my kids to school,” Walker told PJ Media. “I’m not against immigrants, there are thousands better than me. But I am against people who have no background check, who are smuggling across the border. We don’t know whether those guys have a criminal record or not, all we know is that they use kids to get what they want.” Both Shattuck and Johnny Walker agreed that foreign interpreters who risk their lives in helping the U.S. military should have a fast-track to citizenship. “For me and a lot of people who worked with Americans, fought with Americans, want the American dream — I think America should give them something special,” Walker told PJ Media. Update March 20 at 12:36 p.m.: Johnny Walker got his citizenship this morning! And his real name is Riyadh Ahmed Khalaf Al Ahmady. He goes by “Riyadh.” Follow Tyler O’Neil, the author of this article, on Twitter at @Tyler2ONeil."
328,Kirsten Gillibrand Wants Gov't to Decide How Many Painkillers You're Allowed to Get,18.0,24.0,https://pjmedia.com/trending/kirsten-gillibrand-is-a-pain/,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,pjmedia.com,25,"Nine years ago last month, I was struck down while crossing the street in Washington, D.C. My knee was shattered and I ended up needing two major surgeries and many months of physical therapy. All told, it was 18 months before I was able to walk again unaided. And the whole time, I was in severe pain, often excruciating. I wouldn’t have gotten through that ordeal without pain medication. At various stages I was taking Dilaudid, OxyContin, or Vicodin. I hated the side effects, like nausea and confusion and sweating, and I was worried about getting hooked. But I didn’t. As the pain eased, my doctors lowered the dosage until I didn’t need it anymore. My knee still hurts, pretty much every day, but it’s manageable. Pain medication helped me get through the worst thing that ever happened to me, and then I walked away from it. Literally. So whenever I see meddling politicians trying to take those decisions away from me because other people make the wrong decisions, I get really angry.     If we want to end the opioid epidemic, we must work to address the root causes of abuse. That’s why @SenCoryGardner and I introduced legislation to limit opioid prescriptions for acute pain to 7 days. Because no one needs a month’s supply for a wisdom tooth extraction.     — Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (@gillibrandny) March 15, 2019 So people who are genuinely in pain need to suffer, just because Kirsten Gillibrand wants to be president? As with just about everything Gillibrand says, this directly contradicts her past rhetoric. She used to hold a much different view about who should be responsible for such decisions:     pic.twitter.com/Y6o7qWCBYZ     — BT (@back_ttys) March 19, 2019 “Keep Your Laws Off My Body” only counts when a woman wants to kill her baby before it inconveniences her. You want government-run healthcare? This is what it looks like. People you’ll probably never meet in your entire life, who don’t know anything about you, will decide how much pain you get to live with. Kirsten Gillibrand is never going to be POTUS, and she’s never going to be my doctor."
329,Poll: TV Viewers Are Tired of Saturday Night Live's Political Obsession,21.0,28.5,https://pjmedia.com/trending/poll-tv-viewers-are-tired-of-saturday-night-lives-political-obsession/,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,pjmedia.com,25,"While many Americans were busy quaffing green beer last Sunday for St. Patrick’s Day, our teetotaling president was expressing his displeasure about a once-funny American entertainment institution:     It’s truly incredible that shows like Saturday Night Live, not funny/no talent, can spend all of their time knocking the same person (me), over & over, without so much of a mention of “the other side.” Like an advertisement without consequences. Same with Late Night Shows……     — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 17, 2019 As the weekly target of Saturday Night Live’s “humor,” President Trump’s disgruntlement with the show is understandable. According to a new poll conducted by The Hollywood Reporter and Morning Consult, however, it isn’t just him who has grown weary of SNL’s shtick. The poll found that 39 percent of the respondents feel that SNL is now “too political.” Almost half of the sample feel that the show in its present incarnation is “more liberal,” while five percent of those polled live in some Bizarro world where they feel it’s “more conservative.” The relentless focus on politics in late-night comedy is certainly tedious. Jay Leno recently lamented that very thing in an interview. The real problem though is that most of it isn’t funny. Political humor is difficult to do well at all, and it is nigh on impossible to pull off consistently, especially when focusing on the same subject. SNL and the weeknight late shows got lazy when Barack Obama became president. His Lightbringer status among the liberal media made him untouchable as a target for humor. What happened as a result was that they essentially just recycled variations of the same “Sarah Palin is dumb” joke for eight years even though she wasn’t in office. If you were to record three weeks’ worth of Kimmel, Colbert, Fallon, and SNL right now you’d see that it’s pretty much the same Trump “joke” every night too. The jokes aren’t really jokes either; they’re just liberal attack talking points that get applause. To be sure, the president isn’t off limits when it comes to cracking jokes on television. He isn’t the only source of entertainment in politics, however. As I wrote last week, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is an almost nonstop gaffe generator. It wouldn’t take me more than an hour to write three skits about her myself. If I were collaborating with others they’d almost write themselves. I am old enough to remember when humor was the primary objective on Saturday Night Live. Yes, that was a while ago. If that were still what they were after, they’d find plenty of non-presidential fodder for political humor. Sadly, the only goal now is to be a part of a relentless partisan media propaganda machine. They don’t want to entertain, they want to influence voters. It’s sad, it’s boring, and it alienates half the country. What will be entertaining is seeing their reactions should President Trump be re-elected."
330,Giant Rock Sculpture of Beto's Face Appears in Austin,12.0,28.25,https://pjmedia.com/trending/giant-rock-sculpture-of-betos-face-appears-in-austin/,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2019-03-19,pjmedia.com,25,"Ever since Hillary Clinton failed miserably and disappointed everybody who believed in her, Dems have been desperately seeking somebody to worship. Obama would be their perfect candidate in 2020, of course, but he can’t run again because of that pesky 22nd Amendment. They’re crazy about AOC, but she’s not old enough yet. (It’s always that damn Constitution thwarting their goals!) And none of the approximately 450 Democrats running next year have been very exciting. A lot of Dem voters really like Bernie, but he’s too cranky and mean. They’d vote for Biden, sure, but they’re not about to throw their panties on the stage for him. They really want to be swept off their feet. They want to devote themselves. They want to fall in love. So apparently they’ve settled on… Beto? Callum Patton, Newsweek: A giant earth artwork depicting 2020 Democratic presidential hopeful Beto O’Rourke has appeared north of Austin, Texas. The two acre design dubbed “Beto Earthwork” was created by Kansas artist Stan Herd, and is formed mostly from gravel, sand and rock… “We’re trying to tell the story of this amazing man from Texas making a difference in the national climate,” the artist explained. “This amazing man.” Yeah, I don’t see anybody building shrines to Kamala or Elizabeth or Amy or Kirsten. It really reminds you just how sexist this country really is, doesn’t it? Take a look at it, courtesy of the artist himself: The last time we heard about painted rocks in Texas, it was because we were supposed to care about the old name of a hunting camp owned by Rick Perry’s family. If Perry had been running for president as a Democrat, the press would’ve dismissed that story quicker than Beto’s DWI. Beto seems like a really weird guy to me. But then, so did Obama. And just as with Obama, all of Beto’s odd behavior and disconcerting foibles will just become part of the myth. The press insisted it was no big deal that Beto livestreamed a trip to the dentist, and they’re already racking their brains to excuse his habit of jumping up on restaurant countertops with his filthy feet. They’re projecting all their hopes and dreams onto him, and they’re not going to let reality spoil the party. I can’t wait until Beto and Kamala go head-to-head. Are white males the source of all our problems, or aren’t they? The cognitive dissonance is gonna be great! P.S. I also don’t like it when Republicans worship Trump, or any other politician. Even Mount Rushmore is kind of creepy, when you think about it. So if and when they start building graven monuments to Trump, I won’t like that either. Okay? Okay."
331,Why Is the Violent Gang Culture that Killed Nipsey Hussle Being Celebrated?,14.25,30.25,https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/why-is-the-violent-gang-culture-that-killed-nipsey-hussle-being-celebrated/,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-15,pjmedia.com,25,"Last Thursday, slain rapper Nipsey Hussle was mourned in a fashion fit for a distinguished statesman: a funeral attended by 21,000 people at the Staples Center in downtown Los Angeles, followed by a 25-mile procession, where thousands more thronged the route and showered the passing hearse with flowers and other mementos of devotion. The entire affair was streamed live on the internet, and as someone who once had a professional interest in Mr. Hussle and his associates, I checked in from time to time to see how things were progressing.  As the procession brought traffic to a standstill across large sections of South L.A., I couldn’t help but wonder how Aaron Shannon’s parents might be feeling if they had found themselves caught in the commotion. If he were alive today, Aaron Shannon would be 14 years old, and his parents, like those of many boys in certain parts of Los Angeles, would be doing their best to inoculate him against the gang culture that has brought so much death and misery to the city. How Aaron’s parents must wish they had to face that challenge today. But Aaron Shannon is not alive today, having been murdered in 2010 when he was just five years old. It was the afternoon of Halloween that year when Aaron, playing in his backyard and dressed in his Spider-Man costume, was shot in the head and killed by gang members seeking retribution for an earlier shooting. Aaron’s grandfather and uncle were also shot that day but survived. No one in the family was affiliated with a street gang. Indeed, one need not have any direct connection to gang culture to have that culture come exploding into one’s life as it did in Aaron’s case. It was his fate to live in the Florence area on the west side of Central Avenue while his killers lived on the east side. Strange as it may sound to people unfamiliar with gang life, that’s all it takes for two groups of people, who may be similar in every other observable way, to be blood enemies. Aaron’s neighborhood was (and still is) claimed by the East Side Mad Swan Bloods, while the neighborhood to the east is home to the Kitchen Crips. Which brings us back to Nipsey Hussle and his elaborate send-off. As the procession made its way through South Los Angeles, traveling on streets familiar to me through my years with the LAPD, I recalled times when I had stood on some of those very sidewalks only a few feet away from the covered body of some young person who minutes earlier had been shot and killed. In fact, if you examine the map that accompanies the Los Angeles Times’s Homicide Report, you can see that the procession’s route of travel, south on Vermont Avenue, then east on Century Boulevard to Watts, then back west on Century to the city of Inglewood and north to the parking lot on Slauson Avenue where Hussle was killed, you can see that it scarcely passed a single block that hadn’t seen at least one murder since January 1, 2000, when the Times’s homicide data begins. (Image via LA Times Homicide Report) And yet, as Nipsey Hussle was extolled as a local hero on Thursday, his membership in the Rollin’ 60s Neighborhood Crips was presented as something to be proud of, as though the gang were nothing but some kind of social welfare organization. It’s true that Hussle had invested in his neighborhood, operating a clothing store, a hamburger stand, and a barber shop, but whatever good may have flowed from those enterprises is far outweighed by the damage done by the Rollin’ 60s in the years since he joined the gang at age 14. Presented nearby is a map of the Hyde Park area of Los Angeles, home to the Rollin’ 60s. The map, created by the Los Angeles Times, contains 237 dots, each one representing a person killed in the area since January 2000. Nipsey Hussle is merely the most recent and most famous of these victims. Despite the gang’s opulent record of death and ruin, Nipsey Hussle boasted of his membership in the Rollin’ 60s, both in interviews and in the lyrics to his music. In doing so he merely followed the path of so many of his predecessors in the genre, which demands “authenticity” of its performers. This brand of authenticity requires embracing the gang life and rejecting such bourgeois conventions as staying in school, confining parenthood to married couples, and, dare I add, not shooting people for the offense of living in the wrong neighborhood. Sadly, even some who have lived bourgeois lives themselves can’t bring themselves to condemn the criminality that is integral to hip-hop music. Witness Michael Eric Dyson’s hagiographic tribute to Nipsey Hussle that appeared in the New York Times on April 12. In the piece, Dyson describes Hussle as, yes, a “ghetto saint,” and he recounts their “epic conversation” while seated together on a cross-country flight. “[Hussle’s] death is even more haunting,” writes Dyson, “because the love he showed took place against the backdrop of unsettling violence, both real and imagined, both in structural forces and intimate spaces, often conjured or measured by his own pen.” Note how gang violence is thus reduced to a “backdrop” to Nipsey Hussle’s saintly love rather than something he participated in and encouraged others to do so through his music. Just as disturbing is the letter Barack Obama sent to Hussle’s family. “While most folks look at the Crenshaw neighborhood where he grew up and see only gangs, bullets and despair,” Mr. Obama wrote, “Nipsey saw potential.” Again, it is indeed commendable that Hussle chose to invest some portion of his wealth in the Crenshaw community, but it is an insult to that same community when we ignore the fact that it was the Rollin’ 60s, of which Hussle remained a proud member to the day he died, that to a large degree brought about the neighborhood’s decline in the first place. In the end, despite his fame and wealth, Nipsey Hussle became another dot on the map, a victim of the gang life that produced him and which he exploited to make himself rich. I realize there are those who will find it unseemly that a white man who spent more than thirty years with the LAPD should dare to tarnish Saint Nipsey’s halo in this fashion. How can I possibly understand, they will ask. I understand all too well, actually, and I have no trouble remembering that those dots on the map, the ones who weren’t rich or famous, were real people, some of whom I saw take their last breaths. The gang culture that was celebrated at Nipsey Hussle’s funeral is a cancer in every community it touches, and it does no one a bit of good to forget it."
332,Trump Campaign Astonishes With $30 Million Fundraising Haul,16.0,33.0,https://pjmedia.com/trending/trump-campaign-astonishes-with-30-million-fundraising-haul/,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,pjmedia.com,25,"I don't think Donald Trump will be spending a lot of his own money to get re-elected. The Trump campaign reported to the FEC that they have raised a whopping $30.3 million for the January-March quarter. They also reported cash on hand of $40.8 million, swamping the president's nearest Democratic challenger, Bernie Sanders. “The president is in a vastly stronger position at this point than any previous incumbent president running for re-election, and only continues to build momentum,” said Trump re-election campaign manager Brad Parscale. Fox News:     Among the Democrats, Sanders is on top when it comes to the amount of cash raised and the amount of money in the bank. The Independent from Vermont, who’s making his second straight bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, reported raising $18.2 million, with $28 million cash on hand, having transferred money left over from his 2018 Senate re-election bid.     Sen. Kamala Harris of California reported raising $12 million. So did former Rep. John Delaney of Maryland, who’s considered a long-shot for the nomination. But $11.7 million of that haul was an infusion of cash from the candidate, who’s a self-made multi-millionaire.     Former Rep. Beto O’Rourke of Texas raised an eye-popping $9.4 million during the first 18 days of his campaign, with $6.1 million of the haul coming in the first 24 hours after declaring his candidacy. Trump filed for re-election the day he was inaugurated, giving him an enormous advantage over his rivals. But perhaps more significantly from a political standpoint, Donald Trump showed just who is the candidate of the ""little guy.""     The Trump campaign touted its small-dollar grassroots appeal, announcing that 98.79 percent of first-quarter contributions were $200 or less, and that the average donation to the campaign was $34.26.  Now perhaps some naysayers in the Republican Party will understand why the Democrats are being given only a 50-50 chance of beating Trump. By the time this race is over, Trump is likely to have raised more than double what he spent in 2016 to get elected. With Democrats locked in a death struggle between the various wings of their party, whichever candidate emerges as the nominee will likely be tapped out. Meanwhile, Trump will be running virtually unopposed and will be able to harness his resources and drop massive amounts of cash in battleground states, and maybe even pick off a blue state or two he narrowly lost in 2o16 -- like Minnesota. MPR:     Now President Trump sees the state as a personal challenge heading into the 2020 election, and his campaign is making it an early target.     No Republican presidential candidate has claimed the state's 10 Electoral College votes since Richard Nixon in 1972 — the longest blue streak in the United States.     Trump acknowledged the Democratic hold on Minnesota during a quick stop there Monday to tout his signature tax law.     ""This has been a very special state. It has been a rare victory for Republicans. And we almost won it,"" Trump said during a visit to a trucking company in Burnsville, a suburb of Minneapolis. He said the result would have been different if he had come more often: ""One more speech."" That may be, and he will certainly have a lot more money to put into the effort to flip the state in 2020. Trump's fundraising juggernaut is just getting started. Along with a massive organization of volunteers and paid staffers, the president will present a difficult challenge to any Democrat who wants to unseat him. "

According to the Census Bureau, there are 328.7 million people living in the United States. The latest national debt figures from the Treasury Department show that the national debt has surpassed $22 trillion, which represents more than $67,000 per person. In 2018, the IRS received 154,444,000 income tax returns, which means the debt per taxpayer currently equals $142,625. These figures do not include the amount of ""unfunded liabilities"" or ""promised benefits"" from Medicare and Social Security. According to some estimates, unfunded liabilities for Social Security total more than $12.5 trillion over the next 75 years. Medicare's unfunded obligations are currently projected to be $37 trillion over the same time period, according to the latest data."
334,Diabolical: Islam’s Past and Present Attacks on European Churches,25.0,24.25,https://pjmedia.com/faith/diabolical-islams-past-and-present-attacks-on-european-churches/,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2019-04-16,pjmedia.com,25,"As explained in this recent article, all around Western Europe, churches are under attack. Along with arson attempts, typically—and rather with diabolical intent—altars are desecrated, crucifixes broken, statues mocked and/or beheaded, and the churches set aflame. Sometimes fecal matter is smeared on the churches. Last February in France, for instance, vandals plundered and used human excrement to draw a cross on the Notre-Dame des Enfants Church in Nimes; consecrated bread was found thrown outside among garbage. One week later, vandals desecrated and smashed crosses and statues at Saint-Alain Cathedral in Lavaur; they mangled the arms of a crucified Christ in a mocking manner and an altar cloth was burned. While European authorities and media usually obfuscate over the identity of the desecrators, demographics offer a clue: true to “Islam’s Rule of Numbers,” Western European nations that have large Muslim migrant populations tend to witness the most attacks. Thus in France, which has one of if not the largest Muslim populations in Western Europe, two churches are attacked every day. The same situation prevails in Germany, which also has an immense Muslim population. In Bavaria and the Alps alone, some 200 churches have been attacked and many crosses broken: “Police are currently dealing with church desecrations again and again,” reads one November 2017 report, before it says, “The perpetrators are often youthful rioters with a migration background.” Before Christmas 2016, in the North Rhine-Westphalia region of Germany—where more than a million Muslims reside—some 50 public Christian statues (including of Jesus) were beheaded and crucifixes broken. In 2015, following the arrival of another million Muslim migrants to Dülmen, a local newspaper said “not a day goes by” without attacks on Christian statues. Numerical deductions aside, the fact is, the desecration of churches has for centuries been a Muslim trademark—a sort of “Islam was here.” As documented in my recent book, Sword and Scimitar: Fourteen Centuries of War between Islam and the West, whenever Muslims invaded Christian nations, untold thousands of churches were ritually desecrated and despoiled, their crosses and other Christian symbols systematically broken. Think what ISIS does but on an exponential level—and not for a handful of years but for over a millennium. The patterns between past and present attacks are virtually identical. Reminiscent of the recent drawing of a cross in fecal matter on a French church, in 1147 in Portugal, Muslims displayed “with much derision the symbol of the cross. They spat upon it and wiped the feces from their posteriors with it.” Decades earlier in Jerusalem, Muslims “spat on them [crucifixes] and did not even refrain from urinating on them in the sight of all.” Even that supposedly “magnanimous” sultan, Saladin, commanded “whoever saw that the outside of a church was white, to cover it with black dirt,” and ordered “the removal of every cross from atop the dome of every church in the provinces of Egypt” (all quotes from primary sources documented in Sword and Scimitar, pp. 171, 145, 162). From the start, the intentional, widespread, and systematic targeting of churches and other Christian symbols prompted some to see Muslim invaders as motivated by a diabolical animus. For Anastasius of Sinai (630–701), the heroes of the seventh-century Arab conquests of the then Christian-majority Middle East were “perhaps even worse than the demons.” After all, “the demons are frequently much afraid of the mysteries of Christ, I mean his holy body [the Eucharist], the cross... and many other things. But these demons of flesh trample all that under their feet, mock it, set fire to it, destroy it” (Sword and Scimitar, p. 27). Interestingly, nowadays, whenever a church attacker is exposed as a migrant, authorities and media try to downplay the incident by saying he is suffering from mental health issues (modern-day parlance for what was once seen as demonization). Others still rely on the more antiquated interpretation. During the memorial service for Father Hamel—an 85-year-old priest slaughtered by “Allahu Akbar” shouting Muslims while holding mass in his own church in France—Archbishop Dominique Lebrun called on those “who are tormented by diabolical violence, you who are drawn to kill by a demonic, murderous madness, pray to God to free you from the devil’s grip.” Before his murderer carved his throat, Fr. Hamel himself had reportedly shouted, “Be gone, Satan!” Considering the descriptions of some Muslim assailants, such “otherworldly” accusations are not farfetched. In France, April 2015, a Muslim man dressed in traditional Islamic garb damaged and desecrated more than 200 Christian gravestones and crosses in a cemetery (just as ISIS and other Muslim “radicals” are known to do in Libya, Iraq, Iran, and elsewhere). After he was apprehended, authorities said, “The man repeats Muslim prayers over and over, he drools and cannot be communicated with: his condition has been declared incompatible with preliminary detention.” Similarly, around Christmas 2016 in Italy, another Muslim migrant who said he “wanted to destroy Christian symbols” set a church nativity scene aflame. Police fought hard to restrain the man, who was described as suffering from a “visible psycho-physical crisis.” In other words, not much has changed: past and present, Muslims—motivated by what has long been deemed a diabolical animus—attacked and desecrated churches, crosses, and other Christian symbols. The only difference is that, whereas Europeans used to prevent them entry, and thus safeguarded their sacred sites, today they welcome them in with open arms. Note: For a comprehensive and well-documented overview of what Muslims did to churches throughout history, see Ibrahim’s book, Sword and Scimitar: Fourteen Centuries of War between Islam and the West"

True, they’ve had a few public moments of joy to celebrate the fact that they voted for a president who will require and extra Secret Service agent just to make sure he doesn’t choke on a toy from a Happy Meal, but Trump is still living rent-free in their heads. There are a variety of ways that the next four years of American presidential politics can play out but I think that the one thing we all agree on is that Joseph Robinette Biden will not be the President of the United States at the end of that time. Finally…a moment of unity. One of the first things I thought about at the end of last week when I began pondering what might happen if Trump were to lose was that he should go the full Grover Cleveland route and try to come back in 2024. Cleveland is the only two-term president to have served non-consecutive terms. Not long after joking about that, it became an “ask and ye shall receive” kind of thing for me. The Hill:     President Trump has told close advisers that he is considering running for president in the 2024 election, according to a report from Axios.     Trump has yet to concede defeat to Democrat Joe Biden in the 2020 election, but networks have projected the former vice president as the winner, as Trump would likely have to win a series of recounts in multiple states to win the election.     The president appears to have lost five states to Biden that he won in 2016, but he also piled up more total votes than he won in 2016, which has given him some clout within the GOP despite the loss.     If he decided to make another run for the White House in 2024, he would be the odds-on favorite in a GOP primary given his level of support among Republican voters. That’s what I’m talkn’ about! It would be a wonderful comeback story. I’ve read a couple of MSM articles that were speculating about Trump being empty and sad without the presidency, as if he didn’t have a business empire, a hot wife, and is own jet before getting elected. Both articles were so bad that I won’t link to them. I don’t think he’ll be empty, but I do think he’ll be annoyed about losing, as well he should be after this fiasco. And I think he likes a challenge. We see what kind of energy he has at age 74, there’s no reason to think he won’t be up to it at 78. The real reason I hope he keeps thinking about it and keeps the possibility afloat in the news is this: it will drive the Democrats and their flying monkeys in the mainstream media absolutely insane. Remember, these idiots think that they are about to vanquish their nemesis forever. If they keep thinking that the scariest monster under their bed hasn’t gone away, they’ll be too afraid to get up and go to the bathroom in middle of the night. Even if it’s one big troll job, it would be the greatest trolling yet by the man who trolls the Democrats better than anyone alive. Trump 2024, people. LET’S DO THIS.

346,5 Things to Know About Night 2 of the Democratic National Convention,22.25,30.25,https://pjmedia.com/election/tyler-o-neil/2020/08/18/5-things-to-know-about-night-2-of-the-democratic-national-convention-n807423,https://adfontesmedia.com/pj-media-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,pjmedia.com,25,"The Democratic National Convention (DNC) continued for a second night on Tuesday. PJ Media has been watching this not-exactly-prime television so you don’t have to. Check out our liveblogs from Monday night and last night, and follow us live on Wednesday and Thursday night. Without further ado, here’s a recap of the second night. 1. You weren’t watching? Neither were most Americans. The first night of the DNC on Monday was a snoozefest, and the ratings reflected that. According to The Hollywood Reporter, the common hour-plus coverage of the DNC on ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC averaged 18.68 million viewers, down about 28 percent compared to the opening night of the 2016 Democratic convention. The broadcast networks suffered the biggest drops: ABC, CBS, and NBC added up to 6.7 million viewers at 10 p.m., down from the 11.6 million who tuned in to those channels in 2016. Monday night featured Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Michelle Obama, and Govs. Andrew Cuomo (D-N.Y.) and Gretchen Whitmer (D-Mich.). If the ratings tanked so badly on the night featuring Bernie Sanders and Michelle Obama, why would they get better for night 2, which featured the star power of… Dr. Jill Biden? Yes, former President Jimmy Carter spoke — without video — and Bill Clinton also spoke, on the same day a viral photo showed him getting a message from one of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims (YIKES!). Sure, night 2 featured Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), but she complained that she’d only get 60 seconds to speak, and she did only speak for 96 seconds. Don’t worry, she smuggled in “colonization” into those seconds. What Planet Is He on? John Kasich Promises Moderates That ‘Decent’ Biden Won’t Turn ‘Sharp Left’ 2. Democrats nominated some candidate or whatever On Tuesday night, Joseph Robinette Biden, Jr., the former vice president and former senator from Delaware, officially became the Democratic nominee for president. Delegates from 50 states and 7 territories gave their support to Biden or Sanders. The nominations ran on interminably, but it was cool to see the different backgrounds. Since Democrats held a virtual convention due to the coronavirus pandemic, delegates from each state appeared in separate videos to nominate Joe Biden. Just watch the video without the sound on, and you can skip listening to the Democratic pablum.

No, AOC wasn’t un-endorsing Biden When AOC used her 60 seconds — sorry, 96 seconds — to endorse Sanders, many people on Twitter started scratching their heads. “Did AOC” started trending on Twitter as people wondered exactly what was happening.     AOC endorsed Bernie in her DNC speech!!!     Trump needs to send her a thank you note with a signed MAGA hat.     — Tim Young (@TimRunsHisMouth) August 19, 2020 The congresswoman herself cleared up the confusion. “If you were confused, no worries! Convention rules require roll call & nominations for every candidate that passes the delegate threshold. I was asked to 2nd the nom for Sen. Sanders for roll call,” AOC tweeted. “I extend my deepest congratulations to [Joe Biden] – let’s go win in November.” Of course, AOC got in as many woke buzzwords as she could in those 96 seconds. “Colonization” fit into those few seconds, of course.     .@AOC's full nomination speech for @BernieSanders at the #DemConvention #DNC2020 pic.twitter.com/ikEpnKF7AJ     — People for Bernie (@People4Bernie) August 19, 2020 Wait, Did AOC Just Excuse Murders and Burglaries in the Name of Social Justice? 4. Khizr Khan repeated Biden’s Charlottesville lie “Three years ago, my beloved city, Charlottesville, Virginia, was attacked by white supremacists and a young woman was killed. We were attacked again when Donald Trump praised those racists, turning his back on a community that just wanted peace,” Khan, who spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, said. “That was the day Joe Biden decided to join this battle for the soul of America,” Khan, a Muslim military veteran, added.

While the president did say there were “very fine people” on both sides, he also clarified: “I’m not talking about the neo-Nazis and the white nationalists, because they should be condemned totally – but you had many people in that group other than neo-Nazis and white nationalists, okay? And the press has treated them absolutely unfairly.” Liberals like Biden seized on the regrettable “very fine people” remark, completely ignoring the president’s clear condemnation of neo-Nazis and the white nationalists. Indeed, in his video announcing his candidacy for president, Biden accused Trump of having assigned “a moral equivalence between those spreading hate and those with the courage to stand against it.” Trump defended the “very fine people” remark, explaining that he meant to praise “people that went because they felt very strongly about the monument to Robert E. Lee, a great general. Whether you like it or not, he was one of the great generals. I’ve spoken to many generals here, right at the White House, and many people thought of the generals, they think that he was maybe their favorite general. People were there protesting the taking down of the monument of Robert E. Lee. Everyone knows that.” Trump Defends Charlottesville Remarks After Biden Attack: ‘Fine People’ Supported Robert E. Lee 5. Omitting “under God” from the pledge The Democratic National Convention recited the full Pledge of Allegiance — including that politically incorrect “under God” bit — but don’t worry, the Muslim Delegates & Allies Assembly moderator managed to cut it out of his recitation.     Kicking off the @JoeBiden/@DNC Muslim Delegates & Allies Assembly, moderator skips ""Under God"" while reciting The Pledge of Allegiance pic.twitter.com/oCia4ybFUo     — Chris Martin (@chrisjdmartin) August 18, 2020 Night 2 featured a good amount of God talk — from Jill Biden saying her husband believes in providence to an Episcopal woman priest giving the concluding prayer — but the Democrats’ increasing animosity toward conservative Christians remains strong. It seems odd that a Muslim break-out would be the DNC session to exclude God from the pledge. It’s not like Muslims don’t believe in a supreme being, they just refer to their monotheistic deity as “Allah.” Of course, Democrats would be the last to insist that the Christian God and Allah are totally different conceptions of God (even though they are), right?! Perhaps observant Muslims know better… Concluding thoughts: Jill Biden gave a surprisingly good speech, though Democrats are unlikely to take her message of love and unity to heart when it comes to the Republicans they demonize. The fact that Jimmy Carter would speak to a convention at 95 is impressive. Bill Clinton seemed rather old… perhaps the viral photo of him with a Jeffrey Epstein victim has aged him. AOC spoke at lightning speed. That’s a wrap for me! Join us Wednesday night and Thursday night for some liveblogging. On Wednesday, the key speaker is Sen. Kamala Harris (D-Calif.). On Thursday, it’s Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. himself. You’ll need a good stiff drink to watch Kamala, and a coffee to keep yourself from falling asleep when the nominee stutters his way through a speech on Thursday.

1075,Amnesty Loses to the Rule of Law,17.67,33.0,https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/09/amnesty-loses-to-the-rule-of-law/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-20,www.nationalreview.com,25,"The Senate parliamentarian’s rejection of Democrats’ amnesty push is a win for republican self-government.At a time of unprecedented breakdown and chaos at America’s southern border, Democrats were quietly hoping to include an amnesty package for some 8 million illegal immigrants in their filibuster-protected $3.5 trillion budget-reconciliation push. The move was an attempt to subvert one of the most fundamental aspects of the social contract, predicated on the dubious premise that sweeping immigration reforms were appropriate to the reconciliation’s intended fiscal purpose, carried out through a flouting of the institutional norms and decorum that Democrats have ostensibly held in such high esteem for the last four years. Thankfully, Senate parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough had the courage to stand firm against the effort, announcing in a three-page memo released to senators late Sunday evening that “provisions are not allowed in such bills if their budget effect is ‘merely incidental’ to their overall policy impact,” according to the Associated Press.The amnesty proposal itself was one of the most radical in American history, granting green cards and a potential path to citizenship for 8 million out of the approximately 11 million illegal residents in the United States — including those with criminal records — and significantly expanding legal immigration without even a symbolic mention of border security, to boot. Were it not for MacDonough, all of that could well have passed under the radar without hearings, floor debates, or in-committee votes.Despite Representative Ilhan Omar’s argument on Twitter that the parliamentarian’s ruling was “optional” and that Chuck Schumer and the White House “can and should ignore it,” the Democrats’ amnesty ambitions are likely dead, at least for now. That’s worth celebrating for a number of reasons. Not only is it a check on the Left’s abuses of Senate procedure but it’s a rebuke of what would almost certainly exacerbate the surge of migrants flooding over the southern border, much of which is driven by the widespread perception that America’s commitment to border security has weakened under the Biden administration.More to the point, the failure of the Democrats’ amnesty package is a win for the rule of law. There are few things more foundational to republican self-government than the integrity of the polity itself. It is impossible to sustain a nation with no clear, widely understood definition of what that nation is; political liberty cannot last for long in the face of the breakdown of civic friendship, which proceeds from uncontrolled immigration’s degradation of the very idea of citizenship itself. Our collective loyalties, shared loves, and mutual commitments come by virtue of our understanding that we belong to the same home. But that sense of belonging is impossible unless we are able to know where our home begins and ends.Amnesty undermines all of that. Our entire immigration system, which runs on a laughably porous set of enforcement mechanisms punctuated by spasmodic efforts at citizenship for millions of illegal residents, is an affront to the principle of national sovereignty from start to finish. But the periodic (and often bipartisan) mass-amnesty pushes are the most blatant of all of these offenses, enshrining and widening the disconnect between the American people and their ostensible representatives in the ruling elite. An immigration regime that relies on capriciously awarding citizenship for the feat of illegally entering and residing in our country is an inversion of justice, rewarding lawlessness and punishing merit. Even more fundamentally, it is a radical rejection of democratic self-determination, robbing the nation’s citizens of the sacrosanct right to determine who joins their political community.Gavin Newsom’s Real ConstituentsExclusive: Republicans Revive Counter-CRT Bills in CongressThe Indoctrination in Public Schools Is WorkingAt root, governing a nation this way enshrines the idea that our laws are optional. This is an effect of mass immigration that is not easily discerned in GDP, wage growth, opinion polls, and other standard numerical measurements of social prosperity but is profoundly corruptive of the political and moral character of a nation all the same. The “mobocratic spirit” that a young Abraham Lincoln spoke of in his Lyceum Address — in which “the lawless in spirit are encouraged to become lawless in practice” — contributes to the breakdown of what the future president described as “the strongest bulwark of any Government, and particularly of those constituted like ours . . . the attachment of the People.” Lincoln recognized that Americans are bound together by a shared reverence for our political inheritance, embodied by the Constitution and the laws of the land. But “if the laws be continually despised and disregarded,” he warned, “the alienation of their affections from the Government is the natural consequence; and to that, sooner or later, it must come.”Lincoln understood that the institutionalization of lawlessness and disrespect for the Constitution corrodes the soul of a people. Outside of the wonkier — though still crucially important — questions surrounding economics, cultural assimilation, and any other aspect of the immigration debate, this is the first-order objection to mass amnesty: It is a repudiation of the principle that a people should be sovereign in their own country, replacing a nation of laws with an arbitrary regime whose fidelity to the Constitution fluctuates at the momentary whims of those in power."

Breed maintained that she was drinking at the time.“My drink was sitting at the table,” said Breed. “I got up and started dancing because I was feeling the spirit and I wasn’t thinking about a mask.”In a vacuum, I agree with this. It’s a free country, and we don’t, in fact, need the “fun police to come in and micromanage and tell us what we should or shouldn’t be doing.” It’s just that, well, London Breed is the “fun police.” The rule in San Francisco is that unless you’re actively eating or drinking, you need to wear a mask. And, per her own testimony, London Breed wasn’t actively eating or drinking; she was dancing while her drink was “sitting at the table.” Is the rule that Breed broke stupid? Yes, it is — especially given that San Francisco has a system of vaccine passports that applies to the very club she was attending. But it’s the rule nevertheless, and, as mayor, she has to follow it, too.Under the current rules, my three-year-old has to wear a mask when traveling on airplanes. Like many children, he, too, likes to dance when he feels the spirit. And, like many children, he, too, is less than fond of the fun police. But do you know who cares about any of that? Nobody, that’s who. As I write, millions of American kids are on their way to school with masks strapped over their faces — a fact of which London Breed’s political party not only approves, but is willing to sue in order to universalize. If, as Breed implies, these rules represent unnecessary and intrusive micromanagement that can’t possibly survive contact with reality, then maybe we should do the obvious thing, and blow them all up?"

However, subsequent information from the attorneys for both Carmine’s and the women revealed that the trio did, in fact, present verification of vaccination to enter.Shortly after the women’s group was seated, three men arrived to join the party inside, but two were denied entry because they failed to provide vaccination documentation, lawyers from both sides confirmed to the New York Times. A fight broke out outside when a hostess allegedly used a racial slur and made derogatory remarks directed at the female customers, accusing them of carrying fraudulent vaccination cards, the lawyer who represents one of the women, Kaeita Nkeenge Rankin, who is a doctor, told the Times. Justin Moore, the lawyer, said the women claim the hostess “spewed out” the N-word. After the brawl, NYPD arrested the three black women for investigation of criminal mischief and assault.Organized by Black Lives Matter Greater New York, demonstrators congregated Monday to clarify the story from their perspective. At the rally, the speakers railed against the racial obscenity that was allegedly uttered as well as the perceived discrimination against the black unvaccinated patrons. While protesters claimed the hostess was white, invoking “white supremacy” multiple times, Carmine’s owner Jeffrey Banks told the New York Post that the employees who he says were violently attacked were black, Latina, and Asian American.BLM NYC co-founder and chairman Hank Newsome alleged that the restaurant staff treated the black women with hostility and accused Carmine’s of covering up “their employees’ actions by using the vaccination passport as an excuse.” He demanded that Carmine’s release its video footage of the incident, which he believes will settle that the hostess was the antagonizer and that the three women were wrongfully charged.On Tuesday, Carmine’s owner Jeffrey Bank released the surveillance tape, which shows one of the Texas tourists, rather than the hostess, throwing the first blow.“This attack was entirely unprovoked,” Banks told the Post. He also unequivocally denied that any one of his employees made a racial slur.Chivona Newsome, the other co-founder of BLM NYC, targeted Mayor Bill de Blasio’s vaccine mandate more specifically in her remarks. She implied that the edict has resulted in repeats of historical episodes when blacks were disenfranchised from society.“Being a doctor does not protect you from anti-blackness. Having a vaccination card does not protect you from discrimination. The 1964 Civil Rights Act prohibits the actions of Carmine’s. It says it is illegal to discriminate against you on the basis of race,” she said.“Seventy-two percent of black people in this city from ages 18 to 44 are unvaccinated. So what is going to stop the Gestapo, I mean the NYPD, from rounding up black people, from snatching them off the train, off the bus?” she added.Chivona Newsome suggested that if these incidents continue, Black Lives Matter could revolt to exact justice like it did after George Floyd’s death.“We’re putting this city on notice, that your mandate will not be another racist social-distance practice. Black people are not going to stand by, or you will see another uprising. And that is not a threat; that is a promise,” she said. “The vaccination passport is not a free passport to racism.”Kimberly Bernard, the co-founder of the Black Women’s March, echoed the charge that COVID restrictions are being weaponized against minorities.“We are serving notice on the mayor, on the governor, on the restaurant industry that we will not allow for you to use this pandemic, vaccination cards, and masks as another reason to be racist, to put us in prison. Because there’s enough of us in there,” she said.A man from Rise and Resist, a direct-action group that formed in resistance to the 2016 election of former president Donald Trump, turned the conversation to the partisan blame game that’s exploded amid the pandemic.“The Republican Party and elected officials and pundits on Fox News try to blame the entirety of the unvaccinated COVID crisis on black people, even though black people are twelve percent of the population,” he said.But while the speaker said the political Right is guilty of pinning the pandemic on the unvaccinated, of whom many are blacks, a female African American in the crowd told National Review a different tale.Amaya Perez, a college student with experience in the restaurant industry, said her community is struggling to recognize that Democrats, not Republicans, are spearheading vaccine mandates and therefore resurrecting racial discrimination and conflict.“Most black people aren’t going to acknowledge that the Democratic Party has disenfranchised us. Malcom X said it’s foxes and wolves. The fox pretends to be your friend to your face but passes laws behind your back to harm you. The wolf is not your friend, they don’t like you, and they treat you as such. But who do you respect more? Black people tend to fall for the fox,” Perez said.She said her job is in jeopardy now because she’s refused the vaccine, another issue of economic equity that she says Democrats are not acknowledging.“This vaccine mandate is disproportionately affecting people of color. People shouldn’t be forced to do it. It’s ‘for your health,’ but they’re willing to ruin people’s lives to protect against a virus with over a 99 percent survival rate. .  . This is going to be the new Jim Crow, and it’s going to affect mostly people of color,” she said."
1079,The Songwriting Star Who Won’t Let America Forget Afghanistan,17.33,29.33,https://www.nationalreview.com/the-morning-jolt/the-songwriting-star-who-wont-let-america-forget-afghanistan/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-21,www.nationalreview.com,25,"On the menu today: Singer-songwriter John Ondrasik (a.k.a Five for Fighting) is on a one-man cultural crusade to keep the abandoned American citizens, green-card holders, and Afghan allies stranded in Afghanistan in the forefront of the minds of the American public; the U.N.’s secretary-general offers a strikingly different tone in his general remarks than in his meeting with President Biden; U.S. allies in Europe reconsider their options; and a reminder about the persistent threat of home-cooked bioweapons.A New Protest Song from John OndrasikSinger-songwriter John Ondrasik raises a good point about “Blood on My Hands,” his new protest song about the plight of Afghans, which criticizes President Joe Biden and the U.S. withdrawal from that country. The pertinent question is not why he’s so outspoken about the horrors witnessed in Afghanistan over the past six weeks; the better question is why the rest of the music industry is so uncharacteristically quiet about a brutal regime that is literally killing people for the crime of creating music.In late August, Afghan folk singer Fawad Andarabi was dragged from his home and killed by the Taliban. One of Afghanistan’s most prominent pop singers fled to Istanbul, leaving on a US military-evacuation plane to a base in Doha, Qatar. The Afghanistan National Institute of Music is closed, with no word on whether it will ever reopen. The Taliban are banning music in public again, like the last time they ruled the country, deeming it un-Islamic. Members of an internationally renowned orchestra of Afghan women and girls remain stuck in Afghanistan, after an attempt to get them out through Kabul’s airport in the last days of the U.S. war failed. Ondrasik himself has heard from those still in Afghanistan about a music school that was burned to the ground.“To this day, I don’t understand the lack of an outcry, especially from the music community,” Ondrasik said in a Monday morning interview. “Where are the benefit concerts? Where are the protest songs, the protests outside the White House? This is why I think tribalism has corroded our souls. . . . Why isn’t Fawad [Andarabi] on the cover of Rolling Stone?”Ondrasik said the inspiration for “Blood on My Hands” came at three distinct points during the early weeks of the crisis in Afghanistan. The first was the horrific sights of the chaotic evacuations in the first days after the fall of Kabul. The second came during a phone call from a friend whom Ondrasik describes as spending her career involved with humanitarian work all around the globe.“She said, ‘I’m organizing evacs for AmCits, LPRs, and SIVs,’ and she’s spitting out all these acronyms,” Ondrasik recalled. “I asked, ‘What’s an AmCit?’ and she said, ‘That’s an American citizen.’ I said, ‘You’re going to risk your life, and private citizens like you are going to do the same, to rescue Americans we left behind?’ And this is a tough person, and she started crying, and she said yes. I thought, ‘What is happening? What world are we living in?’”“The song sort of wrote itself when the president came out and gave his ‘extraordinary success’ speech,” at the end of August, Ondrasik said. “Most of us were insulted. It’s hard for someone like me to criticize the military. [Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark] Milley and [Secretary of Defense Lloyd] Austin, I figured they would say, ‘this is not an extraordinary success, but here’s the plan.’ And then they didn’t. They echoed what Biden said, and that was scary. I’ve always felt that our presidents may not have the greatest intentions, but that the military were the adults in the room. When I saw that, I realized, this is spouting the company line, like some hack in the basement.”Indeed, “Blood on my Hands” calls out members of Biden’s cabinet as much as the president himself.Winkin’ BlinkenCan’t you look in my eyes?Willy MilleyTell me when did you decide‘This we’ll defend’Your sacred mottoNow means . . .‘Never Mind’General AustinIs there no honor in shameCan you spell BagramWithout the letters in BlameThe fact that Milley and Austin played along with Biden’s implausibly rosy assessment “really made me angry, more at Milley, and Austin and [Secretary of State Antony] Blinken than at Biden,” Ondrasik said. “To me, it is inexcusable that there have been no resignations, and no one has been fired, the lack of accountability.”Ondrasik said the song has already garnered a strong and supportive reaction, although it is not really a song that can be enjoyed.“The word I’ve heard a lot from Americans as they look at Afghanistan is ‘ashamed,’ not ‘angry,’” Ondrasik says. “I didn’t want to write this song. I don’t want to sing it, but I think we owe it to ourselves, and we owe it to the Afghans. We have to admit our complicity in this.”This week, Ondrasik is going on his first major concert tour since the pandemic hit, backed by a string quartet — and while he will perform “Blood on my Hands,” he will perform it alone, after his main set. Ondrasik says he knows the irritation people can feel when an artist not known for politics suddenly gets up on a soapbox.“This song came in just the last couple weeks, and a lot of people probably don’t even know about it,” he says. “I have four people with me on stage, so we’re going to do my set, and after my show, I’m going to invite anyone who would like to stay, please stay; if you’re not comfortable, thank you. . . . And if the venue won’t let me do it, then we’ll do it in the parking lot.”Ondrasik is involved with several groups attempting to help Americans in Afghanistan and Afghan refugees, including the Nazarene Fund. His concert tour dates can be found here.Elsewhere, Samaritan’s Purse offers an update on the services it is providing to Afghan refugees who are currently in camps in eastern Europe — medical care, haircuts, blankets, kites, balls, and other toys for the children. And Team Rubicon is currently supporting the management of donated goods and setting up the logistics at each donation point for collections and distribution at seven U.S. military bases hosting Afghan refugees.Meanwhile, over at the United Nations . . .President Biden will address the United Nations General Assembly today. Yesterday, after an evening meeting with Secretary-General António Guterres of the United Nations, Biden declared that, “And the Secretary-General and I share a strong commitment to the principles of human freedom and human dignity on which the U.N. was founded.” Biden did not mention Afghanistan, and the country was not mentioned in the official readout of Biden’s meeting with Guterres, but the two men “reaffirmed the strong partnership between the United States and the United Nations which, in particular, is based on common values that include respect for universal human rights, fundamental freedoms, and international law. They discussed the importance of multilateralism and the defense of democracy and the rules-based international order.”Oddly enough, in an interview two days ago, Secretary-General Guterres had plenty to say about Afghanistan.“The institutions we have, have no teeth. And sometimes, even when they have teeth, like in the case of the Security Council, they have not much appetite to bite,” Guterres said. “We see the terrorist groups emboldened by the situation in Afghanistan, the victory of the Taliban.” Asked what his message to member states was, Guterres said that, “My main message? It’s time to ring the alarm bell. We are on the verge of a precipice and we are moving in the wrong direction. Look at [COVID-19] vaccination, look at the difficulties in bringing together all countries to make sure that we make COP26 [the climate-change conference] a success. Look at the multiplication of conflicts we have witnessed in the last few months. We need to change course, and we need to wake up. So, my message to the leaders? Wake up, change course, unite, and let’s try to defeat the enormous challenges we are facing today.”On Friday, the State Department’s principal deputy spokesperson, Jalina Porter, said that in total, between the charter flights and the overland crossings, 36 U.S. citizens and 24 lawful permanent residents have departed Afghanistan since August 31. She said that nearly three weeks after the last U.S. forces left the country, the State Department remained unable to provide precise figures on how many U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents were still in the country because “the situation is very dynamic, and as we have more precise and specific details, we’ll be able to provide those.”Porter also declared that, “Defending human rights and democratic values at home and around the world is essential to renewing the United States’ national strength and advancing our interests.”This morning, a new report from Amnesty International concluded that, “In just over five weeks since assuming control of Afghanistan, the Taliban have clearly demonstrated that they are not serious about protecting or respecting human rights. We have already seen a wave of violations, from reprisal attacks and restrictions on women, to crackdowns on protests, the media and civil society. . . . Given the prevailing climate of fear, lack of mobile connectivity in many areas, and internet blackouts enforced by the Taliban, these findings are likely to represent just a snapshot of what’s happening on the ground.”How About Those Strong Alliances, Huh?Meanwhile, the president who pledged to restore U.S. alliances has apparently alienated Europe so severely that they are reevaluating their long-term interests.“There is of course in Europe a growing feeling that something is broken in our transatlantic relations,” Thierry Breton, the EU commissioner for internal markets, told the Financial Times. He added that, “It’s true that we hear some voices in Europe saying that probably after what happened over the past two months, it may be a good idea to reassess everything we are doing, and our partnership. . . . In this council, there are a lot of things that we can see pretty clearly what we can bring and will bring to the U.S., maybe it’s not always clear what the U.S. can bring to us.”"

Police Chief Unloads on Lax Court System after Shooting: ‘You Cannot Coddle Violent Criminals’,8.0,32.33,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/d-c-police-chief-unloads-on-lax-court-system-after-restaurant-shooting-you-cannot-coddle-violent-criminals/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.nationalreview.com,25,"Washington, D.C., police chief Robert J. Contee III slammed what he described as a malfunctioning justice system on Friday morning following a shooting in the crowded 14th street commercial district Thursday night.Gunmen shot two people on the city’s upscale 14th Street, in an incident captured on video. Police have recorded 105 homicides in the city so far this year, while 2020 saw a 16-year high of 198 homicides.Contee said the Thursday shooting left people “mad as hell” in a Friday press conference.“We could take the political route and talk about all of this fluffy stuff, but I’m going to give it to you straight, where the issues are,” Contee told reporters. “The justice system that we have right now—it is not functioning the way that it should. The courts are not open, that is a fact.”Contee said people arrested by police could up back on the streets within “three weeks,” and that there is still a backlog of cases from the previous year.“What does the community expect?” Contee said. “When a person gets caught with a firearm, what do we expect? Do we expect to see them in the neighborhood in three weeks? And if we do, are we saying that that’s acceptable?”Contee continued, “You cannot coddle violent criminals. You cannot treat violent criminals who are out here making communities unsafe….They might not want a job. They might not. They might not need services. What they may require is to be off of our streets.” When the Police Wreck Your Home by Mistake, You Shouldn’t Have to Foot the BillProgressive Portland DA Ousted as Voters Overwhelmingly Reject Soft-on-Crime PoliciesNo Cops Died ‘in the Line of Duty’ during the Capitol RiotThe Thursday shooting came several days after three people were wounded in a shooting at Nationals Park, leading panicked spectators at a Nationals-Padres game to flee the stadium. Contee noted that both shootings drew national attention, but that incidents like them occur far more frequently in other parts of the city.Around 40 percent of all shootings in Washington, D.C., are concentrated on 151 blocks, or 2 percent of the entire city, the Washington Post reported."
1081,"To Fight CRT in the Schools, Unfortunately We Do Need Lawmakers",16.0,29.0,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/to-fight-crt-in-the-schools-unfortunately-we-do-need-lawmakers/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.nationalreview.com,25,"The esteemed Robert Woodson has been fighting the good fight on the education front, particularly in countering the spread of the 1619 Project curriculum in public schools, and we are all in his debt for those efforts. On the homepage today, he calls for “A Better Way to Fight Critical Race Theory,” in which he argues: “Just as we wouldn’t ban teaching students about communism or fascism, our schools should equip students with the intellectual tools to understand any ideology — including CRT — and decide for themselves what they think about it.”TOP STORIES D-Day at 80: How the Allies Won at Normandy and Changed History. Finally, Transgender Sports Rules That Make Sense. Joe Biden Visits Daughter-in-Law Hallie Ahead of Testimony at Hunter Biden’s Gun Trial. Respectfully, I’d like to argue that there is a problem with this, and it’s a reality that Woodson acknowledges: “Across the country, a handful of educators and administrators aren’t really teaching kids about CRT; some are applying CRT to curricula as a framework to understand the world.” In other words, CRT isn’t a subject, it’s a perspective: a way to approach subjects.(And I think “a handful” is an understatement; we wouldn’t be seeing the intense public concern about CRT in the schools if it were ascendant only in places like nutty Portland.)While it’s true that we wouldn’t want to ban the teaching of fascism, we don’t want our public schools to teach from a fascist perspective. As Cameron Hilditch forcefully explains, we properly recoil from the idea of indoctrinating students in ideologies antithetical to the ideals of liberty and the rule of law applied equally to all citizens.Nor should we want K–12 students taught from a CRT perspective — taught to view the world through the lens of race, to view American society as divided between the (white) oppressors and the oppressed. We don’t want children inculcated in an ideology that denies their individual agency and impels them to subordinate their thinking to a prescribed orthodoxy. As Peter Wallison observes, “where CRT is taught, it seals off all counterarguments.”Woodson is clearly dedicated to steering American education clear of CRT. I would like to think he’s right that if we “encourage students to hold its prescriptions up to practical real-world challenges and those who overcame them . . . CRT will have no power.” But just look at the power that CRT has already gained having escaped from academia out into the wider world.I worked for many years as a copy editor on educational reference books and textbooks. Increasingly, I found myself drowning in academic jargon and critical theory, wondering how shocked parents would be if they knew the contents of their college kids’ assigned readings — both the wretched prose and the radical ideas. (Given what I knew, I could at least encourage my own kids to be skeptics.) But when that material filtered down to the high-school and middle-school levels, I knew it was time to get out. I began to feel it was immoral for me to try to improve these texts.So the argument that legislating CRT out of the public schools has become necessary seems far more persuasive. It might make us a little squeamish, but it’s what this has come to."
1082,An Orwellian Kodak Moment,12.0,34.67,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/an-orwellian-kodak-moment/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-23,www.nationalreview.com,25,"Kodak became the latest U.S. brand to censor itself and apologize to the Chinese government for speaking the truth this week.The ailing photography company deleted an Instagram post in which it had promoted the work of Patrick Wack, a French photographer, capturing scenes from China’s Xinjiang region. In his own posts, Wack called Xinjiang an “Orwellian dystopia.” Kodak’s offending post drew from Wack’s forthcoming book of photographs from Xinjiang.The Hong Kong Free Press reported on the differences between the company’s English-language statement on Instagram and the one it posted to WeChat:“Content from the photographer Patrick Wack was recently posted on this Instagram page. The content of the post was provided by the photographer and was not authored by Kodak,” the company’s statement on Tuesday read, after the post was deleted.It added that its Instagram page was not intended to be a “platform for political commentary” and disabled comments on the post in question.“The views expressed by Mr. Wack do not represent those of Kodak and are not endorsed by Kodak. We apologize for any misunderstanding or offense the post may have caused,” the company said.In a separate statement on Chinese social media WeChat, the company vowed to cooperate with the Chinese government and respect Beijing.“For a long time, Kodak has maintained a good relationship with the Chinese government and has been in close cooperation with various government departments. We will continue to respect the Chinese government and the Chinese law,” the statement read.“We will keep ourselves in check and correct ourselves, taking this as an example of the need for caution,” it added, saying “management loopholes” may have been responsible for the post.The differences between Kodak’s statements on the two platforms are striking, but not out of the ordinary. Nominally American companies are accepting the Chinese Communist Party’s parameters for accepted speech, even for posts in English on U.S. platforms. (Instagram is banned in China.) They apologize when they fall short of that standard and attempt to cover their tracks afterward, only issuing the most groveling version of their statements in Chinese, opting for more anodyne language in English."
1083,Biden’s Gift to Putin,12.33,35.33,https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/07/bidens-gift-to-putin/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,www.nationalreview.com,25,"President Biden promised to unite the world’s democracies against global authoritarianism, but the administration’s new Nord Stream 2 bargain placates the Kremlin’s Western cronies and German business interests at the expense of U.S. allies in Russian crosshairs.The 760-mile pipeline is a geopolitical weapon, which Kyiv fears Vladimir Putin will use to deprive it of transit revenues from the gas pipelines that currently cross its territory. Nord Stream 2 will double the capacity of an existing pipeline under the Baltic Sea, and thus would either remove or substantially reduce any economic costs that Russia might incur if it steps up its harassment of Ukraine. As recently as this month, Putin has suggested that he’d like to do just that, calling Russians and Ukrainians “one people” in an article on the conflict in Ukraine’s Donbas region, where Russia is backing separatist forces.Despite recognizing Nord Stream 2’s role as a malign Russian influence project, the administration announced a deal this week crafted to resolve Washington’s long-running dispute with Berlin over the pipeline, ensuring that it will be finished. The move all but dashes hopes that Washington would use sanctions in a last-ditch effort to kill the Gazprom-backed project.Under the agreement, Germany makes some concessions to U.S. concerns about Ukraine’s security, including by pledging to retaliate against Russia for any attempts to weaponize its energy flows and to appoint a special envoy to help Kyiv negotiate a deal that would continue Moscow’s current gas flows through the country. It also commits to helping (and funding) Ukraine’s transition to renewable energy sources and creating a 60-million-euro energy resilience package, among other things. The idea that EUR 60m would make any difference one way or another is so ludicrous as to be insulting.All of this is supposed to assuage Ukraine’s concerns, but the German pledge to impose sanctions on Russia in the event of a coercion campaign is vague, and it’s uncertain what leverage it would have in negotiations over Ukraine’s energy contract after 2024, the final year of the current contract.U.S. officials grasp the undesirable quality of this compromise, but they claim their choice is the most pragmatic among bad options. “While we remain opposed to this pipeline, we reached the judgment that sanctions would not stop its construction and risked undermining a critical alliance with Germany, as well as with the EU and other European allies,” said a senior administration official this week, announcing the deal. Other “European allies” rather closer to the Russian border might disagree. It has escaped no one’s notice in Warsaw, Tallinn, Vilnius, or Riga that the Baltic pipelines run directly from Russia to Germany. Memories of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact have not faded in that part of the world.No one doubts that full implementation of the sanctions packages that Congress passed in 2017, 2019, and 2020 would have aggravated Germany and perhaps other European countries, as these measures targeted European — and German — companies. Chancellor Angela Merkel has claimed that the Russian pipeline is a purely commercial project, one that plays a significant role in Germany’s energy transition, and called potential U.S. sanctions on German entities an illegal infringement of her country’s sovereignty. Which is why in May the administration designated several ships and companies involved in the project but waived sanctions targeting the Nord Stream 2 corporate entity and its CEO Matthias Warnig, a former Stasi officer.By then, Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s team had already lost the argument within the administration over pushing for full implementation of the U.S. sanctions targeting any individuals and entities working on the pipeline, the Washington Post has reported. Biden, Jake Sullivan, and other NSC officials favored a softer touch. If the pipeline was certain to be completed, they didn’t also want to alienate Germany.In the weeks since, Blinken has publicly toed the administration’s line, calling the pipeline a fait accompli, even though he and others privately thought otherwise. That question is now definitively settled — the agreement does make Nord Stream 2 a fait accompli.Now it will face a bipartisan, bicameral assault on Capitol Hill. Although outraged lawmakers don’t get any say over the agreement’s enactment, they might attempt to sabotage it and limit the fallout by passing robust new assistance packages for Ukraine.For all of its deficiencies, the deal serves an important clarifying purpose, showing that German officials, who have long denied it, actually do understand how Nord Stream 2 will be used as a political project. It reveals the bankruptcy of Merkel’s mercantilist defense of the project. And it demonstrates proof of concept for Putin’s efforts to buy influential European politicians, such as Gerhard Schröder, chairman of the Nord Stream 2 board and a former German chancellor.With Nord Stream 2, Moscow has effectively deepened the divisions between the U.S. and some of its allies. This episode has made Ukraine and other Eastern European pipeline opponents question Washington’s determination to confront the Russian threat. On Wednesday afternoon, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba and Polish foreign minister Zbigniew Rau released a joint statement ripping the deal.Maybe Washington can afford to hold Ukraine, an imperfect and certainly flawed democracy, at arm’s length and give preferential treatment to Germany, which has shown itself to have a soft spot for doing business with Beijing and Moscow. And perhaps Kyiv has no other choice but to take what it can get. But the White House’s talk of defending embattled democracy sounds tinnier after this deal. "
1084,Why Meritocracy Makes Us Miserable,11.0,30.33,https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/07/why-meritocracy-makes-us-miserable/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,www.nationalreview.com,25,"Today, the compulsive habit of comparison driven by our democratic way of life has gotten entirely out of hand.All Our Opinion in Your InboxNR Daily is delivered right to you every afternoon. No charge.Nothing is more characteristic of the modern world than the spirit of comparison. Our economic system and our political system both impose a duty of comparison on everyone in society in order for them both to function. Our social order, meanwhile, is shot through with sleepless, incessant measurements of status taken by each of us against the standard of our neighbors. No doubt this comparative impulse is endemic to our nature to a great degree — its evolutionary utility alone is obvious. But it’s nevertheless true that the advent of the modern world — of liberal democracy, capitalism, and urban industry — exacerbated this habit or impulse of comparison to an altogether pathological extent.The burgeoning ascendancy of the comparative mindset in the West fascinated Alexis de Tocqueville, who witnessed it coming to birth during the 19th century in post-feudal France and America:In certain areas of the Old World . . . the inhabitants are for the most part extremely ignorant and poor; they take no part in the business of the country and are frequently oppressed by the government, yet their countenances are generally placid and their spirits light. In America I saw the freest and most enlightened men placed in the happiest circumstances that the world affords; it seemed to me that a cloud habitually hung upon their brows, and I thought them serious and almost sad, even in their pleasures. The chief reason for this contrast is that the former do not think of the ills they endure, while the latter are forever brooding over the advantages they do not possess.It’s a troubling paradox. “The freest and most enlightened men placed in the happiest circumstances that the world affords” are those for whom happiness remains most elusive, yet the destitute of the earth “are generally placid and their spirits light.” It’s unwise to romanticize destitution and unfreedom, the evils and sufferings of which are clear and harrowing, but those who have traveled widely in the third world will at some point have witnessed the kind of uncomplicated contentment of which Tocqueville writes. My father sees it often in rural India, where men walk to and from the sites of their subsistence labor, holding hands entirely platonically, absorbed in the enjoyment of their mutual affection and taking no thought of the riches that elude them.Tocqueville thought that this contrast between spiritual contentment amid material suffering and spiritual crisis amid material wealth could be put down to the different psychological implications of stratified and democratic social orders. As Larry Siedentop explains in his book on the great Frenchman:Whereas identities in an aristocratic society seem “natural” or fated, in a democratic society they are constructed or artificial. For comparison is the essence of a democratic society. Individuals can distinguish between persons and roles, compare roles and aspire (at least in principle) to almost any role. That yields a remarkable result — there is an unprecedented release of energy in a democratic society. Individuals are no longer held back by fixed or assigned identities. They can aspire to power, wealth, and status. Thus, civil equality fosters a society marked by ambition, innovation, and restlessness. When people no longer feel tied to a particular situation, they compare what they have with what they might have, and the consequence is the multiplication of wants. Instead of the static wants of an aristocratic society, where people feel that their lot is fixed, members of a democratic society are obsessed with acquiring what they do not yet have.In hierarchical societies, the radical inequality between different groups of people circumscribes the goals to which any given individual might aspire. After all, it’s only possible to be saddened by the absence of some good that was at least theoretically possible for one to obtain in the first place. Many people today are anxious or frustrated about not having the kind of house they’d like to live in. Far fewer are languishing in turmoil over the fact that they have never ridden a dragon or a unicorn.For the serfs of a 16th-century Russian prince, to take an example at random, the possibility of acquiring an estate and titles of nobility was negligible. The reason for this is that inherited identities and social roles constrain both the number and the grandeur of the desires that can reasonably dwell in the breast of any given member of society. A peasant might aspire to be the most revered man on the commune, but he will not feel any great sense of disappointment over the fact that he is not the czar.The establishment of political equality changed all this. By placing every citizen (at least theoretically) on a level footing with all of his or her fellows, and by propagating the notion that work, talent, and merit can take anyone wherever they might like to go, a democratic society imposes on each citizen the crushing responsibility of creating themselves from scratch. Because each person regards him- or herself as the equal of everyone else, failure to match the success of others is received as a huge psychological blow. As Tocqueville writes:The same equality which allows every citizen to conceive these lofty hopes renders all the citizens less able to realise them. It circumscribes their powers on every side, while it gives freer scope to their desires. They have swept away the privileges of some of their fellow creatures which stood in their way, but they have opened the door to universal competition. . . . To these causes must be attributed that strange melancholy which often haunts the inhabitants of democratic countries in the midst of their abundance, and that disgust of life which sometimes seizes upon them in the midst of . . . their easy existence.Status, wealth, and privilege used to be allocated by accident of birth. We would never want to return to such a social order, but it was nevertheless a virtue of this ancien régime that people spent little time fretting over their lack of these things.Let’s compare the fictional serf we imagined above with another hypothetical figure: a young boy born in 1867 in a log cabin near Hodgenville, Ky. In many ways, he is similar to our Russian serf. He will probably live a life of poverty in absolute terms, and will live hand-to-mouth by farming the land. But he lives at a time and place where equality — at least among white men — has advanced much further than it had in medieval Russia. In 1860, a man from a background almost identical to this fictional Kentucky boy was elected president of the United States. Consequently, it’s not nearly as fanciful for this boy to compare himself to President Lincoln as it would be for a serf to compare himself to the czar.For the most part, of course, this is the glory of equality and, by extension, the glory of America. Lincoln himself was keen to advertise his election as evidence that every father’s son might aspire to the same office as his had. But with the possibility of that aspiration comes a possibility of disappointment hanging over the head of our farm boy like the sword of Damocles and a restless anxiety born of the need to justify himself that neither his father nor his grandfather had ever known.Today, the compulsive habit of comparison driven by our democratic way of life has gotten entirely out of hand. The range of people with whom young people compare themselves today is uncircumscribed by almost any limiting factor. Once again, this is a cause for celebration in most respects, but democratization and globalism taken together have enlarged the social sphere in which people seek out status to an altogether oppressive degree. All sorts of jobs, social roles, and identity markers that would once have accorded a satisfying amount of status to people in local communities have been drained of their status by a mass celebrity culture that reallocates this status (along with power and wealth) to those at the top of the meritocratic pyramid.António Salazar: Conservative DelusionsChina’s Social-Credit System Arrives on British ShoresHow the West Lost GodThe comparative excesses of meritocracy in this new global statusphere account for the weightlessness and anonymity felt by many people in the modern world. They also account for some of our most fanatical and deranged social conflicts. When status, wealth, and power are all up for grabs by anyone, the bitterest rivalries often sprout up between immediate rivals for these goods. This is why intra-conservative debates on the American right have always been more heated than debates between right and left more broadly.Probably the most distressing example of how the comparative spirit of meritocracy is wreaking havoc on America today concerns college administrators. In a society of self-assured citizens at peace with themselves, college administrators would be content with doing their jobs. But as Lyell Asher pointed out in a memorable 2018 essay written for The Chronicle of Higher Education, the Great Awokening currently spreading across college campuses like a prairie fire can largely be put down to status anxiety on the part of these administrators. Having spent decades working in close proximity to people who are accorded a higher status by our culture than they themselves are — academics — a need was felt on the part of administrators to recast themselves as “educators.”The descent of college administrators into a state of Jacobin degeneracy is just one example of how the scramble for status in our meritocratic world is making us miserable. Other examples abound, and some will undoubtedly have occurred to the reader by this point. But the lesson of each different permutation of this pathology is the same: We will not be able to live free, equal, prosperous, and happy all at the same time until we overcome what Thomas Merton called “the strange error that our perfection depends on the thoughts and opinions and applause of other men.” “A weird life it is, indeed,” he wrote, “to be living always in somebody else’s imagination, as if that were the only place in which one could at last become real!” Without finding a sure footing for personal worth apart from the comparative meritocratic advantage we might have over and against another, none of us will escape the fate of Tocqueville’s miserable men of material wealth and spiritual squalor.In order to make our meritocratic social order function in a healthy way, each of us has to find some unearned grace in our solitude that will insulate us from the perils of both ascent and descent on meritocracy’s ladder: a grace akin to that which Jacob found on that other ladder of old on which angels ascended and descended, and from whose heights he heard a voice saying, “And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee whithersoever thou goest.” Whether or not one is religious is, in many ways, incidental to the matter at hand. But we all need to have something of ourselves we can withhold from meritocracy’s merciless calculations. Otherwise we’re headed for a social order remade from root to branch in the image of college administrators and other reckless graspers after self-actualizing social status. What a fate to contemplate."
1085,Border Patrol Seize Record Amount of Fentanyl in June,8.33,41.67,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/border-patrol-seize-record-amount-of-fentanyl-in-june/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,www.nationalreview.com,25,"Federal agents seized a record 1,060 pounds of fentanyl in June, U.S. Customs and Border Protection announced Friday.More fentanyl was seized in June 2021 than in the last three Junes combined, the Daily Caller first reported.CBP reported 109 seizures in June with an average of 9.7 pounds per seizure. That number was down from 132 seizures in May.CDC data reveals that more than 93,000 Americans died of drug overdoses last year, marking a 30 percent uptick from 2019, with 69,000 of those overdose fatalities being opioid-related.The surge in drug-related deaths has primarily been attributed to opioid overdoses, especially from opioids laced with fentanyl, according to the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. As little as two milligrams of fentanyl can constitute a lethal dose, according to the United States Drug Enforcement Administration.In May, Republican Texas Governor Greg Abbott said that the Biden administration’s relaxed immigration policies are to blame for the massive influx of fentanyl infiltrating the Texas interior. He subsequently deployed 1,000 Texas Department of Public Safety troopers and National Guard members to combat the drug trafficking. He also announced he will sign legislation to codify the manufacturing or delivery of fentanyl as a criminal offense, beginning as a third-degree felony.“Biden’s deadly border policies are being felt in communities throughout TX & the country. DPS & @TexasGuard are working to get these drugs off the streets,” Abbott tweeted in May.Abbott and Governor Ron DeSantis participated in a joint briefing Saturday to discuss the two states’ efforts on border security.“What’s happening here at the border may be happening here today but it may be happening in these other states tomorrow, next week or next month,” Abbott said. He emphasized that the flow of fentanyl across the border necessitates bolstered law enforcement.“We appreciate you stepping up where the federal government won’t and we understand how important this is to not just Texas, but other states,” DeSantis added.CBP accounted for 188,829 encounters on the southern border in June, the greatest level since March 2000, according to agency data released Friday."
1086,Senior Biden Officials Say COVID Lab-Leak Theory as Plausible as Natural Origin: Report,5.0,41.33,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/senior-biden-officials-say-covid-lab-leak-theory-as-plausible-as-natural-origin-report/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-26,www.nationalreview.com,25,"Senior Biden administration officials, including national security adviser Jake Sullivan, now view the theory that the novel coronavirus leaked from a laboratory as equally plausible as a natural origin, CNN reported on Friday evening.The report comes midway through a U.S. intelligence community review of the hypotheses for the origins of the pandemic, ordered by President Biden in May. While intelligence agencies are still divided as to whether the coronavirus first infected a human in nature or in a laboratory, the lab-leak theory has received renewed credibility in those agencies, one source familiar with the review told CNN.“There has been a shift in their point of view,” the source said.The shift coincides with a change in popular opinion among Americans as to the origins of the coronavirus. A bipartisan majority of Americans now believe the coronavirus leaked from a lab, including 59 percent of Republicans and 52 percent of Democrats, according to a Politico-Harvard University survey in late June.At a press conference on Thursday, World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was “premature” to dismiss the lab-leak hypothesis.“I was a lab technician myself, I’m an immunologist, and I have worked in the lab, and lab accidents happen,” Tedros told reporters.The city of Wuhan, China, where the pandemic began, is home to three laboratories that study coronaviruses, including the Wuhan Institute of Virology. China has refused to allow independent investigators access to data from the institute from the early days of the pandemic."
1087,Pete Buttigieg Should Not Be Taking Two Months off during a Supply-Chain Crisis,15.67,31.67,https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/pete-buttigieg-should-not-be-taking-two-months-off-during-a-supply-chain-crisis/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-10-15,www.nationalreview.com,25,"As America faces a mounting transportation crisis — the disruption of shipping supply chains — Jim Geraghty asked yesterday exactly what it is that Joe Biden’s “Supply Chain Disruptions Task Force” has been doing since Biden named it in June. We then got a partial answer that has people up in arms at Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, one of the leaders of the task force:They didn’t previously announce it, but Buttigieg’s office told West Wing Playbook that the secretary has actually been on paid leave since mid-August to spend time with his husband, Chasten, and their two newborn babies. “For the first four weeks, he was mostly offline except for major agency decisions and matters that could not be delegated,” said a spokesperson for the Department of Transportation. “He has been ramping up activities since then.” As he does that, Buttigieg will “continue to take some time over the coming weeks to support his husband and take care of his new children,” the spokesperson added…Buttigieg’s time away to help care for his children is the latest example of paid leave for new parents becoming more common in the United States, even at the highest levels of government. Acting Director of the Office of Management and Budget SHALANDA YOUNG is pregnant and is planning to take “time away from the office to be with her daughter after she’s born in the next few weeks,” according to an OMB spokesperson. Sen. TAMMY DUCKWORTH (D-Ill.), the first senator ever to give birth in office, took 12 weeks maternity leave when her daughter was born in 2018, though she famously appeared on the Senate floor with the newborn to cast a vote…In the past, Cabinet secretaries felt compelled to come back sooner. Former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development JULIÁN CASTRO took about a “week or so” of leave after his child was born, his spokesperson told us.There are four reasons why Buttigieg is, and should be, under fire for this.First, Buttigieg is a cabinet secretary. That is a senior management position, on par with being a corporate CEO. There are all sorts of nice things that come with being senior management — good pay, lots of perks, publicity, obsequious underlings. But the tradeoffs are typically that, in return, senior managers are asked to put in more time, get away from the job less easily, and lack the job security sometimes granted to ordinary workers. That’s the deal; it’s what you get when the buck stops with you. Even if being away for eight weeks is reasonable for a secretary, a janitor, or a mid-level bureaucrat in the Transportation Department, it really is pushing it for the man in charge to just go away for that long. A private company would be well within its rights to demand that its CEO come back faster than that, even if it offered a more generous maternity or paternity policy to its lower-level employees.Second, the disruption of supply chains really is a major problem, regardless of how bad you think it may be. The administration thinks that it is one within Buttigieg’s jurisdiction, hence his position on the task force. Just because you can take paternity leave in normal circumstances doesn’t mean you should take every last day you’re entitled to without any regard to what is happening in your job — especially if that job is a senior management role at the nationwide level.Third, the whole controversy raises the question of why we even have a secretary of transportation. While it appears that Buttigieg was asleep at the switch and that administration policies made things worse, it is a fair enough defense that there actually is not a whole lot that the Department of Transportation can do to solve the problem. If Buttigieg’s defenders are going to claim that his extended absence is not that important, then how can they also say that the job upgrades him to presidential timber from being the guy who Biden once mocked for installing “decorative brick” and “colorful lights” in South Bend, Ind. It is also fair to question whether maybe we would do just fine if the secretary of transportation left the job and was never replaced. And, for that matter, it is fair to ask why the same media that conducted a daily watch when Melania Trump wasn’t seen in public for three weeks somehow failed to even ask where the secretary of transportation was for two entire months.Fourth, Buttigieg is a man. He’s not a mother who gave birth and is breastfeeding a child. He’s not even assisting a mother who gave birth and is breastfeeding a child. This is not about Buttigieg being gay, but about his being a man whose physical burden simply is not the same as a woman’s when a child is brought into the world. You can argue in general, as a matter of policy, that men should get the same leave after birth that a woman gets, and that this should take place whether or not those men live with the birth mother of the child. But when you ask what amount of time it is reasonable for a senior executive to take during a crisis, it of course is relevant that he didn’t give birth. Maternity leave originated to reflect four basic realities. One, a woman needs a certain amount of time to recover physically and emotionally from the demands of giving birth, an experience that has no parallel for men. New mothers go through significant natural hormonal changes as part of that process; they may be susceptible to postpartum depression, which is also not a comparable issue for men. Two, new mothers often breastfeed their children, and this places particular demands on them physically. Three, we recognize the value of new mothers bonding with their children. Four, there is a ton of work to be done with a newborn, and then some with twins.Over time, paternity leave has expanded, if not caught up everywhere with maternity leave — and that’s fine. I got time off when my third child was born, whereas I had to take vacation time with my first two. The average woman takes, according to one study done in 2005, ten weeks of maternity leave after giving birth. A 2017 Pew study found that “the median length of leave for mothers after the birth or adoption of a child is 11 weeks, compared with one week for fathers.” Part of the recognition of paternity leave was as much for mothers as for fathers: All the things that new moms go through also mean they need more help. But the first two big items on the list — recovery from childbirth and breastfeeding — don’t matter when there is no birth mother in the house. Does that mean that adoptive parents such as the Buttigieg family should not get maternity or paternity leave? Of course not. But it is simple common-sense recognition of reality for people to notice that Pete Buttigieg is as far removed as it is possible for a new parent to be from the core purposes for which parental leave was created in the first place, plus he is the family breadwinner earning a cabinet-secretary salary and undoubtedly can afford to hire professional help in the event of a work crisis. It is artificial to ask people watching politics to not notice things that are real and obvious and would matter to a family outside of the world of Beltway power brokers.So, yes: A senior executive taking two full months out of the office during a major crisis in the job under the jurisdiction of his phony-baloney cabinet department is a legitimate story. And when you talk about that story, people are reasonably going to notice that the senior executive in question isn’t a woman who just gave birth."
1088,Biden’s ‘Double Death Tax’,6.33,35.0,https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/07/bidens-double-death-tax/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,www.nationalreview.com,25,"The White House is proposing what would amount to a second estate tax. The one we already have is bad enough.For more than a generation, Republicans have rallied to the flag of “kill the death tax,” and for good reason: Poll after poll shows it to be the tax that ordinary Americans find the most unfair. Democrats, understanding this, have cooperated (however reluctantly) in reducing the tax (its rate has fallen from 55 percent to 40 percent this century) and expanding the exemption to it (now as high as $25 million for a married couple). And on the state level, death taxes have all but disappeared from tax codes.Yet now, the “norms restoring” Biden administration is attempting to double down, by creating a new, parallel death tax to go alongside the old one no one likes.The Biden administration proposes that on top of the old death tax, which is assessed on estates, the federal government should add a new tax on the deceased’s last 1040 personal-income-tax return. This new, second tax would apply to tens of millions of Americans.Under the administration’s plan, the year someone died, all of their unrealized capital gains (gains on unsold real estate, family farms and businesses, stocks and other investments, artwork, collectibles, etc.) would be subject to taxation as if the assets in question had been sold that year. The first $1 million of unrealized gains ($2 million in the case of a married couple) would be exempt from the new tax. In addition, up to a certain point ($500,000 for a married couple, half that for others), gains derived from the sale of a primary residence would be exempted. Finally, the administration has said in the vaguest terms that “going concerns” in family farms and businesses would be exempt, but no one knows how that would work or believes it’s anything more than politically expedient hand-waving.In short, what the Biden administration is proposing is to tax the capital gains on a person’s property when they die, even if the assets that account for those gains haven’t actually been sold. By itself, this is deeply unfair, because potential income from a house or a stock is not real income one owes taxes on until a sale happens and one has cash in hand. (You don’t pay income tax on the growth in your home’s value every year, for example.) But to make matters worse, the administration also supports raising the top tax rate on long-term capital gains from 23.8 percent to 43.4 percent. When state capital-gains-tax rates are factored in, this would make the combined rate at or above 50 percent in many places — the highest capital-gains-tax rate in the world, and the highest in American history.And that’s not all. After these unrealized, unsold, phantom gains are subject to the new 50 percent double death tax, there is still the matter of the old death tax to deal with. Imagine a 50 percent death tax followed by a 40 percent death tax on what is left, and you get the idea. Karl Marx called for the confiscation of wealth at death, but even he probably never dreamed this big.It goes without saying that this 50 percent double death tax would apply to all capital gains over the exclusion amount, including those derived merely from inflation. A middle-class family who bought a vacation home in 1980 for $100,000 and has seen its value rise to $500,000 today knows that a lot of that growth is due to inflation alone. In fact, adjusting for inflation would reduce the gain in this example from $400,000 to just $150,000. Both the old and the new death taxes will tax merely phantom inflation gains.And how, exactly, are family farms and businesses supposed to handle this? Should they assess the enterprise value of a company that isn’t publicly traded and valued? Should the land-rich, cash-poor farmer be punished for keeping a 100-year-old family business going? Will factories and farm plots have to be sold off, or employees laid off, to pay this new tax? Just like the old death tax, the double death tax would be a dream for the estate-planning industry, armies of actuaries and attorneys, and other tax professionals. But for the average American, it would be a nightmare.The death tax we have is bad enough. A second death tax would be a catastrophic mistake."
1089,Whitmer-Kidnap Case Enters ‘Entrapment’ Phase,6.33,37.33,https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/07/whitmer-kidnap-case-enters-entrapment-phase/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,www.nationalreview.com,25,"But do the Wolverine Watchmen militia members have a valid claim?What would it take to entice you to commit a mass-murder attack?I wouldn’t have bet on it, but I did actually get to pose that question once. It was about 25 years ago, speaking to the jury at the end of the Blind Sheikh trial. I’d first gotten involved in the investigation nearly three years earlier, a few weeks after the World Trade Center was bombed in February 1993 … but well before we would finally arrest jihadists in flagrante delicto, mixing explosives in a Queens safehouse — explosives they were planning to detonate in the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels, two of several targets on their hit list in what became known as the “New York City Landmarks” plot.Given that experience, it is no surprise that my eye was quickly caught by the big BuzzFeed.News story this week, about the investigation of the Wolverine Watchmen militia and its — or, as some allege, the FBI’s — plot to kidnap Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer.What we are looking at with the Watchmen is a covert investigation of terrorism, mainly relying on informants, in the domestic context — in the sense that, whether the suspected terrorist group under investigation is deemed “domestic” (i.e., American citizens) or “foreign,” the activities being probed took place inside the United States, and thus under all the safeguards of the Constitution and statutory law. My investigation in 1993 could have been described the same way.It did not strike me as controversial that we used “sting” investigative techniques back then. For one thing, the Twin Towers had just been bombed, and the jihadist cell was clearly still active — the handful of arrests right after the bombing hadn’t shut down the broader cabal. In such circumstances, the object of the game is to prevent more atrocities from happening, rather than being content to prosecute only after people have been killed.Moreover, I had done covert investigations before, in dealing with organized crime (OC). This involves professional criminals — e.g., members or associates of the Mafia (the most infamous OC organization) — who make their living violating the law, a “profession” that is inherently violent for obvious reasons.(By the way, I am using the term “covert,” even though these are more often called “undercover” investigations, because undercover can be a confusing term. In law-enforcement lingo, an “undercover” is a law-enforcement agent who pretends to be a criminal in order to gather evidence against actual criminals. Private citizens who are not police often perform the same function, under the supervision of law-enforcement agents, but they are called “informants” even though they work undercover.)I describe terrorism and OC investigations, and the fact that, at the time, the covert tactics seemed unexceptional, because of the hue and cry over the heavy use of informants in the Watchmen probe, as reported by BuzzFeed.It is virtually always the case that some suspects caught up in a sting operation will claim to have been entrapped, as a number of the Watchmen are poised to do. The defense is nearly always a loser, though it may be the only conceivable defense a suspect has, because a well-run covert investigation won’t leave room for much else.Why are we surprised that entrapment claims tend to be weak even if it appears that the police were deeply involved in the criminal activity charged, to the point of appearing to orchestrate it? It is mainly because media coverage — especially at the pretrial stage, when it is mostly defense lawyers speaking to the press — focuses on the wrong issue.When it comes to entrapment claims, what matters most is the nature of the criminal conduct at issue. The degree of police aggressiveness is a side issue. Indeed, the more serious and potentially violent the crime, the more aggressiveness we expect from the police and their informants.If you’re not focused on the nature of the crime, then any discussion of entrapment escapes the realm of common sense and enters that of a dry, artificial law-school exam.The legal test of entrapment is straightforward. Entrapment is police enticing of a person to commit a crime that the person was not otherwise disposed to commit. Consequently, as a matter of law, there can be no entrapment if the accused (a) proposed or otherwise initiated the crime, or (b) was predisposed to commit the crime, even if the government proposed it.Once that sinks in, it is easy to see why entrapment defenses nearly always fail. If the crime is the accused’s idea, or if the accused is obviously a crook (such as a Mafia member) who is just looking for any opportunity, pitched by anyone, for a criminal payday, then the law doesn’t care how heavy-handed the police investigation was (provided there were no constitutional violations, such as illegal searches or forced confessions).There is rarely much dispute about how a crime was initiated. In covert investigations, most everything an informant does is recorded, so it is a simple thing to show who or what was the catalyst. But if we assume this is arguable, the case is going to come down to predisposition. In a law-school fact pattern, where the professor is testing the student’s grasp of entrapment principles, that could be an interesting question.In the real world, though, it’s usually a silly question, and the more heinous the crime, the more silly the question becomes. Why? Because innately law-abiding people do not get entrapped into committing violent crimes.About a year before I took over the terrorism investigation, the Supreme Court had occasion to revisit its entrapment jurisprudence in Jacobson v. United States (1992). It is an infuriating case. Not because the justices, in a narrow 5-4 ruling, found that the defendant had been entrapped, but because of both the nature of the crime — receiving through the U.S. mail pornography depicting minors (preteen and teenage boys) — and the overbearing conduct of the postal inspectors.Keith Jacobson was basically minding his own business. He bought a legal magazine that depicted nude models not engaged in sexual activity. That was enough to get on the inspectors’ radar. They then spent two and a half years trying to get Jacobson to order child pornography. He repeatedly ignored or refused the entreaties, which mixed vague offers (images of “neophytes,” for example) with political messaging about free expression. U.S. Customs agents jumped in, too, the government apparently figuring some foreign flavor could make the offers more alluring. Finally, Jacobson’s curiosity was piqued by a catalogue the agents sent, offering photos of boys engaged in sexual activities. He ordered . . . and the feds arrested him when he showed up at the post office to claim the package.Jacobson might not have become curious at all had the government not hounded him, time after time, month after month. Was he predisposed? Like a jury, I’m no mind-reader, but I can certainly see that he wasn’t out to hurt anyone. When law-enforcement agents are so bizarrely obsessive about nailing someone who isn’t looking to hurt anyone, it is not hard to see that they have abused their power in trapping the unwary.But that is not a terrorism case. And that is not a kidnap-the-governor case. Could anyone entice you into kidnapping anyone, let alone the governor of a state — and maybe blowing up a bridge while you’re at it? Of course not.To be clear, there is a great deal about the Watchmen case that bears examination. It is reasonable to ask, for example, whether the government is taking legal conduct that progressives find distasteful — e.g., shooting practice, paramilitary exercises, Second Amendment advocacy, and engaging in angry rhetoric about the government — and (at least as to some minor players in the case) whipping it up into a crime without very convincing evidence that those involved agreed to join a kidnapping conspiracy.On that score, the BuzzFeed reporting makes much of the very explicit statements by the informants, which prosecutors will exploit to impute knowledge to the defendants. It is worth noting why informants are trained to speak very explicitly about criminal schemes — something that can be very dangerous, because real criminals become suspicious of accomplices who speak too much and too openly. The FBI knows that, when a case gets to court, defendants are apt to claim lack of knowledge and intent. If the defendants have participated in explicit conversations, however, claims that they were unaware of what was happening, or did not intend any harm, are not credible.That said, a defendant will not be convicted unless the government can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that he understood what was going on and took affirmative steps to further the scheme. A person may not be found guilty because he knows bad actors or was in the vicinity during criminal conversations. There must be proof of knowing, intentional participation.In any event, entrapment claims usually sound a lot stronger in the pretrial stage, when defense lawyers are trying to frame the case for the court of public opinion (including the jury pool), than they do during trial, when the evidence starts mounting in the court of law. Even if entrapment cannot be established, there may still be disturbing aspects of the investigation — are people being targeted for their political views, or is their constitutionally protected conduct being criminalized under the guise of an elastic view of conspiracy? It is too early to tell.Also, even if entrapment cannot be established as a matter of law, it is always possible that jurors will acquit on nullification grounds if the police conduct is over the top — too aggressive, too intrusive, too involved in pushing along a scheme that might not otherwise have been formed.But that is exceedingly rare. Covert tactics are usually reserved for heinous crimes, and the more potentially deadly the crime, the more leeway people are willing to give the police to be aggressive.On that note, one last point. In the eight years from the time the World Trade Center was bombed in 1993 until it was destroyed in 2001, the United States was subjected to a string of jihadist plots and attacks — WTC, the Landmarks, the Bojinka airliners plot, Khobar Towers, the embassies in eastern Africa, the USS Cole, and finally 9/11. The death count is very high.Out of all those terrorist schemes, we managed to stop just one — the Landmarks conspiracy. I’d love to be able to tell you it was because we had better prosecutors and investigators running the case. But we didn’t. The only difference between the Landmarks and the other plots is we had an informant — a brave man who pretended to be a terrorist, infiltrated the cell, and gave us real-time information about what the jihadists were planning.Practically speaking, if the FBI does not use informants, undercover agents, and covert tactics, it cannot prevent horrific crimes. It must be content to prosecute only after they’ve happened and people have been hurt or killed. No one likes the notion of risking the entrapment of the innocent. If a criminal conspiracy is grave, though, there is little chance that an innocent person could be entrapped into it, and a high likelihood that only an informant can thwart it."
1090,Surgeon General Urges Social Media Platforms to Confront COVID Misinformation ‘Wildfire’,0.0,46.0,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/surgeon-general-urges-social-media-platforms-to-confront-covid-misinformation-wildfire/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,www.nationalreview.com,25,"Surgeon General Vivek Murthy on Sunday urged social media companies to confront and snuff out the COVID misinformation “wildfire” circulating on their platforms.“This is about the health of Americans and the reality is that misinformation is still spreading like wildfire in our country, aided and abetted by technology platforms,” Murthy said on Fox News Sunday. “I have been in dialogue with a number of technology companies in good faith efforts to express my concerns to them and where they have taken positive steps. And some of them have, I’ve acknowledged that, as we should do, but what I’ve also said very clearly to them, privately and also publicly, is that it’s not enough.”During a press briefing Thursday, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that the White House was “flagging” COVID misinformation for social media censors. She added Friday that social media platforms should work in concert to ban the purveyors of misinformation.“You shouldn’t be banned from one platform and not others if you — for providing misinformation out there,” she noted.Republicans have objected to the censorship campaign, noting that social media companies’ definition of ‘misinformation’ is ever-evolving and subjective. For instance, in May Facebook reversed a policy that prohibited content referencing the theory that COVID originated in a laboratory accident in Wuhan, China, after flagging those posts as conspiracy for many months.With the White House missing consecutive vaccination targets, it is pursuing a more aggressive approach to convince the remainder of the population to get vaccinated by holding tech companies accountable for allowing misinformation to spread on their platforms.“They’re killing people,” President Biden told reporters Friday in response to a question about Facebook. “The only pandemic we have is among the unvaccinated, and they’re killing people.”"
1091,College Republicans Poised for Splinter after ‘Stolen’ Election,0.0,42.33,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/college-republicans-poised-for-splinter-after-stolen-election/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-17,www.nationalreview.com,25,"The election is over, but the stakes are still quite high.Courtney Britt, the candidate who incumbent College Republican National Committee Chairman Chandler Thornton hoped would succeed him, triumphed today over Judah Waxelbaum. Only about 60 percent of CRNC affiliates cast ballots, though: A consequence of the maneuvering detailed earlier this week by National Review.In her acceptance speech, a less-than-a-minute address kept short as a courtesy to delegates who had already spent nearly seven hours on the call, Britt purported to be excited to work with “all” state federations.She spent much of the day, however, voting not to allow numerous states — which had been sidelined over disputed credentialing issues — representation in the chairman’s race. It is widely believed that Waxelbaum would have had a sizable majority had all 52 eligible federations cast ballots. Just over 30 were actually allowed to.Supporters of Waxelbaum forced the eligible states, as well as the CRNC board, to vote on every single previously disqualified affiliate. Each time, the result was the same, and no states were readmitted into the process.In a brief statement afterward, Waxelbaum decried the limits on participation and urged federations that feel disenfranchised to “seek independence.”Ryan Silverstein, president of the Sacred Heart College Republicans, lamented that “the CRNC refusing to seat Connecticut and 18 other states’ delegates is a slap in the face to the low level volunteers like me and my friends who spent our weekends for 7-8 weeks in the 2020 election cycle trying to keep America red.”At one point, a debate broke out over Arkansas being stripped of its votes last Sunday under allegations of voter fraud in its state chairman election; the state’s actual party chairman has weighed in on the matter, assuring the CRNC that everything was on the up and up. Nevertheless, Britt — a graduate of Richmond Law School — argued that the state should remain disenfranchised since it hadn’t presented evidence that fraud had not occurred.Ty Seymour, national treasurer on Thornton’s board, delivered perhaps the most memorable speech of the day: A searing indictment of national leadership that laid at their feet allegations of “flagrant constitutional violations,” “intimidation,” and bribes. Seymour also told the audience that members of the board had manufactured false charges of sexual assault to take down their political opponents.“I genuinely pray to God that  every CR in attendance will come to their senses and open their eyes to see the institutional decay that this organization is undergoing,” said an emotional Seymour.“Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely and I want to thank Chandler Thornton, our national chairman and Courtney Britt, the candidate for national office for affirming that belief,” he finished.Thornton’s address included a dismissal of Seymour’s claims, but did not go into specifics. “I will not elevate these false, defamatory claims,” he declared.Now, the theater of battle shifts. Britt will take over in 72 hours, but her organization may be significantly smaller by then. Within minutes of her election, both the New York and Texas federations announced that they would be meeting to discuss secession. Brandon Kiser, chairman of the Texas federation, was adamant in a statement he provided to National Review: “I don’t want to get into the details of this stolen election. My focus now is on TXFCR, our chapters, our members, and our future. Texas doesn’t tolerate corruption and fraud. We are going to vote on leaving the CRNC to ensure moral leadership of our organization, and a focus on winning in 2022.”Asked if he planned on spearheading a new national organization, Kiser was noncommittal, offering that “our focus right now is solely on Texas. If and when the proper time comes to consider a next step, we’ll consider all our options.”Augustus LeRoux, Kiser’s counterpart in New York, was equally sure that secession was around the corner, but seemed slightly more optimistic about starting up a direct competitor to the CRNC: “We are entertaining the idea of a new national organization, but I can’t give any more specifics than that.”The developments suggest that Britt will have her work cut out in order to mend fences and prevent the organization she now leads from fracturing further.Students from multiple other federations have also told National Review that they are considering leaving. One person connected with the Waxelbaum campaign implied that Florida and California are likely to withdraw from the CRNC. That would mean the organization would lack representation in the four largest states."
1092,Hunter Biden’s Prosecutor Delayed Escalating Probe amid Presidential Race,12.33,32.33,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/hunter-bidens-prosecutor-delayed-escalating-probe-amid-presidential-race/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-16,www.nationalreview.com,25,"As the 2020 presidential race heated up last summer, the federal probe into Hunter Biden’s tax filings and overseas business dealings was gaining steam, but the prosecutor in charge waited to issue grand jury subpoenas and request search warrants until the race ended.The U.S. Attorney’s office had been investigating allegations that the president’s son was engaged in pay-for-play Chinese business engagements, potential money laundering, violations of the Foreign Agents Registration Act, and tax evasion. The latter allegation, tax evasion, ultimately became the center of the probe, a person familiar with it told Politico.While some officials wanted to escalate the inquiry, others cautioned Delaware’s U.S. Attorney, David Weiss, against pursuing the case more aggressively amid a presidential election. In 2018, former President Trump nominated Weiss to serve as U.S. attorney.“To his credit, he listened,” a person familiar with the discussions told Politico. Weiss decided to delay any actions until after the presidential race concluded, so as to avoid making the prosecution the subject of political intrigue.“It was a close call,” the person said. “That case has way more credibility now.”The probe remained outside the mainstream media spotlight until several weeks after President Biden was declared the winner. Hunter Biden then released a statement downplaying the probe as pertaining exclusively to tax issues and acknowledging that Weiss had notified him of the investigation. Some Republicans demanded that a special prosecutor be appointed to conduct it, but Trumps’ Attorney General William Barr dismissed those calls.In addition to the tax fraud probe, Weiss’s office is also conducting an accompanying investigation into work that Blue Star Strategies, a Democratic lobbying firm, did for Burisma, the Ukrainian energy firm for which Hunter Biden formerly served as a board member. Politico first reported on the Blue Star inquiry last month.“David is the type of lawyer who follows the facts and whatever the facts may lead to,”  Tom Ostrander, a law firm partner who worked with Weiss while he prosecuted a murder case dealing with one of Delaware’s leading political families, told Politico. “It doesn’t matter who the person is he’s looking into.”"
1093,Protests Erupt at Los Angeles Spa over Transgender Access Policy,0.0,44.67,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/protests-erupt-at-los-angeles-spa-over-transgender-access-policy/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,www.nationalreview.com,25,"Dueling protests erupted in front of a Los Angeles spa Saturday over the establishment’s transgender access policy.The demonstration was sparked by a video that was posted earlier this month, in which a customer complained to the Wi Spa workers after they allowed a biological male to expose his penis in the women’s area of the spa. The business stood by its policy of admitting transgender clientele, spurring objections, the Los Angeles Times reported.Protestors both opposing and supporting the spa’s position convened in LA for a rally that turned unruly, after some participants started hurling smoke bombs and other objects at police, Detective Meghan Aguilar, a spokeswoman for the LAPD, told ABC News.Video footage posted to Twitter shows law enforcement officers trying to contain the unrest, hitting protesters with batons and shooting off bean bag rounds and other projectiles. Police declared the gathering an unlawful assembly and demanded those involved clear the area but many refused. Several dozen arrests were made for defying orders to leave. Police said later they recovered stun guns, knives and pepper spray from the protest on the street.The Los Angeles spa controversy exemplifies a growing schism in the U.S. over whether biological males should have access to spaces previously reversed for females. A number of Republican-dominated states have attempted to pass legislation barring transgender individuals from accessing the bathroom of the opposite biological sex.Last week, a federal judge blocked a Tennessee law mandating that businesses post a notice to inform customers if they allow transgender people to use bathrooms based on their gender identity rather than their biological sex."

1095,"Reading, Writing, and Racism: the NEA’s Campaign to Gaslight Parents",18.67,24.0,https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/07/reading-writing-and-racism-the-neas-campaign-to-gaslight-parents/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,www.nationalreview.com,25,"American moms and dads now know that forcing critical race theory onto children is a priority for teachers’ unions.Twenty twenty-one is shaping up to be the year of one of the largest grassroots movements since the Tea Party movement in 2009. Millions of parents across the country are fighting back against the spread of critical race theory (CRT) in their schools, recognizing it as a dangerous ideological movement meant to divide Americans. The movement is so widespread that CRT was Googled more in June than Joe Biden. Understandably, parents are upset that some teachers are telling white students that they are perpetuating racism while telling black children they are locked out of the American dream.While the Left pretends this racist ideology isn’t being taught in grade school, new business items adopted by the National Education Association, the nation’s largest teachers’ union, show that there is a coordinated effort by the education establishment to force teachers to promote CRT in the classroom and to work to destroy its critics.Let’s rewind to last year, when parents participating in their children’s at-home learning received a front-row seat in their children’s classrooms for the first time. What they saw disturbed them. Instead of trying to improve America’s failing grades on math and science, schools spent class time indoctrinating kindergartners, teaching five-year-olds about “racist police,” and telling students that “all white people play a part in perpetuating systemic racism.”That was the spark for a nationwide movement to reject racist, neo-Marxist teaching that spread like wildfire. Parents in places such as Loudoun County, Va., are rightly outraged that their children are being taught the racist ideology of CRT. They’re heading to school-board meetings and state houses to reject CRT and keep it out of their children’s classrooms. Thousands of parents have used Heritage Action’s CRT e-book to understand what CRT is, identify it in their community’s schools, and issue FOIA requests to expose how school administrators are promoting CRT.Their activism is working: This year, over 20 states have passed or proposed laws preventing CRT and other racially based ideologies from being forced into our schools.As this nationwide movement reached critical mass, the Left scrambled to defend their extreme, wildly unpopular ideology. So CRT supporters brought in the big guns: the National Education Association. At their annual conference last weekend, the nation’s largest teachers’ union announced a six-figure campaign to “have a team of staffers for members who want to learn more and fight back against anti-CRT rhetoric” and an official position that “in teaching these topics, it is reasonable and appropriate for curriculum to be informed by academic frameworks for understanding and interpreting the impact of the past on current society, including critical race theory [emphasis ours].” The announcement exposed the source of CRT in schools: not necessarily individual teachers, but a coordinated left-wing campaign that includes massive teachers’ unions.Pushing CRT in schools behind the scenes wasn’t enough for these teachers’ unions, however. They doubled down and are attacking the groups opposing their agenda. A separate business item, costing nearly $60,000 in new union dues, was also adopted:NEA will research the organizations attacking educators doing anti-racist work and/or use the research already done and put together a list of resources and recommendations for state affiliates, locals, and individual educators to utilize when they are attacked.Which organization did they single out? The Heritage Foundation, Heritage Action’s partner organization and the leading conservative think tank exposing CRT.The official left-wing talking point, “CRT is not being taught in schools,” was repeated ad nauseam over the last two months by liberal think tanks, the mainstream media, and progressive politicians alike, in an attempt to gaslight Americans and convince them that they were crazy for wanting to protect their children from the Left’s indoctrination. But the NEA resolution destroyed that narrative — and their woke allies noticed. Soon after the NEA convention concluded on July 3, they removed every business item from their site, including all items mentioning CRT.I noticed the deletion within an hour, and Heritage Action immediately spread the word. Soon after the news broke, the NEA redirected the old links to their homepage. But this flimsy cover-up attempt was too little, too late: Parents nationwide have concrete proof that the education and progressive political establishment are willing to support racist CRT education, lie to Americans about its presence in their children’s schools, and then delete their pro-CRT stance to cover their tracks.American parents aren’t falling for it. They know that CRT-based curricula are infiltrating their schools, and they overwhelmingly reject it. According to polling conducted by Heritage Action, 79 percent of voters say children should be taught about the American dream instead of the idea that their destiny is tied to their skin color, and 61 percent reject the idea that America is “fundamentally a racist country.” As more parents begin to learn about what CRT really is, they will continue to reject it.While sunlight is the best disinfectant, there’s more to be done. Parents can’t do it alone: School boards, state legislators, and members of Congress must join the fight and enact laws that prohibit racist CRT from being taught in our schools. Conservatives in Washington are putting CRT advocates on notice: Representative Dan Bishop (R., N.C.) has introduced two bills that would defund CRT in our military and in our schools. Representative Chip Roy (R., Texas) has introduced the Combatting Racist Teaching in Schools Act to prevent federal funding from going to schools that force teachers and students to adhere to ideologies like CRT that teach discrimination based on skin color, in violation of the Civil Rights Act. Senator Tom Cotton has introduced a similar bill, the Combatting Racist Training in the Military Act. There are further steps conservatives can take: While House Democrats will likely prevent the above bills from coming up for a vote, Republicans should work to insert language into the must-pass National Defense Authorization Act to ensure defense funds don’t go to the indoctrination of our military.This battle won’t be easy. Grassroots Americans are going head-to-head with some of the nation’s most well-funded and politically connected organizations. The American Federation of Teachers has added $2.5 million to their legal fund to “defend” teachers who insist on breaking the law and indoctrinating students against the will of their parents — even while insisting that CRT is not being taught. Under Biden’s “whole-of-government equity agenda,” the Department of Education is directing grant money to schools for “culturally responsive education.”The good news: Americans are on our side. Not a week goes by without reports of parents organizing rallies or running for election to their school board. America’s parents won’t be deterred by the empty rhetoric and strong-arm tactics coming from teachers’ unions and their multi-million-dollar war chest.Will Americans choose to side with an education establishment that promotes racist ideologies to our children, lies to parents about it, and then campaigns to silence dissidents? Or will they side with concerned parents of all colors and creeds who would rather see our schools educate than indoctrinate? I have a feeling Americans will choose the latter — and I think the teachers’ unions know it."
1096,Judge Blocks Tennessee’s Transgender Bathroom Sign Law,1.33,44.0,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/judge-blocks-tennessees-transgender-bathroom-sign-law/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-10,www.nationalreview.com,25,"A federal judge on Friday blocked a Tennessee law that required businesses to post a notice if they allow transgender people to use bathrooms based on their gender identity rather than their biological sex.The law requires that bold, uppercase letter signage must be posted outside multi-person bathrooms that transgender individuals are allowed to use based on their gender identity.Business owners must post a sign that reads, “This facility maintains a policy of allowing the use of restrooms by either biological sex regardless of the designation on the restroom,” at the entrance of single-sex public restrooms, locker rooms, dressing areas, or other facilities that are “designated for a specific biological sex . . . where a person would have a reasonable expectation of privacy.”The ruling comes as part of a lawsuit by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of two Tennessee business owners. The suit, filed late last month, sought to prevent the rule from going into effect on July 1.On Friday, Middle District of Tennessee judge Aleta A. Trauger ruled in favor of the ACLU and issued a temporary injunction against the law.“The plaintiffs have presented evidence that they have strived to be welcoming spaces for communities that include transgender individuals and that the signage required by the Act would disrupt the welcoming environments that they wish to provide,” Trauger wrote in the ruling. “That harm would be real, and it is not a harm that could simply be remedied by some award at the end of litigation.”Kye Sayers, owner of Sanctuary Performing Arts who challenged the new law with the help of the ACLU, said she is glad that the court “saw that forcing businesses to display a sign that hurts transgender and intersex people is unconstitutional,” according to NBC News.Tennessee state representative Tim Rudd (R) said during legislative debate in May that the measure is intended to protect women and children “against sexual predators that could be taking advantage of policies, executive orders or legislation that may allow the opposite sex to enter a restroom, shower or locker room,” according to the Chattanooga Times Free Press.A second suit was filed against the law last week, by a Nashville record-label owner who is represented by GLBTQ Legal Advocates and Defenders."
1097,Former Obama Ethics Chief: Hunter Biden Art-Selling Arrangement ‘Perfect Mechanism for Funneling Bribes’,7.67,37.0,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/former-obama-ethics-chief-hunter-biden-art-selling-arrangement-perfect-mechanism-for-funneling-bribes/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-09,www.nationalreview.com,25,"During an appearance on CNN on Friday, former Obama-era Office of Government Ethics chief Walter Shaub called the White House’s arrangement allowing Hunter Biden to sell his art “the perfect mechanism for funneling bribes” to the president.Shaub’s statement comes amid the development that the White House crafted a deal under which the price tags of Hunter Biden’s artwork sales, some listing as high as $500,000, will be obscured from the artist to prevent ethical violations.Per the contract, New York gallery owner Georges Bergès will set the prices for the art and also will conceal related records such as prospective bidders and buyers. Bergès has promised to refuse extraordinary offers far exceeding the asking price or those that he deems suspect, sources first told the Washington Post. The president’s son’s art sale, expected to be held this fall, has been subject to criticism amid concerns that the market he’s dabbling in has a reputation for corruption and shady business activity.“They have outsourced government ethics to an art dealer. She mentioned industry standards,” Shaub said in reference to comments by White House press secretary Jen Psaki. “It’s an industry that’s notorious for money laundering. There’s no standards in that industry,” he said during the interview.“The idea that they’re going to flag any overly priced offers — well, this is art that hasn’t even been juried into a community art sale. How are they going to decide what’s unreasonable when they’ve already priced it in the range of $75,000 to $500,000 for a first outing? This is just preposterous and very disappointing,” the Obama official said.Psaki said during a press briefing Friday that Biden has every right to pursue a new career like any other previous president’s child. She said the White House’s appointing itself the intermediary in the arrangement would help the Biden family avoid running afoul of ethics concerns. Shaub disputed that.When asked for his opinion on the White House decision, Shaub replied, “They’ve absolutely made it worse, for two reasons. One: What they’ve done is ensure that neither you nor I nor anyone watching this show will know who buys the art unless they share it publicly.“There’s nothing we can do to monitor to make sure that Hunter Biden or anyone in the White House doesn’t find out that the dealer keeps his or her promise, that the buyers don’t call the White House, ask for a meeting, and say ‘Hey, I just bought the president’s son’s art for $500,000,'” he added.Ethics experts have contended that Hunter Biden’s artwork wouldn’t have had the enormous price tag if not for his last name and family connection to the sitting executive. They have suggested that the buyers of his creations are unlikely to be real art-appreciating connoisseurs or collectors but rather individuals looking to purchase clout, preferential treatment, and influence.“It’s got the absolute appearance that he’s profiting off his father’s fame. He’s not selling under a pseudonym, he’s not waiting until his father’s out of office, and he’s not selling at any price comparable to what other first-time artists are selling,” Shaub said.“The problem is, now they’ve set a precedent for the next president. And even if you happen to trust Joe Biden, what if the next president has the character of a Donald Trump? This would be a perfect mechanism for funneling bribes to that president,” the former ethics head concluded.Hunter Biden is already entrenched in a number of scandals and investigations, including one into his allegedly falsifying a firearm application form, his foreign business dealings, and his tax filings."
1098,Why Is Naming Sports Teams after Europeans Any Better?,6.33,32.67,https://www.nationalreview.com/2021/07/why-is-naming-sports-teams-after-europeans-any-better/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-24,www.nationalreview.com,25,"Our great-grandchildren are liable to recognize our chauvinism and wonder.‘Cleveland Guardians” it will be. The news arrived on Friday, July 23, the day after the 225th anniversary of the city’s founding by a crew of Connecticut WASPs, who, having anchored on the southern shore of Lake Erie, gave the native people of the neighborhood not much say in the matter. A fan since childhood, I’d been dreading this moment since the front office confirmed, in December, that the Major League Baseball franchise in Cleveland would shed its longstanding nickname, Indians, after the 2021 season.At this point, you’re liable to assume that I’ll spend the rest of this essay shaking my fist at left-wing social-justice warriors. It’s tempting. Be assured, I have words as well for culture warriors on the right who agreed to join the battle over the oldest sports tradition in that proud, misunderstood city on the banks of the Cuyahoga River. To those who began to wear the old colors and to flash the retired symbols not for love of the team but to own the libs, I say, “That’s when I knew the game was over.” Stay tuned for more on that.First, a few observations about “the Indians.” It was elegant, tall and slender, the only one of the league’s 30 nicknames to begin with that trimmest of capital letters, I. The assonance with “Cleveland” touched you whether you were conscious of it or not: —and Ind—.The reasons most often cited for objecting to “Indians” never added up, as you noticed if you calculated with a close eye and an open mind. Let’s run through the two main reasons, quickly.To name a sports team after an ethnicity is to demean the ethnicity. Unless, apparently, we’re talking about northwestern Europeans — Vikings, Celtics, Yankees, Fighting Irish.If you say that it isn’t racist to name a team after certain European ethnicities, I don’t disagree. If you then maintain that it is racist to name a team after a people whom European settler-colonizers displaced, please explain.Look: On the ground, in the stands, at home in front of the screen, the anthropological associations evoked by such team names as “Vikings” and “Indians” are pretty thin. When we talk about the NBA franchise in Boston, we’re no more likely to think of the Indo-European peoples designated by the term “Celtic” than we are to think of Franciscan priests when talking about the MLB franchise in San Diego.The culture war, of course, demands that we pretend otherwise, at least in some cases. Over the years, to no avail, I’ve asked friends and foes to make explicit the logic that leads them to aver that “Indians” is a racist team name but that “Yankees,” for example, is not. They’ve left me to do the work for them. Here goes:Since our premise is that it’s demeaning to a people to attach their name to a sports team, to do so when the people in question are not at the bottom of a presumed status hierarchy has a leveling effect: The distance between them and those deemed to have suffered greater historical humiliation is reduced. The principle of equality is thereby served.But follow the logic to the other end. Shouldn’t we want to have teams called “the White Anglo-Saxon Protestants,” to take the colonizers down a peg? How about “the Conquistadors”?That would be a lot of weight to put on our premise. We don’t even try, since we intuit that the premise would collapse under the burden. We go only so far as to embrace teams named after certain subcategories of whites and to insist that any team named after a defeated and subjugated nonwhite people undertake a makeover, like immigrants from southern and eastern Europe who Anglicized their surnames after a few years in America in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Let me tell you about my relatives named Franks.“Remember when teams were named after American Indians?”“Eww. How cringe. Go Vikings!”I suspect that our great-grandchildren will recognize the chauvinism and wonder.American Indians object — it’s their name, and we disrespect them by appropriating it. Most American Indians don’t object, to judge from most, though not all, polling on related questions. I’m not aware of any polling that’s been done directly on the name of the Cleveland Indians. In 2016, in a Washington Post poll, it was reported that 90 percent of American Indians did not object to the name of the Washington Redskins. The finding matched that of a poll conducted by the Annenberg Public Policy Center in 2004.In 2020, however, researchers at Berkeley and Ann Arbor published findings sharply at odds with all that: Two-thirds of American Indians whose engagement with tribal culture was heavy considered the name “Redskins” offensive; even among those whose engagement with it was light, 40 percent were offended, four times the figure given by the polls from four and 16 years earlier. One of the authors of the 2020 poll argued that theirs was more rigorously constructed and therefore more reliable than that of the Post, but an interviewer for the Washingtonian touched on, in passing, a more piquant possibility: that the opinion of American Indians had shifted, in tandem with that of the general public, toward the position that many tribal leaders and activists had long advocated even when the bulk of their constituencies appeared not to have been following them on that issue.The earliest public expression of American Indian opposition to the name and branding of the Cleveland MLB franchise came from Russell Means, an activist, in the early 1970s. For many years the cause was widely perceived as fringe — Means was passionate but unpolished. He could come off as a blowhard. Those who celebrate his posthumous victory (he died in 2012) may be inclined to assume that he prevailed because we the public finally caught up with a truth that he made us see. That truth, though, is not correct. Neither is it incorrect. It belongs to the category of interpretation, not fact. Means looked at the name “Indians” on the uniforms of the Cleveland baseball club and saw an ugliness. In the early days of his effort, most others did not. He insisted. He persisted. A critical mass slowly came around to his point of view.You’ve seen Rubin’s vase, the ambiguous illustration that looks like a chalice and equally like two faces in profile opposite each other, nose to nose. Most of us at first see only one of the two depictions. We see the other when it’s pointed out to us. Then we’re able to switch rapidly, seeing the chalice one moment and, the next, the faces in profile.Means and his peers taught us to see the name “Indians” in a new, unflattering light. Those of us who admit that we continue to see the name in the old, golden light as well and to appreciate its halo are scolded and mocked. We may lie and say we don’t notice what we notice. Or we may refuse to affirm or deny it, opting instead, as the Cleveland front office has done, to deflect the censorious attention of the racial-sensitivity squad of the morality police: “Hey, how ’bout them Guardians!”In hindsight, we can see that the anti-Indians campaign gained momentum earlier than we realized at the time, when fans began to be cornered into making one of two possible unsatisfactory moves. The first was to let go — a rose by any other name, after all. The second possible move was to fight for the name, like a dog for a bone, succumbing to the distraction. We would take and keep our eyes off the prize, which is to win the World Series. Remember baseball?To culture-warrior friends on the right who think I’ve surrendered by acknowledging that the side we’re against won and won quite some time ago, I offer this familiar wisdom from T. S. Eliot:If we take the widest and wisest view of a Cause, there is no such thing as a Lost Cause because there is no such thing as a Gained Cause. We fight for lost causes because we know that our defeat and dismay may be the preface to our successors’ victory, though that victory itself will be temporary; we fight rather to keep something alive than in the expectation that anything will triumph."
1099,Independent Source Confirms Authenticity of Damning Hunter Biden Emails,26.0,22.33,https://www.nationalreview.com/news/independent-source-confirms-authenticity-of-damning-hunter-biden-emails/,https://adfontesmedia.com/national-review-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-21,www.nationalreview.com,25,"Two crucial emails included among the material reportedly taken from Hunter Biden’s laptop last year are genuine, according to new evidence presented in the book The Bidens by Politico reporter Ben Schreckinger.A 2015 email from Ukrainian businessman Vadym Pozharsky thanking Hunter Biden for “giving an opportunity to meet your father and spent [sic] some time together” is genuine, according to a person described in Politico Playbook as having “independent access” to Hunter’s emails. Pozharsky was an adviser to Burisma Holdings, the Ukrainian natural gas company on whose board Hunter Biden sat while his father was vice president.A second email from 2017 that reportedly outlines a deal between the Biden family and a now-defunct Chinese energy company is also real, the person said. That email, sent by Biden business partner James Gillar, includes the line “10 held by H for the big guy?” which Tony Bobulinski — Hunter Biden’s former business partner and a recipient on the email — said referred to Hunter holding a 10 percent stake in the deal for Joe Biden.Both emails were first reported by the New York Post, which purportedly recovered them from a laptop that Hunter left at a repair shop in Delaware and never retrieved.Shreckinger’s source remembered viewing both emails but was not able to compare the text leaked to the Post with the original emails. Other emails from the leaked files matched a cache of emails released by a Swedish government agency, two people who communicated with Hunter Biden said.President Biden has insisted that he was never involved in his son’s business dealings.Citing its hacked materials policy, Twitter censored the damning New York Post article that exposed the emails in the run up to the 2020 presidential election, blocking users from tweeting out a link to the story and from direct messaging it to other users. The Federal Elections Commission recently ruled that the censorship was not politically motivated and therefore did not qualify as an illegal in-kind contribution to the Biden campaign.The president’s son is currently attempting to sell paintings at galleries run by art dealer Georges Bergès. The White House has agreed to an arrangement whereby the buyers will remain anonymous, however the high price of the paintings, some of which could sell for up to $500,000, has raised eyebrows.“There is simply no way an artist who has never even juried into a community center art fair is going to suddenly show up in New York selling art for half a million a pop,” former Office of Government Ethics head Walter Shaub said on Law & Crime’s Objections podcast in August.Shaub told CNN in July that the arrangement was “the perfect mechanism for funneling bribes.”"

The campaign to recall Governor Mike Dunleavy, who has about 17 months left in his term, is legal and may proceed, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled. Whether Dunleavy's detractors have made their case that his alleged shortcomings - that he is incompetent and corrupt - justify his removal from office is up to the voters, the court said. “The people asked to sign petitions must decide whether the allegations are serious enough to warrant a recall election; each voter in the voting booth must decide whether the allegations are serious enough to warrant removal from office,” the opinion said. Dunleavy, a former teacher, school administrator and legislator representing Wasilla, was elected governor in 2018, positioning himself as a political acolyte of then-U.S. President Donald Trump. His tenure has been rocky as Alaska struggled with financial difficulties and its dependence on dwindling oil revenues. The governor's foes argue that he deserves to be recalled because he is unfit and has abused his power. Among grounds cited by recall supporters, Duleavy is accused of illegally using his budget veto to punish judges for abortion-rights rulings and violating ethics laws by using state funds for partisan campaign purposes. To qualify a gubernatorial recall for the Alaska ballot, campaigners must satisfy a two-phase test, gathering petition signatures totaling 10 percent of votes cast in the previous statewide election and, subsequently, gathering signatures totaling 25 percent of the votes cast. The Recall Dunleavy campaign reported it had 81 percent of the required second-phase signatures as of April. In a statement Friday, Dunleavy blasted the court’s ruling, saying it will subject elected officials “to baseless, expensive, and distracting recall elections by their political opponents.” Dunleavy faced problems other than the recall threat. In a showdown with the legislature, he vetoed this year’s entire Alaska Permanent Fund dividend, a cherished oil-wealth payout to residents made annually since 1982. This week CNBC ranked Alaska’s business climate dead last among all 50 U.S. states. CNBC cited Dunleavy’s actions specifically, saying he “relentlessly slashed” University of Alaska funding and made other poor decisions."
1176,U.S. senators drop tax enforcement from bipartisan infrastructure bill -Portman,0.0,43.33,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-senators-drop-tax-enforcement-bipartisan-infrastructure-bill-portman-2021-07-18/,https://adfontesmedia.com/reuters-bias-and-reliability/,2021-07-18,www.reuters.com,25,"WASHINGTON, July 18 (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers trying to salvage a $1.2 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill have dropped a provision to beef up tax enforcement, Republican Senator Rob Portman said on Sunday, setting aside a significant revenue-raising measure. The provision, aimed at increasing Internal Revenue Service (IRS) collections, will instead likely be added to a separate budget 'reconciliation' bill being pushed by Democrats as a vehicle for passing trillions of dollars more in spending and tax increases, Portman said on CNN's State of the Union program. President Joe Biden has said he wants to invest $80 billion in IRS technology and enforcement to increase collections of taxes by $700 billion over 10 years. The provision outlined in the infrastructure bill would account for around $100 billion of that larger goal, according to Democratic senators' estimates. The decision to exclude the IRS provision from the $1.2 trillion infrastructure bill comes as senators and the White House are trying to negotiate the final details of the package ahead of a key procedural vote planned for Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said he wants to hold a 'cloture' vote to meet the 60-vote threshold needed to end debate and allow the infrastructure bill to proceed to a final vote. 'In terms of IRS reform or IRS tax gap, which was originally in the proposal, that will no longer be in our proposal. It will be in the larger reconciliation bill we're told,' said Portman, who is among senators working to negotiate the legislation. Portman said that there was Republican 'pushback' against the IRS proposal after the party learned that Democrats were also planning to add a bigger IRS enforcement proposal into the separate reconciliation spending bill. Democrats hope to pass the reconciliation bill without Republican support under budget rules that allow them to proceed with just a simple majority, which would require them to use the tie breaking vote of Vice President Kamala Harris. 'That created quite a problem,' said Portman said, because Republicans believed they had agreed with Democrats on the full extent of IRS enforcement in the infrastructure bill. 'And President Biden, to his credit, said we will not be re-negotiating these items in the reconciliation package.' Republican Senator Bill Cassidy, who is also among the infrastructure bill's negotiators, said it was unclear if they would be able to proceed with Wednesday's procedural vote. He told Fox News Sunday that the deal could proceed alongside Democrats' larger reconciliation bill if the right revenue measures to pay for it could be found. Wednesday's vote would require 60 votes in the Senate to proceed, meaning it would need the support of at least 10 Republicans, assuming all Democrats support it. 'How can I vote for cloture when the bill isn't written?' Cassidy said. 'Unless Senator Schumer doesn't want this to happen, you need a little more time to get it right.' Schumer, speaking to reporters in New York on Sunday, said there was 'no reason' that the bipartisan group negotiating the infrastructure package could not come to an agreement by Wednesday."

Lee was taken down in Charlottesville, Virginia, on Saturday, nearly four years after white supremacist protests over plans to remove it led to clashes in which a woman was run down by a car and killed. Shortly after the removal of the Lee statue, a statue of Confederate General Thomas 'Stonewall' Jackson was also removed from its base in another city park. Onlookers who had gathered hours earlier cheered as the statues were loaded onto trucks and driven away. Statues honoring leaders of the pro-slavery Confederate side in the American Civil War have become a focus of protests against racism in recent years. The college town's planned removal of the Lee statue in 2017 prompted a rally by white supremacists that turned deadly when a car driven into a crowd by a self-described neo-Nazi killed a counter-protester, 32-year-old Heather Heyer. Weeks later the Charlottesville city council unanimously ordered the Jackson statue to be removed. Citizens including the Virginia Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans sued Charlottesville over the removal plans. In April, Virginia's highest court ruled the city could remove, opens new tab both Confederate statues, overturning a state Circuit Court decision that had upheld the citizen lawsuit. Charlottesville will keep the statues in storage until it makes a final decision about what to do with them, officials said in a statement on Friday. The city installed protective fencing and designated no-parking zones around the parks in anticipation of Saturday's removals, the statement said. Asked whether the city was aware of any planned protests, city spokesman Brian Wheeler said, 'an indication of how we feel about this is, we're inviting the public to join us in the park.' 'We think a lot of our community members really want to be there to see this happen.'."

The three Texas House Democratic lawmakers had been vaccinated against the coronavirus, but tested positive over the last 24 hours, according to a caucus statement. Vice President Kamala Harris had met on Tuesday with two of the lawmakers who have since tested positive. Based on the timeline of the test results, 'it was determined the vice president and her staff present at the meeting were not at risk of exposure because they were not in close contact with those who tested positive and therefore do not need to be tested or quarantined,' Harris' spokesperson Symone Sanders said in a statement. 'The vice president and her staff are fully vaccinated,' Sanders added. Texas state Representative Ron Reynolds, one of the Democrats who traveled to Washington, told MSNBC the test results were cause for caution. 'We are taking these positive confirmations very seriously,' Reynolds said. 'We're following all CDC guidelines and ... we are going to make sure that we don't expose anyone.'. COVID-19 cases in the United States have surged over the past week with new cases up 70% and deaths rising 26%. Some members of the Texas delegation met over the past week in Washington not only with Harris but also with congressional Democratic leaders including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer. Schumer's office, in a separate statement, said it was informed that none of the Texas lawmakers who tested positive for COVID-19 had had contact with him or his staff."

Maybe he won't even have to wait until 2024. During an interview with Trump Friday, radio hostWayne Allen Root pitchedthe idea of Trump becoming speaker of the House in 2023 and leading the MAGA-desired impeachment of President Joe Biden.Why not, instead of waiting for 2024, and I'm hoping you'll run in 2024 but why not run in 2022 for the United States Congress? A House seat in Florida. Win big. Lead us to a dramatic landslide victory. Take the House by 50 seats. And then you become the Speaker of the House, lead the impeachment of Biden and start criminal investigations against Biden. You'll wipe him out for this last two years.""Root was excited while describing this reality TV version of ""House Of Cards."" Trump thought this was very “interesting,"" because he's all about immediate gratification. Root claimed Trump would be a “folk hero"" as speaker, which is just how we think of past GOP House speakers: Dennis Hastert, Folk Hero! Newt Gingrich, Folk Hero!A few months ago, Steve Bannon suggested a similar scheme in a speech stuffed with messianic imagery.Trump is a disruptor, but he has a long-term vision because I absolutely believe in the marrow of my bones that he will be our nominee in 2024. He'll come back to us. We'll have a sweeping victory in 2022, and he'll lead us in 2024.""“He'll come back to us!"" This is pathetic but slightly amusing if you imagine House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy freaking out over the possibility that Trump will swipe the speaker's gavel from him. He'ssacrificed whatever dignity he might've hadto keep Trump happy so Republicans can take back the House and Senate. McCarthy had hoped he'd get toput his feet up on Nancy Pelosi's desklike a common seditionist Capitol invader.The speaker of the House is areal job with responsibilities.There's even counting involved. This is all beyond Trump, who prefers headlining hate rallies when not binge-watching Fox News,Newsmax,and OAN. Bannon declared that Trump's first act as speaker would be to “impeach Joe Biden for his illegitimate activities of stealing the presidency."" Biden didn't steal the presidency. That's theRepublican Big Lie,but if a grand jury can indict a ham sandwich, a corrupt authoritarian political party can impeach a legitimately elected president for imaginary “crimes.""Trump was impeached in both 2020 and 2021. He's to impeachments what Tom Hanks was to the Oscars in the mid 1990s. However, the Senate never came close to convicting Trump and removing him from office. This is not because Pam Bondi and Bruce Castor are great lawyers. No, they bothdemonstrably sucked.Remember this shit?During Trump's second annual impeachment trial, thereleased a video called “The Strangest Lines From Trump Lawyer Bruce Castor's Opening Statement."" That was not a highlight reel. It was more likeMarv Albert's sports bloopersfrom the 1980s.It takes 67 votes in the Senate to convict an impeached president. The GOP won't have anywhere near 67 Senators in 2023, even if you throw in Joe Manchin andKyrsten Sinema.The sedition caucus can impeach President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, andeven Barack Obama,but that won't “reinstate"" Trump. It'll just waste everyone's time and distract Republicans from their inspiring agenda of lowering taxes for billionaires and saving Mr. Potato Head from ""cancel culture.""Impeachment itself isn't a slam dunk. An appalling139 House Republicans objectedto the Electoral College count on January 6, but that's still far short of a majority. Also, many Republicans felt they could safely spit in democracy's eye because they knew they didn't have enough votes to actually reject the count.Ten incumbent Republicansvoted to impeach Trump after he incited a violent insurrection, so he'd need a major MAGA wave to achieve his mad dream.But Trump released a fundraising video this weekend where he creepily hinted at""taking back the White House and sooner than you think.""He's still got sedition on the brain. The Constitution doesn't actually require that the speaker is a current member of the House, so Trump doesn't even have to bother running for anything. Republicans can elect whoever they want, including a twice-impeached thug.Fox's Jason Chaffetz: ""Under the Constitution, you don't need to be a member of Congress to be elected the Speaker. Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz, who once represented Utah without distinction in the House,thinks Speaker Trumpis a great idea, not because he'll deliver any major legislative achievements(he sucks at that), but because he'll produce big ratings!So put Donald Trump in as Speaker of the House and he can go out and investigate everybody and he can impeach everybody. That would be pretty fascinating ... It would make for great TV.No, asshole, if Republicans try to remove Biden from office and fail, which they will, that could very well result inbloody attack on the Capitol. This isn't a show. We know the MAGA mob takes this seriously. January 6 was only five months ago, for God's sake, but Republicans only care about power and their mad king's ego.[Newsweek]ollow Stephen Robinson onTwitter.Want to just donate once?"
2025,Science must drive any investigation into the origin of Covid-19,-3.67,36.33,https://www.scmp.com/comment/opinion/article/3137105/science-must-drive-any-investigation-origin-covid-19,https://adfontesmedia.com/south-china-morning-post-bias-and-reliability/,2021-06-13,www.scmp.com,25,"Scientific ideas are subject to change if warranted by the evidence. A World Health Organization investigative team concluded the most plausible cause of the Covid-19 pandemic was a virus jumping from one animal species to another and then to humans. It considered a notion that the virus leaked from a laboratory in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first outbreak occurred, “extremely unlikely”.Further research is needed before there can be a definitive conclusion and while it is being carried out, there is room only for science and truths, not conspiracy theories.Politicians and others seeking personal gain have other ideas; a number blame Beijing for the coronavirus and the interest of many centres on China’s most important laboratory for the study of infectious diseases, the Wuhan Institute of Virology.They speculate the virus may have escaped by mistake or been intentionally released, theories that American and some other Western intelligence agencies consider a possibility.The idea began circulating soon after the outbreak began 18 months ago and have been gaining fresh traction amid rising geopolitical tensions.Intelligence officers are not scientists, so such an investigation is about theatrics. So short a time frame is similarly meaningless, with years and sometimes decades being necessary to come to a conclusion about the source of a disease.While severe acute respiratory syndrome first appeared in 2003, it was not until 2017 that Chinese scientists determined it originated in bats in Yunnan and spread to civet cats and then humans. There can be no deadlines or rushed reports where Covid-19 or any other disease is concerned.China has been cooperative with WHO investigators and it has to continue being open and transparent to ensure the United Nations agency can properly carry out its work. Still, Chinese officials have been repeatedly accused of trying to cover up the truth.Those making such claims are invariably Western politicians or media commentators. Some, particularly in the US, are eager to divert attention from poor records of dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, attempts to curtail voting rights or racist comments.With the world struggling to contain fresh coronavirus outbreaks and variants and trying to vaccinate populations, finding the origins of the pandemic is made more challenging. But doing so is essential to better understand infectious diseases and prevent outbreaks. Scientists, working with knowledge and facts, are the only ones qualified to do that work."
2027,Chinese diplomat pictured walking on locals’ backs highlights Pacific power struggle,-2.33,53.33,https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3098125/chinese-diplomat-pictured-walking-locals-backs-highlights,https://adfontesmedia.com/south-china-morning-post-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-21,www.scmp.com,25,"Commander Constantine Panayiotou, the US defence attaché to five Pacific Islands including Kiribati, took to Twitter to say: “I simply cannot imagine any scenario in which walking on the backs of children is acceptable behaviour by an ambassador of any country (or any adult for that matter!)”“The Marakei people can welcome dignitaries any way they like, it’s well known they follow many of the customs of their land,” said Katerina Teaiwa, an associate professor at the Australian National University’s College of Asia and the Pacific, whose father is from Kiribati.“Everyone should be less hysterical about this and more respectful towards the diversity of Pacific ways, islands should have cultural self-determination … Marakei was probably trying something extra customary to show honour and hospitality.”In the weeks leading up to the presidential vote in June, Kiribati received more than US$4.2 million from Beijing for “livelihood projects”, according to a Kiribati government statement.The US military has raised concerns that Kiribati might allow China to build facilities for both military and civilian use on its largest island, which is just 2,000km (1,200 miles) south of Hawaii – home to the US Pacific Command. Maamau has insisted in interviews he will safeguard the country’s independence and has no plans to allow China to build military bases in the country.Fuelling talk of China trying to increase its influence in Kiribati is an ambitious and expensive plan to battle rising sea levels in a country that is no more than two metres above sea level at its highest point.With a population of 115,000, Kiribati consists of 32 atolls spread across thousands of kilometres of ocean. Climate scientists have long argued that Kiribati will cease to exist in the next 80 years as sea levels rise.Former leader Anote Tong pursued an idea of “migration with dignity” – buying land in nearby Fiji and starting the process of relocating people.But Mamaau, who first came to power in 2016, rejected the migration strategy and instead announced that his government’s intention was to “put aside the misleading and pessimistic scenario of a sinking, deserted nation” by pursuing regional support to raise the islands above rising sea levels.In 2017, while unveiling Kiribati’s “20-year vision” to world leaders at the 23rd annual Conference of the Parties to the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, Maamau showcased a video pitch to wealthy investors to “transform Kiribati into the Dubai or Singapore of the Pacific” by building 5-star eco-resorts that will enable tourists to access “world-class diving, fishing and surfing experiences”.Paul Kench, a Canadian coastal geomorphologist working with the Kiribati government on the island-raising plan said previous assumptions that the nation would drown amid rising sea levels were “based on imperfect knowledge”.“Our work has shown that islands are natural features that can adjust their size and shape on reef platforms as sea-level changes. This understanding affords island nations a new set of opportunities,” he saidHowever, she noted that China’s involvement “does not automatically equate to building dual purpose ports and airfields” though this “is obviously the long-term concern”.“Kiribati and the US also have a Treaty of Friendship and Territorial Sovereignty which states that any military use by third parties of the islands shall be subject to consultation between Kiribati and the US,” she said.Alexandre Dayant, a research fellow at Australia’s Lowy Institute who monitors aid to the Pacific region, said that despite Kiribati making the diplomatic switch to China, not a lot has happened since.“Taiwan’s aid was an important component of the country’s resources and it leaves a void in the government’s revenue. With Taipei out of the country, there is currently a gap that observers believed Beijing would fill but apart from unfounded rumours that China will provide full funds for the procurement of several aeroplanes, we still cannot see much Chinese aid going in.”In any case, Dayant said, China is not alone in its efforts to increase influence in the Pacific.Of all the troubles Kiribati will face in its effort to raise its islands, Dayant said financing is likely to be the biggest.“My understanding is that a project like this would cost anywhere between US$100 million and US$300 million, almost twice Kiribati’s GDP,” he said. “Loans are clearly not an option – Kiribati is considered as being in a high risk of debt distress according to the International Monetary Fund.”This has raised concerns that Kiribati could be subjected to the kind of “debt-trap diplomacy” China has been accused of using elsewhere.A report for the Lowy Institute published last October found that Beijing was not deliberately engaging in such practices, but that “the sheer scale of Chinese lending” to Pacific states did “pose clear risks” for smaller nations of being overwhelmed by debt.Kench, the coastal geomorphologist, said seeking out financial support for Kiribati was more important than political point scoring for Kiribati.“There is a risk that we get caught up in the US vs China stand off – which inevitably rests around strategic ownership for military purposes. If this stalls progress on the project – then Kiribati will lose out,” he said.“Left unchecked, storm damages will be prevalent, land resources on the urban islands will be reduced and infrastructure will be in a parlous condition. This would undoubtedly impact the health and safety of communities and potable water resources will be diminished.”Powles of Massey University agreed that preoccupations with geopolitical competition amid the deepening US-China rift should not distract from Pacific island’s needs.“We should not lose sight of the fact that Pacific leadership has identified climate change as the existential threat,” she said."

Beijing has maintained that just because the virus was identified in China does not mean that is where it emerged.Chinese National Health Commission spokesman Mi Feng said on Tuesday that the China part of the WHO mission had “concluded”.The international team has not released its final report but has already met resistance from the United States, with a State Department official saying on Tuesday that the US would not accept the WHO team’s findings without independently verifying them, citing concerns about transparency.Dutch virologist Marion Koopmans, one of the members of the WHO team, responded, saying on Twitter: “And so it starts. No need to wait for the report, right?”"

While the size, make-up and date of the mission are still unknown, it is also unclear if the team will be required to go through two weeks of quarantine before work begins.“An international team is being called together right now and many countries have expressed interest in participating in that,” Ryan said, adding the UN agency was also reaching out to its partners in the global response network for experts to join the group.03:07Wuhan pool party shows China's ‘strategic victory’ over Covid-19, Beijing saysHe said Ghebreyesus had written to Ma Xiaowei, minister in charge of China’s National Health Commission, on the design of the study, which would be carried out in two phases.“Phase 1 will focus on an epidemiological study in Wuhan, focusing on the chain of transmission in Wuhan … The subsequent study will have much more details on the animal-human side of things.”The institute, famous for its research into bat viruses, is at the heart of US President Donald Trump’s accusation that the novel coronavirus – which has so far infected 24 million people and killed more than 820,000 – was leaked from its P4 laboratory. The claim is fiercely rejected by China.02:24Coronavirus: A look inside China’s Wuhan Institute of VirologyRyan said the advance team had also spoken to representatives from China’s ministries for health, and science and technology, as well as the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention while in Beijing.The trip by the WHO’s international experts will be under close scrutiny following criticism of the UN agency by Western politicians and media for being “pro-China” – an accusation cited by Trump as a reason to stop US funding for the organisation.China, on the other hand, rejects the criticism and insists the WHO international expert team will “assist” the work of Chinese scientists if it travels to China, rather than carry out an investigation into China’s work."
2046,Could Russia side with the US and India against China?,-3.33,40.33,https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/politics/article/3098398/could-russia-side-us-and-india-against-china,https://adfontesmedia.com/south-china-morning-post-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-22,www.scmp.com,25,"China and Russiahave often described their relationship as “special” and “unprecedented” and have recently promised to maintain what they call a “comprehensive strategic partnership”.Many Chinese criticised the embassy’s blog as a painful reminder of their country’s historical humiliations at the hands of foreign powers.Hu Xijin, the editor of the nationalistic Chinese tabloid Global Times, even went as far as refusing to refer to the city as “tongzhi dongfang” or “Ruler of the East” as its name means in Russian, calling it by its old Chinese name of Haishenwei instead.Some of the more strident posters suggested China should respond to the embassy’s blog by rethinking its stance on Crimea.Russia seized Crimea by force from Ukraine in 2014 and annexed it the following year after a referendum, a move which drew international condemnation. China has so far chosen to remain neutral.The outcry over the embassy’s blog was one of the first real signs that the territorial dispute was not dead and an indication that “Sinocentrism is becoming a problem in this relationship”, according to Asan Forum editor Gilbert Rozman.“A supremely confident China in 2020 is witnessing an upsurge in impatient calls to settle scores steeped in grievances nurtured by its leaders. Deference towards Russia observed since 1992 may not be an immutable principle”, Rozman wrote in an article titled Multipolarity vs Sinocentrism: Chinese and Russian Worldviews and Relations.“Yet, such confidence was building for many years and 2020 only accelerated it,” Rozman said.As for deference towards Russia, Rozman said this was a strategic decision made by Beijing to win Russia to China’s side against the US.The month after the June 15 clash, in which at least 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese were killed in hand-to-hand fighting, New Delhi rushed through a deal to buy new Russian warplanes and upgrade its existing fleet.As one Chinese internet user put it: “While fighting your opponent, how would you feel if your friend handed over a knife to your opponent?”However, Dmitry Stefanovich, a research fellow with the Centre for International Security at the Russian Academy of Sciences’ Institute of World Economy and International Relations, pointed out that Russia had been supplying arms to India since long before the clash in the Himalayas.Most of India’s strategic weapons, from its aircraft carrier to its nuclear attack submarine, are imported from Russia.“The Russian defence industry, obviously, would like to remain in the Indian market, which is getting more and more competitive, with France and the US being the most obvious challengers,” Stefanovich said.01:55Chinese exercise in Tibet after border clash with IndiaIndeed, said Delhi University’s Institute of Chinese Studies visiting fellow and assistant professor Rityusha Tiwary, Russian arms sales to India had in fact fallen since the peak in 2005 when sales reached US$3.2 billion. Still, analysts acknowledged that defence matters had created fault lines in the Russia-China relationship.Alexey Muraviev, an associate professor of National Security and Strategic Studies at Australia’s Curtin University, said Russia was uneasy about Chinese cooperation with Ukraine in both military and business matters.“The Chinese are also engaged in reverse engineering Russia’s military technology and then trying to sell indigenous platforms based on Russian designs, thereby competing against Russia on the global arms sales market,” Muraviev added.Tiwary said Russia saw selling arms to India as a way of balancing out China’s growing power.Another fault line appears to have opened up over a deal for Russia to supply the S-400 anti-aircraft missile system to China.The S-400 is considered the most advanced of its kind in Russia, capable of destroying targets at distances of up to 400km and heights of 30km.Last month, the Chinese websites NetEase and Sohu reported the deliveries had been “delayed” due to the coronavirus, but Moscow said later the deliveries had been “suspended”.According to Russia’s TASS news agency, China received its first batch of S-400s in 2018 but further deliveries were suspended when Moscow accused Valery Mitko, president of the St Petersburg Arctic Social Sciences Academy, of spying for Beijing.The move incensed many Chinese, not least because Russia’s defence minister Sergey Shoygu had agreed with his Indian counterpart Rajnath Singh to fast-track the production and delivery of five S-400 systems purchased by India in 2018. (The first of these are expected to be delivered in October).Many Chinese said this proved Russia was putting the interests of India before those of China, which had placed its orders in 2014.“Is this not a clear-cut case that the Russians are unreliable? China has to wake up!” wrote one Chinese internet user.Describing the S-400 suspension as an “intriguing development”, Derek Grossman, senior defence analyst at the Rand Corporation, a Washington think tank, said the suspension ran counter to the narrative that Sino-Russian security relations had strengthened in recent years.He also questioned Chinese media claims that the problem was due to the coronavirus, noting that it came less than two weeks after the deadly clash in the Himalayas on June 15.“This strongly suggests that Moscow’s decision was in response to the [Himalayan] incident,” Grossman said.He noted that throughout the Cold War, the Soviet Union had been a close friend of India, and the relationship remained warm today.“I suspect that the S-400 decision largely was the result of Russia deciding to punish China for its actions against India, and to demonstrate to New Delhi that Moscow can still be trusted to support its interests,” Grossman said.Still, perhaps most divisive of all the issues facing the relationship is the recent claim in Indian media that New Delhi wants Moscow to join the US-led Indo-Pacific initiative, a strategic grouping widely seen as being an attempt to counter China.The matter was reportedly discussed during a phone call between Russian deputy foreign minister Igor Morgulov and the Indian ambassador to Russia, D. Bala Venkatesh Varma.India reportedly told Russia that just as it supports Moscow’s Greater Eurasia project – in which Russia’s foreign policy is intended to pivot to the East and greater engagement with Asia – so too should Russia support the Indo-Pacific grouping, and not see the idea merely as a strategy by Washington to divide the region.Some Chinese commentators said the idea – a “betrayal of China”, according to some – was as explosive as asking Russia to join Nato (the Western military alliance originally set up primarily to counter Russian aggression).But while some analysts questioned whether the US would agree to Russian membership, others thought that given the right incentives Moscow could be convinced.Tiwary said the idea was in line with the strong India-Russia partnership of recent decades, and would further cement the relationship.02:27Russia wants to build up its Arctic route with China, its top diplomat to Beijing says“For Russia, the initiative offers a chance to counter US leadership in any emergent power structure in the region, by being a part of it,” Tiwary added.However, Stefanovich said Russia was unlikely to sign up, given the group’s reputation of being anti-China. “Russia believes in inclusive regional organisations and cooperation regimes,” said Stefanovich.Victor Gao, Soochow University chair professor and the vice-president of the Centre for China and Globalisation, a think tank in Beijing, agreed.It was “inconceivable” that Russia would “relegate itself into being a vassal of the US”, Gao said.■"
2048,Coronavirus death rate may be as bad – or worse – than for Spanish flu,-6.33,37.67,https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3099956/coronavirus-death-rate-may-be-bad-or-worse-spanish-flu-pandemic,https://adfontesmedia.com/south-china-morning-post-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-02,www.scmp.com,25,"The death rate from Covid-19 could be as severe as – or worse than – that of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, new research based on data from the initial outbreak in China suggests.During the influenza outbreak over a century ago, some 500 million people – or a third of the world population at the time – were infected in about two years. Death toll estimates range from 10 million people to over 50 million.To compare the death rates, a team of Chinese and American scientists went back to the start of the pandemic, using new data and improved modelling on the first wave in Wuhan, the central Chinese city where the virus was first reported late last year.They put the actual death rate at 4.54 per cent.“[This] is comparable, if not higher, than that of the 1918 influenza pandemic,” the team led by Yu Hongjie, an epidemiologist at Fudan University in Shanghai, wrote in a non-peer-reviewed paper posted on medRxiv.org on Tuesday.Estimates of the Spanish flu death rate range from 1.61 per cent to 1.98 per cent.02:07Global coronavirus cases surpass 25 million as India deals with world’s fastest-growing outbreakThe researchers sought data from Wuhan because it was the place where the new virus strain was first identified by scientists after patients started turning up at hospitals with pneumonia-like symptoms. That made it an ideal location for a comparison of the death rate from the pandemic in 1918, when there was also limited knowledge and treatment available for the illness caused by the H1N1 influenza A virus.While two previous studies in Beijing and Hong Kong have estimated much lower death rates for Covid-19 – at 1.2 per cent and 1.4 per cent – the research team said they did not take into account that the RT-PCR tests used at the early stage of the outbreak were not as accurate. They said the tests had a 30-40 per cent accuracy rate at the time.People with mild symptoms who did not go to hospital were not included in the modelling for those studies either, according to the paper.The latest study aimed to include all of these cases. “Our estimate of the disease burden may be the most accurate for Wuhan so far,” Yu and the team wrote in the paper.Yin Ping, a professor of epidemiology with the Tongji Medical College at Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan, believed the Fudan study was the most accurate yet when it came to the death rate.“This estimate is closer to the truth,” Yin said. “This time could indeed be worse than what happened in 1918.”China has been criticised for its handling of the initial outbreak in Wuhan. Washington has accused Beijing of withholding information at the early stage, blaming China for the pandemic that has hit the US the hardest, with more than 6 million cases and nearly 200,000 deaths.According to the Fudan researchers, while the new death rate estimate for Wuhan was not perfect, it provided a more accurate picture than data from North America.In the US and Quebec – Canada’s worst-hit province – the rates of symptomatic cases were 404 and 534 per 100,000 people, respectively, in the first few months of the outbreak. In Wuhan, that rate was considerably higher at 796, suggesting some Americans and Canadians may have died from Covid-19 but were not taken into account in the official figures, the paper said.01:54Tests on nearly 10 million people in Chinese city of Wuhan turn up only 300 coronavirus casesThe paper was co-authored by Cecile Viboud, a senior research scientist with the National Institutes of Health’s international epidemiology and population studies division. She could not immediately be reached for comment, but a statement in the paper said it did “not necessarily represent the views of the US government or the [NIH]”.President Donald Trump has claimed there is a “deep state” in the US government against his handling of the pandemic. He shared a tweet on Sunday claiming only 6 per cent of the people listed as coronavirus deaths had “actually died” from the disease. Twitter later removed the link for “violation of misinformation policy”."

They also protect the eyes from splashes and sprays of infected droplets, are easily cleaned and disinfected, and allow visual communication for the hearing-impaired.Unfortunately, smaller aerosolised droplets can penetrate under the bottom of the shield and from the sides of the visor. The researchers found that, over an exposure lasting between one minute and half an hour, the shield was only 23 per cent effective in reducing the inhalation of droplets.One-way exhalation valves, on the other hand, do not filter the breath of the wearer, potentially exposing other people to infected droplets.“Overall, the visuals presented here indicate that face shields and masks with exhale valves may not be as effective as regular face masks in restricting the spread of aerosolised droplets,” the study concluded, adding that US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines discourage the use of face shields as a sole means of virus prevention.The CDC also advises that masks equipped with exhalation valves should not be used when a sterile environment is required.01:51Compostable masks made from hemp aim to reduce waste amid pandemicGao Xiaodong, a hospital infection specialist from Shanghai Zhongshan Hospital, said he agreed with the American researchers that both face shields and masks with exhalation valves had limitations in stopping the spread of the virus.“It is safe to wear surgical masks inside the face shield,” Gao told the. “Face shields were invented, not to deal with patients with respiratory diseases, but to protect the wearer’s face from splashes and sprays of body fluids.”Gao said face shields came in different sizes and many people did not follow instructions on how to wear them correctly.As for exhalation valve masks, initially invented for use during smog, Gao called them “selfish”, as they provided no protection to anyone except the wearer. “Hospital staff do not wear this kind of mask and no patients are allowed to wear them either,” he said."

Thecites another set of satellite images, captured by Maxar Technologies, as showing signs that the retrofitted carrier is also loaded with at least seven fast-attack boats alongside the purported shipment of fuel.When it comes to fuel shipments from Iran to Venezuela, the two countries have already engaged in such operations in the past. Tehran sent several tankers under its flags to help Caracas cope with thepetroleum shortagesin the country. All of them successfully reached the nation's shores. Yet, the US claims to have intercepted several ships sailing under non-Iranian flags but purportedly carrying Iranian fuel for Caracas. Tehran denied owning the intercepted petroleum, but condemned Washington's attempts to intercept such shipments as state piracy.While all these reports remain unconfirmed and Iran is dodging questions regarding thetwo ships' missionin the Atlantic, the US has already expressed concerns regarding the nature of the endeavour.

This did not, at the time, look like a recipe for geopolitical strife. ByteDance merged Musical.ly with a similar app called TikTok, which started growing at a blistering pace. Today TikTok has 100m users in America, and competes with Facebook and Snap. With growing popularity has come growing scrutiny, as Sino-American tensions spread from trade to tech, and a barrage of invective from President Donald Trump. This looks set to culminate in a forced sale of TikTok’s American business to a domestic buyer. Touted as vital to protect Americans’ data, the crackdown is in fact a depressing example of jingoistic opportunism, more likely to chill investment in America and stoke Chinese nationalism.The legal basis for TikTok’s divestment comes from the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which this week ruled that the Musical.ly deal was against America’s national-security interests. Having flirted with banning TikTok altogether, Mr Trump now seems willing to accept a fire-sale.

The news came just as the country recorded 166 covid-19 deaths, a daily record. “The challenge is a path out of pandemic and deep recession,” said the adviser.The summing-up is accurate. Mr Fernández, a Peronist who became president in December, had appeared to be on a collision course with holders of $65bn-worth of foreign-law bonds. That is about 40% of the government’s foreign debt and equivalent to 16% of this year’sGDP. The economy minister, Martín Guzmán, initially demanded big cuts in interest payments and a delay until 2023 in resuming them.

The object of China’s fury: the incumbent president, Lee Teng-hui, whom they accused of wanting to split the motherland by formally declaring Taiwan’s independence.China’s actions backfired. Taiwanese refused to be intimidated. Election rallies were huge. Children rode on parents’ shoulders, air horns lent a carnival air and taxis raced around the capital, Taipei, flying candidates’ flags out of their windows. Never has Banyan witnessed such a boisterous election. Mr Lee’s stump speeches drew crowds to flatter a rock star. Tall and with a near-permanent toothy grin, he was the first leader of the Kuomintang (KMT, or Nationalist) party to address people in their native Taiwanese rather than in Mandarin, the language thatKMTcarpetbaggers had brought with them when they fled the mainland, defeated by the Communists in 1949. Taiwanese, he said, should not fear China’s “state terrorism”. His victory was emphatic, with more votes than the three other candidates combined.

Alan Krueger, who died on March 16th, managed both. In research with David Card in the early 1990s, Mr Krueger showed, through careful data analysis, that increases in the minimum wage did not lead to reductions in employment, as standard models suggested they should. The research, which the authors summarised in a seminal book, “Myth and Measurement”, published in 1995, drew a scathing initial response. Critics assaulted their motivations, data and analysis until allowing, finally, that the pair had a point. Their work changed economics and politics. It also exemplified Mr Krueger’s career as both scholar and public servant.Mr Krueger did not come across as the combative type. He was gracious and generous in person, and a skilled communicator. That came in handy during his time in Washington, as chief economist of the Department of Labour when Bill Clinton was president, and in the Treasury and the White House under Barack Obama during the most tumultuous economic times since the 1930s.

On the surface, its manifestations are mostly unconnected. Britain’s miffed motorists are suffering from a shortage of lorry drivers to deliver petrol.

The phrase has cropped up in the past but is being increasingly used by provincial authorities to decry property developers’ attempts to slash home prices.

Officials, fearing that the price cuts might frustrate recent homebuyers and lead to protests and distortions in the property market, regard the discounts as undermining social stability and have banned them. In the central city of Yueyang the government has told developers to stop increasing prices but also to refrain from reducing them by more than 15%.In such cases both regulators and developers are walking a tightrope, teetering between sky-high prices and a damaging downturn. The property market is probably the single largest driver of the country’s economy. Urban Chinese have flocked to it as a haven.

And as our affordable housing crisis lingers and deepens, the pandemic continues to reveal alarming figures. Despite the disbursement of CARES Act funding and the latest round ofEmergency Rental Assistance, an estimated 14 million Americans continue to owe back rent payments. And while these devastating impacts are deeply felt nationwide,a study showsthat, again, Black and Hispanic households are disproportionally affected. This is no coincidence. It is symptomatic of a rigged and underfunded system that continuously produces racial disparities and falls short of its promises. As President Biden vows to heal the nation and to pursue racial justice, you may wonder, “What does this look like?” Here are three promising policies you should pay attention to.1. Eliminating exclusionary land-use policiesIn essence, land-use policies regulate lot size, density, sitting, and the height and form of structures. These policies not only affect the cost and availability of housing but also residential sorting of individuals — perpetuating segregation. These communities (often wealthy, white neighborhoods) frequently pretext pressure on infrastructure, such as traffic concerns or local schools, and the desire to maintain “neighborhood character.” It’s hard not to hear the racial undertone in defending the status quo and socioracial profile of communities. President Biden’s housing plan wants to tackle that. The proposed program would allocate flexible competitive funding to jurisdictions removing exclusionary land-use policies. The incentive-based program, said to be “purely carrot, no stick” holds real promise but also sizable risk. While the details are not yet fleshed out, I would warn that, absent of reporting requirements, performance metrics, and distributional goals, this could lead to another government-sponsored program concentrating affordable housing in high-poverty/low-opportunity areas. Location matters, and data is needed. The challenge for the Biden Administration is to design procedures that balance accountability and flexibility, without deterring participation or worsening inequities. Part of the answer may be found in fair housing.2. Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH)The balancing of meaningful reporting requirements with local latitude was best embodied by the Obama-era fair housing rule. Prior to being eviscerated by former President Trump, the rule established a robust and data-driven process for communities receiving federal funding to better understand their fair housing landscape. The planning process required the completion of a data-driven assessment examining fair housing challenges such as segregation, concentration of poverty, housing needs, access to opportunities, and local policies (i.e., zoning); and to accordingly develop goals to address issues. To that effect, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) provided nationwide data about disparities and neighborhood quality, and developed a publicly availableinteractive mapping toolto help communities in their decision-making process. Although its primary tool presented (rectifiable) technical flaws, the 2015 AFFH rule represented an unprecedented advance in fair housing planning. To put teeth to their racial justice-focused agenda, it is essential for the Biden-Harris team to fully reinstitute the rule while improving the data and technical tools provided to communities.3. Voucher program expansion and innovationFederal rental assistance programs are essential to America’s safety net system. Although these programs lift an estimated3 million householdsout of poverty, another 16 million are left unassisted. The funding is insufficient, but not only. Key programs, like the Housing Choice Voucher program (formerly known as “Section 8”), have hardly evolved since their inception. And despite the very intent of the program, families disproportionally reside in areas of poverty. Why? Because we are not funding what works. A series ofgroundbreaking researchled by renowned Harvard economist Dr. Raj Chetty found that the provision of customized assistance, also referred to as “mobility counseling,” significantly increases leasing in high-upward mobility neighborhoods. Yet, Public Housing Authorities are not funded to provide mobility counseling. But this may change. ThePresident’s initial 2022 budgetnot only seeks to expand the Voucher program to serve 200,000 more families, but it also includes funding for mobility-related supportive services to provide low-income families who live in racially and ethnically concentrated areas of poverty with greater options to move to higher-opportunity neighborhoods. In 2018, and in response to theNorth Texas Assessment of Fair Housing, our agency designed and operationalized that very program — the first of its kind, called Children First North Texas. A cautionary note would be that the pursuit of innovation is not a cost-free exercise for Housing Authorities. And while President Biden is on target, it is now equally important that the federal government deploys the necessary technology for housing program administrators to deliver on the President’s promises.Undeniably, the slope is steep; but our downfall could be steeper. As our new administration continues to craft bold and innovative policies, our communities await for change. And with tangible pathways ahead, we may finally have a fair shot.Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed."

This particular ecosystem has been further endangered by logging and development.Pynn estimated the value of the trees at more than $800 apiece, adding that the fine for poaching would be equivalent to the penalty for littering.Add Changing America to yourFacebookorTwitterfeed to stay on top of the news.Municipality forester Shaun Mason said poaching is not a new phenomenon in the region but that it has gotten worse amid the lumber pricing crisis, according to The Guardian. Mason believes the poachers prefer cedar due to the market value.Lumber prices across the U.S.areup 308 percentsince the beginning of the pandemic, according to analysis by industry trade magazine Random Lengths.The costs have skyrocketed in Canada as well. Kevin Lee, CEO of the Canadian Home Builders Association,told CBC in Aprilthat a 2,500-square-foot home could see more than “$30,000 in additional costs for lumber.”But most mills on Vancouver Island won’t accept wood without marking, Mason said.“It’d be illegal, but if someone had a sawmill set up on their property and someone said, ‘Hey, I could get some cedar, would you mill it for me?’ You know, obviously, it’s not on the up and up, but it definitely could take place,” Mason said.Mason said the municipality has posted signs in an effort to deter would-be poachers, increased patrols and invested in surveillance, adding he expects the issue is more widespread.“It’s happening all over the place. We just happen to have ungated, unfettered access, not that far from a main road or highway,” Mason said. “So we tend to be the easiest targets.”Jens Wieting of British Columbia’s Sierra Club believes the government must enact harsher fines to curb poaching, saying what’s happening in the region reflects a broader issue, The Guardian reported.“Maybe, with a change in perspective, people who might be tempted to make an extra buck by poaching trees won’t do it because they get a sense that it would be wrong—and that the consequences could be bigger and more serious,” Wieting said.Copyright 2024 Nexstar Media Inc.

Cookewrote in a Thursday piecetitled “Maggie Haberman Is Right.”Trump also truly believes that he’ll be reinstated to office after a number of election audits in Arizona and other states are finished, Cooke added.A spokesperson for Trump did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Hill.Cooke’s story comes a day afterHaberman described Trump’s effortsto recruit conservative opinionmakers on the CNN show “New Day.”“He has been trying to get conservative writers to publish, you know, in a more mainstream way that this election was, quote unquote, stolen from him,” Haberman told host John Berman, without naming any writers.Haberman had initially tweeted Tuesday that Trump believes he will be reinstated.Trump has been telling a number of people he’s in contact with that he expects he will get reinstated by August (no that isn’t how it works but simply sharing the information).https://t.co/kaXSXKnpF0— Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT)June 1, 2021Like many after hearing that idea, Cooke pointed out in his piece that there is no constitutional mechanism that would allow that to happen.“[Reinstatement] is a rejection of reality, a rejection of law, and, ultimately, a rejection of the entire system of American government,” he wrote.“There is no Reinstatement Clause within the United States Constitution. Hell, there is nothing even approximating a Reinstatement Clause within the United States Constitution.”Jay Caruso, managing editor of the Washington Examiner magazine, agreed with Cooke’s assessment.“It’s a wild-eyed fantasy,” Caruso said. “There is no constitutional mechanism for reinstatement for a president. The election was certified and Biden was sworn in. It’s not like Trump was unjustly fired from the workplace and found to have done no wrong.”The National Review has called out Trump for his behavior since losing the 2020 election to President Biden, withits editorial board sayinghis challenges are “disgraceful” and that “almost nothing that the Trump team has alleged has withstood the slightest scrutiny.”"
2727,“Mythic Quest” and the Pursuit of Anti-Capitalist Media,-7.33,42.33,https://www.currentaffairs.org/2020/08/mythic-quest-and-the-pursuit-of-anti-capitalist-media,https://adfontesmedia.com/current-affairs-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-12,www.currentaffairs.org,25,"There’s an idea—passed down from Adorno in a game of telephone—that products of the culture industry must necessarily reflect capitalist values. This is superficially very convincing: if I were a capitalist, I would probably fund works that reassert the status quo, even subconsciously, since if I were a capitalist the status quo would be going pretty well for me. You can find lots of supporting examples if you look around: the valorization ofrags–to–richesstories that obscure the near-impossibility of real-life social mobility, particularly in the United States; the entire cop show genre, which essentially functions as propaganda for the police; even the original, which has a plotline about how the EPA shouldn’t investigate unlicensed nuclear reactors.But if you take a broad look at mass media, instead of cherry-picking examples, it’s hard to see any coherent ideology at work, even within specific media companies. Columbia Pictures and Relativity Media produced bothandThe Social Network, two biopics about young entrepreneurs that couldn’t be more different in their relative skepticism towards the idea of the self-made man. There’s mainstream, capitalist-made art that espouses anti-capitalist principles, fromIt’s A Wonderful LifetoRobocoptoThe Big Short. The evil businessman is such a deeply embedded trope that, with the exception of a few billionaire superheroes, it’s a bit weird to see a businessman in a movie who isn’t evil. The villain in Tim Burton’s live actionDumboremake is a very obvious allegory for Disney. WWE boss Vince MacMahon is a union-busting, Trump-supporting, coronavirus-spreading supervillain, but rich guys on WWE are always heels—Vince MacMahon included. Lots of cultural products—maybe most of them—are internally ideologically ambiguous or just incoherent.The Lego Movieis in no small part an advertisement for Lego and its bad guy is literally called President Business.The truth is much simpler than a vast effort to indoctrinate. The culture industry only sporadically produces works that correspond to apparent “capitalist” values—competition, individualism, pulling yourself up by your bootstraps—because the only actual capitalist value is generating and accumulating profit.In his 1979 defense of disco, Richard Dyer writes that rather than capitalist modes of production simply reproducing capitalist ideology, capitalists’ interest in cultural commodities is generating a profit, which they can do just as well from something ideologically opposed to capitalism as something supportive of it.This means that it’s possible for fresh, challenging, weird, fun art to be produced under capitalism, even within extremely corporate environments. As Dyer puts it, “As long as a commodity makes a profit, what does it matter?” But because nothing matters but making money, corporations are at best indifferent and frequently hostile to the actual “art” part. Making things that are fresh and challenging and weird and fun is easily sacrificed to the bottom line, because everything can be sacrificed to the bottom line. Film critics frequently romanticise the 1970s as a period of artistic quality and integrity in Hollywood filmmaking, and justifiably so: the Hollywood studios spent the 1970s letting young, visionary directors—like Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola, or Robert Altman—make strange, highly personal and frequently brilliant films. But it’s not like the studios suddenly cared a lot about art. Their appetite for risk-taking didn’t expand to women directors, no matter how visionary, asElaine May can attest, while black directors mostlyworked outside the studio system. Whenantitrust cases(remember those?) against the studios meant they no longer had a vertical monopoly, which combined with competition from television created a perfect storm of flops, films likeandBonnie and ClydeandEasy Riderstill managed to make profits, and so the studios tried to emulate their success. WhenJawsand especiallyStar Warsrevealed a new, more profitable business model, the director-driven filmmaking of the 1970s collapsed. The studios’ motivation—making as much money as possible—remained constant. The profit motive both enabled a great period of creativity and innovation in film and brought it to an abrupt end.Television is a basically unique artform in that it is definitionally made only in corporate environments. There’s public television, sure—although shows on public broadcasters are usually made with a private production company at least involved—but unlike films or music, there is notelevision. It’s hard to even imagine what independent television would be like, because if it’s not distributed through a TV station or a streaming service, it’s not television. It might be a webseries, which is fine, but that’s a different medium with different conventions. This is partly why TV had a reputation for conservatism—both politically and aesthetically—for so long, at least untilThe Sopranosand the supposed Golden Age of TV. But the history of television is full of artists making politically and aesthetically significant work, frequentlybattlingcorporateoverlordsto do it. Sometimes those fights have been about censorship, or sometimes they’ve been about a lack of time, money and resources to do their work. Working in a medium where they have to wage those battles doesn’t negate their art. Rod Serling’s originalTwilight Zonefeels as urgent and incendiary as ever.Star Trekfeels like a more important socialist reference point for me than anything Marx wrote. I think about the scene inM*A*S*H*where Hawkeye explainswhy war is worse than hellprobably once a week.Earlier this year,co-creators Rob McElhenney and Charlie Day, along withIt’s Always SunnyandCommunitywriter Megan Ganz created the sitcomMythic Quest: Raven’s Banquetfor Apple TV+. It’s set in a video game development studio, working on aWorld of Warcraft-style massively multiplayer online role-playing game of the same title. McElhenny plays Ian (pronounced eye-an),Mythic Quest’s megalomaniac, would-be auteur creative director, with Charlotte Nicdao as overworked and underappreciated lead engineer Poppy. (Thankfully, Poppy isn’t Ian’s put-upon disapproving straight man, as is so common with female characters in these types of roles; she’s a real weirdo in her own right.) F. Murray Abraham plays C.W., a washed-up sci-fi writer who once won a Nebula Award and is now stuck writing for a game he’s never played. Danny Pudi plays Brad, head of monetization and soulless monster. David (Always Sunnyveteran David Hornsby), the game’s executive producer, weakly insists that he “backs creative” while living in fear of calls from “Corporate” in Montreal.It takesa little while to find its groove. It’s a much more conventional show thanIt’s Always Sunny—hitting the warm, familiar beats of the workplace sitcom thatSunnywould only approach with irony and cynicism—but they are, thematically, nice companion pieces. WhereSunnyhas spent a decade and a half in a dive bar in Philadelphia, exploring how people at the bottom of society are crushed,Mythic Questis about the dissatisfying limitations of capitalist success.Critics have sometimes describedas being about “women in the gaming industry”, and that’s definitely there—in one episode, a Girls Who Code group visits on a day when Poppy happens to be out of the office, and David struggles mightily to find a female employee to tell them something inspirational. But framing it that way makes it sound as if the gaming industry is an otherwise neutral entity unfortunately afflicted with sexism. It matters that Poppy is an Asian woman and Ian is a white man, but their conflicts aren’t reducible to that dynamic. Underlying everything is that Ian treats Poppy like a mechanic, not a creative partner: Poppy tells him she feels like she’s his favorite paintbrush, rather than a creative person in her own right. (Later, he repeats it like it’s a compliment.) Their conflicts are about much broader themes: the nature of artistic collaboration, for one, and the relationship between art and commerce. It’s easy to watchMythic Questas beingaboutvideo games in some significant way, but it just uses the video game industry as a setting to explore the problems of making art in a corporate environment. It’s about video games, but it’s also about TV, and about any kind of art made primarily as a commodity.This comes to the fore in “A Dark Quiet Death,” a standalone episode halfway through the season. It follows two characters with no obvious connection to the show’s main plot, played by Jake Johnson and Cristin Milioti, for over a decade. They meet in a video game store in the early 1990s: budding video game producer Doc (Johnson) strikes up a conversation with goth girl Beans (Milioti) in which she trashes all the games he suggests. He asks if she’s ever thought of making her own game, and she says yes so quickly that he’s a bit taken aback: he clearly thought the question would blow her mind.From there, the episode drops in on these characters once every couple of years. Doc and Beans create a game called: it’s a survival horror game, where you can use a flashlight to push the monsters back but you can’t defeat them. Somewhere along the way, they fall in love. It initially seems like a “visionary at the wrong time” story, because that kind of no-win, walking-simulation horror game is a lot more common and popular now than it was a decade ago.But they do succeed. And it’s so much worse.The firstgame is modestly successful, and Doc and Beans hire out an office to work on the sequel. The building was the site of a sweatshop fire a hundred years ago, and it will one day be, we later find out, the offices forMythic Quest. Doc and Beans carve their names in the wall.Once they move into the office, more and more people are involved in building whatwill become, and Doc and Beans’ relationship becomes more and more fractured. Beans is an uncompromising artist and Doc is open to collaboration and compromise, for good or ill. Beans is dismissive of focus groups while Doc insists they should at least consider what marketing has found; Doc listens to what their brand manager has to say while Beans is scornful and rude. Corporate gives them a commemorative flashlight as a gift, and Beans uses it to hold flowers, no matter how many times Doc asks her not to.Slowly,starts to resemble less and less anything like Doc and Beans’ original vision. Every time Beans voices her objections, the brand manager makes it sound like they’re agreeing, even though he’s clearly not taking in a word. She says they’re like the frog being boiled alive: she agrees to add a gun that would weaken the monsters but not kill them, and then suddenly they’re watching an advertisement for the game where the monster’s head gets blown off. Suddenly there are so many weapons that there’s no room for the flashlight. Suddenly Doc is taking calls from Disney. Suddenly they’re divorced.Doc justifies each compromise by pointing to how many more people they can bring to their game. And it’s true:becomes one of the biggest games in the world. It launches a film franchise (Doc dates the starlet who plays the lead.) Then we see the brand manager showing him Roscoe, a cutesy, fuzzy purple character who is squarely aimed at appealing to small children. Corporate wants Roscoe added to the nextDQDgame since he “tests through the roof”. When Doc says thatDQDisn’t for children, the brand manager points out that lots of children play it anyway, as if that’s a justification. Doc gives a flat “no” for the first time in the episode. He repeats what Beans said about the frog being boiled alive, and the brand manager says that Doc’s not the frog in that analogy, he’s the chef.He makes the case that they’ve always done whatever Doc wanted, because he’s the boss. There’s a moment of horror, as Doc realizes he believes he was helplessly pulled along through compromise after compromise when he wasn’t helpless after all. But this time he puts his foot down. “It’s Roscoe or me,” he says.Hard cut to an advertisement for a cuddly toy. “Iiiiiiiiit’s Roscoe!”What’s so brilliant about this episode is that it sets up the conflict between uncompromising artist and compromising collaborator, then reveals it to be bullshit. It doesn’t matter how much Doc is willing and eager to bend: if it’s any amount less than completely, totally, and utterly, he’ll be tossed aside. Doc becomes a company man—treasuring presents from Corporate and ceding to their every demand—and itdoesn’t buy him enough leeway to object to marketing a game calledDark Quiet Deathto four-year-olds. The brand manager says Doc is the boss, but he never was, not really. Corporate has always been in charge. The conflict between him and Beans was fundamentally artificial, because they both end up the same way: forced out for asserting a creative vision. The episode puts a bow on this by having them literally end up in the same place: back in the video game store, trying to find something to play that doesn’t suck. Beans has remarried and is getting some awful game to occupy her kids. There’s a whole display of Roscoe merchandise, but Doc finds the original DQD in the bargain bin. He recommends it to a passing customer.The episode ends with Ian pitchingto the same publisher that madeDark Quiet Death. He says that what’s special aboutMythic Questishim. The show has already displayed skepticism of the idea of Ian as an auteur, showing how that mythos erases his creative partners such as Poppy and the other coders. But ending “A Dark Quiet Death” on Ian pitching Mythic Quest as an auteur project lends the whole affair a very different, darker tone. Ian has creative control of the game fornow, maybe, but we have no reason to think Corporate has changed. In fact, Ian pitchesMythic Questto the exact same guy that Doc and Beans pitchedDQDto, symbolizing the fact that theyliterally haven’t changed.Ian’s auteurism is shown to be a lie: both because lots and lots of people work together to makeand because he only ever has as much control as Corporate allows him. This double-inflected critique manages to expose the myth of pure auteurism without lapsing into, like, arguing thatit’s actually really progressive that the Marvel Cinematic Universe films are produced on an assembly line.When Poppy is considering leaving, Ian appeals to her to stay by comparing their creative partnership to The Beatles. She’s initially charmed—although Ian insists on explaining who The Beatles are—until he reveals that he thinks she’s Ringo. Poppy, annoyed, asks why she couldn’t be “one of the good ones.” It’s funny, but also sort of perfect. Poppy rightly takes the comparison as a minimization of her contribution to the game, but Poppyisthe Ringo. Ringo’s unique-as-a-fingerprint drumming is literally the sound of The Beatles; you can recognise Beatles songs from Ringo’s drum parts alone. And like lead engineer Poppy, people think of Ringo’s role in the band as mechanical—“somebody has to keep the beat,” Ian says—rather than creative. Like Poppy, Ringo’s shunted off to the back somewhere.In the final episode of the season, the coding staff announce that they’re unionizing. Michelle (a wonderfully deadpan Aparna Nancherla) sits down for negotiations with executive producer David. She asks for overtime pay, and there’s a pause where David waits for her to list more demands. But she doesn’t have any. It’s frustrating to watch: a rare workplace show where staff forms a union and only asks for the bare minimum that they should obviously be getting already. David is surprised, too: he sighs in relief because he thought they were going to ask for profit sharing. (“Could weprofit sharing?” Michelle asks, but the chance is already gone.) David agrees that they should get overtime pay, and asks her to leave the room so he can call Corporate.The workers have asked for the bare minimum, and the profit sharing gag demonstrates that the show knows that. So David calls Corporate to ask for the bare minimum—and gets fired immediately.The episode ends in a banal way—Ian rings Corporate off-screen and fixes everything. It feels like a real cop out: a shortcut to a happy ending that isn’t earned. But the memory of “A Dark Quiet Death”—brought to the forefront of our memories in the finale episode when Ian asks Poppy to carve her name in the wall next to Doc and Beans—gives it a ring of darkness. The workers are relying on the whims of Ian—whose whims are also why they’re working so much overtime in the first place—and relying on Corporate valuing Ian enough to care about his whims.Corporate does value Ian, in no small part because his image as the lone artist is an integrated part of’s marketing. The image of the lone artist is deliberately cultivated, in no small part because it keeps the vast majority of workers anonymous and invisible. It accrues power to Ian, but only to sap power from the rest of Mythic Quest’s workers. It’s very hard to imagine that he’d be able to make a fix-everything call to Corporate if Michelle had actually asked for profit-sharing.—the TV show—is a product of capitalism that criticises capitalist modes of production. It focuses on how capitalist production affects art, but it’s more expansive than that: What really matters is how capitalist production affectspeople. Even though Ian wins basically every creative battle in the season, the conditions of the game’s production are still terrible.Mythic Quest’s staff are overworked, underpaid and essentially made invisible to the rest of the world. The woman who moderates complaints and comments (enduring constant harassment in the process) is clearly suffering from PTSD. Predatory monetization underwrites Ian’s creative control: in one episode, Brad, the head of monetization, creates some in-game weapon you can buy for a quarter of a million dollars, and then a player immediately buys it. Brad spends the rest of the episode demoralized: if, no matter what he dreams up, some rich guy is going to immediately buy it, then his job is meaningless. Towards the end of the episode, David tells him that he wasn’t actually a rich guy who bought the weapon, but a middle-aged man living in a trailer park. Brad’s eyes light up. He has a renewed sense of purpose: it’s not about the big money transactions, it’s about taking a player’s last dollar.Brad’s story here isn’t just a metaphor for capitalism; he’s the avatar of capitalism in the show. Motivated entirely by capitalist ideology, he talks about how his dream is to have a Scrooge McDuck money bin. But this isn’t just because he wants to accumulate Scrooge McDuck wealth: he explicitly states that he wants money as a means of controlling people, of owning them. Part of the appeal of the Scrooge McDuck money bin, for him, is having enough money tosomeone build a Scrooge McDuck money bin.But Brad, notably, doesn’t spend the whole series trying to make the game’s themes more capitalist. He spends it ruthlessly, successfully, making the game more. The cruelty inflicted upon the game’s accumulation-addicted players is just, for him, a personal bonus.understands that the capitalist class’s primary motivation will always be the pursuit of profit as its own end, rather than any ideological commitment to capitalism itself. It’s a perfect meta-example of its own possibilities: an anti-capitalist television show released by Apple. But its sharpest insight as anti-capitalist art is its acknowledgement that there are deeper, more material issues at stake in the capitalist mode of production than its effect on the content and character of art. Ruthless pursuit of profit requires exploitation of workers on one end, and exploitation of consumers on the other. Brad wants to accumulate wealth so he can control people, and one of the darkest things about his character is that his personal delight in controlling other people is not just his only humanizing quality, but it actually makes him less evil than the invisible hand of Corporate. All the characters inMythic Quest, from our protagonists to the countless unseen players, have key parts of their life controlled by Corporate, and by capital itself. For the staff it’s work; for the players it’s leisure; either way, their behavior gets filtered through a stranger’s profit-loss calculation. Ian is the only one who seems to have control over his destiny, but, as with Doc, this is an illusion. Ian thinksMythic Questbelongs to him, and he spends the season learning that it belongs to Poppy, too. But it’s Corporate’s game. They just make it."

It has been corrected.” The video itself is so uncontroversial, however, that many are wondering how it could have been flagged in the first place.The video features Tebow telling his Christian fans that they should remember that they can lean on God during tough times such as those in which we are living.“Bible believers, when we look at the Bible, and we see a lot of the heroes, a lot of times they truly were wounded deeply before they were ever used greatly,” the former NFL quarterback said. “So maybe you’re going through a time in your life where you feel like you’ve just been wounded greatly. It hasn’t been your year, hasn’t been your day — you just don’t feel like this is your time.”“This could be your time for learning,” Tebow warned. “This could be your time for growing. This could be your time for adapting. This could be the time that is a test for you, but tomorrow it gets turned into a testimony.”He added that God could be preparing us for greater challenges in the future.“You never know what God is doing with your life,” Tebow said. “You never know what He is preparing you for. So many times in the Bible, when we look at the heroes, there were times in their life where — if they stopped, if they quit, if they said, ‘No, God, I’ve had enough’ — then they would have missed out on the most impactful, most influential times of their life.”“Maybe that is the next step for you,” he added. “Maybe that is tomorrow. Maybe that is next week, maybe that is next year. But when we quit, we will never know what we missed out on. We will never know what’s in store for us.”In the end, Tebow said that Christians are better equipped to handle this pandemic because of their close relationship with Jesus Christ.“We get to trust an unknown future to a known God, because we know how much He loves us,” he explained. “We know what He did for us in sending His son. He gave His best for us.”Do you think Twitter censors conservatives?“Right where you’re at, whatever you’re doing, whatever you’re going through, He loves you. You were enough for His son to die on the cross, that’s how much you’re loved,” Tebow concluded. “Hold onto that in your time of need.”He posted the video to Twitter along with the caption, “This could be your time. That breakthrough could be tomorrow, or it could be next year. But, you have the opportunity to turn however you’re being tested into a testimony. So many heroes were wounded deeply before they were used greatly!”This could be your time. That breakthrough could be tomorrow, or it could be next year. But, you have the opportunity to turn however you're being tested into a testimony. So many heroes were wounded deeply before they were used greatly!pic.twitter.com/ldTu5acIDO— Tim Tebow (@TimTebow)July 27, 2020Twitter may be claiming that censoring this video was an “error,” but that seems awfully fishy to us. Given how liberal Big Tech is, it would not be surprising if a leftist at Twitter found the Christian message of Tebow’s video so offensive that he or she decided it just had to be censored.Imagine the outrage that would come from the Left if Twitter did this to a Muslim video."

Now, his cause of death has finally been revealed.“He died of heart disease (natural),” the Chief Medical Examiner Office in Connecticut clarified in a statementper.This came after Philbin’s family said that he died of “natural causes.”“We are deeply saddened to share that our beloved Regis Philbin passed away last night of natural causes, one month shy of his 89th birthday,” they said in a statement. “His family and friends are forever grateful for the time we got to spend with him — for his warmth, his legendary sense of humor, and his singular ability to make every day into something worth talking about. We thank his fans and admirers for their incredible support over his 60-year career and ask for privacy as we mourn his loss.”Philbin was best known for hosting his “Live!” morning show alongside cohosts Kathie Lee Gifford and Kelly Ripa. He was also known as the host of the popular gameshow “Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?” His career in television spanned decades, earning him millions of fans over the years.This comes after Gifford opened up about the last time she saw Philbin, explaining that she went to visit him at his home in Connecticut recently.“I was just so grateful the Lord gave me that final time,”Gifford said. “And it was so precious because when I talked to Joy the day that I found out right after he had passed, she said, ‘Kathie he hadn’t laughed in a long, long time.’ She said, ‘I was so worried about him.'”“I think he was like Frank,” she added. “He was just ready, you know? … And she said, ‘The day that we came to have lunch with you was the last time I heard him laugh.’ That will forever be a precious gift the Lord gave me, that I got to laugh again with one of my best friends in all my lifetime.”Gifford added that during this visit, she could tell that Philbin’s health was failing.“I sensed much more fragility than I’d seen in him since the last time in January out in Los Angeles,” Gifford explained. “We sat right here on my screened porch, and we laughed ourselves sick. We always picked up right where we left off. … After they left I just thought to myself, ‘Lord, is that the last time I’m going to see my friend?’ Because he was failing, I could tell.”The opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of LifeZette."
4305,Bernard Kerik: Black Lives Matter's roots are showing,27.67,15.67,https://www.lifezette.com/2020/07/bernard-kerik-black-lives-matters-roots-are-showing,https://adfontesmedia.com/lifezette-bias-and-reliability/,2020-07-27,www.lifezette.com,22,"Unlike so many other commentators and public officials, I have never been under any illusions as to the true nature of the “Black Lives Matter” (BLM) movement.Hiding behind an innocuous-sounding moral truism, BLM is an avowedly “revolutionary” group rooted in terrorist violence, unrepentant Marxism, latent racism and anti-Semitism, and committed to the “dismantling” of America as we know it. Ever since its emergence in 2014 and 2015, BLM’s primary target has been law enforcement officers like the brave men and women I served with throughout my career, a fact that has perhaps immunized me from the propaganda that portrays BLM as a legitimate organization concerned with justice—a lie that has successfully convinced hundreds of major corporations to ply BLM with millions of dollars in donations, mainly as an act of virtue signaling.Finally, however, people are beginning to wake up to the grim reality of what we’re really dealing with here. I was happy torelatethe current state of play on “Tucker Carlson Tonight” recently. In case you missed it, here’s the recap:BLM was never a mainstream or moderate movement. From the very beginning, it trafficked in violent rhetoric aboutkillingpolice officers, which the establishment Left eitherignored or excused. We police officers, of course, knew that we were dealing with a genuine threat.The first cracks in BLM’s façade began to show in 2016, when the group couldn’t help but include anti-Semitic talking points about Jews committing “genocide” in Palestine as part of an ideological manifesto. It was widelycondemnedin the Jewish press at thetime, but swept under the rug by the rest of the mainstream media.Now, of course, we can all see the truth: BLM was founded and is to this day held together by communists. Last month, a video emerged, showing BLM co-founderPatrisse Cullorsdescribingherself and another co-founder as “trained Marxists.”It shouldn’t have been a surprise to anyone familiar with BLM’s history and background. Cullors has long been open about her ties to communists —including terrorists— while the co-founder she referenced, Alicia Garza, has been equally open about heraffinityfor cop-killing communist Joanne “Assata Shakur” Chesimard.Then, we learned that BLM’s fundraising operation —the tax-exempt “charity” raking in millions in corporate guilt checks— isrunin part by none other than Susan Rosenberg, the convicted “May 19th Communist Organization” terrorist.Rosenberg is free to raise millions for BLM only because President Bill Clinton, in the final hours of his presidency, commuted her 58-year sentence for hoarding weapons and explosives for a group that killed several police officers and civilians while engaging in a years-long campaign of bombings and armed robberies.I personally escorted Rosenberg to and from her trial in Newark, New Jersey in 1985, carrying my sidearm at all times. The extreme security was necessary because her terror cell was known for staging violent prison breaks.Who do you think would win the Presidency?It should be clear by now that BLM’s leadership is driven by a dangerous ideology rooted in race hatred and committed to violent revolution. The group’s ugly side poked through yet again when BLM’s Toronto chapter founder posted a lengthy screed describing white people as “sub-human” and “recessive genetic defects.” Black people are superior, according to this BLM leader, because “melanin directly communicates with cosmic energy.”Once again, astute observers could see this coming. Back in 2018, BLM darling Tamika Mallory landed in hot water over her unapologeticsupportfor Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, a man whose cult preaches that white people are not true humans but, rather, “devils” genetically “grafted” by a mad scientist named Yakoob.The evidence is out there and freely available—BLM is not run by well-meaning “social justice warriors”; it’s run by people who practice a racial brand of revolutionary communism.Bernard Kerik is a former police commissioner and Department of Correction commissioner in New York City."

In fact, Van Duyne’s win was so huge that GOP strategists have even dubbed her seat as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s “most bitter loss.”Last month, Van Duyne was elected to represent Texas’ 24th District covering Dallas-Fort Worth, making her only the second Republican woman from Texas ever to be elected to the House of Representatives.“The results of this race proved the people of North Texas want a representative who will go to Washington to get things done, and that’s exactly what I’m going to do,” Van Duyne toldFox News. “As a single mother and a businesswoman, I’m ready to fight to empower working families, expand job opportunities, and deliver more options for people to have affordable, personalized health care.”Van Duyne beat her Democrat opponent, Candace Valenzuela, in a very tight race, winning with 166,363 votes – or 48.8% – to Valenzuela’s 163,326, or 47.5%. This seat had been held by GOP Rep. Kenny Marchant since 2005, and Pelosi and her fellow Democrats saw it as a prime opportunity to pick up an open seat with. his retirement.“Pelosi, Democrat leadership, and numerous liberal, attack organizations went all-in to assault Beth Van Duyne, spending over $14 million and making TX-24 the most expensive open seat race in the country,” said a Texas GOP strategist. “They completely believed they were going to win.”“Pelosi’s failure in this North Texas suburban district – that Joe Biden won – may well be her most bitter loss,” the strategist added.Pelosi, however, has tried to put on a brave face and refused to acknowledge her failings in this election cycle.“We lost a few seats,” Pelosi said after the election. “But as I said, we won those seats in Trump districts. He wasn’t on the ballot [in 2018], he is now. I do believe with Biden in the White House and a Democratic Congress and hopefully a Democratic Senate – we’ll see in January – we’ll be able to do great things for the American people.”Republican lawmakers are already expressing their excitement at having Van Duyne onboard.“Beth was an incredible mayor of Irving, Texas, who knows what it takes to grow our economy and keep our streets safe,” said House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA). “Her victory in November means our Republican conference will be even stronger.”Who do you think would win the Presidency?“She’ll be an invaluable member of our team because she will always fight to restore our way of life, rebuild the greatest economy in history, and renew the American Dream,” he added."

She had been with Netflix since 2018, and her final official day with the streaming service will be January 20.Biden’s campaign said in a statement that he chose Rice for this role because she “knows government inside and out” and will “turbocharge the effort to build back better,” according toYahoo News.“Rice is among our nation’s most senior and experienced government leaders with the skills to harness the power of the federal government to serve the American people,” Biden said. “As a former member of the Cabinet, she also understands the challenges and opportunities of running an agency and has extensive experience working with other key members of the Biden-Harris White House team.”Biden also nominated Denis McDonough, the former White House chief of staff for Barack Obama, as secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs. This was a somewhat controversial decision given the fact that McDonough never served in the armed forces himself, according to theAssociated Press.This is yet more evidence that Biden is filling his potential administration with major figures in the Obama administration.

Vilsack had this same role for eight years when Obama was in office.“The roles they will take on are where the rubber meets the road — where competent and crisis-tested governance can make a meaningful difference in people’s lives, enhancing the dignity, equity, security, and prosperity of the day-to-day lives of Americans,” Biden said in a statement, referring to the nominations."
4312,Justice Alito Sounds An Alarm Over Biden And PC,14.0,37.67,https://www.lifezette.com/2020/11/justice-alito-sounds-an-alarm-over-biden-and-pc/,https://adfontesmedia.com/lifezette-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-15,www.lifezette.com,22,"Seeing the current atmosphere of Washington and what PC Democrats may bring to it in January,  Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito warned that the virus has launched “unimaginable” restrictions on basic freedoms. He said this Thursday, addressing a conference of the conservative Federalist Society in Washington.“We have never before seen restrictions as severe, extensive, and prolonged as those experienced for most of 2020,” he said. Alito also noted that many recent law school graduates face “harassment” and “retaliation” for any moderate or conservative views that depart “from law school orthodoxy.”He continued, “Tolerance for opposing views is now in short supply. In certain quarters religious liberty has fast become a disfavored right. For many today, religious liberty is not a cherished freedom. It’s often just an excuse for bigotry and it can’t be tolerated even when there’s no evidence that anybody has been harmed. The question we face is whether our society will be inclusive enough to tolerate people with unpopular religious beliefs.“One of the great challenges for the Supreme Court going forward will be to protect freedom of speech,” Alito said. “Although that freedom is falling out of favor in some circles, we need to do whatever we can to prevent it from becoming a second-tier constitutional right. Let’s go back to some basics: the Supreme Court was created by the Constitution, not by Congress, and under the Constitution we exercise the judicial power of the United States. Congress has no right to interfere with that work anymore than we have the right to legislate.”Houses of worship have been targeted unfairly during the virus. Alito mentioned a case in Nevada, “Nevada was unable to provide any justification for treating casinos more favorably than other houses of worship,” he said, referencing a recent Supreme Court decision.But the Left took a defense of faith in the address and turned it around to their twisted dark purposes, “Homophobic rhetoric isn’t a matter of free speech. It’s a matter of hate speech,” the obviously fey Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-CA, said Friday. I mean, what adult still goes by Jimmy? “These are stunning, harmful words from Justice Alito.” Oh boo bloody hoo, get over it sister.Homophobic rhetoric isn’t a matter of free speech. It’s a matter of hate speech.These are stunning, harmful words from Justice Alito.That’s why my @LGBTEqCaucus colleagues and I introduced a resolution reaffirming marriage equality and#SCOTUS’ Obergefell v. Hodges decision.https://t.co/CKbBJ2TcO9— Rep. Jimmy Gomez (@RepJimmyGomez)November 13, 2020The harpy Warren could not keep her pointed beak out of it, “Supreme Court Justices aren’t supposed to be political hacks. This right-wing speech is nakedly partisan,” she added. Uh huh. And Democrat judges and justices never do that? Right. The real reason they’re mad at Alito?Last week he issued a temporary order requiring Pennsylvania officials to segregate ballots that arrived after Election Day. Alito’s order came as part of a legal wrangle over ballots received during a three-day extension issued before the election by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. Alito decided for a fair election. That’s why Democrats went after him. He stalled their coup."

Nowhere is this more clear than in the case of the Supreme Court. Thus, among the president’s greatest achievements are the nominations and Senate confirmations of Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett.We saw this on Wednesday as the high court ruled against the arbitrary and capricious actions of New York Liberal Democrat Governor Andrew Cuomo and his dictatorial hypocrisy on virus regulations.FNC: “The court ruled 5-4 to bar Cuomo from enforcing his Oct. 6 ‘Cluster Initiative’ against houses of worship that sued to challenge the restrictions. The order was also the first in which Justice Amy Coney Barrett played a decisive role. Barrett, who was President Trump’s third Supreme Court nominee, joined the court Oct. 27, after winning Senate confirmation following the Sept. 18 death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In addition to Gorsuch and Barrett, Trump also appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas — conservatives who were appointed before Trump took office — also sided with the majority opinion.”Evangelical Christian leader Franklin Graham, son of the late and famed Reverend Billy Graham, was pleased with the outcome of the court decision, “President Trump deserves thanks for appointing three conservative Supreme Court justices, each of whom ruled this week in favor of religious groups and against New York government officials seeking to curb congregation sizes at religious services.”He wrote on Twitter that he was “thankful for President @realDonald Trump’s appointment of 3 conservative #SCOTUS justices who ruled last night in favor of churches & against gov’t overreach in the state of New York.”VICTORY at the Supreme Court‼️The Court rules AGAINST Cuomo 5-4 and his attempt to unconstitutionally restrict religious gatherings.“Even in a pandemic, the Constitution cannot be put away and forgotten."" 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸— Kayleigh McEnany (@kayleighmcenany)November 26, 2020Gorsuch wrote in the majority opinion: “It is time … to make plain that, while the pandemic poses many grave challenges, there is no world in which the Constitution tolerates color-coded executive edicts that reopen liquor stores & bike shops but shutter churches, synagogues, & mosques.” Absolutely perfect logic from this Trump appointee.In the Supreme vote, Chief Justice John Roberts voted with the liberal minority. The left knows that such cases are being decided by the conservative majority because of the president’s victory on Barrett. Therefore, expect extraordinary pressure on the Supreme Court in a Biden administration.There will be moves for the liberal justices to retire to make way for younger leftists. There could be a court packing scheme. Knowing the left and their terrorist allies, there could even be physical threats and assaults on conservative Supreme Court justices. The proper crocodile tears would be shed by the Biden administration and then they would nominate a Jacobin, an ersatz Robespiere, a veritable Vyskinsky, to sit on the high court.Who do you think would win the Presidency?What will stop them? Pray it is the United States Senate, likely by one vote. That’s how close we are to a national tragedy of immense proportions."
4314,Tulsi Gabbard Presses For Other Pardons,9.33,38.33,https://www.lifezette.com/2020/11/tulsi-gabbard-presses-for-other-pardons/,https://adfontesmedia.com/lifezette-bias-and-reliability/,2020-11-27,www.lifezette.com,22,"Rep. Tulsi Gabbard – Democrat of Hawaii, who did not run for reelection, was the candidate who sunk Kamala Harris’ presidential ambitions. So perhaps now is a good time for her to get out of Washington.The extremely telegenic US Army combat officer never seemed quite at home in the Democrat Party. She is no conservative. But her tendency to spar with Harris and Hillary Clinton, her military record, her visage and demeanor, suggest a person who is a sensible patriot. Which, of course, precludes her from leadership in the Democrat Party. Perhaps that is why she is retiring. However, she still has some fight left in her.FNC: “…Gabbard has called on President Trump to pardon National Security Agency (NSA) whistleblower Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange before the president leaves office on Jan. 20, according to a report. In a tweet the retiring Hawaii Democrat suggested that Trump use his presidential pardoning authority to grant clemency to both men, each of whom has been charged under the Espionage Act of 1917, Newsweek reported.”‘Since you’re giving pardons to people, please consider pardoning those who, at great personal sacrifice, exposed the deception and criminality of those in the deep state,’ Gabbard tweeted on Thursday, tagging President Trump.” That is a Democrat using the term “deep state.” That is not something you see every day.In an earlier tweet she said, “Brave whistleblowers exposing lies & illegal actions in our government must be protected. Join me and urge Congress: Pass my bipartisan legislation (HRes1162, HRes1175, HR8452) calling for charges against @snowden & Assange to be dropped & to reform the Espionage Act.”.@realDonaldTrumpSince you're giving pardons to people, please consider pardoning those who, at great personal sacrifice, exposed the deception and criminality of those in the deep state.https://t.co/aeXklUsNSd— Tulsi Gabbard 🌺 (@TulsiGabbard)November 26, 2020The case of both men is controversial in conservative circles. Libertarian conservatives see both as heroes, exposing government corruption, Big Tech manipulations, and establishment intrigues. National security conservatives see them as traitors, providing sensitive American data to our potential enemies. The fact that Snowden lives in Russia, he has for some time, and has likely been thoroughly debriefed by FSB officers does not help his case.But the president knows what it’s like to be targeted by the establishment and Big Tech. He is also a national security maverick, pulling America out of meaningless conflicts and refusing to fund the defenses of allied nations at the expense of the American taxpayer.So their case and Gabbard’s plea may not be dismissed out of hand. It would gain the president points with young voters, the foreign press, and libertarians of all stripes. Now, the president is not a leader who does things for the popularity of them. In fact, many times it seems the opposite. But if he is considering a 2024 run, and he is, this would not be a bad way to reach out to diverse constituencies in anticipation of Trump 2024 ramp up just after the 2022 midterms. Thus, these pardons are definitely not out of the realm of possibility."

4316,Attorney General Barr bombs premise of Black Lives Matter,22.33,20.67,https://www.lifezette.com/2020/09/attorney-general-barr-bombs-premise-of-black-lives-matter/,https://adfontesmedia.com/lifezette-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-03,www.lifezette.com,22,"Black Lives Matter is based on a simple premise: Racist white police officers are killing black people because they are black. But actual numbers show that a majority of those killed by police are white and that only 32% are black. So, if racist white police officers are hunting down innocent blacks, then why are they killing more whites than blacks? Why, by two to one, are you safer with a police officer if you’re black than if you’re another race?The answer is obvious: Black Lives Matter, like so many Democrat disinformation operations, is a hoax. Like Russian collusion and the Ukrainian phone call before it, Black Lives Matter is based on a lie that is willingly spread by the media. But U.S. Attorney General William Barr is having nothing of it.“I think the narrative that the police are on some epidemic of shooting unarmed black men is simply a false narrative,” Barr said Wednesday on. “The fact is that it’s very rare for an unarmed African American to be shot by a white police officer.”https://twitter.com/nick_ramsey/status/1301272527881359360?s=19The vast majority (68 percent) of those shot by police officers are not black. So those alleged killer racist officers must be color blind. The majority shot by police are white —52 percent— while 32 percent are black. African American males make up six percent of the population but commit over many times that percentage of crimes, according to findings from the National Institutes of Health and the FBI. Thus their chances of being involved in police situations are much higher to begin with. All the evidence points to one inescapable conclusion: police officers shoot more white people than black people by 20 percent. So, going by facts and the premise of the movement, it should be called “Male Lives Matter,” “White Lives Matter,” or more than not, “Criminal Lives Matter.”Barr continues: “At the same time, I think it would be an oversimplification to treat the problem as rooted in some deep-seated racism generally infecting our police departments. It seems far more likely that the problem stems from a complex mix of factors, which can be addressed with focused attention over time.”Barr is not a politician but the nation’s top law enforcement officer, so he can’t and shouldn’t go into the factual consequences of his data-driven assertion. But he is also a very intelligent man and is not oblivious to the obvious conclusions.The amazing part of this is the complete intellectual disregard Democrats have for America and especially for black Americans. They believe that by lying about this issue, in contravention of easily discoverable facts, that black Americans will rise up in indignation and blame the president. But something else happened.Since the riots and the media ascendancy of Black Lives Matter, the president’s poll numbers have skyrocketed with black American voters. Trump received about 6-8 percent of their votes in 2016. Now, his standing is around 25 percent and growing. He’s quadrupled his support. So even in today’s America there are times when a Democrat lie won’t work."

Yes, some Democrats finally admitted that Trump did not collude with the Russians. Oh hooray.“Over the last three years, the Senate Intelligence Committee conducted a bipartisan and thorough investigation into Russian efforts to influence the 2016 election and undermine our democracy,” said Acting Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Marco Rubio (R-FL) on Tuesday. “We interviewed over 200 witnesses and reviewed over 1 million pages of documents. No probe into this matter has been more exhaustive.”Final volume of Senate Intelligence bipartisan & thorough investigation into Russian 2016 efforts is now publichttps://t.co/nuPuYifaa4We found no evidence of “collusion”But we did find troubling actions by the FBI, particularly their willingness to rely on “Steele Dossier”pic.twitter.com/S5hiKDgURB— Marco Rubio (@marcorubio)August 18, 2020“We can say, without any hesitation, that the Committee found absolutely no evidence that then-candidate Donald Trump or his campaign colluded with the Russian government to meddle in the 2016 election,” Rubio said. “What the Committee did find, however, is very troubling.”Rubio’s committee found “irrefutable evidence of Russian meddling” and “deeply troubling actions taken” by the FBI, “particularly their acceptance and willingness to rely on the ‘Steele Dossier’ without verifying its methodology or sourcing.” Yup, the FBI under Comey was corrupt as the day is long. Let’s hope John Durham comes to that view as well.Rubio: “The FBI used the dossier in a FISA application and renewals, and advocated for it to be included in the Intelligence Community Assessment before taking the necessary steps to validate assumptions about Steele’s credibility.”The Senate Intelligence Committee found that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort’s “presence on the Trump campaign and proximity to then-candidate Trump created opportunities for Russian intelligence services to exert influence over, and acquire confidential information on, the Trump campaign.” Looking for the fall guy? Look no further.“On numerous occasions, Manafort sought to secretly share internal Campaign information with [Russian oligarch] Konstantin Kilimnik,” the Senate report said. Though the committee was “unable to reliably determine why Manafort shared sensitive internal polling data or Campaign strategy with Kilimnik or with whom Kilimnik further shared that information… The Committee obtained some information suggesting Kilimnik may have been connected to the GRU’s hack and leak operation targeting the 2016 U.S. election…after the election, Manafort continued to coordinate with Russian persons, particularly Kilimnik and other individuals close to Oleg Deripaska, in an effort to undertake activities on their behalf… Manafort worked with Kilimnik starting in 2016 on narratives that sought to undermine evidence that Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. election,” the committee reported.Who do you think would win the Presidency?The Intel committee added: “Taken as a whole, Manafort’s high-level access and willingness to share information with individuals closely affiliated with the Russian intelligence services, particularly Kilimnik and associates of Deripaska, represented a grave counterintelligence threat.” If the president loses the election, expect Manafort, as in the custom of all outgoing presidents in regards to their troubled pals, to be pardoned.However, in the main, Rubio and his committee found “no solid evidence that information of benefit to the Campaign was transmitted at the meeting, or that then-candidate Trump had foreknowledge of the meeting [with the Russians].” Enough exoneration already. Can we just fast forward to the next hoax?"

Maron gave a disclaimer at the start of the show saying that “if you don’t like Jews, you’re gonna get triggered,” adding that it was the “Jewiest talk” he’d ever had.“If you meet a Jewish person in America, they’re probably here because someone tried to kill their grandparents not that long ago,” Rogen said to kick things off.The “Knocked Up” star went on to denounce the Jewish state of Israel, claiming that a “better strategy” after the Holocaust would have been to spread Jews out all over the world, rather than congregate them in one place.“You don’t keep all your Jews in one basket,” Rogen said. “It makes no sense whatsoever.”“It would be nice to live somewhere which was not a part of Christian apocalyptic prophecy,” he said, “maybe settle somewhere the Christians don’t think you’ll have to die in order for the Apocalypse [to occur].”Rogen then talked about why he would never live in Israel:“To me it just seems an antiquated thought process. If it is for religious reasons, I don’t agree with it, because I think religion is silly.If it is for truly the preservation of Jewish people, it makes no sense, because again, you don’t keep something you’re trying to preserve all in one place — especially when that place is proven to be pretty volatile, you know? ‘I’m trying to keep all these things safe, I’m gonna put them in my blender and hope that that’s the best place…that’ll do it.’“It doesn’t make sense to me. And I also think that as a Jewish person I was fed a huge amount of lies about Israel my entire life! They never tell you that — oh by the way, there were people there. They make it seem like it was just like sitting there, like the f*cking door’s open!… They forget to include the fact to every young Jewish person.”Rogen indicated that his feelings on Judaism are upsetting to his wife (pictured above), who is also Jewish.“I would have been totally happy marrying a non-Jewish person, it’s only coincidental that [his wife Lauren Miller is] Jewish, and it really bothers her when I say that,” he admitted. “She wants her Judaism to have some value to me, even though it doesn’t, in any way, shape or form.”Who do you think would win the Presidency?This comes as anti-Semitism is at an all-time high in the United States, something that Rogen admits.“It is pervasive and it is prevalent and it is to many Jewish people so confounding that they don’t assume it’s true…” Rogen said of anti-Semitism. “I’ve tried to put a lot of thought into why it’s happened… People obviously hate people who do not look like them. … I think people also have a weird fear of people who look like them but do not believe the same thing they do fundamentally.”Rogen did not seem to see the irony of calling out anti-Semitism right after saying that Israel “makes no sense.” This shows once again that finding success in Hollywood does not require an IQ test."

There didn’t seem to be any objections to this deliberate butchering of the Pledgeby those high profile members who attended the session, which included DNC Chair Tom Perez, Bernie Sanders, Keith Ellison, and Rashida Tlaib.Because why would there be? While the DNC probably avoided national headlines by not removing “under God” from the recitation that occurred during the opening of the event, this is a darn good sign that this is exactly how they feel about it. Away from the media attention, this is what they back.This isn’t an unreasonable conclusion to make, as there have been other rather clear examples of anti-God/anti-Christian behavior at past DNCs as well. Back in 2016, the DNC opened in Philadelphia with a prayer from a minister,but those prayers were heckled and interrupted.And in 2012,the words “God” and “Jerusalem” were both booedwhen they were considered being put back into the party’s official platform.

Once a controversial but brave organization, they have been reduced to shilling for the dregs of society and championing causes that must embarrass even their most frothing supporters. As such, their coffers are not what they used to be. So what do they do?They try to gin up donations by calling for something patently absurd. Their thinking is maybe they can get a piece of the pie of all the cash donated by lunatics and terrorist fellow travelers to Antifa and Black Lives Matter. So they call for the abolition of the Department of Homeland Security, the main force standing in the way of Antifa and Black Lives Matter. Easy, right. Except, DHS knows how to fight back.Last week the ACLU joined a small minority and called for law enforcement to be defunded and the dismantling of@DHSgov.Our response to this political stunt:https://t.co/YKJZQU8Vc8— Acting Secretary Chad Wolf (@DHS_Wolf)August 17, 2020Heritage Foundation V.P. James Carafano comments on the kerfuffle: “Of course, the ACLU learned long ago that championing far-left fantasies was an express pass to fund-raising bonanzas. After 9/11, the ACLU made attacking the Patriot Act their cause célèbre — and an aroused Left cheerfully opened its wallets… Watching all the usual progressive Big Money Boys pour resources into the Black Lives Matter network, the ACLU must have set its cap at can getting part of the action. With ‘Defund the Police’ and ‘Defund Defense’ already taken, the ACLU set its sights on Homeland Security… The logic appears to be that, since DHS is a government agency being run by a president they don’t like and pursuing policies they don’t like, it should be eliminated. If conservatives had called for abolishing the State Department after Benghazi, the Left would have laughed. This complaint makes as little sense.”Carafano defines the issue: “At its root, the ACLU’s beef with the department is that it is doing its job too well — protecting federal property in our cities, securing the border and going after radical, criminal extremist violence… To be against the department is to not want federal property protected; not care if law enforcement officers are attacked, injured, blinded or killed; not fear for equal protection under the law in our cities; and not worry that our citizens can’t safely walk our streets or open their doors for business without being harassed or extorted.”When the ACLU was founded ages ago it fought for free speech, often in the face of wide and intensive opposition. More times than not they were on the right side of the Constitution, granted sometimes defending very odious people. They understood what Voltaire meant about defending free speech that isn’t popular.But like so many groups that occasionally had their moments, the ACLU has fallen prey to the PC bacillus. Now they only seek to advance a hard-left agenda at any cost. And if they can make some filthy lucre off it by appealing to the lowest common intellectual denominator amongst the denizens of the fever swamps of the Left, they think so much better for them. But not really. Now they are just another of the grasping herd of Bolshevik hucksters. No more glory, no more moral and intellectual bravery. A sad state for a once scrappy band that here and there found themselves on the right side of the Constitution."
4323,New Reports Indicate Trouble between Obama and Biden,31.0,13.67,https://www.lifezette.com/2020/08/new-reports-indicate-trouble-between-obama-and-biden/?utm_source=home-top-stories,https://adfontesmedia.com/lifezette-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,www.lifezette.com,22,"Disgraced 44th president Barack Obama has recently let it be known through a third party what he thinks of Joe Biden’s chances for victory. Obama said to a Democrat pro who leaked it, certainly with Obama’s approval, “Never underestimate Biden’s ability to screw this up.” Various versions of the line are making their rounds on social media, but one thing is clear: Obama does not want to be tarred with a Biden loss.Actually, Obama is playing a double game. If Biden wins he will take credit. If Biden loses he will say, “I told you so.” This is all in an effort not to damage the Obama brand while Michelle prepares her own run for office, probably in Illinois.There is a bit of ideology and a vendetta at play here as well. Obama knows at heart Biden is a machine moderate, not a PC radical like himself. Just look at Biden in the 70s when he was first elected to the Senate. He could almost have been called leaning right then. Look at his treatment of Anita Hill when he was Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1991. He wasn’t quite subservient enough for the likes of Obama’s wing of the party and the former chief executive remembers it.Then there was this primary season and his battle with Sanders. Obama’s socialist heart lies with Sanders, as does almost of all the Obama administration types still active in the party. And the vendetta?Obama correctly sees Biden as more of a member of the Clinton wing of the party, left wing corporatists, than of his socialist wing. And there is very little love lost between Obama and Clinton. Obama holds Hillary Clinton responsible for squandering his legacy by losing to Trump and Obama still recalls the harsh words between the two camps in the North Carolina primary of 2008.For his part, Biden’s people know how polarizing and potentially radioactive Obama is to swing voters. They also want their own mandate and reject advice and arm’s length sponsorship from a guy they see as an ineffectual show pony. They saw in the congressional GOP landslide in 2010 and in Trump’s victory that Obama has little to non-existent coattails. After this last leak, their enmity for their boss’ former boss will increase accordingly.So how does it play out in the general? Obama will continue to walk a tightrope between support for Biden and letting it be known that Biden’s loss is not his proxy loss. Biden will use the ex-president when and where he can, but Biden knows Obama’s double game and will be suspicious of more anonymous leaks.If the President Trump’s team is smart they will do all they can to fan the flames and rub salt in any outstanding wounds. They could run ads in urban areas calling out racial gaffes by Biden and then contrasting them with Obama lines. They can execute that and other tactics to make Obama think the price for sticking with Biden may be too great for the Obama brand to endure. Then, just sit back and watch the fun.The President is OverexposedMichigan High School Fall Football CancelledProtesters Tried to Protect Violent Criminals from Being Taken to Jail by ICEThe opinions expressed by contributors and/or content partners are their own and do not necessarily reflect the views of LifeZette."
4324,Michael Cohen tell-all book on President Trump reads like an amusing fairytale,26.33,25.0,https://www.lifezette.com/2020/09/michael-cohen-tell-all-book-on-president-trump-reads-like-an-amusing-fairytale/?utm_source=home-top-stories,https://adfontesmedia.com/lifezette-bias-and-reliability/,2020-09-02,www.lifezette.com,22,"Former presidential lawyer turned hoax collaborator Michael Cohen has written a tell-all, yet almost completely fabricated, book entitled“Disloyal, A Memoir: The True Story of the Former Personal Attorney to President Donald J. Trump.”In case you were wondering about the objectivity of the book, this should give you a clue.https://twitter.com/Breaking911/status/1298032187569254400?s=19In the book, Cohen claims to reveal much about the president. It does not. But it reveals much about Mr. Cohen. Like this, directly from his book:“The President of the United States wanted me dead. Or, let me say it the way Donald Trump would: He wouldn’t mind if I was dead. That was how Trump talked. Like a mob boss, using language carefully calibrated to convey his desires and demands, while at the same time employing deliberate indirection to insulate himself and avoid actually ordering a hit on his former personal attorney, confidant, consigliere, and, at least in my heart, adopted son… All rats deserve to die, I was told. I was a lowlife Judas they were going to hunt down.”Where do you even begin? The fake mob patois that nobody else ever heard Donald Trump use and —this is so pathetic— the “adopted son” line are both evidence not only of a vivid and bitter imagination but of a personal obsession with the president that borders on the unnatural. And the fake threats to make him seem like a victim? Please. He goes on…“For more than a decade, I had been at the center of Trump’s innermost circle. When he came to my son’s bar mitzvah, a generous gesture that I found touching, he told my then thirteen-year-old boy that his Dad was the greatest and that, if he wanted to work at the Trump Organization when he grew up, there would always be a position for him. ‘You’re family,’ Trump said to my son and I. And I f—ing believed him!”Another “family” reference, as in mob family. He’s watched “The Godfather” one too many times. He goes on…“I knew that the reality was much more complicated and dangerous. Trump had colluded with the Russians, but not in the sophisticated ways imagined by his detractors. I also knew that the Mueller investigation was not a witch-hunt. Trump had cheated in the election, with Russian connivance, as you will discover in these pages, because doing anything—and I mean anything—to ‘win’ has always been his business model and way of life.”Here’s the bitterness. Trump wins and Cohen then was a player. He said nothing at that point. Then suddenly when Cohen cracks and loses his presidential access, then and only then, is the president a Russian stooge. Right, of course. Cohen offers more fairytale fodder…“For more than a decade, I was Trump’s first call every morning and his last call every night. I was in and out of Trump’s office on the 26th floor of the Trump Tower as many as fifty times a day, tending to his every demand. Our cell phones had the same address books, our contacts so entwined, overlapping and intimate that part of my job was to deal with the endless queries and requests, however large or small, from Trump’s countless rich and famous acquaintances. I called any and all of the people he spoke to, most often on his behalf as his attorney and emissary, and everyone knew that when I spoke to them, it was as good as if they were talking directly to Trump.”Who do you think would win the Presidency?This sounds like a jilted girlfriend complaining about her ex. We could go on but you get the drift. The book is only a fantasy work that the press and the Democrats will use as ammo and Cohen will use as a payday to square his legal bills. Nothing else but that."

As Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton discussed Friday, Judicial Watch is fighting to overturn a recent court ruling which alleges the House of Representatives enjoys “absolute immunity from inquiries about the subpoenas” they ordered on Rudy Giuliani, Rep. Devin Nunes, and a number of other prominent conservatives. As Fitton explained, Rep. Adam Schiff committed “a radical abuse of the impeachment power [when] he issued secret subpoenas.” The attorney representing Rep. Schiff, who Fitton argues obtained the records by trampling on the Fourth Amendment rights of several U.S. citizens, recently argued that the court cannot be given the subpoenas due to possible privacy rights infringements. The Judge responded by stating:“Well, I do think it’s, if not ironic, noteworthy that one of the interests you’ve just put forward is the invasion of privacy when the whole claim of Judicial Watch is that this Committee invaded the privacy of private citizens in the first place.” As Fitton observed, “the Pelosi/Schiff House asserts it has an unlimited government surveillance power and an unlimited ability to invade the privacy of any American with zero accountability and transparency.” “Those Fourth Amendment protections you have against unlawful search and seizure… Congress thinks they don’t apply to them.” Fitton concluded by stating:“The courts should reject Adam Schiff and Nancy Pelosi’s corrupt cover-up of the unconstitutional subpoenas that abused the civil rights of then-President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, journalists and other American citizens.”Judicial Watch’s Senior Attorney, James Peterson, is fighting in the U.S. Court of Appeals – District of Columbia Circuit to challenge what Fitton describes as a “disgusting abuse of power.” If you support safeguarding your constitutional rights against unlawful secret subpoenas, support Judicial Watch’s work today.

Dr. Fauci claims to have been “misled” by the WHO, one of his early mistakes being his analysis “of how transmittable the virus was. In part, I’m sure that came from the Chinese,” Fitton states. These admissions have prompted Judicial Watch to represent the Daily Caller News Foundation in their seeking discovery of their full communications. “In a crisis, transparency and the rule of law should not fall on the wayside,” Fitton states. In its fight to uphold transparency in government, Judicial Watch has already filed over 30 FOIA requests to receive complete records on the government’s response to the pandemic as well as information related to the “outrageous lockdowns” which Governors have imposed across the United States, who in Fitton’s words “have no lawful authority to shut down entire states.”Judicial Watch believes it is imperative to investigate senior leadership in the National Institute of Health (NIH), from Dr. Fauci to Mr. Lane as it is “important to know what the WHO was telling our top medical officials,” Fitton concludes."

The emails revealed the U.S. government had been buying and trafficking “fresh” aborted baby body parts.According to the report, the FDA purchased the body parts, which were derived from babies aborted at up to 24-weeks’ gestation, in order to engineer humanized mice and perform experimental drug research.The Federalist reported on the Judicial Watch revelation:Emails between FDA officials and ABR employees reveal disturbing conversations as they collaborate to buy and sell aborted fetuses. Records indicate ABR was paid $12,000 upfront per baby, some survivable out of the womb, between the gestational age of 16-24 weeks. Most purchases are for intact thymuses and livers shipped “Fresh; on wet ice.”With the callousness of picking a cut of meat from a butcher shop, an FDA doctor requests tissue samples be procured from a baby boy, as they claim “It is strongly preferred to have a male fetus if at all possible … [but] undetermined sex or female is better than no tissue.”"
4758,"States Say ICE Stops Issuing Detainers for Illegal Immigrant Convicts, Revokes Them for Dozens",16.67,36.0,https://www.judicialwatch.org/corruption-chronicles/states-say-ice-stops-issuing-detainers-for-illegal-immigrant-convicts-revokes-them-for-dozens/,https://adfontesmedia.com/judicial-watch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-04-20,www.judicialwatch.org,21,"Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has long complained about police in sanctuary cities that fail to honor its detainers, instead releasing serious criminals in the U.S. rather than turn them over to get deported. Now two states are suing the Homeland Security agency for failing to issue detainer requests for convicted felons in the country illegally, forcing local authorities to free them after completing their sentence rather than turning them over to the feds for removal. It seems that the tables have turned under the Biden administration, according to the lawsuit, filed this month by officials in Texas and Louisiana.The states claim that ICE has reversed a Trump era policy and is not issuing detainer requests for dangerous illegal aliens imprisoned in their jurisdiction. “As a result, many convicted criminal aliens have been released to society after their sentences, contrary to Congress’s mandate that they be detained pending their removal from the United States,” according to their complaint, filed this month in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Texas Victoria Division. Besides ICE, the defendants include the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its secretary, Alejandro Mayorkas, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and various officials at the DHS agencies. The lawsuit begins by stating that “the Biden Administration is refusing to take custody of criminal aliens despite federal statutes requiring it to do so.” Instead, the document reads, defendants “have issued and implemented unlawful agency memoranda that allow criminal aliens already convicted of felony offenses to roam free in the United States. Such aliens belong in federal custody, as Congress required.”Adding insult to injury, officials in the Lone Star State reveal in the court document that the Biden administration has taken the extra step of revoking ICE detainer requests for a multitude of illegal immigrants convicted of felonies and serving sentences in prisons operated by the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. Many were found guilty in a U.S. court of serious drug offenses, including possession, manufacturing, and sale. “President Biden’s outright refusal to enforce the law is exacerbating an unprecedented border crisis,” said Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in a statement announcing the lawsuit. “By failing to take custody of criminal aliens and giving no explanation for this reckless policy change, the Biden Administration is demonstrating a blatant disregard for Texans’ and Americans’ safety. Law and order must be immediately upheld and enforced to ensure the safety of our communities. Dangerous and violent illegal aliens must be removed from our communities as required by federal law.” In 2019 Texas housed nearly 9,000 undocumented criminal aliens at a cost of more than $152 million, according to the lawsuit.In Louisiana ICE is not removing individuals subject to mandatory deportation, the complaint says, causing convicted felons incarcerated in state facilities to be released in local communities throughout the Bayou State. Louisiana, more than any other state, has greater risk due to the large number of local jails that are used to house detainees prior to removal, according to Attorney General Jeff Landry. “The President’s refusal to enforce the law only worsens an already dire border crisis,” Landry said. “Law and order must prevail; dangerous and violent criminal aliens must not be allowed to roam free in our communities.” Both states assert that the administration is violating binding agreements with DHS to assist in immigration enforcement and national security missions as well the Constitution, Immigration and Nationality Act and Administrative Procedure Act, which require the government to post proposed substantive rule changes in the Federal Register and allow the public to comment on them before enacting them.For years ICE has slammed sanctuary cities nationwide for refusing to honor a local-federal partnership known as 287(g) that notifies the agency of jail inmates in the country illegally so that they can be deported after serving time for state crimes. Before Biden became president, ICE repeatedly issued statements reminding sanctuary cities and states that when law enforcement agencies fail to honor immigration detainers and release serious criminal offenders onto the streets, it undermines its ability protect public safety and carry out its mission. The agency even launched a billboard campaign seeking the public’s help in capturing felons released by one state’s sanctuary policy."

U.S. Department of Homeland Security (No. 1:21-cv-01194)).The lawsuit was filed after the Secret Service failed to process records in a timely manner in response to a March 10, 2021, FOIA request seeking:All records of communications between USSS officials responsible for protection at the White House regarding the Biden family dogs, named Champ and Major.On April 12, 2021, the Secret Service replied to Judicial Watch’s FOIA request saying that they had identified responsive records which were being processed but have yet to produce them.On March 9, 2021, the White House confirmed that President Biden’s dog Major, “did in fact bite someone at the White House, causing a “minor injury.” Press secretary Jen Psaki confirmed said that the dogs, “are still getting acclimated and accustomed to their new surroundings and new people.”On March 30, 2021, the White House reported that, “President Biden’s dog Major on Monday afternoon bit another employee, who then required medical attention.” The encounter reportedly took place on the White House South Lawn Monday, March 29.“The public has a right to know the details about any incident in which Secret Service personnel were injured by President Biden’s dog,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “We have no doubt that Major and Champ are good dogs but politicians and bureaucrats can’t be trusted.”"

As Fitton explained, “we were able to extract 848 pages of documents about a California government deal… we’re trying to figure out what was behind this contract which was quite controversial… the documents are pretty interesting.” According to Judicial Watch’s findings, “the documents reveal that the Office of Emergency Services Assistant Chief Counsel in California admits that they deviated from the normal procurement protocol for this contract.” As Fitton summarized from an April 7th 2020 email, the President of the Chinese company, BYD, suggested that the California agency “should open champagne at the conference call when California finalized the purchase of the masks.”  In a later amendment to the agreement, “BYD had to refund 247 million of the 495 million down payment [to California] because they weren’t able to meet the deadline to receive certification for the N95 masks.“These are remarkable documents,” Fitton continued. “The documents show how a well-connected and controversial Chinese firm was able to get a leg up on a billion-dollar mask contract with California politicians,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.

4762,BLM “Racial Justice” Riots Result in Record Number of Domestic Terrorism Cases,13.33,42.67,https://www.judicialwatch.org/corruption-chronicles/blm-racial-justice-riots-result-in-record-number-of-domestic-terrorism-cases/,https://adfontesmedia.com/judicial-watch-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-14,www.judicialwatch.org,21,"A record number of domestic terrorism cases were filed by federal prosecutors last year with the largest concentration in Oregon thanks to the ongoing riots there inspired by the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement and its leftist supporters. For the past seven months Portland has been like a war zone with anarchists breaking into buildings, rioters setting fires in the streets and smashing the windows of local businesses. One area news report recently quoted Portland’s mayor comparing the perpetrators to a “flash mob.” There seems to be no end in sight to the mayhem. Just a few days ago about 100 protestors vandalized businesses and police headquarters in the Portland suburb of Tigard.The ongoing violence has earned Oregon the distinction of having the largest arsenal of criminally charged domestic terrorists during a record-breaking year for homegrown terrorism in the U.S. In fact, in 2020 the Department of Justice (DOJ) initiated more domestic terrorism cases than any other year in the last decade and a half, according to figures provided by the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a data research center at Syracuse University. The records published by TRAC show that U.S. attorneys around the country filed 183 domestic terrorism cases in 2020, most of them related to nightly protests in the aftermath of George Floyd’s death during an arrest by Minneapolis Police. Seventy-eight of the cases were brought in Oregon, ground zero of leftist rioting. It marks the highest total of such cases since government tracking began a quarter of a century ago, TRAC confirms. “This compares with 69 such prosecutions in fiscal 2017, the first year of the Trump Administration, 63 domestic terrorism prosecutions during FY 2018, and 90 such prosecutions during FY 2019,” the research group writes in its report.The government categorizes domestic terrorism to include assault, resisting or impeding officers or law enforcement employees, threats against the president, entering or remaining in restricted buildings or grounds, importing, or storing explosives, civil disorders and making threatening communications. Back in September Oregon’s top federal prosecutor, U.S. Attorney Billy J. Williams, announced that his office was committed to charging those who impede or assault law enforcement officers, damage federal property, and set buildings on fire. “Those who commit violence in the name of protest, will be investigated, arrested, prosecuted, and face prison time,” Williams writes in the announcement. Days later dozens got charged in Oregon with assault on a federal officer, destruction of government property, arson of federal property and violating national defense airspace. The cases all stem from nightly protests outside Portland’s federal courthouse after Floyd’s death 1,700 miles away.The District of Columbia ranks second with 16 domestic terrorism cases, according to TRAC figures obtained from the government. Ohio is third with six followed by Utah with five. The nonpartisan university research conglomerate points out that many U.S. Attorneys offices failed to charge perpetrators with domestic terrorism, even in states where violent BLM protests made international headlines. Among them is the U.S. Attorney in the Western District of Washington, which has jurisdiction over Seattle, a city with BLM protests just as violent as those in nearby Portland. In the aftermath of Floyd’s death, Seattle became a war zone with daily vandalism and violence as well as the occupation of a neighborhood—in the name of racial justice—that was finally dismantled by the city after two fatal shootings. Protestors managed to convince lawmakers to drastically cut police funding even as Seattle experiences the highest murder rate in 26 years.Federal prosecutors in Washington may have chosen to look the other way as domestic terrorists trashed their largest city, but the numbers nationally are still unsettling. Data provided by TRAC reveals that the homegrown extremists—mostly violent leftists claiming to be fighting for racial justice—greatly outnumber the 21 international terrorism cases filed by feds last year. “Federal prosecutors also labeled as terrorism prosecutions some cases brought to safeguard critical infrastructure to protect national security, terrorism-related financing offenses, and terrorism-related export enforcement,” TRAC writes in its report. “They also categorized others as internal security offenses. But despite the diversity of categories, the 183 domestic terrorism prosecutions during FY 2020 accounted for the majority. Prosecutions under the broad terrorism/internal security label altogether totaled 301.”"
4763,Hillary Clinton Resists Court Order to Produce After Action Memo on Search and Review Process that Lead to Deletion of Her Emails; Judicial Watch Files Motion to Compel,30.0,34.5,https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-releases/hrc-resists/,https://adfontesmedia.com/judicial-watch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-05-12,www.judicialwatch.org,21,"(Washington, DC) – Judicial Watch announced today that it filed a motion in federal court to compel former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to produce the December 2014 after action memorandum created by her personal attorney Heather Samuelson that memorializes the search for and processing of Clinton emails in 2014. Samuelson reviewed Clinton’s State Department emails and about half of them were deleted (Hillary Clinton is also resisting, through an emergency appeal, the court’s order that she testify to Judicial Watch about her emails.)The filing comes in a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit that seeks records concerning “talking points or updates on the Benghazi attack” (Judicial Watch v. U.S. Department of State (No. 1:14-cv-01242)). Judicial Watch famously uncovered in 2014 that the “talking points,” which provided the basis for false statements by then-National Security Advisor Susan Rice, were created by the Obama White House. This FOIA lawsuit led directly to the disclosure of the Clinton email system in 2015.In December 2018, Judge Lamberth ordered discovery into whether Clinton’s use of a private email server was intended to stymie FOIA; whether the State Department’s intent to settle this case in late 2014 and early 2015 amounted to bad faith; and whether the State Department has adequately searched for records responsive to Judicial Watch’s request. The court also authorized discovery into whether the Benghazi controversy motivated the cover-up of Clinton’s email. The court ruled that the Clinton email system was “one of the gravest modern offenses to government transparency.”Clinton is resisting producing even a portion of the “after-action” memo, despite an August 22, 2019, ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Royce C. Lamberth that Judicial Watch may ask for the memorandum in its discovery. Clinton refused to produce any part of the memo, alleging that it is fully exempt from disclosure under the “attorney work product doctrine.” In an earlier ruling on a similar issue in this litigation, the Court held that “any contemporaneous documents shedding light on the three narrow discovery topics – even documents evincing attorney impressions, conclusions, opinions, and theories – constitute fact work-product” and should be produced.Judicial Watch explains to the court: “After repeated attempts to resolve this dispute have proven unsuccessful, [Judicial Watch] respectfully requests an order from the Court to compel Secretary Clinton to produce the document … within short order.”Judicial Watch points out:This is a rare Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) case in which the Court determined that civil discovery is appropriate. On March 29, 2016, the Court granted [Judicial Watch’s] motion for discovery, holding that “[w]here there is evidence of government wrong-doing and bad faith, as here, limited discovery is appropriate, even though it is exceedingly rare in FOIA cases.”In its motion Judicial Watch refutes Clinton’s claim that the memo is protected by the “attorney work product doctrine”:Secretary Clinton claims that the after action memo is subject to the attorney work product privilege and exempt from disclosure, but she fails to explain that the memorandum was created in reasonable anticipation of litigation. … She does not assert that it was created due to the litigation here. Neither does she claim that it was created in anticipation of any other specific litigation. Simply put, she does not demonstrate that the after action memo was not created in the normal course of the search and review process …Second, … the after action memo falls within the category of “contemporaneous documents shedding light on the three narrow discovery topics.” … According to Samuelson’s testimony, the after action memo plainly contains factual information memorializing searches and techniques for retrieving Secretary Clinton’s governmental records.Clinton’s attorneys also do not explain why her emails were deleted despite the “reasonable anticipation of litigation,” rather than preserved.In a June 2019 court-ordered deposition to Judicial Watch, Samuelson admitted under oath that she was granted immunity by the U.S. Department of Justice in June 2016. She also revealed that, contrary to what she told the FBI in 2016, she was, in fact, aware that Clinton used a private email account while secretary of state. Samuel’s admission to Judicial Watch that she became aware of Clinton’s non-State.gov emails during her service in the Clinton State Department White House Liaison Office contradicts the notation in the FBI’s May 24, 2016, “302” report on Samuelson’s interview with FBI agents:Samuelson did not become aware of Clinton’s use of a private email account and server until she was serving as Clinton’s personal attorney.In 2014, after Clinton left the State Department, Samuelson became Clinton’s personal attorney where she was primarily responsible for conducting the review of Clinton emails and sorting out “personal” emails from government emails, which were provided to the State Department under the direction of Cheryl Mills and Clinton lawyer David Kendall.  After the emails were provided to State, Clinton, through her lawyers and Platte River Networks, deleted the rest of the “personal” emails from her server, wiping it clean. Samuelson conducted the review of emails on her laptop, using Clinton server files downloaded from Platte River Networks, which housed the Clinton email server.“Hillary Clinton doesn’t want the Court and the American people to know the full truth about her destruction of 33,000 emails,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “The evidence shows Hillary Clinton knew exactly what she was doing when she hid her emails, took them from the State Department and deleted them. So it is no surprise she is desperate to avoid testifying and turning over what must be a smoking-gun memo on her email deletions.”On March 2, 2020, Judge Lamberth granted Judicial Watch additional discovery that includes testimony under oath by Clinton and her former Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills regarding Clinton’s emails and Benghazi attack records. In April, Judicial Watch and the State Department, which is represented by Justice Department lawyers, filed responses opposing Clinton’s and Mills’ Writ of Mandamus request to overturn this court order requiring their testimonies.Also, on April 10, Judicial Watch served a subpoena on Google LLC, which was authorized by the court, demanding that it produce all emails, including metadata, from a Google account believed to contain former Secretary of State Clinton’s emails. In the subpoena,Judicial Watch also demands that Google produce all Clinton emails, including metadata, sent or forwarded to or from or saved, stored, archived or contained in the Gmail account, identified as CarterHeavylndustries@gmail.com, also written carterheavyindustries@gmail.com."
4764,Trump on the Front Lines: Big Bet on Virus Drug Gets Personal,23.83,22.17,https://www.judicialwatch.org/investigative-bulletin/trump-on-the-front-lines-big-bet-on-virus-drug-gets-personal/,https://adfontesmedia.com/judicial-watch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-05-21,www.judicialwatch.org,21,"Judicial Watch has been closely following the saga of President Trump and the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine (HC). We get a lot of mail on the subject. We’ve long considered it a bold gamble and a winning bet. On Monday, the president took it to another level, announcing that he himself had been taking the drug.Heads promptly exploded across the liberal universe. Nancy Pelosi denounced the president for being “morbidly obese” (he’s not) and “taking something that has not been approved by the scientists.” Longtime Trump antagonist Joe Scarborough called the president a liar, saying he is “not taking hydroxychloroquine.” Chuck Schumer said he did it “to divert attention from all the bad things happening.” Medical professionals rushed in. Trump was setting an “irresponsible” example, said Dr. Scott Solomon of Harvard Medical School. There are “serious hazards” to HC, said Dr. Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic. You get the idea.Yesterday, the president said he would soon stop taking HC, but point made—and it’s a good one. Trump correctly views himself as a frontline leader in the battle against Covid-19. That’s the context for understanding his latest move.The key word is “frontline.”Here’s what Trump said about HC on Monday:“You’d be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the frontline workers, before you catch it. The frontline workers, many many are taking it. I happen to be taking it. I happen to be taking it…. Frontline workers take it. A lot of doctors take it. I take it.”See his full remarks here. Trump repeatedly returns to the theme of HC as an aid to frontline personnel—doctors, nurses, emergency workers, cops, firefighters—and as a prophylactic. He notes that HC can be effective “especially early on” in the course of the virus. It shows promise “as a preventative.”And in fact there are numerous examples from around the globe indicating that HC might benefit frontline personnel and help fight the early stages of the virus. A recent NYU study, for example, found promising results. We noted in an earlier report that Turkey has thrown HC at everyone with the virus and claims a death toll lower than the global average. In March, India approved HC for its frontline personnel. Our mailbox at Judicial Watch is filled with accounts from frontline personnel about the positive impact of HC.The Food and Drug Administration, Centers for Disease Control, and many other organizations have warned about dangerous possible side effects to HC, including serious heart issues. These are important warnings. And other studies have found no benefit from the drug or are inconclusive.But this is life in wartime and an existential threat to the Trump Presidency. As we’ve noted before, the HC episode plays to some of Trump’s most successful political instincts: his preference for non-traditional channels, distrust of experts, deregulatory impulses, showmanship, and use of the media. It will be months, if not years, before the scientific consensus is settled on the use of HC in the battle against Covid-19.Meanwhile, there’s plenty of evidence to suggest that Trump’s bold gamble on HC is still paying off. On Monday, he pushed a big pile of chips to the center of the table and came up a winner."

Though the lower court said that Judicial Watch taxpayer clients are likely to succeed on the merits (that Governor Newsom has no authority under law to spend the money), there’s more harm to illegal aliens during the coronavirus crisis than there is to California’s 40 million taxpayers and citizens.Federal Court Orders Hearing on Judicial Watch Request for Temporary Restraining Order to Prevent Montgomery County, MD from Providing Cash Benefit Payments to Illegal Aliens“Montgomery County Executive Elrich and the Montgomery County Council have no legal authority on their own to spend taxpayer money for cash payments to illegal aliens,” said Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton. “The coronavirus challenge doesn’t give politicians a pass to violate the law. If they want to give cash payments to illegal aliens, they must be accountable and transparent, and, as federal law requires, pass a state law to do so.”Celebrating Ramadan U.S. Gives Terrorist Nation $22 Million to Fight COVID-19Celebrating the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, the U.S. is giving an Islamic country well known as a terrorist recruiting ground $22 million to combat coronavirus disease. In a ceremony announcing that American taxpayers are among the world’s first to provide funds for Bangladesh’s COVID-19 “readiness and response” efforts the Trump administration’s ambassador to the South Asian country noted that Ramadan serves as a reminder to be thankful for the front-line workers confronting the health crisis.How Obama Pushed James Comey to Target Gen. FlynnOn January 5th 2017, “Obama held an Oval Office meeting where he discussed Flynn and the transcripts of his call with the ambassador with his leadership team, including Sally Yates, James Comey, Biden and others” – Fitton claims. According to statements made by Sally Yates, Obama suggested using the Logan Act, “a legal nullity” to disingenuously target President Trump’s incoming National Security Advisor."

Why should American taxpayers care? Because the United States is funding the endeavor and, in fact, is the largest donor of the UN program conducting the multi-billion-dollar initiative called COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan (HRP). In a tedious 80-page document, the world body offers details of its costly project to counter the public health and humanitarian consequences of the crisis. It includes categorizing sexual and reproductive health services on the same level of importance as malnutrition, sanitation, shelter, essential healthcare and food insecurity.Since a large chunk of the American tax dollars flow into UN coffers via the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the head of the agency fired off a letter to the UN Secretary General blasting the COVID-19 response plan for advancing access to abortion as an “essential service.” Besides donating a whopping $3.5 billion to UN health and humanitarian assistance in 2019, USAID has so far been the largest contributor to the global COVID-19 response by pledging more than $1 billion to the cause. In the letter USAID Administrator John Barsa directs UN Secretary General António Guterres to stay focused on life-saving interventions such as the delivery of essential health care and food to address shortages that could represent a second, deadly impact of the pandemic in many countries.“The UN should not use this crisis as an opportunity to advance access to abortion as an essential service,” Barsa writes. “Unfortunately, the Global HRP does just this, by cynically placing the provision of sexual and reproductive health services on the same level of importance as food-insecurity, essential health care, malnutrition, shelter, and sanitation.” Barsa continues by writing: “Most egregious is that the Global HRP calls for the widespread distribution of abortion-inducing drugs and abortion supplies, and for the promotion of abortion in local country settings.” The Trump administration’s USAID administrator proceeds to ask the UN chief to remove references to sexual and reproductive health and its derivatives from the Global HRP and “drop the provision of abortion as an essential component of the UN’s priorities to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.”A Cuban American who grew up in south Florida, Barsa continues by noting that “under the leadership of President Donald J. Trump, the United States has made clear that we will never tire of defending innocent life.” The USAID chief reminds that during President Trump’s address to the 74the UN General Assembly, the commander-in-chief warned the UN that it has no business attacking the sovereignty of nations that wish to protect innocent life. “Indeed, the UN should not intimidate or coerce Member States that are committed to the right to life,” Barsa writes. “To use the COVID-19 pandemic as a justification to pressure governments to change their laws is an affront to the autonomy of each society to determine its own national policies on health care. The United States stands with nations that have pledged to protect the unborn.” Barsa also reveals that UN member countries are deeply divided over the use of the term “sexual and reproductive health” and its derivatives. “It is among the most polarizing issues raised in UN negotiations,” Barsa cautions, adding that “now is not the time to add unnecessary discord to the COVID-19 response.”In the HRP’s introduction, Guterres makes it clear that the UN is hitting up member nations, especially the U.S., for more money, by calling on all donors and partners to maintain core support for the most vulnerable. “To divert funding from humanitarian needs at this time would create an environment in which cholera, measles and meningitis would thrive, even more children would become malnourished, and the narratives of violent extremists would take deeper hold,” Guterres writes. “It would also extend the breeding ground for the coronavirus disease itself.”"
4767,Judicial Watch and Election Integrity Project California Both Work to Restore Voter Confidence Nationwide,19.67,34.0,https://www.judicialwatch.org/press-releases/jw-electionintegrityprojectcalifornia/,https://adfontesmedia.com/judicial-watch-bias-and-reliability/,2020-05-21,www.judicialwatch.org,21,"In the wake of proposals to change voting laws and practices due to COVID-19, Judicial Watch Inc. and Election Integrity Project California Inc. call on lawmakers and election officials to renew their commitment to another important voting rights issue: the urgent need to clean up voter registration rolls and ensure that elections cannot be manipulated through weak laws and practices that erode voter confidence.For more than two decades, Judicial Watch has been known for its aggressive, leading edge use of public records laws and lawsuits, as well as taxpayer, civil rights, and whistleblower protection litigation to fight government corruption.  In 2012, it launched a nationwide effort to promote voting integrity and protect voting rights.  As part of this effort, Judicial Watch has assembled a team of highly experienced voting rights attorneys who have fought gerrymandering in Maryland, stopped discriminatory elections in Hawaii, and cleaned up voter rolls in Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky, among other achievements.  In April 2020, Judicial Watch’s voting rights team filed lawsuits in North Carolina and Pennsylvania to compel the clean-up of voter rolls in five counties in those states.  Judicial Watch is headquartered in Washington, DC.Since 2010, Election Integrity Project California has worked to enable citizens to become active participants in the entire election process.  Its Data Analysis Group™ uses proprietary analysis techniques to research the accuracy of the voter rolls and report to officials duplicated, deceased and other ineligible registrations.  This helps ensure compliance with federal and state list maintenance laws.  Its Election Procedures Observations Program™ has resulted in providing documentation of the chaos in the election process due, in part, to bloated voter rolls.  Based in Santa Clarita, California, Election Integrity Project California has recently expanded its efforts to include Arizona, Nevada and Arkansas.Judicial Watch and Election Integrity Project California joined forces in 2017 to challenge the failure of election officials in Los Angeles and Sacramento to clean up Los Angeles County’s voter rolls. A 2019 settlement of that lawsuit caused changes in California’s statewide voter maintenance procedures and has the potential to result in the removal of some 1.5 million inactive registrations from Los Angeles County’s voter rolls.In this election year, Judicial Watch and Election Integrity Project California jointly call upon all nonpartisan organizations interested in promoting genuinely fair and honest elections to coordinate their efforts across the election process.“Confidence in voter rolls is a civil rights issue,” declared Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton.  “If voters don’t have confidence that voter rolls are updated regularly, it undermines the integrity of our elections.”Bob Popper, who leads Judicial Watch’s voter roll clean-up efforts, explained, “We look for counties that aren’t taking steps mandated by federal law or have more registered voters than citizens over the age of 18 who could lawfully register to vote.  These are red flags and indicate that election officials may not be complying with their voter list maintenance obligations.  We then request records from state and county election officials to see what efforts they are making to clean up their voter rolls.  After analyzing the records, we work with officials in state and counties that fall short to educate them about their obligations and to encourage them to comply with the law.”Linda Paine, President of Election Integrity Project California, said that “As co-plaintiffs in the 2017 lawsuit, our organization’s evidence was instrumental in getting Los Angeles County to agree to update its voter rolls.  Since then, our Election Integrity Project® identified significant structural flaws in California’s VoteCal voter database. Our Election Integrity Project® alerted the California Secretary of State to those flaws, and pointed out multiple incidents of double voting by mail in the March 3, 2020 primary, which he confirmed was double voting by duplicated registrants who had each received two mail ballots.”Paine added, “Our Election Integrity Project® recently served notice on the California Secretary of State for violations of the National Voter Registration Act, after identifying hundreds of thousands of registration irregularities.  Our work has exposed the urgent need to clean the voter lists, especially with potential all-mail elections on the horizon.”Judicial Watch is a conservative, non-partisan, tax-exempt educational organization under Internal Revenue Code section 50l(c)(3).

5263,The Emperor of America – Why Is Biden Governing by Decree?,20.67,13.67,https://www.libertynation.com/the-emperor-of-america-why-is-biden-governing-by-decree/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-03,www.libertynation.com,18,"With Democrats in control of both branches of Congress, opening a wide berth for legislative action, the question persists as to why Joe Biden has shattered the previousrecordfor unilateral decrees — i.e.,executive orders— in the early days of his presidency.In response, ask yourself these fundamental questions: If you were just elected to the highest office in the land as the oldest president ever to take the oath of office, in declining neurological health, uncertain of just how long you will be able to manage the relentless day-to-day pressures of the job, how would you govern? Would you play the long game, working diligently with a friendly legislature to write permanent change into the law? Or would you decide to leave an immediate and substantial imprint on the nation with a seemingly unprecedented burst of executive action right out of the starting gate? Would this not serve as a hedge against your presidency failing to run its full course and becoming a mere footnote in history?These questions have certainly been answered with an exclamation point by the 46th president. With more than 40 strokes of his executive pen, Biden has front-loaded his fumigation of the Trump presidency and thrown the necessary bouquets to his party’s progressive base. With the iron hand of chief of staff Ron Klain carefully orchestrating access to and scheduling for him, Biden has so far been able to pull off a single-shift presidency, arriving and departing from the Oval Office and required appearances mostly during business hours in small, tightly scripted bursts, with much rest in between.He is the quintessential and polar opposite to his predecessor, famously a perpetual-motion machine who, despite his signature commitment to “drain the Swamp,” employed executive orders far less frequently than Biden in the early days of his administration. And Trump moved swiftly out of the gate in leading the charge or backstopping his own party’s congressional initiatives on a range of issues, from taxes to immigration. When will President Biden begin to employ the majorities he holds in Congress? Time is short for theDemocrats’ narrow controlin the upper and lower chambers. As 2022 looms, they know history has rarely been kind to the ruling party in midterm elections.At some point soon, Biden’s decree machine will start to lose steam. He has shot his load early. The people will inevitably tire of governance by fiat. So what happens when aggressive and energetic presidential support is needed to push controversial legislation across the finish line? Will Biden’s bully pulpit, fired up almost exclusively by teleprompter, generate enough credibility for him to sell the public on, for example, a public option added to Obamacare, as Obama was able to do with Democrat majorities in both houses in 2010? Will he stand behind the inevitable flurry of aggressive and explosively controversial climate change legislation Congress is chomping at the bit to pass, even as those bills would face likely defeat in the Senate? Will he explicitly lend his support to equally contentious race-based initiatives likely to emanate from the House?All presidents seek to leave an indelible mark on the government over which they preside, and Biden is no different. But his time in the Oval Office may be shorter than most. His challenge is twofold: to calm the stormy waters stirred up by his predecessor’s ongoing crusade for systemic change, while attempting to demonstrate that the many institutions and practices challenged and exposed by Trump are worthy of restoration. No easy task for even a president in the prime of life. And while ruling by executive fiat is permissible within clear boundaries in our constitutional order, Biden will soon realize that his legacy will hinge not on what he commands from on high but on what he can persuade the American people to embrace."
5264,Impeachment Trial Moves Ahead After 56 Senators Fail Civics 101,24.67,24.0,https://www.libertynation.com/impeachment-trial-moves-ahead-after-56-senators-fail-civics-101/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-10,www.libertynation.com,18,"A day before theimpeachmenttrial of former President Donald Trump gets underway in earnest, the Senate convened to hear debate on the constitutionality of trying a man who no longer holds public office. House impeachment managers – the prosecution – presented their case on Feb. 9 for the legitimacy of this trial, but Trump’s defense team dismantled that position, citing the constitutional flaw and the complete absence of due process for their client. They also presented the chamber with a stark warning about the implications for both future and past presidents and government officials.Still, the trial will go ahead after an almost party-linevote, with six Republicans agreeing that the proceedings were constitutional.It didn’t take long for lead manager Jamie Raskin (D-MD) to reveal a fundamental flaw in his case. He argued that, if a president can commit an impeachable offense during his final weeks in the White House and avoid a later Senate trial on the grounds that he is no longer in office, it creates a “January exception.” The implication is that a president would enjoy what Raskin described as “constitutional immunity” to commit crimes, knowing that he would avoid conviction in the Senate by virtue of his departure from public office.Immediately following his “January exception” argument, though, Raskin clearly claimed that Trump’s motivation in stirring his supporters to violence was to remain in office by derailing the certification of the 2020 election result and, thus, the commencement of the transfer of power.There can be no escaping a Senate impeachment trial if the president is still the president. Trump was either inciting insurrection, knowing that he would escape punishment by leaving office, or he was attempting to remain in office. Both things cannot be true simultaneously.The House impeachment managers made an admirable attempt to use precedent to argue that impeachment and conviction of a former public official were long-accepted practices.The historical record is not on theDemocrats’side, however. Tennessee Senator WilliamBlountwas impeached in 1797. His Senate trial began in December 1798, and the charges against him were dismissed because Blount had already been expelled from Congress. Mark H. Delahay, a federal judge, was impeached in 1873. He resigned before his Senate trial, which was then canceled.George English and Samuel Kent, both federal judges, were impeached in 1926 and 2009, respectively. Both resigned before the completion of their trials, and in both cases the proceedings were brought to a close prior to their conclusions.If a precedent has ever been established, then, it is that the Senate does not pass judgement upon accused government officials who have left office.The entire question of the constitutionality of putting a now-private citizen on trial is largely moot in the face of the facts. The real question is whether Trump committed the crime of which he is accused, namely, incitement of insurrection. The facts do not favor the accusation. Investigations into the events of Jan. 6 have uncovered a degree of pre-planning, which obviously negates the premise that Trump stirred the crowd to violent action with his speech.Then there is the inconvenient timeline. Activists were already at the Capitol, tearing down barriers and moving to breach the building itself while the former president was still addressing his supporters some considerable distance away.Finally, there is the even more inconvenient fact that left-wing activists, such as John Sullivan, who now faces several federal charges in connection with his involvement in the invasion of the Capitol building, are known to have been key instigators during the attack. No senator – or member of the public, for that matter – could possibly believe that these leftists were incited by Trump’s words.For the 45th president, attorney Bruce Castor opened the defense’s case for canceling the trial. In a rambling, folksy speech that sounded more like an old man regaling his grandchildren with stories of his misspent youth, Castor waffled on about what great patriots senators are. It became clear that the attorney was attempting to appeal to the better natures of the elected women and men in the chamber, but his remarks did nothing to advance Trump’s case. It was almost a standup routine, minus the humor.Castor’s colleague, David Schoen, recovered the fumble and headed for the end zone with a long presentation that meticulously dissected the argument that the Senate has the power to try a private citizen. Citing judges, acclaimed legal scholars, and state-level cases, Shoen asserted that, since the mandatory punishment for conviction in the Senate is removal from office, putting on trial an individual who cannot be removed from an office he or she no longer holds is entirely invalid.Schoen dwelt at length on the lack ofdue processafforded Trump throughout the impeachment. He described how House Democrats expedited the operation from the start, eliminating the steps that would have allowed the former president his constitutional right to hear the evidence against him and to test that evidence through his defense team.Equally concerning, the lawyer explained, is the fact that, due to a deliberate delay on the part of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) in transmitting the article of impeachment to the Senate, Trump – now no longer the sitting president – was denied his right to have the chief justice of the Supreme Court preside over his trial. Instead, Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT), as the president pro tempore of the Senate, will preside.Leahy has always been a vocal critic of Trump who has made clear in public statements that he feels the Senate should convict. In addition, Leahy himself gets to vote alongside his fellow senators, making him, literally, both judge and jury.Shoen pointed out that expanding the instrument of impeachment to include all former public officials regardless of how long ago they served in government could have a chilling effect. Someone serving in government today, the attorney explained, could find himself or herself impeached years in the future by a new Congress that decides some action taken by that official years earlier was somehow impeachable. As an example, Schoen suggested that Jimmy Carter could be impeached for his disastrous handling of the 1979 Iran hostage crisis.Now that what was largely seen as a formality is over, the trial begins in earnest on Wednesday, Feb. 10. All that really remains to be seen now is whether the six Republican senators who voted to proceed will also vote to convict Trump, who will almost certainly not be convicted and not removed from the office he no longer holds.~Graham J. Noble."
5265,Senate Democrats Plan Venting Session Over SCOTUS Abortion Cases,9.33,33.67,https://www.libertynation.com/senate-democrats-plan-venting-session-over-scotus-abortion-cases/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-09-04,www.libertynation.com,18,"U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) announced Friday that the Senate Judiciary Committee would hold a hearing examining theSupremeCourt. Durbin’s office said it would focus on the “abuse of its ‘shadow-docket,’ particularly its order permitting Texas’s extreme new abortion restrictions to take effect this week.”The Supreme Court let stand a new Texas abortion law when it rejected an application for an injunction to prevent the law’s enforcement. Unusually, the high court announced itsdecisionin an unsigned opinion released just before midnight on Wednesday, September 1. The law permits abortions when no fetal cardiac activity is detected. It amounts to an effective ban on abortion after the sixth week of pregnancy, which is when the heartbeat is usually first detected. Because women don’t often know they are pregnant until that time, most abortions performed before the law’s enactment would now be prohibited.Durbin said:“This anti-choice law is a devastating blow to Americans’ constitutional rights—and the Court allowed it to see the light of day without public deliberation or transparency.  At a time when public confidence in government institutions has greatly eroded, we must examine not just the constitutional impact of allowing the Texas law to take effect, but also the conservative Court’s abuse of the shadow docket.”Justices John Roberts, Stephen Breyer, Elena Kagan, and Sonia Sotomayor all dissented from the Court’s ruling on the application, and each wrote separately. There was a range of reactions, from Chief Justice Roberts, whose response was measured and circumspect, to Associate Justice Sotomayor, who called the Texas law “flagrantlyunconstitutional” and said her colleagues on the Court “have opted to bury their heads in the sand.” Justice Kagan spent her dissent criticizing what is known as the Court’s “shadow docket” and how the Court has increasingly issued consequential rulings from it.(Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)The term “shadow docket” was firstcoinedin a 2015 law review article. It’s used to describe Supreme Court case rulings that don’t arise on the standard trial docket. These shadow docket cases lack standard features of a regular case, including procedural and substantive shortcomings. Cases on the shadow docket are decided on an application for emergency relief from a lower court, which hasn’t yet decided the case on the merits. Gone are lengthy times for briefing issues, as well as oral arguments to present their best versions and expose contradictions. Finally, Justices don’t take as much time deliberating and writing, so these decisions are rarely explained.The Texas law was constructed to avoid judicial review and has so far succeeded.  A novel feature of the law is that no state official, such as the attorney general or prosecutor, has the authority to enforce it. Any person has standing in Texas courts to commence a civil prosecution of an abortion provider under the terms of the law. It was the complicating factors of this provision that stopped the Supreme Court from issuing an injunction. The majority opinion said:“The applicants now before us have raised serious questions regarding the constitutionality of the Texas law at issue. But their application also presents complex and novel antecedent procedural questions on which they have not carried their burden.”Senator Durbin gave no indication what actions the U.S. Senate might take in response to the Supreme Court ruling in a manner that displeases him.~Scott D. Cosenza."

First, there was theannouncementthat spectators would not be allowed and the recommendation that bars and restaurants close. Then, one day before the event started, the Olympics Opening Ceremony Director Kentaro Kobayashi was fired for a Holocaust joke he made during a comedy show way back in 1998. The comedy act, called, “Let’s play Holocaust,” drew outrage. Rabbi Abraham Cooper, the associate dean and global social action director for the Simon Wiesenthal Center, said in a statement:“Any person, no matter how creative, does not have the right to mock the victims of the Nazi genocide. The Nazi regime also gassed Germans with disabilities. Any association of this person to the Tokyo Olympics would insult the memory of six million Jews and make a cruel mockery of the Paralympics.”The rocky start to the Olympics continued as a Korean broadcast network ended up apologizing for its “totally inappropriate” graphics during the opening ceremony. Intending to make it easier for viewers to determine which countries athletes were from, MBC used images to represent each nation. Some choices, however, were unfortunate, to put it lightly. An image of Chernobyl represented Ukraine, and the Haitian athletes were accompanied by the caption “The political situation is fogged by the assassination of the president.” Italy was represented by pizza, and El Salvador was introduced with a picture of Bitcoin.And the hits kept on coming. Two members of BBC’s Olympic commentary team, Ed Leigh and Marc Churchill, were criticized for refusing to call anon-binaryathlete by their preferred pronouns. Team USA skater Alana Smith, 20, was knocked out of the Women’s Street Skateboarding semi-finals after failing to score three tricks at Ariake Urban Sports Park in Tokyo. On the skateboard, Smith had “they/them” written twice; also wearing a “pronoun pin.” Still, the commenters continued to refer to the athlete as “she” and “her.” BBC said it was an honest mistake and that things happen during live broadcasts while other announcers sided with the commentators, saying they didn’t notice the gender writing on the board either.Simone Biles(Photo by Mike Egerton/PA Images via Getty Images)Perhaps the biggest news to come out of the Olympics so far is the developing story of the gymnast who decided to drop out of competition due to mental health concerns. Simone Biles is consideredstar in the world of gymnastics. The 24-year-old has been hailed as “The Greatest of All Time” in her sport, but the athlete decided the pressure was too much and withdrew from the competition, setting the stage for Team Russia to win the gold medal for the first time in nearly 30 years. “We also have to focus on ourselves, because at the end of the day we’re human, too,” Biles said. “So, we have to protect our mind and our body, rather than just go out there and do what the world wants us to do.”While many were supportive of her decision, lauding her for the courage to publicly display her mental health issues, others were not so compassionate. On Monday, July 26, the athlete posted on social media that she felt the weight of the world on her shoulders. This was after she had a less-than-perfect qualifying that gave the Russians a better shot at the medal. When it came time for her vault performance, Biles didn’t do the intended routine, further damaging the Team USA’s score. She finished the routine, hugged her teammates, and then withdrew from the competition. Critics were appalled that someone would drop out of the Olympic Games because they couldn’t handle the pressure.“And you know, there’s more to life than just gymnastics,” she said.Biles was scheduled to defend her title in the all-around final on July 28, but she withdrew from that as well. She is still qualified for four other events later on, but has yet to say if she will compete.Sometimes, HollyWeird players make headlines for silly or bizarre happenings, so here is a collection of newsworthy doings — honorable and dishonorable — by the tenants of Tinseltown.Britney Spearshas gained a lot of attention recently for the fight against her father’s conservatorship. The pop star testified that she wanted to get the IUD birth control device removed because she wanted to get married and have children. Representative Nancy Mace (R-SC) took issue with that problem, telling the:“One of the other things that upset me about it was the IUD issue. Being forced to be put on birth control – an IUD that’s so invasive, inside your body, preventing you from having kids – that’s something that communist China does, not something the United States of America does. It’s truly a nightmare. If it can happen to her, it can happen to anyone.”Mace is co-sponsor on Rep. Charlie Crist’s (D-FL) bill to allocate $250 million to provide caseworkers for those abused by conservatorship situations. If passed, Mace said it would allow Spears and others “to petition a judge or a court to request for a public guardian. Someone, perhaps, who doesn’t have any conflict of interest, financial or otherwise in this case.”The Jan. 6 House Select Committee held its firstmeetingon July 27. Most of it was emotional testimony, especially by police officers. Fox News’ Laura Ingraham decided to give out mock “best performance” awards during, suggesting those testifying were being overly dramatic. She said Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn gave the “best political performance” while Officer Michael Fanone gave the “best action performance.” She did not receive the best feedback, however, even from Republicans.Rep. Joe Walsh (R-IL) wrote on Twitter:“We’ve always had a choice: We can attack those who attacked our democracy that day, or we can attack those who defended our democracy that day.

Talk show hostess veteran Oprah Winfrey asked Meghan what she expected when she decided to marry royalty. “I can say I went into it naively,” the former actress stated, adding she never did any research on her husband-to-be or her in-laws. “There was no way to understand what the day-to-day was going to be like.”The duchess painted a picture of marked differences in the way she was treated compared to her sister-in-law Kate Middleton before marrying her prince. The “turning point” Meghan said, which allegedly opened her eyes to how differently she was going to be treated – by both the family and the media – was when the tabloids blasted a story saying she had made Kate cry because of issues with the flower girls’ dresses a few days before her official wedding to Prince Harry (the couple actually had a private ceremony three days before the royal affair). Instead, the opposite was true the duchess of Sussex claimed, telling Oprah that Kate had madecry, but then later brought her flowers and apologized for it. However, that “was the beginning of a character assassination,” Meghan said, referring to the media.Cut to images of newspaper headlines flashed across the screen. Kate, the duchess of Cambridge, was seen holding her baby bump, which the press praised, but the other duchess did not receive such warmth. One headline read, “Why can’t Meghan keep her hands off her baby bump” while asking if it was pride or vanity that had her touching her belly.Oprah asked the duchess “Were you silent or silenced?” to which Meghan responded, “The latter.” She talked about giving up everything to be with Harry, including her independence. “That was really hard to reconcile because it was only once we were married and everything got worse,” she claimed. But she said she had not expected the life of royalty to be so restricted and said the public would understand it because they have been experiencing something similar due to the pandemic lockdown.The media, however, was a challenge, Meghan said, especially because the family and the royal institution would not protect them. “They were willing to lie to protect other members of the family, but they were not willing to tell the truth to protect me and my husband,” the duchess complained. The situation became so severe that Meghan contemplated suicide, saying her life was “almost unsurvivable” and “I just didn’t want to be alive anymore.” The institution denied her request for mental health assistance and Prince Harry admitted he was too ashamed to go to his family with Meghan’s condition.Meghan, who is of mixed race, said when she became pregnant questions arose about the child and what color skin it might have. The duchess admitted she never really heard the conversation directly, that it was only relayed to her through Harry. When questioned about such talk by Oprah, the prince answered, “That conversation, I’m never going to share.”It was apparent that racism was a factor, Meghan claimed, since for whatever reason it was decided that the baby, Archie, would not carry the title of prince and he was not to receive security like the other royals. “The idea of the first member of color in this family not being titled” in the same way was shocking and hurtful, she said.*Lack of protection from the media and the treatment of Archie led the royal couple to make the decision to step back from family duties. Both claim they did not intend to leave the family all together, but that they needed to, as Harry said, “Take a breath from constant barrage” because the prince feared that history was repeating itself, referring to his mother Princess Diana and her tragic death. “I think she [Diana] would feel very angry with how this has panned out,” Harry said.Once leaving the United Kingdom, Harry said the family cut them off from security details while the whole world knew where they were living. Without the money Diana left for him, the prince said he would not have been able to survive financially and that agreeing to interviews and television was only to provide security for his family. “Netflix and Spotify, that was never part of the plan,” he claimed.Leaving royal duties behind was liberating for the prince who stated, “I myself was trapped as well.” He added, “I was trapped, and I didn’t know I was trapped. Trapped within the system, like the rest of my family are.”The duke and duchess claim to have a great relationship with the queen, but that the relationship between Harry and his brother, Prince William, needed “space,” while it was a work in progress with his father, Prince Charles.When asked if they were concerned about repercussions from the family over the interview, Meghan replied: “I don’t know how they could expect that after all this time we would still be silent.” As for any regrets, the duchess only had one: “My regret is believing them when they said we’d be protected.”~"
5268,Senate Approves COVID-19 Relief Bill – One Republican Misses Vote,7.67,45.67,https://www.libertynation.com/senate-approves-covid-19-relief-bill-one-republican-misses-vote/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-06,www.libertynation.com,18,"After a marathon debate and vote-a-rama, which included a historic 11 hour and 50-minute vote on a minimum wage amendment, the upper chamber on March 6 voted to pass a $1.9 trillion dollar COVID-19 relief bill. Because one GOP senator, Dan Sullivan, had to return to Alaska to attend a family funeral, the bill was passed by a 50-49 margin. Sullivan’s absence, though, merely hastened the inevitable outcome: had he not been called home, Kamala Harris would have cast a deciding vote, assuring the bill’s passage.The negotiations, objections, and compromises – such as they were – are now history, for better or worse. The bill will be returned to the House of Representatives for final approval before heading to the Oval Office. For Democrats, the main obstacle turned out to be an objection from one of their own; Sen. Joe Manchin (D-WV).With the Senate evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, every vote counts for both sides. Just one member crossing the aisle in either direction determines the fate of any bill. Thus, a moderate Democrat like Manchin suddenly finds himself wielding enormous influence, even as he is seen increasingly as a relic in a party that moves ever further left.The minimum wage amendment, proposed by Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and fought for tooth and nail by the Democratic Party’s progressive wing, was shot down Friday when seven Democrats and one Independent senator voted with Republicans to uphold a procedural objection to the measure.Manchin indicated his willingness to support a Republican amendment that would have reduced the amount paid in supplemental unemployment benefits from $400 to $300. A compromise was finally reached after the intervention of Joe Biden himself and the Senate voted on the relief package shortly after noon on March 6.Before the vote, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) said: “The Senate has never spent $2 trillion in a more haphazard way or through a less rigorous process.”"
5269,Federalizing Elections: 2020 on Steroids?,26.67,26.33,https://www.libertynation.com/federalizing-elections-2020-on-steroids/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-08,www.libertynation.com,18,"With the latest entry in his record-shattering succession of executive orders, Joe Biden has attempted to federalize elections, facilitating the permanent implementation of the type of changes to election law that are widely believed to have produced his own victory in the 2020 presidential election. And to affirm his position further, he came out in support of abillthat has passed the House,expandingvoter registration even further than in 2020, when it was reported that an almost inconceivable total of 159 million votes were cast.This full-court press designed to have our betters in Washington overrule the states’ constitutional prerogative to decide election law for themselves leads us to a serious question: to what degree does our constitutional republic remain intact? Have we crossed some sort of rubicon? For many, the takedown ofDonald Trumpis living proof we have inched ever closer to that territory which is neither democracy nor tyranny, but a gray area somewhere in between. And the worst part is that such middle ground actually draws upon the worst elements of both systems.It’s called oligarchy, and if you’re not familiar with the term, now would be a good time to get up to speed. This form of governance dates back more than 2,500 years to the Greekcity-statesofSpartaandAthens, ruled by an elite group of educated aristocrats. It means that control of a country, organization, or institution rests in the hands of a small group of people.It is governance by the few, but it is the type of elite conduct which can touch – and ultimately control – any form of government, from democracies to dictatorships. The privileged class is generally known for characteristics such as wealth, family, nobility, corporate interests, religion, politics, or military power.No country has ever declared itself an oligarchy, for many reasons. First, it is essentially a term of art, not an invented form of governance. Second, much like the term dictatorship, it is a pejorative, one which the oligarchs themselves would fervently deny.They generally distinguish themselves from tyrants by citing free elections and free enterprise. But elections in oligarchies are never actually free because competing candidates are subject to unrelenting vilification by state-controlled media and even political persecution at the whim of – you guessed it – the oligarchs. And enterprise is only free for the chosen – and tightly connected – beneficiaries of government largesse.Iran, Saudi Arabia, andChinaare widely viewed as oligarchies. But Exhibit A would be Russia and Vladimir Putin, who has accentuated his country’s centuries-long oligarchical heritage by jailing his political enemy, Alexei Navalny, for “disturbing public order” and “leading unsanctioned protests.”But halfway across the world, we have borne witness to a deep state tearing apart, limb from limb, a man who delivered stunning results for the United States before a plague hit the land.What president would not in any other circumstance glide to re-election on the strength of full employment, a booming economy, energy independence, multiple Middle East peace accords, and trade deals, among other things? Well, it would be one who dared take the most aggressive steps ever taken to neutralize the deep state from whence these oligarch wannabes draw their strength.After all, civil servants, the permanent bureaucrats who fill the halls of official Washington, cannot be fired except under extraordinary circumstances. They tend to view every president as a mere transient, someone they will outlive in the Swamp. But in Trump, their outspoken – and often hidden – resolve in protecting their cratering credibility was taken to a whole new level – that of a resistance movement.Consider also the continuing inability of tens of millions of people to make sense of an election that defied logic. It pitted a man who created a movement and stirred legendary enthusiasm in delivering everything he promised and more in an audacious reform agenda versus an aging and enfeebled career politician with virtually nothing to show for his almost five decades in the deep state Swamp. Anyone dropped in from Mars, examining, would conclude that the outcome should be obvious.So, absent the unceasing depiction of Donald Trump as Hitler redux, an evil and irredeemable white supremacist – by a media transparently doing the bidding of the Trump-deranged self-appointed oligarchs – would we have gotten the result the martian would fully expect? Instead, a small group of inside-the-beltway power brokers, joining forces with an activist media and an increasingly oligarchical big tech and corporate empire, succeeded in slaying the dragon that threatened them and placed a compliant yes-man in the Oval Office.One of the popular theorems about oligarchy among scholars is the so-called “iron law of oligarchy,” which asserts that all political systems – from democracy to despotism – eventually evolve into oligarchies. With the events we have witnessed over these last four years, it certainly begs the question of whether America has indeed crossed that rubicon.~."
5270,Biden’s Immigration Reform: Are Open Borders on the Way?,12.67,39.0,https://www.libertynation.com/bidens-immigration-reform-are-open-borders-on-the-way/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-03,www.libertynation.com,18,"Joe Biden promised to spend at least the beginning of his presidency erasing all of Donald Trump’s work onimmigrationand border security. So far, he has kept that promise – and more. The new president signed three executive orders Feb. 2 that roll back Trump-era rules – bringing his total to nine immigration-related executive actions in just two weeks – but they don’t stop there. A thorough reading of these orders cuts through the anti-Trump rhetoric and raises the question: Are open borders on the way?Oneexecutive orderestablishes the Interagency Task Force on the Reunification of Families.The task force will be responsible for finding all the “children who were separated from their families at the United States-Mexico border between January 20, 2017, and January 20, 2021, in connection with the operation of the Zero-Tolerance Policy.” Not mentioned in the order are any children separated from their families under the Obama administration or the fact that President Trump ended the Zero-Tolerance Policy by executive order just a couple of months after it began. Not surprising, as Biden has long claimed – incorrectly – that the Obama administration did not separate families at the border.So, what does reunification look like under the task force? Assuming the actual parents or guardians of these children can be located, visas or other immigration benefits will be issued to allow the families to reunitethe United States and remain in the country afterward.It’s unclear how the actual parents or guardians will be located. Simply returning minors to the adults they arrived with could mean returning children to the adults who love and care for them – or it could mean handing them back to thechild smugglerswho took them from their homes in hopes of clearing the border by fraud.Anotherorderfocuses on overhauling the asylum process. Biden wants a review of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), also known as the Remain in Mexico Policy, which pushed 65,000 asylum seekers back into Mexico pending the results of their hearings. The order ends agreements with the governments of Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras to make way for a new plan.The obvious next step is for the MPP to be rescinded, allowing those seeking asylum to await their results in the United States. But there’s more. The president also wants to “address the root causes of migration” and devise a strategy to “coordinate place-based efforts in El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.” The list of goals laid out in the order is extensive:These are all noble goals for any country – but exactly how the United States is expected to achieve themis unclear. Presumably, there will be many billions of tax dollars spent. The question is whether that money will be used as intended. It stands to reason that if there is extensive corruption to fight, themoneyis at risk unless there is some force present to guarantee things are done properly – and that opens a whole different can of worms.The thirdexecutive ordertakes aim at the public charge rule, which limited green cards for immigrants who didn’t seem able to support themselves in the United States without welfare.The attorney general and the secretaries of state and homeland security are instructed to review all their departments’ policies that might impede the legal immigration process and make a plan to alter or rescind them as needed and report back to the president. They also have 60 days to develop a plan to overhaul the naturalization process. Explicitly mentioned as items to be reviewed – and therefore potentially nixed – are the N-400 application, fingerprinting, background and security checks, interviews, civics and English language tests, and the oath of allegiance.So far, the new president has a good start on erasing everything done by his predecessor – but the goal won’t be achieved overnight. The Biden administration warns that it could take months to complete the process, and that immigrant and immigration activists should be patient. Also in play is a comprehensive immigration reform bill, which was delivered to Congress on Biden’s first day in office. If passed, it would immediately give legal status to the estimated 11 million in the country who don’t have it and replace the word “alien” with “noncitizen” in all the immigration laws. Just like the goal of erasing Trump, theglobalist dreamof open borders won’t happen overnight – but it’s a lot closer.~James Fite."
5271,Media Disappointed as Fauci Paints a Modest Image of Trump,18.67,29.0,https://www.libertynation.com/media-disappointed-as-fauci-paints-a-modest-image-of-trump/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-31,www.libertynation.com,18,"In a recent interview with, Dr. Anthony Fauci sat down once more with the media to give one of his first major interviews since Donald Trump’s departure from the White House. The intent behind this sudden interview was clear; the media giant wanted to get the inside scoop from Dr. Fauci himself on the Trump administration’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic without the supposed political pressure they claimed the former president had placed on him.Fauci himself is not safe fromcontroversy. Both the left and right, at different points, have questioned his back-and-forth opinions throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite this, Fauci has been treated like a celebrity for his outspoken and prominent advice that often seemed at odds with Trump’s rhetoric. Since Trump’s departure, the media appeared to be eagerly waiting for the first interview with Fauci, expecting a bombshell condemnation of Trump’s response to the pandemic. Reality proved just the opposite.Fauci’s interview with thecertainly proved interesting and informative on his role in the Trump administration. Unfortunately for liberals throughout the country, their hopes for an attack on Trump’s COVID-19 record did not come to fruition.The infectious disease expert summed up the perceived differences between himself and Trump as a case of simple miscommunication. Throughout the interview, Fauci repeatedly mentioned Trump’s intention to put a positive spin on almost all the information from his advisors. Interestingly, Fauci seemed to blame Trump’s circle of advisors that appeared to resent the more negative but realistic outlook on the COVID-19 pandemic he and White House coronavirus response coordinator Deborah Brix usually shared.Fauci ultimately seemed to blame the overly optimistic views of then-President Trump on his coronavirus task force members. Throughout the interview, Fauci repeatedly stated that Trump appeared to take his advice to heart when speaking with him one-on-one, but that the then-president’s statements would usually completely turn around upon speaking with other advisors. To be clear, Fauci’s words should not be taken as gospel. Since the beginning of the pandemic, hisdefeatistattitude has dominated the media cycle. Despite this fact, his answers gave credit to Dr. Birx’s recent statements to the media that the president was receiving competing data from sources outside of herself and Dr. Fauci, leading to a façade of conflict within the task force adopted by the media.Infamous clips showing Dr. Fauci disagreeing with statements the president had just made were summed up as Fauci’s way of presenting the facts in a manner that was not meant to be confrontational to the president but to provide his own views on the pandemic. By the end of the interview, Fauci had discredited countless media reports about his friction with Trump. He continued to insist that the president merely “expressed disappointment” with Fauci’s opinions and statements. Fauci even praised Trump’s lack of personal confrontation with him, debunked media reports encouraged by the interviewer, and refused to answer a leading question about Donald Trump’s responsibility for the loss of life in the pandemic.The Fauci bombshell interview was anything but damning, providing no political ammunition for the liberals who have treated Dr. Fauci as the second coming of Christ in their crusade against Trump. To his credit, Fauci refrained from making the interview political or espousing anti-Trump rhetoric after the president’s departure, as some of the 45th president’s allies and staff have done.Even now, Dr. Fauci has come outstronglyagainst liberal advocates refusing to admit that schools should reopen, possibly further souring his reputation with an anti-Trump coalition opposed to a gradual return to normal life. The Biden administration is currently split on deciding whether to advocate a return to in-person schooling or not. Dr. Fauci will quickly prove to be a more positive voice for returning to education that the progressive left has been firmly against for months. After all this time, Dr. Fauci’s relationship with Donald Trump has been uncovered, and bereft of the drama the left so desperately desired as another potential slurring of the former president’s legacy.Jose Backer"
5272,Are Baby Boomers and Millennials Ruining America? Part One,14.67,31.33,https://www.libertynation.com/are-baby-boomers-and-millennials-ruining-america-part-one/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-08,www.libertynation.com,18,"In the years directly following World War II,Americaturned a war-torn page and began a new chapter in the continuously unfurling story of our nation. The famous image of a sailor kissing a nurse in Times Square as war’s end was announced heralded a new era of optimism in the American experience. “Forget your troubles, c’mon, get happy!” is how a beloved song from those years memorably framed it.But the West had narrowly dodged an existential bullet. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill had tried in vain for more than two years to coax President Franklin Roosevelt to join the Allies as the “gathering storm” of Adolf Hitler’s Third Reich gave way to a fascistic deluge that threatened to douse the Free World. Though sympathetic to the plight of Europe, Roosevelt nimbly danced around Churchill’s entreaties, offering old ships on lend-lease here, some encouraging words there – but never committing a nation fortuitously bordered by oceans on two sides to the good fight.However, when America was attacked by the Japanese at Pearl Harbor, the resolve to confront abject evil suddenly gained urgency and moral dimension. After patiently paving the way for the possibility the mighty United States might enter the fray, Churchill finally got his wish. As the smoke hung heavy in the Hawaiian air from the most brazen attack in our history, the United States declared war on the Axis Powers, and, after four years of the world’s bloodiest conflict, the Allies prevailed.The collective sigh of relief across the Western world was audible, and the jubilation lit up America from sea to shining sea. The Greatest Generation had ultimately secured the very “peace in our time” that Churchill’s feckless predecessor, the appeasing Neville Chamberlain, believed he had secured from a mere handshake with Adolf Hitler. Lesson learned: Freedom must be fought for – not agreed to over tea and strudel.An extended period of prosperity followed in America as the austerity of the war years and the dread echoes of the Great Depression faded from the cultural horizon. Optimism was reignited, giving rise to a rebirth of American ingenuity. By mid-century, things for the good life were built, branded, and sold by the millions — houses and cars and appliances.And as the middle class defined the American Dream — and vice versa — those sunny smiles and beliefs in God, country, and capitalism meant a renewed focus on family. The excesses of the time were mirrored in the giant tail fins of the cars sold in record numbers – and reflected, too, in the burgeoning size of American families. Freed from the anxieties and privations of the war years, Americans were having a lot of sex, and a tidal wave of children followed.The Baby Boom usually includes anyone born between 1946 to 1964. A staggering 79 million babies were born in the United States during that interval, and that generation went on to change America and the world forever.As they came of age, the Boomers broke new ground culturally. They sent seismic shocks across the planet with the music of the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who, the Doors, Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, and many others. They challenged the established sexual mores of the ’50s, took advantage of the liberating new invention known as the pill, and engaged in “free love” as a path to cultural revolution.The Boomers experimented with drugs and altering consciousness. The women’s rights movement came of age. The Boomers fought for civil rights and against the Vietnam War. These strains of counter-culture rebellion were knit together in the Dionysian excesses of the Woodstock festival, the last gasp of the hopeful ’60s before the dark clouds of Vietnam and the assassinations ofMartin Luther KingJr. and RFK rolled in.Boomers expanded on the free love of the ’60s in the decadence of the ’70s. Their cynicism toward the establishment deepened, exacerbated by the corruption of the Watergate scandal. And in the ‘80s, when the massive Boomer generation collided with the workforce, the results were seen in the impressive economic gains of the Ronald Reagan years as well as the widespread abuse of drugs like cocaine.But the dream of the ’60s had some unforeseen and unfortunate side effects: divorce, abortion, and drug addiction saw exponential increases, religion ceased to be a touchstone for faith in American families, and the gap between the middle class and the powerful and wealthy widened. Into this sobering American landscape, another cultural boom detonated: the largest generation in American history — the Baby Boomers – were having their own children.They would come to be known as the Millennials.The Millennials, named for the turn of the new century during which they came of age, include those born between 1981 and 1998. They are characterized as being far less willing to get married early and comfortable with such technologies as computers and the internet. They have been beset by the rising costs of higher education and housing and seek to become parents themselves during a time of dramatically lowered fertility rates. It hasn’t been easy for them.But as the children of the Baby Boomers, the Millennials were adversely impacted by a phenomenon known as the Self-Esteem Movement. Possibly reacting to the sometimes stern “spare the rod” parenting of their Greatest Generation mothers and fathers, Boomer parents often cosseted their children, bolstering their self-worth with continuous empty praise.They obsessively leveled every bump in their children’s way, as if smoothing the ice as sweepers do for the granite stone in the Olympic sport of curling. Such “parental curling” — also known as “snowplowing” — was an extension of “helicopter parenting.” It made for a generation of kids who got used to their parents as ‘fixers” and whose ability to problem-solve independently in the real world was stunted. And this unwelcome cultural development caused a sea change in education.NEXT: The last of a two-part article examines the intertwined cultural imperatives of the Baby Boomer and Millennial generations that pervade our society, affecting everything from the response to the Coronavirus to the gutting of the First Amendment.(Note: The author is complicit in his thesis as a Boomer on paper – but identifies Gen-X.)~"
5273,What Oprah Forgot to Mention about the Marvelous Miss Markle,12.67,29.0,https://www.libertynation.com/what-oprah-forgot-to-mention-about-the-marvelous-miss-markle/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-03-08,www.libertynation.com,18,"In Oprah Winfrey’s tell-almost-all interview with Prince Harry and theDuchess of Sussex, Meghan, one point seems to have grabbed the attention of the American media: Their firstborn child, Archie, has been denied a title and security because of his race. With racial issues being the go-to lead for most members of the Fourth Estate, it is perhaps unsurprising that this idea has gone unchallenged.But is the royal family engaging in racism? Or has the duchess fundamentally misunderstood the roles, rights, and responsibilities of royalty?During the interview, the duchess told Winfrey that, while she was pregnant, conversations took place that involved Archie not receiving a title or security, in tandem with questions over what color his skin might be. Winfrey’s shocked reaction was shared by many people who do not understand the rules of royal titles.Who gets a title and who doesn’t ultimately comes down to the monarch of the day, but it is not as simple as deciding who is and is not in favor. The present governing rules were first laid down by King George V in 1917.In the Letter Patent, King George wrote:“[T]he children of any Sovereign of these Realms and the children of the sons of any such Sovereign (as per the Letters Patent of 1864) and the eldest living son of the eldest son of the Prince of Wales (a modification of the Letters Patent of 1898) shall have and at all times hold and enjoy the style, title or attribute of Royal Highness with their titular dignity of Prince or Princess prefixed to their respective Christian names or with their other titles of honour.”These rules made clear that the title of Prince would extend to only the grandchildren of the reigning monarch. At the time, it was considered highly unlikely that kings or queens would live to see their great-grandchildren, and, as such, the stated rules tidied up the details of the regulation. However, the British royal family is, despite what TV would have us believe, an institution that changes with the times.In 2012, Queen Elizabeth II, realizing that people naturally live longer, amended the 1917 Letters Patent to grant title to the children of the Prince of Wales’ eldest children: namely Prince William’s children. It did not extend to the offspring of the second-born child.For the duchess to suggest that Archie would not receive the title of “prince” because of his skin color, or for any reason other than the rules set in place before she ever met Harry, is disingenuous at best; at worst, it is feigning ignorance of well-established rules to paint the reigning monarch as a racist.As to whether Archie would be denied security because of his racial mix, we again find that this is a misleading concept.The royal family is taxpayer funded through something called the Sovereign Fund Grant, which pays the family 25% of the income from lands within the Crown Estates. The queen and extended members of the family also receive incomes from various estate trusts. However, the Sovereign Fund does not provide for security or royal ceremonies; these are often paid out by the queen from the Privy Purse, the queen’s personal income derived from her land and asset portfolio.The reality is that if the couple were to have their main residence in the United Kingdom, all security would be paid.The fact of the matter is that the British royal line has managed to continue for so long because the systems in place guarantee its longevity. The duchess may be upset that her child is not referred to as a prince, but if she truly understood how the whole thing worked, she would know that when the queen eventually passes, her child will become the grandson of the monarch. As such, under the Letter Patent of 1917, he will officially be Prince Archie.But Prince Harry does, or should, already know this. So what is the problem?Is it perhaps that DuchessMeghanwants not just her child to be a Royal Highness but also that of her line going forward? It seems that this whole storm in a Royal English teacup is not about race and more about perceived entitlement. All want the best for their children, but that was not the deal she signed up for in marrying into the family. And those in the media who insist on flattering her ego and ignoring her mistakes are not doing her or her family any favors.~Mark Angelides.[mepr-hide rule=”560663″][/mepr-hide]"

5275,Changing America One Word at a Time,25.33,22.0,https://www.libertynation.com/changing-america-one-word-at-a-time/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-10,www.libertynation.com,18,"TheBiden administrationhas embarked on an all-encompassing drive to banish any wording that may reflect negatively on illegal aliens from official U.S. government use. A much larger agenda appears to be at work here, and the “no human being is illegal” party line that Joe Biden is embedding into federal agencies works to further it.U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has ordered its officers to stop issuing a Notice to Appear (NTA) toillegal aliensfacing deportation informing them that they must show up for a scheduled court date because it may cause “undue stress,” Paul Bedard at thereported Feb. 7. Illegals are described as “customers” in the email outlining the new directive.“This guidance will ensure the agency is not placing undue stress on the customer who believes he/she may or may not receive an NTA based on the information provided in their denial notification,” the email reportedly reads.This comes on the heels of an administration effort to remove the terms “alien” or “illegal alien” from immigration laws via a proposed U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 sent to Congress. “The language change on the first day of this administration, with [Vice President] Kamala Harris the daughter of immigrants, to me it’s not just symbolic … it’s foundational,” Jose Antonio Vargas, an illegal alien who runs an organization called Define American, told CNN.The movement to “fundamentally transform” America is back in business now that Barack Obama’s former sidekick has made his way into the Oval Office. Behind all the Soviet-style dialectics control, there lies a grand pivot away from a U.S. government that places American citizens’ interests first to one pledging to serve an ill-defined global citizenry.While Obama fervently wished to be the first out-and-out internationalist president of the United States, his timing was a tad off. The globalist power forces had not yet fully fallen into place on the political chessboard. But as the coronavirus crisis and its formidable array of draconian social curbs on formerly free citizens and the establishment of a multi-level campaign to control the 2020 presidential election have since made clear, the moment has come forBidento claim Obama’s cherished mantle.The language being utilized to define the immigration debate reveals the full scope of this effort to transcend the confines of the American nation-state and erect a globalist American governing entity. Not merely as vision or theory, but as practicing reality.A Fact Sheet on Immigration Reform released by the Biden administration on Feb. 2, displays more slanted wording. The offense of crossing America’s sovereign southern border is not referred to as illegal entry but “irregular migration.” This change is enormous. Rather than protecting American citizens from unknown foreigners stealing into their nation, this language completely turns the tables and puts the onus on Americans to care for those brazenly disregarding their natural rights as citizens. Indeed, it compels them to bear the burdens of the entire world:“First, the Administration will address the underlying causes of migration through a strategy to confront the instability, violence, and economic insecurity that currently drives migrants from their homes. Second, the Administration will collaborate with regional partners, including foreign governments, international organizations, and nonprofits to shore up other countries’ capacity to provide protection and opportunities to asylum seekers and migrants closer to home. Finally, the Administration will ensure that Central American refugees and asylum seekers have access to legal avenues to the United States.”There you have it. With two simple words, Biden entangles the United States in troubling internationalist webs and paves the way for endless interventionism – military and otherwise – under the guise of stopping the factors that “drive migrants from their homes.”Language has been employed as a political weapon. Choose the wording and win the argument. All those who took pride in what was once known as the unique spirit of American exceptionalism will likely be outraged at the notion of illegal aliens being re-labeled “customers.” Is this nation nothing more than a shopping mall open to all comers, or does citizenship hold any value at all?Joe Schaeffer."
5276,Reading the Tea Leaves on the Blurry Biden Doctrine,23.33,24.0,https://www.libertynation.com/reading-the-tea-leaves-on-the-blurry-biden-doctrine/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-10,www.libertynation.com,18,"What is the President Joe Biden Doctrine? In the few weeks since Biden was sworn in to the Oval Office, it remains unclear where he stands on foreign policy other thanMAGA(making America global again). A glance at his record suggests he licked his finger and lifted it in the air to see which way the wind was blowing. His comments, too, spotlight a lifelong politician with four decades of experience who has failed to convey an original thought or hold a defiant position on a subject that has generally been a bipartisan affair of adventurism and interventionism in Washington.Foreign policy did not attract too much attention on the campaign trail, likely because it highlighted the Democrats’alliancewith the bloodthirsty, pro-war neoconservative establishment. Despite being a seasoned political veteran, Biden is an amateur on foreign relations, emphasized by his inability to carve out a vision for relations with China, Iran, and other adversaries of the American empire.Speaking in an interview with NBC News, Secretary of State Antony Blinken warned that the Iranian regime could be “weeks” away from compiling enough fissile material to produce a nuclear weapon. As a result, Biden wants Tehran to return to the 2015 nuclear deal, but the country will come back to the negotiating table only if the U.S. government removes economic sanctions. However, Biden has confirmed that Iran needs to cease enriching uranium before the White House entertains the idea.The administration is ostensibly trying to strike a fine balance between being tough and refraining from scaremongering. While Iran has stated that its nuclear ambitions are for peaceful purposes only, Republican and Democratic administrations have been sounding the alarm for nearly 20 years that a potential apocalypse was nigh.Despite being active in this region of the world since the CIA overthrew democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953, Washington has yet to resolve anything of substance. It has been the same old game of cat-and-mouse. It is unlikely Biden will solve the quagmire.The president has downplayed the rise of China, dating back to the 2020 primaries. He dismissed Trump’s dispute with Beijing, using flippant and vague language to espouse his positions on the world’s second-largest economy. For now, it appears that Biden will maintain his predecessor’s tariffs, noting that China should anticipate “extreme competition” from the United States on the global economic stage.“He’s very bright, he’s very tough. He [President Xi Jinping] doesn’t have a democratic – small ‘d’ – bone in his body,” President Biden told CBS News, adding that the United States will build back better at home to vie for economic supremacy in the international marketplace.Biden has yet to speak with President Xi, but Blinken spoke with his counterpart, Yang Jiechi. The secretary of state warned that the White House would hold China accountable for its actions and demanded that the regime condemn the military takeover in Myanmar. Blinken conceded that the foundation of Trump’s aggression toward China had been correct on principle, but he wishes to adopt a different approach to China.The president’s stance on North Korea is unclear. Many of the Democratic candidates in the 2020 field were perturbed that Trump engaged with enemies, arguing that he should not have communicated with a dictator like Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un. Biden omitted Pyongyang from his prepared remarks in a recent foreign policy speech, choosing to review the matter before committing to anything. Indeed, North Korea has been more complicated, and Kim has shown no desire to curtail the nation’s nuclear arsenal. That said, its neighbor to the south was jubilant over the progress that Trump fostered, helping to open up economic relations between the two nations.Can Biden build on these achievements?He may need to develop a recipe containing the ingredients of diplomacy, sanctions relaxation, and repeated summit meetings. Throughout his rise to despotic authoritarian, Kim has ostensibly taken a liking totwo things– attention and business – and the previous administration exploited them to attain a modicum of success. Has it worked? Seoul appears to be pleased with the results.When Biden was a senator from Delaware, he championed the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq. As these operations metastasized into disastrous never-ending conflicts, he proposed separating Iraq into three countries and maintaining the course in Afghanistan. Despite troop numbers at their lowest levels in the two nations, Trump was unsuccessful in completely winding down these wars. Will Biden be the one to fully end military endeavors in these two nations?The previous administration struck a deal with the Taliban to withdraw all U.S. troops by May 2021. But Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby believes it will be challenging to accomplish, telling ABC News:“The Taliban have not met their commitments. As you know, there is a looming deadline of early May … but without them meeting their commitments to renounce terrorism and to stop the violent attacks on the Afghan National Security Forces and, by dint of that, the Afghan people, it’s very hard to see a specific way forward for the negotiated settlement.”Meanwhile, President Biden has requested the Department of Defense to review Trump’s paring down of U.S. troops in Iraq following a deadly improvised explosive device (IED) attack just south of Baghdad. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin confirmed that the DoD would perform an exhaustive review of “U.S. military footprint, resources, strategy, and missions.” Defense officials have stated that the current administration is likely to suspend personnel withdrawals, adding that the Oval Office has yet to provide a defined position in either conflict.Should voters have anticipated anything different from a career politician? Republicans and Democrats have possessed an adamantine desire to keep America as the policeman of the world. Trump may not have resigned from this title, but at least he attempted to push the nation’s allies to cough up and pay their fair share. Indeed, it is easy to have a generous welfare state if the U.S. military is protecting your borders. That said, the 2020 election may have been one of only a handful of modern electoral contests where the more pro-war candidate enjoyed victory because of Orange Man Bad – or something.Was Biden’s predecessor an anti-war candidateformer Congressman Ron Paul (R) or former Representative Tulsi Gabbard (D)? Hardly, but he didexposethe military-industrial complex and reviled the dream of permanent war among the chief Swamp creatures inside the corridors of power. Biden so far appears to be a  return to the status quo, the days of constantlyseekingdragons to slay to appease special interests and war-starved politicians.~Andrew Moran."
5277,Tech Tyranny: Parler in Peril and Twitter Tests the Truth,18.0,14.67,https://www.libertynation.com/tech-tyranny-parler-in-peril-as-twitter-tests-the-truth/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-04,www.libertynation.com,18,"Social media platform Parler quickly gained symbolic status as a free speech frontier after the Capitol riots as one platform which would not capitulate to the politically correct – but is that all over now?Parlerquickly gained thousands of users in the aftermath of the 2020 election, but the company’s rising star was shot down when Silicon Valley giants Apple, Amazon, and Google accused the platform of fomenting violent discontent that led to the events of Jan. 6. Since the three tech giants pulled their online hosting services, Parler was yanked from the web and has not so far managed to get back online.Expectations were high that Parler would soon resume its services, but it looks like a rift between the owners has brought that – as well as the future of the company – into question.CEO John Matze has reportedly been fired by the company’s board, which he says is controlled by Rebekah Mercer, over competing visions. In a memo to Parler staff, obtained by Fox News, Matze wrote:“Over the past few months, I’ve met constant resistance to my product vision, my strong belief in free speech and my view of how the Parler site should be managed. For example, I advocated for more product stability and what I believe is a more effective approach to content moderation.”It’s unclear at this point what the specifics of Matze’s vision are, but it would appear the dispute is over content moderation policies going forward – providing ideal “product stability” while also maintaining free speech for users.Co-founder Mercer has been described as a Republican megadonor and a Trump supporter of anti-establishment views. The heiress revealed in November 2020 that she had been helping to bankroll the social media platform, making a statement at the time in support of its freedom-oriented stance:“John and I started Parler to provide a neutral platform for free speech, as our founders intended, and also to create a social media environment that would protect data privacy … The ever-increasing tyranny and hubris of our tech overlords demands that someone lead the fight against data mining, and for the protection of free speech online. That someone is Parler, a beacon to all who value their liberty, free speech, and personal privacy.”Does this commitment to free expression signify that there is something else behind the rift between Mercer and Matze – or has one of them changed their approach in light of the business realities of Big Tech control and Parler’s lack of success in circumventing the Silicon Valley pillars to make it back onto the internet?Parler investor and political pundit Dan Bongino waded into the fray with another behind-the-scenes point of view, suggesting that “the story you’re hearing is, unfortunately, not correct.” On a Facebook video, Bongino took the gloves off, asserting that Matze is “not telling the truth.” He stated, “There were two separate visions for the company, and I don’t know what John’s saying in his reports out there, but this free speech vision, that was ours – the other owners in the company.”Bongino continued:“Some terrible decisions were made in the past that led to this, that led us to getting pulled down by Amazon and others. It was us, me and the [two] other owners … that were constantly on the side of ‘this site was going to be a free speech platform or it was going to be nothing’ … After Apple, Amazon and Google wiped us out, we could have been up in a week if we just would’ve bent the knee … We don’t want garbage on our site either and we took the proper steps to do that but we were a free speech site and will remain as such and that’s why it’s taken so long to get back up.”Ultimately, it remains unclear what has been going on behind the closed doors of Parler’s offices. What does this untimely division mean for the future of liberty on social media? Only time will tell.Two progressive icons face trouble in the turbulent skies of Twitter – Greta Thunberg is being accused of conspiracy, while New York’s Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is trying to deploy her fans into curbing an alleged misinformation campaign.Thunberg rapidly and spontaneously rose to become the world’s favorite teen activist, definitely not manipulated by any adults. Accidental Twitter posts show that not all may be as it appears with this lone-wolf influencer, however. Thunberg, weighing in on recent farmers’ protests in India, mistakenly tweeted a document that instructed her on what to say to support the Indian revolt. The script included suggested posts and tags for the eco-warrior, as well as links to other celebrities.The post was quickly deleted from Thunberg’s Twitter account, but the damage was done. Not only did it provide a peek behind the curtain of supposedly grassroots activism, but a politician has called it “evidence of international plans for attacks against India,” and the group is being investigated for criminal conspiracy. Luckily for Greta, it appears she is not being investigated personally.AOCis also weighing in on protests – but closer to home. In fact, if you believe the congresswoman, she was right in the thick of the riots on Jan. 6 and came close to death. Question her claims and her supporters will have your posts removed from social media – or that appears to be what she is hoping for.The representative has been dubbed “Alexandria Ocasio-Smollett” by some who claim her story of events is exaggerated. She has been likened to actor Jussie Smollett, who has been accused of fabricating a violent attack against himself. AOC’s staff was not going to stand for “misinformation” spread to sully her reputation, reportedly writing in an email to supporters, “As we speak, right-wing operatives with millions of followers on social media are spreading flat-out lies and misleading information about Alexandria. But with your help we can force Twitter and Facebook to enforce their own rules.”The message instructs readers to find and report such messages, which are allegedly radicalizing people against AOC. The email was shared on Twitter by Jack Posobiec of the One America News Network, who has outright accused the lawmaker of lying. Posobiec wrote: “To be clear, a US government official is calling for tech companies to censor private citizens for daring to point out when she is not telling the truth.”Is AOC a survivor of trauma? Is Greta Thunberg simply a stage performer following a script? The only obvious truth is that Twitter continues to be used as a tool to control the way people see the world.~"
5278,Don’t Fence Me Out: Barricade Madness Reigns Supreme,23.0,22.67,https://www.libertynation.com/dont-fence-me-out-barricade-madness-reigns-supreme/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-31,www.libertynation.com,18,"A fencing trend appears to be gaining momentum across the nation following the U.S.Capitol protestearlier this month. Only days ago, the Acting Capitol Police Chief called for permanent barriers to be set up at the national Capitol building. However, such moves are not isolated to the Swamp. Go west almost 5,000 miles to the Hawaii State Capitol, and visitors will be treated to a brand spanking new chain link fence surrounding one of the most beautiful sites in the Aloha state.  Could we be witnessing the fencing out of America?Prior to the January 20 inauguration ceremony, theFBIissued a nationwide warning of potential violence to state capital officials. Hawaiian legislators took it to heart, despite no credible threats to the Hawaiian Capitol Complex. Now residents and tourists have the privilege of staring at a big, ugly barrier – and it looks like it is here to stay.In Hawaiian, the word “aloha” can mean hello and good-bye – quite fitting for the new barriers erected in front of the famed statue of Father Damien that stands in the plaza of the Hawaiian capitol building. As one longtime Aloha resident put it, the fencing is “not a pretty sight.” Back in the Swamp, a “non-scalable” fence was added to the White House perimeter just before election day. Lest one think that barriers and fences at U.S. government buildings are unprecedented, think again.Circa 1801, President Thomas Jefferson requested a “wooden post and rail fence” to be placed around the White House. According to the White House Historical Association, Jefferson erected what was commonly known at the time as “ha-ha” walls around the presidential residence.  A “ha-ha” wall sinks into the ground to permit an “uninterrupted view of the landscape” – perhaps a nod by the great architect to keep the White House from taking on the look of a prison.However, Mr. Jefferson’s enclosure was only the first of many White House barriers ordered by numerous presidents. Ulysses S. Grant added iron fencing. Grover Cleveland closed the South grounds. On the cusp of World War I, Woodrow Wilson closedthe grounds surrounding the residence, and FDR approved a plan that would “restrict public access to the grounds” once and for all.When the U.S. Marine barracks in Beirut, Lebanon were bombed, 3-foot thick concrete barricades went up at the White House. Following the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995, President Clinton closed Pennsylvania Avenue to all vehicular traffic. Then, post 9-11, the famed Jersey barriers were installed, and shortly thereafter, even passersby could not approach the official residence of the United States president.It appears that no matter the political stripe, everyone agrees that walls are effective at keeping people out. There is one exception, of course.When it comes to the U.S.-Mexicoborder, fences are, well, offensive. In one of his first executive orders, Joe Biden ordered all border wall construction to cease. Under the Trump administration, it is estimated that 450 miles of the wall between the U.S. and its neighbor to the south were built. On Thursday, January 28, it was reported that the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) suspended all construction on the southern border in compliance with the new directive.If there is a concern that a border wall will give America an unwelcoming look, why is it that this same concept does not translate to citizens within the country? In a current political climate permeated by fear, it is more than likely millions of dollars will be spent to erect a permanent barricade surrounding the U.S. Capitol. If appearances matter – and they do – knee-jerk reactions to domestic and foreign events will mean the land of the free will have the look and feel of a communist country. Perhaps, legislators should open discussions with the Chinese. They know a lot about building walls.~Leesa K. Donner."
5279,Yang Gang Takes New York?,15.67,29.33,https://www.libertynation.com/yang-gang-takes-new-york/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-03,www.libertynation.com,18,"Andrew Yang for mayor? The Yang Gang is seeking to occupy New York City in this summer’s electoral race, potentially putting their guy in place to succeed outgoing Democrat Mayor Bill de Blasio. After achieving national name recognition during the2020 Democratic primaries, mainly for being the candidate to offer Americans free money for existing, Yang is vying for one of America’s most powerful positions. Can Yang transfer his die-hard followers from the presidential race to local politics? If modern U.S. history is any indicator, the national stage is a successful springboard to political victory and adding to the campaign war chest.Is it too early for the polls? If there is anything the left and the right adore, it is polling data andbetting oddsfor future elections. Research firms are already surveying Americans for the 2024 primaries (former President Donald Trump lead in most). So, what do the numbers say about the June 2021 New York City mayoral contest?The latest poll came from Slingshot Strategies (Jan. 15-19). It found that the entrepreneur and presidential ambassador for global entrepreneurship is at the head of the pack, with 25%. This is followed by Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams (17%) and NYC Comptroller Scott Stringer (12%). When these candidates go head-to-head, Yang secures at least 48% of the vote.Since he hardly made a dent in the 2020 Democratic primaries, the mainstream media refrained from engaging in a full-frontal assault on the Yang campaign. The debate moderators usually allotted Yang only a few minutes of speaking time while allowing President Joe Biden to spout gibberish, Vice President Kamala Harris to laugh incessantly, and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to deliver crafted and hebetudinous platitudes. Now that Yang is a frontrunner in a crucial race, is the press digging up any controversies?According to, Yang’s White House campaign was engulfed in a “bro culture,” where the bullying was so intense that some female staffers revealed they were emotionally scarred. The website reported that one senior female official was placed on the sidelines in favor of a younger man, while another woman claimed she was terminated for reporting social media harassment from Yang’s supporters. It was so toxic for some women that they sought professional counseling.“The problem is, in general, this campaign is being run by bros who promote bros,” one former presidential campaign staffer told the news outlet.In a statement to the, Yang admitted that he failed to ensure all employees were “heard and respected,” adding that his campaign team failed to take into “account for how much our male-dominated culture alienated female and non-binary employees. I wish we had. For that I am deeply sorry.”Therecently obtained a copy of an 11-point contract that requires staffers to sign nondisclosure agreements (NDAs). The arrangement also contained a noteworthy conclusion: “I recognize the campaign’s right to proceed directly against me to obtain both injunctive relief and reasonable monetary damages if I violate the commitment listed above in any way.”The publication learned days later that Yang’s campaign would cease utilizing NDAs for volunteers. Press Secretary Jake Sporn confirmed that the main objective of ditching these hush contracts was to send the message to volunteers that discrimination, harassment, and other misconduct would not be tolerated. Sporn told the newspaper:“The remaining sections were there to protect all staff and volunteers from inadvertently running afoul of any rules regarding campaign finance or restrictions on coordination with any outside groups. These agreements are no longer used by the campaign.”Yang also faced criticism that he did not vote in many national and local races. Yang toldthat he did not vote in the 2000 and 2012 presidential elections, as well as New York City mayoral races between 2001 and 2017. But he says times have changed and that “now we’re in a crisis,” noting that “I think a lot of people are very galvanized to bring in a different sort of leadership.”Yang was often described as the internet’s favorite candidate. But did he initiate a movement with his White House bid last year? Yang proposed as his chief campaign plank theFreedom Dividend, also known as a universal basic income. Aside from that, he failed to offer anything substantive or different from his opponents. He adequately addressed society’s symptoms, from Middle America’s woes to the Democratic Party’s disdain for working-class folk, but Yang never offered solutions except for free money.Many are hoping that some young blood in politics rather than the gray-haired Swamp lifers may help bring fresh relevance to their constituents. By standing at the podium, Yang garnered enough attention to become a mainstay in politics and lay the foundation for a new and likely successful political career.~Andrew Moran."
5280,Is Maxine Waters Padding the Family Payroll?,20.0,25.67,https://www.libertynation.com/is-maxine-water-padding-the-family-payroll/,https://adfontesmedia.com/liberty-nation-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-01,www.libertynation.com,18,"Maxine Waters, the Democrat from California whoclaimedto have been sent by God to stop Donald Trump and whocalledfor the harassment of Trump staff and supporters, has again raised eyebrows – this time for how many campaign dollars she has given to family members. According to theFederal Elections Commission(FEC), Waters has given her daughter, Karen Waters, more than $1 million from campaign funds for duties performed since 2003. In fact, Watersdistributedto her daughter more than $240,000 during the most recent re-election cycle.The junior Waters received most of her pay for slate-mailing, a technique that isn’t used in campaign methods much anymore. A slate mailer is much like a pamphlet that lists a range of proposed laws or candidates, with information opposing or endorsing them. Karen Waters was involved in sending out publications “in which other candidates in Southern California paid Maxine Waters’ campaign for endorsement quotes that appeared on mailings sent out to voters on behalf of those other candidates,” Fox News explained.Between March 2019 and September 2020, Rep. Waters’ daughter earned $212,654.73, most of which came from “Slate Mailer Management” fees, but the FEC record shows 26 separate entries which also included “canvassing” and “office expenses.” The 82-year-old representative’s recent re-election campaign efforts showed five new entries for Karen which totaled $28,150. Of the ten recipients, Karen was the highest-paid from her mother’s campaign funds.Karen, however, isn’t the only family member to get paid through Waters’ campaign. Thereported in 2004 that more than $1 million had been paid out to relatives during the previous eight years. Melanie Sloan of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington at the time said Waters’ practice was unethical:“It looks like congresswoman Waters is using her position to financially benefit her family members, and that is at the very least unethical. You shouldn’t be making money off your mother’s endorsements.”Waters and her relatives claim they keep their businesses separate. “They do their business and I do mine,” the representative said. “We are not bad people.” Waters is the head of the House Financial Services Committee, and so these dealings have attracted a lot of scrutiny into her campaign finances, especially because of the numbers involved with her daughter’s earnings.Unsurprisingly, the mainstream media are not covering this story. A Google search only produced articles from Fox News, yet people have been raising red flags about the congresswoman’s campaign fund practices for well over a decade.Political nepotism may just be why so many Americans feel politicians are in it for themselves instead of the good of their constituents. Waters has been in Congress since 1991 and FEC records appear to show she has spent many years employing and paying various relatives large sums of money. Of course, she is not the only policymaker to take advantage of the system, and many question how lawmakers can enter the field with average wealth and become rich while serving the people.Although some suggest a full audit of Waters’ campaign finances, no action has been taken. It does seem like a lot of money to shell out to Karen’s public relations firm, Progressive Connections, to create, print, and mail sample ballots.~Kelli Ballard."
5281,Mnuchin in the Middle: Between Trump and Democrats,8.0,39.25,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/13/mnuchin_in_the_middle_between_trump_and_democrats__142927.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-13,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"It was hopeless, and he knew it, even before he started talking.The junior senator from Kentucky walked to the floor to deliver a melodramatic eulogy. “Can you hear it? Can you hear the somber notes, the feet shuffling, the solemn tones?” Rand Paul asked his colleagues last July 31 as they prepared to vote on a $2.7 trillion spending deal. “It’s a dirge, a funeral march; it’s the death of a movement.”“Today’s vote will be the last nail in the coffin,” he continued. “The Tea Party is no more.” And then, the Senate voted, 67-28, to suspend the debt ceiling and advance the spending package, which Paul had warned would further explode the nation’s $22 trillion debt.  If anyone was hammering nails into the coffin of the grand old claim that the Grand Old Party was the one of fiscal responsibility, it was the secretary of the Treasury Department. More specifically, the Republican Treasury secretary.When the White House wants to win over Democrats, President Trump sends in Steve Mnuchin. He has suspended a debt ceiling and quarterbacked a trade negotiation and most recently guided the $2.2 trillion Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security  package through Congress. With more aid coming, some conservatives in the White House and on the Hill quietly complain that Mnuchin is the fox guarding the fiscal hen house.They don’t go on the record, and for good reason.While the life of other Cabinet secretaries can be brutish and short, Mnuchin enjoys rare job security. Many of his colleagues have been forced to resign. Others have been publicly humiliated, fired over the phone while on the toilet or left behind on the tarmac. Not him. There were some slight scandals — the expensive flights on military jets and that egregiously out-of-touch photo shoot with his wife and the sheets of freshly printed dollar bills. But neither stuck, and it’s easy to understand why.“Despite the concerns of conservatives,” a senior House aide told RealClearPolitics, “it is clear that he has the trust of the president, which makes him a unique figure in the Cabinet.”Complaining about Mnuchin might mean jeopardizing access to the White House or, worse, endangering a clear line to the Treasury Department as the secretary doles out aid. And so, Republicans complain about the product without publicly mentioning the man who guides the process. A spokesman for Sen. Paul declined to comment, but he isn’t alone.“I’m not interested in any more of Speaker’s Pelosi’s spending porn — or any other member of Congress for that matter,” Sen. John Kennedy said on “Fox & Friends” shortly after the relief packaged passed. “Unless you were throwing the Frisbee in the quad during Econ 101,” he continued, “deficits matter.”A spokesman for Kennedy did not return a request for comment on the record.But if anyone is playing Frisbee, as Kennedy suggested, it would be Mnuchin and Pelosi. Drew Hammill, deputy chief of staff to the speaker, documented their correspondence in real-time. While Trump and Pelosi are not talking due to their feud, Mnuchin and the speaker talked on no fewer  than 10 different occasions as House Democrats held up the stimulus bill.The result of those negotiations: $2.2 trillion in relief that included cash for the National Endowment for of the Arts ($75 million), a fat bailout for the Kennedy Center, which still furloughed hundreds of staff ($25 million), and hefty payment to NASA ($60 million).And there was more than money. As RCP first reported, a union provision was tucked into the bill that had nothing to do with combating coronavirus. Businesses with 500 to 10,000 employees that accept a government relief loan are now required to remain neutral if their workers try to organize.Trump left the ugly business of sausage-making to Mnuchin and overlooks spending his conservative base would find unseemly. Anything he finds objectionable in the bill, the president insists, is just the price of doing business. “This is the Democrats -- that’s the way they play,” he said on “Fox & Friends.” “We need their votes. They have the House. We had to take care of people.”No one doubted the need for immediate relief, and the pandemic package advanced out of the House by voice vote. But some conservatives note this isn’t the first trillion-dollar piece of legislation that Mnuchin has delivered, and they point to the July 2019 bill that suspended spending limits that Paul blamed for burying the Tea Party. These two examples, one prominent House Republican representative told RCP, have brought him to an unavoidable conclusion: “I think that he is out of his lane.”Mnuchin made his money in banking at Goldman Sachs before turning his interest to film producing. He handled the money partnering with 20th Century Fox and Warner Bros to produce dozens of films. Some were more successful than others. “Mad Max: Fury Road,” a story of post-apocalyptic survival starring Tom Hardy, was a hit. Others, like Sandra Bullock’s “Our Brand is Crisis,” about an American political consultant trying to fix the Bolivian presidential election, flopped. Aside from brief mentions in rolling credits, Mnuchin was little-known and his civic involvement was limited to cutting checks to prominent politicos such as Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney.It wasn't until after a last-minute invitation to a Trump primary victory party in 2015 that Mnuchin switched to politics full time. He became national finance chairman of the Trump campaign and, later, secretary of the Treasury.It is remarkable start for a political rookie. Some worry it’s not enough to go against an ace like Pelosi.“He's probably pretty terrific on the technicalities of high finance,” the Republican said. But stepping to the plate against a seasoned negotiator like the speaker, the representative continued, requires discipline. “She may have lost some of her fastball, but she certainly still has a curveball and a slider.”Mnuchin places a premium on winning Democratic approval for legislation. The 2019 debt deal that the secretary negotiated, for instance, passed the House on back of Pelosi’s caucus, while a majority of Republicans opposed it. He wants to make a deal just like his boss promised to do during the campaign, and Mnuchin, despite his ideological naysayers, has delivered. Unlike Trump, though, he can sit down with Pelosi. They even have their own way of talking.“We listen to each other. And we kind of speak shorthand to each other because we don’t waste each other’s time on niceties or anything like that,” Pelosi told reporters as the relief package was being negotiated. Why not just speak to Trump directly? “There was no need for that,” Pelosi said of negotiating with the man she has been more than cool toward for months. It has left conservatives on the Hill feeling overlooked and taken for granted. “When you are negotiating a big deal you never start by handing the other side their preferred negotiating partner,” a senior House aide told RCP. “Mnuchin starts with more in common with how the Democrats view the world then how Republicans view the world, and that is concerning to conservatives in Congress.”This is all too familiar to one former White House aide who said Mnuchin was in the habit of bragging about his relationships with Democrats on the Hill while overlooking Republicans. “Sending him to negotiate is like waving the white flag of surrender before the battle has even started,” the former aide told RCP. And according to a White House official with knowledge of the relief package negotiations, Mnuchin has a singular focus: the stock market.“We are more interested in bipartisanship,” the current aide explained, comparing how the current and previous administrations dealt with the Hill, “but Mnuchin also isn’t particularly ideological.” And so, the secretary has been willing to turn a blind eye to principled objections “when the financial health of markets seems to be on the line.” A quiet frustration with Mnuchin is simmering in more conservative corners of the administration, and the pandemic has only heightened tensions. A senior administration official wondered whom Mnuchin was “representing in this deal.” There are billions for corporations and corporate lenders, so much so that the official said that whomever Mnuchin was backing “certainly wasn’t small business.”If Democrats are going to lard up emergency legislation with add-ons, outside conservatives are urging Mnuchin and the Trump administration to make their own asks. They feel the union rule included in the last round of relief was an unfair ambush. They want it overturned, and more.The Club for Growth has sent a memo to Capitol Hill calling for a number of regulatory relief items, including a temporary suspension of any business regulation that “imposes a burden” on U.S. businesses, charities, educational institutions, and other employers trying to restart and rehire employees. The plan would also require Trump to issue an executive order suspending all civil and criminal penalties for any violation of regulations. Those are their proposed riders, and they wish Mnuchin would give those Republican concerns as much as priority as Democratic asks.It isn’t like the White House doesn’t have clout on Capitol Hill; conservatives say it is just a matter of will. They have hope in the newly minted chief of staff.“Mark Meadows is a very good negotiating politician. He is able to do remarkable things, and I’m hopeful that he can basically help Mnuchin begin to understand the ramifications for the conservative cause in these deals,” a House Republican said. “But I’m not sure he’s the one who should be negotiating in the first place.”Another congressman was more blunt, if also slightly more optimistic.“I've never been comfortable with a with a Democrat-Wall Street guy negotiating with Nancy Pelosi, who's always more inclined to put Wall Street in front of mainstream interest,” the Republican representative explained. “That being said, it's clear that he has the president’s respect.”Perhaps if Trump is reelected, the representative said, Mnuchin could leverage his relationships with Democrats to tackle the national debt.But if the Tea Party is dead, suffocated by the ballooning deficits of a Republican administration, fiscal renewal seems unlikely in the next four years. Another phase of relief now sits before Congress, and according to Hill sources, Mnuchin has been signaling different things to either side.Chuck Schumer spoke with Mnuchin Friday morning, and the Senate minority leader announced that he and the Treasury secretary had “agreed to pursue bipartisan talks with the leadership of House and Senate Democrats.” Pelosi also announced that she had talked to her new friend, recommending publicly that talks “proceed on a bipartisan basis.”Republicans have been pushing for additional funding for small business loans, and Democrats are amenable. They just want more sweeteners on top — aid for hospitals and local government and underserved communities. Mitch McConnell has said publicly that those funds can be included in a subsequent funding package.The delay, the majority leader concluded, was pure politics. “Nobody except Washington Democrats seems to be unclear on this fact or confused about the urgency,” McConnell said in a statement. “Republicans reject Democrats’ reckless threat.”Mnuchin remains in the middle, Trump’s point man for negotiations. Some worry again about what additional sacrifice he will make to get another deal."
5282,Infection Count vs. Jobless Data: An Imbalanced TV Picture,10.33,30.33,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/10/infection_count_vs_jobless_data_an_imbalanced_tv_picture_142919.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-10,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"A Washington Post opinion piece this week posed an interesting question: What if television news channels like CNN displayed unemployment numbers throughout the day the way they do infection and death counts, thus raising awareness of the enormous economic cost the coronavirus is wreaking on the nation? Greater public awareness of job loss could pressure lawmakers to accelerate relief programs, much as wall-to-wall coverage of infection counts has pushed government leaders to enact more mobility restrictions on citizens. This raises the question of just how much more coverage infection counts are getting compared with unemployment numbers.Specifically, how often are the words “unemployment,” “unemployed” or “jobless” displayed on CNN each day? In contrast, how often does “Johns Hopkins” (CNN’s primary source of infection and death counts) appear on screen?To explore this question, Google’s Video AI was used to “watch” CNN 24/7 since Jan. 25 and compile all of the text visible on screen each second. The source of all the broadcasts was the Internet Archive’s Television News Archive and they were analyzed by the GDELT Project in a special non-consumptive digital library system.The timeline below shows the total seconds of airtime from Jan. 25 through the end of April 8 in which either of the two topics appeared in the on-screen text each day. (Click on the chart to enlarge it.)Unemployment began appearing around March 18, with two bursts on March 26 and April 2 (coinciding with the release of weekly jobless figures), but otherwise has received little on-screen visibility.In contrast, on March 20, CNN displayed infection and death counts from Johns Hopkins University for more than five hours (the cumulative total) throughout the day and starting the following day has aired them around eight to nine hours each day.In total, over the past two months, unemployment numbers have appeared on screen on CNN for just 6.3 hours total, compared with 160.3 hours of infection and death counts.Over the last three weeks, a third of CNN’s total airtime each day has aired the public health impact of the virus, compared to just a few brief mentions of its economic devastation. Would greater visibility of the latter pressure lawmakers to extend greater relief to the nation’s suddenly jobless? We may never know the answer as CNN has apparently decided, at this point, that the health impacts are far more important."
5283,We Won't Do This for 12 to 18 Months,5.67,30.0,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/23/we_wont_do_this_for_12_to_18_months.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-23,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"Economist Herb Stein was famous for a great many things, but most prominent among them was “Stein’s Law.” It is elegant in its simplicity: “If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.”Stein’s Law is particularly appropriate these days as we discuss plans for reopening the economy. There is a small but growing portion of mostly Republican governors who seem intent on opening up sooner rather than later. There’s also a group that insists on opening up slowly, with Ezekiel Emanuel suggesting “conferences, concerts, sporting events, religious services, dinner in a restaurant, none of that will resume until we find a vaccine, a treatment, or a cure” while concluding that “[w]e need to prepare ourselves for this to last 18 months or so and for the toll that it will take.”Somewhere in the middle are a slew of plans from think tanks outlining a variety of suggestions to open up gradually over the course of the next few months.  Most of these plans are pegged to a variety of metrics based off of declining caseloads, or a set period of time. The Center for American Progress suggests 45 days, while Harvard suggests three months.These are interesting debates, but they don’t frame the question properly. The question isn’t what timeline we should allow for things to start to reopen. That assumes a degree of control over events that we probably lack.  Instead, the timeline will probably be dictated for us, which demands a slightly different policy discussion. There are a couple of reasons for this:First is public opinion. Support for stay-at-home orders remains robust nationally in polling, but there is at least anecdotal evidence that patience with such orders is starting to wane. I’ve noticed an increase in traffic when I go to the bank, and longer lines when I get takeout. We’ve seen protests, although they are sporadic at best. And, again anecdotally, people’s nerves seem to be fraying.How long the public will support these measures is anyone’s guess, but I doubt the public’s patience is infinite. This debate will heat up as our economy sorts into three tiers: knowledge economy workers unaffected by the collapse who demand continued distancing; essential workers who have to work (often in jobs where it is impossible to distance); and a growing segment of unemployed.  Simmering in the background is the issue of churches; secular observers often have a hard time appreciating the mindset of religious believers, but I’m confident that while the devout are willing to take a few weeks off of services, they won’t wait several months to resume them.Second, for plans that are based on the development of a vaccine or a national test-and-trace system, it isn’t assured that we will ever have either. In fact, we’ve never developed a vaccine for a coronavirus, and there are challenges involved in doing so. Attempts to develop an effective vaccine for SARS ran into financial challenges as the virus disappeared, but those vaccine trials also were showing secondary effects. This doesn’t mean it is impossible – many trials are well under way for this pathogen, and the reward for developing this vaccine will be much greater than developing one for, say, the coronavirus strains of the common cold. But we shouldn’t act as though success is assured, either. Hope is important, but it is not a plan.As for test-and-trace, this would require immense intrusions on personal liberty to carry out, which the public and courts may or may not tolerate. I also think people underestimate the massive logistical challenges involved in implementing such a policy in a country that is roughly the same size as all of Europe, including the Russian portion, only less densely populated overall. I’m not a public health expert, but implementing this in Manhattan seems to be a fundamentally different challenge than doing so in, say, Montana.But these are secondary, and to some degree speculative, concerns. The biggest problem is that, sooner or later, something will collapse that we can’t bail out or regulate our way around. The most obvious prospect is another collapse of the financial system, though we successfully bailed out and regulated our way around such an event only 12 years ago.A crisis in higher education is another possibility. If students decide to opt for gap years before college or to take another year off before going to graduate or professional school as campuses close, school income would be hit. More important for some larger schools would be the cancellation of sports. The Ohio State University, for example, makes some $75 million in profit off of sports, and it isn’t the nation’s biggest sports school. Those are big gaps to fill, especially when states will be facing contracting budgets as well. Larger concerns would be a collapse of the health care system or food distribution networks.  We’ve seen increasing stories of hospitals conducting layoffs – counterintuitively, one might think, amid a pandemic – because of the cancellation of non-emergency surgeries, which supply a huge amount of their operating budget.  To put this in perspective, Ohio hospitals are projected to lose $1.2 billion a month in revenue.  That’s unsustainable for the summer, much less 18 months.  Farmers are beginning to destroy their crops as the collapse of the dining industry removes a major source of demand. You should think of this probabilistically. We’ve thrown a live grenade into a very delicate social and economic web. Regardless of whether or not you support the measures we’ve adopted so far, the longer they go on, the higher the probability of the grenade detonating as we hit a “tail risk” phenomenon. Sooner or later some second- or third-order effect is going to pop up that no one anticipated, and that threatens to overwhelm us. If you need further convincing, follow oil prices. Negative prices are not normal.Mind you, the first school closures barely occurred a month ago (speaking of which, if secondary schools are closed next year, those parents still working are going to have to figure out how to make it work). We haven’t been at this very long and we’re already seeing serious threats looming. I can only imagine what other threats will emerge after another month or two of this. Finally, we shouldn’t let these trees obscure a wider forest. These different scenarios work with each other: As second- and third-order effects begin to present, Americans’ tolerance for restrictions will increasingly wear thin. This will be especially true if, as some suspect, the virus retreats in the summer (before reappearing in the fall).Two concluding thoughts: First, this is descriptive, not prescriptive; the analysis does not vary whether one opposes or supports the current measures. Second, none of this means that we should do nothing.  It means that time is of the essence. We don’t have unlimited runway to get things up and running before our hand is forced. We might have the 45 days envisioned by the Center for American Progress, but I’m extremely skeptical that we have the three months envisioned by Harvard."
5284,"Remote But Not Removed, Alaska Freezes Out COVID-19",17.0,35.67,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/23/remote_but_not_removed_alaska_freezes_out_covid-19_143019.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-23,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"The layover would last five hours. Some cried. Most cheered.Kalitta Air 4371, with service to March Air Reserve Base in California, landed to refuel in Anchorage on the night of Jan 29. The cargo plane had been hastily converted to accommodate passengers and commissioned by the State Department to bring 201 Americans home. And while planes landing safely seldom make the news and delays rarely make anyone happy, this one did both. It came from Wuhan.The passengers kept cheering as the 747 taxied to the gate. At that time, World Health Organization officials still insisted that human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus seemed unlikely, and they wouldn’t declare a global health pandemic for another 42 days. But listening and watching from his home office, Alaska’s chief executive came to his own conclusion.“You just knew something was up,” Gov. Mike Dunleavy told RealClearPolitics of the cheering expats and crying diplomatic staff. “This isn’t a cold. This isn’t the ordinary flu.”Medical professionals were screening the passengers one by one when Dunleavy realized it was a matter of time before the virus would come to the last frontier. “We just wanted to do everything we could to prepare,” he explained. “We stood up, our response, right after that.”Much of that responsibility went to Adam Crum, commissioner for the Alaska Department of Health and Social Services. The State Department had called on Saturday. The governor gave the go ahead. Crum had four days to prepare, “but really we didn't know much about this virus at all at that point in time,” he recalled.So, they took every precaution, turning a terminal at Ted Stevens International Airport into an impromptu screening station: negative pressure systems, first responders geared head to toe in personal protective equipment, and hospital beds ready to go.The cheers were also the first thing Crum heard, and it was a relief. Rumors had circulated once news broke of the flight from Wuhan that “we were letting a ‘death plane’ land in Alaska filled with the plague.” No one knew the exact nature of the virus, let alone the mortality statistics. The onboard jubilation was an early sign that their worst fears wouldn’t be met.Among the most extreme contingency plans: How would Alaska store dead bodies of Americans coming back from Wuhan with the state’s already limited morgue capacity? Officials prepared to use cold storage warehouses at the Department of Fish and Game and Department of Natural Resources.The freezers stayed empty. None of the passengers needed emergency medical care either, except for one woman who had broken her hand boarding the plane. Still, Crum and his team often began conversations with the Centers for Disease Control by warning that “Alaska has a very delicate health care system.”Alaska has mirrored many of the actions taken by states in the Lower 48. There are stay-at-home orders and schools are out for the rest of the year, and everything from bars to bingo halls are closed. The governor also went farther with an emergency order: Anyone entering the state must declare a designated quarantine location and self-isolate for 14 days. Ignoring that edict is a Class-A misdemeanor that could come with a $25,000 penalty or a year in jail.And, so far, it has worked. This week Alaska has only 329 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and nine deaths, according to the state’s Department of Health and Human Services.“There is no doubt that a major contributor to Alaska’s lower case counts to date is the fact that our state and local leaders, particularly Gov. Dunleavy, took decisive action early to implement broad community mitigation interventions,” wrote state epidemiologist Joe McLaughlin.But the big advantage of Alaska -- its 663 million square miles and fewer than 1 million people -- is also its biggest disadvantage. Villages are isolated, Crum explained, but people there are densely packed together. Alaska has nearly double the national average of homes defined as overcrowded. “While we can keep it isolated,” Crum said of the virus, “if it finds its way into some of these communities, it would spread like wildfire.”The state, in good times, has hospital capacity for 2% of the population, and Alaskans have a saying that there is just a week’s supply of groceries within its borders at any given moment. This makes for a different pandemic experience than that of other states. So do the snow machines and bush planes ferrying medical supplies and personnel to the farthest north, east, and west corners of the country.Bad luck has also made for good pandemic preparation. Alaska has a history of tuberculosis outbreaks and regularly battles sexually transmitted infections. “And so,” Crum explained, “our epidemiologist teams are well versed with public health nurses to do contact tracing and getting into small areas to find out what exactly is going on.”Alaska is also drawing from its own grim institutional memory of the great influenza outbreak that swept the world a century ago. “We have villages that existed at 1918 that don't exist anymore because of the Spanish flu,” Dunleavy explained. His team knows the history. According to University of Alaska professor Katherine Ringsmuth, “More people per capita died from influenza in Alaska than almost anywhere else in the world.” “Fake news” was a thing back then, too. Nothing to see here, the Anchorage Daily Times assured its readers back in 1918: “Don’t be alarmed,” it proclaimed, “over influenza in Anchorage.” Then, when it became clear that alarm was just the right response, pleas came from Alaska to Congress for relief – pleas that fell on deaf ears: A $200,000 request was cut in half by the Senate and then voted down by the House.But the money flows north without impediment this time, and the governor is hell-bent on keeping a second tragic chapter from being written. Abbott testing machines are being delivered via snow machines, and Alaska feels better about its preparations for this pandemic. Dunleavy is not afraid. After all, this state is populated by the most unconventional of citizens — global health crisis be damned. There is a reason, they say, why people move to a frozen place, an unbroken motivation for living in Secretary William Seward's infamous “icebox.”The White House has not forgotten the nation’s northernmost citizens. The administration would rather let them figure out the particulars while Washington figures the broad strokes.This works for Mike Dunleavy. But the Republican governor won’t go as far as his colleagues. The state parks remain open. “We are a free people in this country,” he said. “We believe that in Alaska we are an even a freer people, and so to be able to go out and do what you want, as long as you stay six feet away from others, is fine.”Salmon season is just around the corner, and the governor is planning on how to let fisherman reap the harvest while following federal social distance guidelines."
5285,Facebook's COVID-Protest Ban Renews Censorship Concerns,8.67,29.0,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/22/facebooks_covid-protest_ban_renews_censorship_concerns_143003.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-22,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"Facebook’s growing power over the public square is back in the news this week as the company announced it is banning the promotion of certain kinds of back-to-work protest events on its platform. While the company’s previous bans have largely focused on blocking digital speech it finds objectionable, the move to thwart protests in the physical world underscores just how central the social media giant has become to the expression of democracy and just how much power it now wields over even our physical lives.On Monday, the company began removing certain posts intended to organize rallies protesting government stay-at-home orders amid the coronavirus epidemic. A spokesperson confirmed that “events that defy government's guidance on social distancing aren’t allowed on Facebook” and that it was removing content promoting or organizing such rallies.As part of its efforts, the company “reached out to state officials to understand the scope of their orders” and to “remove the posts when gatherings do not follow the health parameters established by the government and are therefore unlawful.”In cases where state governments still permit socially distanced protests, Facebook is allowing the events to be organized on its platform as long as the protest explicitly requires all participants to maintain social distance. The company didn’t clarify whether it would remove protest events in states with stay-at-home orders that do not explicitly permit protests other than to note that it would remove any events running contrary to the guidance of state officials.The outsized role Facebook plays today in organizing in-person rallies again reminds us that it is no longer just a place for friends to share family photos and chat online. It is now the de facto town square through which democratic societies communicate with their elected officials and organize demonstrations when they feel those officials no longer represent their interests.That a private company can now unilaterally decide to simply delete the promotion of protests it deems unacceptable is a remarkable expansion of its power over what was once a sacrosanct and constitutionally protected freedom. As we cede the public square to private companies, however, those constitutional freedoms of speech and expression no longer apply in some cases. Through those private companies, in fact, government officials can in effect restrict speech they are obligated to protect.If Facebook is able to independently ban certain COVID-19 protests, what is to stop the company tomorrow from banning calls for women’s rights protests in the Middle East, LGBTQ protests in Russia or democracy protests in Hong Kong, all to comply with government rulings? Asked about these examples, the company declined to comment further or to commit that it would not expand its COVID-19 policy to other topics.In the end, while we might question the wisdom of crowded protests in the midst of a pandemic, the responsibility for curbing such actions must fall to democratically elected governments answerable to the people, not private companies accountable to no one."
5286,"Dem Candidates Give Pelosi, Party Leaders a Pass on SBA Loans",18.0,35.33,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/21/dem_candidates_give_pelosi_party_leaders_a_pass_on_sba_loans_142998.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-21,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"John Hickenlooper, Colorado’s two-term governor whose 2020 Democratic presidential bid morphed into a Senate campaign, wants voters to know he’s not an average politician. The former Denver mayor is trying to unseat freshman Republican Sen. Cory Gardner, and his campaign literature is sprinkled with references to his small-business beginnings and the brewpub chain he created with a loan from the city more than three decades ago.Hickenlooper would go on to sell his stake in the chain for a reported $7 million.  “Change is on tap,” his website bio page proclaims, describing Hickenlooper’s “different path to public office.” The life story is accompanied by beer-tap icon and black-and-white photo of a 1980s-styled Hickenlooper and his three business partners, all clad in T-shirt and jeans, standing below a Wynkoop Brewery-coming-soon sign that promoted the undertaking as a project of the city and county of Denver’s Revolving Loan Fund Program.Now that a global coronavirus pandemic has workers locked down in their homes and more than 22 million Americans out of work, business-friendly Democrats like Hickenlooper are urgently pressing for more loans and action to help small businesses survive.“We must accelerate our efforts to enable small businesses to keep workers on payroll,” Hickenlooper said in a statement over the weekend. Last week he unveiled his multi-point plan to do just that. It starts out by acknowledging that “half of small businesses only have about a two-week cash buffer before they collapse.”Meanwhile, Democratic leaders in Washington, D.C., have been  holding up hundreds of billions in federal funds intended to rescue the same kind of restaurants, stores, breweries and other small businesses across the country. A $350 billion loan program, part of the CARES Act, was paused last Thursday after quickly burning through all of its money. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and other Democratic leaders have been facing heat over the last week for their role in the stalemate. While acknowledging that small businesses are being crushed, Democrats have insisted on tying the rescue to their own priorities, including $150 billion funding for state and local governments that are facing spiraling budget deficits – many COVID-related, but some not — and some $75 billion for hospitals.All of this is occurring during an election year, and Republicans have hammered Democratic candidates over it while playing up what they see as a wildly out-of-touch moment for Pelosi last week. The wealthy Democratic Party leader joined comedian James Corden from her California home on his late-night show, taking shots at President Trump’s handling of the pandemic while showing off how much designer ice cream she has in her two gleaming sub-zero freezers.“While Nancy Pelosi sits in her ivory tower in San Francisco eating $13 dollar a pint ice cream out of her $24,000 fridge, she is cheering on Democrats for blocking coronavirus relief aid that has so far been distributed to 1.3 billion small businesses that is about to run out,” Republican National Committee spokesman Steve Guest tweeted.“Question for Nancy Pelosi: How many more jobs will you eliminate while you and your fellow Democrats continue to block more funding for the Paycheck Protection Program?” Guest followed up in an email to reporters on Monday.Critics on the left also panned the appearance as unseemly.“Millions of Americans are waiting for crappy one-time 1200 checks that Congress passed before they went on holiday, and the Speaker is on a late-night comedy program showing off how much ice cream she has stored in her freezer,” tweeted Mehdi Hasan, a columnist for the Intercept.The Trump campaign this week started running a brutal digital ad showing the pain of out-of-work people looking into their own near-empty refrigerators intercut with Pelosi’s comedy segment where she titters about how much ice cream she’s eating while under lockdown. The ad ends with the words, “Let them eat ice cream—Nancy Antoinette.”Stalling legislation to get more of what you want is part of normal Washington sausage-making. But during a pandemic with the economy cratering, two days can make or break companies, advocates warn. The National Federation of Independent Business released a survey on the small business loan program Monday, showing that 80% of small business applicants are still urgently waiting for financial assistance and many have no idea of where they are in the application process.“Every day that goes by without financial support for these small firms is hugely detrimental for those who have to adjust their workforce or operations to keep afloat,” Holly Wade, NFIB director of research and policy analysis, told RealClearPolitics. “It’s incredibly stressful, frustrating and scary.”The urgency certainly isn’t lost on Hickenlooper and other prominent Democratic candidates with business backgrounds, but most have tried to frame the debate as Washington politics delaying the funds, instead of Democrats wanting add-ons that could be pursued later.Astronaut-turned-small-business-owner Mark Kelly is one example. The husband of former Rep. Gabby Giffords is challenging Arizona Sen. Martha McSally in a closely watched election battle. Kelly, a part owner of near-space tourism company World View, recently said he is acutely aware of how difficult it is to start a small business in the best of times, never mind trying to keep it running during a pandemic.“Washington needs to get out of its own way, immediately put more resources into this program, and fix some of the issues that have made it harder for Arizona small businesses to get this relief,” he said. “The Arizona small businesses I've spoken with aren't receiving the help they need and can’t wait any longer.”M.J. Hegar, an Air Force veteran and teacher who also has her own business consulting firm, casts her frustration over the delays in similar terms. Hegar is challenging Texas GOP Sen. John Cornyn. A spokeswoman for her campaign told RCP the Democratic candidate “has been clear that Washington needs to put politics aside and provide immediate relief for Texas small businesses.”She also faulted Cornyn for the $2.2 trillion relief package Congress passed in early April for failing to fund enough virus tests, which could, if conducted extensively enough, help state and local leaders in Texas assess how to best open the state’s economy. Less than 1% of Texans have been tested for COVID-19, the spokeswoman said. “Texas small business owners deserve both economic relief and peace of mind that, because of adequate testing, once they can reopen, they will stay open,” she added.Other Democrats with business backgrounds in tough races argue that it’s good policy to delay the funds to make sure they’re going to the small businesses that need them the most. Clearer guidelines are desperately needed, they say, after embarrassing examples of the loans being awarded to more than a dozen companies with annual revenues in the hundreds of millions, such as Ruth’s Chris Steak House chain and Shake Shack, which received $10 million but has since pledged to give it back.Democratic Sen. Gary Peters, whose state of Michigan is getting hit hard by both the pandemic and the accompanying economic free fall, said Democrats have delayed the new funding to try to fix a problem with the first tranche already passed, namely that many small businesses were left waiting while bigger businesses, restaurant chains and some big hotel groups were given money instead.“We need to be focused on those businesses that are most damaged – folks that need the help the most,” he told MSNBC on Monday. “Help can’t wait much longer, but we want to do this right as well and to make sure there’s proper accountability,” added Peters, who has an MBA and spent his early career as a Merrill Lynch financial adviser before becoming an executive at PaineWebber.Peters, one of the most vulnerable senators this cycle, maintains only a four-point lead over challenger John James, according to a poll conducted in January, before the pandemic. Republicans say they were close to a deal late last week but Democratic leaders are still not appreciating the urgency of the situation.“Apparently, Senate Democrats decided over the weekend that providing financial relief to small business owners and their employees was not an urgent priority,” National Republican Senatorial Committee spokesman Jesse Hunt told RCP.Moe Vela, a former senior adviser to Joe Biden who now works for TransparentBusiness, a consulting firm, brushes off the notion that voters will blame Democrats for holding up the funds for two weeks. Vela, who sat on the White House emergency preparedness and continuity of government council during Barack Obama’s presidency, argued that Democrats are fighting to ensure that the money goes to those who truly need it, such as minority- and women-owned small businesses -- and voters are smart enough to see that.“Shake Shack got some, but Mrs. Gonzales’ tortilla factory didn’t?” he asked.A spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee pressed similar points.“Democrats had to fight for more money for small businesses in the original relief package, and are now fighting to ensure this aid actually gets to small businesses, including those that work with community leaders, are in rural communities or are owned by veterans, people of color and women,” said DSCC spokeswoman Lauren Passalacqua said in a statement.“They’re also fighting for more hospitals and coronavirus testing so we can safely reopen the economy – why aren’t Republicans?”But at least one prominent Republican, President Trump himself, has expressed concern over bigger businesses getting the loans while smaller ones struggling to find the money to stay afloat are having more trouble. “Some people will have to return it, if we think it’s inappropriate,” he pledged during Monday’s press conference. “If somebody got something that they think is inappropriate, we will get it back.”When it comes to more money for testing, Trump was less trusting of Democrats’ motives. Earlier Monday, he tweeted that Democrats are pushing for more testing as a way to shift responsibility onto the federal government for any problems involved in re-opening state and local economies.“States, not the federal government, should be doing the testing,” he said. “But we will work with the governors and get it done.” "
5287,A Tiny Virus Further Sickens the Fevered Media Mob,21.0,30.0,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/20/a_tiny_virus_further_sickens_the_fevered_media_mob_142976.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-20,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"In his 1898 novel, “The War of the Worlds,” H.G. Wells imagined a world changed forever by something like our dread coronavirus. In that familiar story, Martian invaders were close to total domination of the Earth when they were unexpectedly vanquished by the “germs of disease,” famously called by Wells “the humblest things that God, in his wisdom, had put upon this earth.”In the novel, mankind is saved by germs, but in modern Hollywood science fiction viruses are usually employed to devastate human society, or change it forever. The extent to which COVID-19 will leave a permanent mark on us is yet unknown, but it is safe to declare that generations of future doctoral students will study its impact on everything from handshakes to food supply chains.Within the sphere of politics, we have already seen short-term impacts to elections and how legislative bodies do their work, but the question of how the psychology of crisis will translate into permanent changes in the relationship between the governed and the government can only be answered with informed guesses. Is the rebellion in Michigan against Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s stringent stay-at-home orders the first shot in a war against the nanny state or the last gasp of “consent of the governed”? Will the electorate become enamored of receiving “paychecks” from the government for not working, or will it chafe at adding untold trillions to the national debt and demand new austerity measures? Can the political media continue to play the role of a Greek chorus, pretending to speak for the general population and assuming a posture of omniscience despite being mainly aligned with one political party – and being so wrong so often?It is that last question that consumes me today as I watch yet again the White House press corps savage President Trump. It’s become a daily ritual, and one that I enjoy not because the president is being attacked, but because he so deftly fends off the swarming journalistic pests like Gulliver shaking loose from a dozen Lilliputians who mistakenly thought they had the giant pinned. What I don’t know is how many voters believe the Fake News being used against Gulliver or how they view him when he on occasion loses his cool in response to their poison darts. Hopefully, the average citizen recognizes that swatting at mosquitoes is the appropriate response when traversing across a dangerous swamp. The skeeters, of course, have a different take.Last week, we witnessed the White House press corps at its fustian worst while trying to pit President Trump against Dr. Anthony Fauci, one of his chief advisers on the pandemic. Like many experienced hands in D.C. before him, Fauci made the mistake of appearing on a Sunday morning talk show with the expectation that the journalist interviewing him was interested in a Socratic dialogue intended to elucidate the truth. No such luck. Jake Tapper, host of CNN’s “State of the Union,” was only interested in playing a grade-school game of gotcha. He wanted to maneuver Dr. Fauci into blaming Trump for the deaths of Americans.I watched with amusement as Fauci fenced with Tapper in regard to whether or not the president “had gotten started too late” on mitigation efforts against the coronavirus, and was therefore responsible for thousands of deaths. Fauci began his response with a catchphrase that should be used by every guest who appears on Tapper’s show: “You know it isn’t as simple as that, Jake. I’m sorry.” Unfortunately, he proceeded to try to treat Tapper like an adult capable of nuance and rational thought, which led him to make self-evident statements of little probative value, but which Tapper (and his fellow wolfpack journalists) twisted into a condemnation of the president.“Obviously, could you have done something a little earlier? Would it have had an impact? Obviously,” Fauci stated, but he then shot down Tapper’s attempt to make a comparison between South Korea and the United States when it comes to deaths from the virus.“It’s a little bit unfair to compare us to South Korea, where they had an outbreak in Daegu and had the capability of immediately attempting shutting it off completely in a way we may not have been able to do in this country,” he said. “I don’t think you could say that we are where we are right now because of one factor. It’s very complicated.”But Tapper wasn’t buying it. He had an agenda, a roadmap in the form of a New York Times report asserting that Fauci and other officials had “wanted to recommend” social distancing guidelines as far back as the third week of February, but the administration didn’t announce such guidelines until a month later. The implication was that the delay was equivalent to premeditated murder. When Fauci didn’t take the bait, Tapper got more direct: “Do you think lives could have been saved if social distancing, physical distancing, stay-at-home measures had started the third week of February instead of mid-March?”This was like asking whether an accident could have been avoided if the driver was told in advance to swerve left instead of right. Yeah, thanks, you know-it-all Greek chorus! By now, I’m screaming at the TV and at Tapper’s smug face as he dutifully sets up Fauci for the kill. Please, Doc, just don’t say “obviously” again! But it was inevitable. Fauci just never understood that he was being ambushed.“You know, Jake, it’s the what-could-have, what-would-have,” Fauci replied. “… It’s very difficult to go back and say that [lives could have been saved]. I mean obviously you could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier, you could have saved lives. Obviously, no one is going to deny that. … But what goes into those kinds of decisions -- it’s complicated. But you’re right. Obviously, if we had right from the beginning shut everything down, it may have been a little different.”“Obviously” times three! This could not be good. What is obvious to you and me is absolutely mind-blowing to the Jake Tappers of the world, who seize on every shred of common sense as the first sign of a coverup in plain sight. Then Fauci gave Tapper and the rest of the partisan press just what it needed when he made the vague and obviously true statement that “there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then.”It didn’t seem like a big deal at the time. After all, it was obvious, but within hours, the rest of the mainstream media was quoting Fauci as if he had pointed the finger at Donald Trump and said, “It’s all his fault! Trump was the one who pushed back! He made me do it!” Of course, that’s nonsense. Everybody except perhaps Sen. Tom Cotton was pushing back against the doomsday scenario of shutting down the economy at that time. Most of us probably never even envisioned it as a realistic possibility. Only the self-absorbed Greek chorus with its 20-20 hindsight could manage to condemn Trump with such skimpy evidence.But condemn they did! The narrative was quickly shaped and shopped around that Fauci was blaming the president for thousands of deaths. Even the once conservative Drudge Report informed its millions of readers that “Fauci downloads on Trump,” which is hip headline lingo for criticizing his boss.Only it never happened. In his interview with Tapper, Fauci had not one harsh word to say about the president. Trump knew it. I knew it. Fauci knew it. But the press apparently didn’t know it, and the phony story spread for 24 hours that the Good Doctor had pushed back against the president when he was really pushing back against the misleading questions. Even a lot of the conservative media like Breitbart and Gateway Pundit were quick to adopt the Fake News narrative that Fauci had been disloyal to Trump. What interview were they watching? Please, folks, get the facts straight before you make accusations.The following day, at the April 13 coronavirus task force briefing, Fauci and the president got to set the record straight. It didn’t take long. Following his first response to a question, Fauci said he needed to clarify something he said the previous day in response to a hypothetical question:“Hypothetical questions sometimes can get you into some difficulty, because it’s what ‘would have’ or ‘could have’ [happened]. The nature of the hypothetical question was, ‘If in fact we had mitigated earlier, could lives have been saved?’ And the answer to my question was ... ‘Yes.’ I mean obviously. If mitigation helps — I’ve been up here many times telling you mitigation works — so if mitigation works and you ... initiate it earlier, you will probably have saved more lives. If you initiate it later, you probably would have lost more lives. You initiate it at a certain time. That was taken as a way that maybe something was at fault here.”Fauci then explicitly explained that before there even was a task force, he and the other medical professionals had talked about “the pros and the cons, and effectiveness or not, of strong mitigation.” The “pushback,” in other words, was the normal give-and-take of professionals having a serious discussion about real-life consequences of real hard decisions. It had nothing to do with President Trump.“The first and only time that Dr. [Deborah] Birx and I went in and formally made a recommendation to the president to actually have a … shutdown in the sense of ... strong mitigation ... the president listened to the recommendation and went to the mitigation.”This firm and clear statement that the press had gotten the story wrong wasn’t good enough for some of the reporters present. Paula Reid of CBS even tried to shift the narrative against Fauci himself by casting him as a toady of Trump. “Are you doing this voluntarily?” she asked without the slightest hint of shame.The poison look that Fauci gave her was the perfect summation of how an informed citizenry feels about the misinforming media. “Are you kidding?” he might have asked. “Did you really just ask me that insulting question?”Par for the course. Only usually it is President Trump who is being insulted by the masters of the universe in the journalism racket. But as the Washington press corps gets bolder, they seem willing to go after nearly anybody, even on occasion a Democrat! Or maybe they had to seek easier targets since Trump punches back.It is my hope that one of the changes we may see happen as a result of the current pandemic is that the American public will stop relying on the media to interpret events for them, or to pass judgment on our behalf. It was easy for reporters to turn President Trump into a dangerous buffoon when they controlled the narrative, but as soon as Trump decided to hold daily press conferences about how his administration was responding to the virus crisis, it gave Americans a chance to judge for themselves the character and competence of their commander in chief. They also have a chance to judge for themselves how closely the media narrative hews to reality or — as I think — diverges into pure fantasy.With any luck, we can break the stranglehold of the know-it-all media mafia on the flow of information into the homes of most Americans. On the other hand, it is entirely possible that the Trump-hating media will redouble its efforts to alienate Trump from everyday Americans by painting him as an out-of-touch madman. I wish I knew which way the matter will be resolved,  but like the narrator of “War of the Worlds,” I too must confess “the stress and danger of the time have left an abiding sense of doubt and insecurity in my mind.”How much of that doubt and insecurity is a function of the virus, and how much of it was created by the Greek chorus of media negativity, is one of those questions that will have to wait to be answered by future scholars."
5288,"Harris Ripped Biden on Race. As VP Contender, She Hails Him.",7.75,38.0,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/28/harris_ripped_biden_on_race_as_vp_contender_she_hails_him_143057.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-28,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"Sen. Kamala Harris tends to go to extremes when describing the choice for voters in the 2020 election.During a virtual forum Monday to promote Joe Biden’s campaign -- an online gathering that also served as Harris’ latest veepstakes audition -- she implored his supporters to “do everything we can to elect” the former vice president because the November election is “literally going to be about our health and whether we live or die.”In a normal election year, such apocalyptic language would prompt collective eye-rolls. But roughly two months into a pandemic that has upended the world, snuffing out precious lives and livelihoods in its path, it comes off as rehearsed gloom and doom from Democrats eager to use the crisis to oust Donald Trump from office.The problem, at least in terms of optics for Harris, is that less than a year ago the freshman California senator was making similarly unrestrained attacks against the candidate she now heralds as the nation’s savior. In fact, the only time her presidential campaign had even a short-term surge was when she upbraided Biden during the first primary debate over his decades-ago fight against busing to desegregate schools and his fond recollection of being able to work with segregationist senators in his first years in office.As the only black woman on the stage, Harris said it was “hurtful” to hear him speak positively of those times in the 1970s. She described a little girl in California who was part of the second class to integrate her public schools and who was bused to school every day.“And that little girl was me,” Harris said to dramatic effect.Although she noted that she didn’t believe Biden is a racist, Harris used his comments as an example of why the Democratic Party still has a lot of reckoning to do when it comes to racial equality.Fast-forward to Monday’s virtual forum on the “coronavirus’ disproportionate impact on communities of color” and it was as if last year’s confrontation had never occurred.Harris heralded her former rival as the great equalizer when it comes to racial aspects of the pandemic — a champion of economic security, access to health care, food assistance and small business loans for black companies and churches — without a trace of the pain she had previously expressed about Biden’s past. She praised him for producing a detailed plan for expanding the nation’s testing capabilities, including in areas where racial disparities could lead to undercounting, ensuring that recovery funds and small business loans are doled out equitably across the country, as well as expanding unemployment insurance and food assistance benefits.“What Joe Biden is saying [is] there should be free testing and treatment for everyone, regardless of race. He is saying there should be an equitable allocation of recovery funds,” she said. “Joe always talks plain talk, he speaks straight — and what he’s saying is he wants to make sure every community gets enough so that it ends up being equal.”Rep. Marcia Fudge, an Ohio Democrat and past chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus, quickly backed her up. “If we do not elect Joe Biden, we will not recover in my lifetime,” the 68-year-old lawmaker warned.Political expediency during the general election is often the miracle cure for old primary wounds, perceived or real. In 2007, Biden’s cringeworthy comments about then-presidential candidate Barack Obama as “the first mainstream African American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy” evaporated into thin air when Obama tapped him as a running mate.But those remarks, however awkward and inappropriate, were made in the classic bumbling, back-handed way that Democrats have come to expect during Biden’s long tenure on the political scene.In contrast, Harris had engaged in a humiliating, full-frontal assault last year. Biden was clearly taken aback, telling the audience that her depiction mischaracterized his position. The moment went viral and led to a short-term boost in the polls for Harris.Despite that short-term gain, the dramatic confrontation immediately triggered questions about whether she had sidelined herself from ever joining Biden on the Democratic ticket should the early front-runner secure the nomination. Harris aides have openly said they’re not sure the moment was worth it, especially when their boss wasn’t able to fully explain the differences she had with Biden on busing.In an interview with CNN later that summer, Biden referred to Harris’ friendship with his late son, Beau, to explain why he was upset by the attack and didn’t see it coming.“She knew Beau,” Biden said. “She knows me.”Harris served as attorney general of California when Beau Biden held the same top legal post in Delaware, and the pair became friends while working on efforts to hold national banks responsible for the 2008 mortgage meltdown. Harris has since faced criticism for failing to speak out against then-Calif. Gov. Jerry Brown’s diversion of part of the state’s share of the $25 billion national settlement she helped negotiate, alongside Beau Biden.The issue pitted homeowners who suffered foreclosures against the big banks, with Harris and other attorneys general as referees, and there is still lingering resentment from those who lost out on the relief.“There were periods when I was taking heat, when Beau and I talked multiple times a day,” Harris wrote in her pre-campaign memoir, “The Truths We Hold.” “We had each other’s backs.”The two were close and Harris expressed deep public condolences to the Biden family on May 30 last year, the anniversary of Beau’s death.“Four years after his passing, I still miss him,” she wrote.Perhaps it was the years of banked goodwill, or Biden’s decades of experience with Washington opportunism, that has allowed him to move beyond the debate attack. At the start of the second Democratic debate in Detroit last summer, Biden good-naturedly joked to Harris, “Go easy on me, kid.”He has since said the two quickly recovered from the episode and have called each other often in the months since, sharing warm conversations and jokes. Both sides say they maintain a deep, mutual respect for the other.“I’m not good at keeping hard feelings,” Biden said in December when asked if he harbored any ill will over the June debate clash.After his Feb. 29 blowout victory in South Carolina, where the endorsement of elder statesmen Rep. Jim Clyburn helped him win 61% of black voters, both Harris and Sen. Cory Booker, who also campaign aggressively against Biden in the primary, quickly endorsed him. Booker, Harris, and Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer joined forces to campaign for Biden in Detroit in early March. After Harris opened the event, Biden bounded onstage and the two hugged, then held their hands in the air in solidarity.The question now is whether Harris would be the right VP choice to bolster Biden’s pandemic-cloistered campaign, whether she has the credibility and personal charisma to help carry him over the finish line in November.It’s clear she’s trying to make up for lost ground. After the hug in Detroit, Harris struck an emotional note. “I got to know Joe through Beau,” she told the crowd. “It’s a rare thing to see such a special relationship between a father and his son. It was an extraordinary relationship they had.”During the virtual forum Monday, Harris extolled Biden’s personal tragedies as having molded him into the right man for this moment.“He has a plan, he speaks from the heart, and understands people’s struggles, and he feels that struggle in a way that he always acts to take care of people and lift them up,” she concluded."
5289,New Twitter Censorship Rules Raise Transparency Questions,10.33,38.67,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/28/new_twitter_censorship_rules_raise_transparency_questions_143049.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-28,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"After years of being on the defensive over data breaches, privacy invasion, censorship and monopoly concerns, social media platforms are leveraging the current public health crisis to vastly expand and entrench their power in an ostensibly free society. Last week Facebook announced it was banning the use of its platform to organize many kinds of anti-lockdown protests, expanding its reach from the digital to the physical world. For its part, Twitter took the opportunity to sweepingly expand its censorship policy, heightening its role in deciding what constitutes “truth.”On Wednesday, Twitter announced that it was “broadening our guidance on unverified claims” and that, with respect to COVID-19-related posts, “unverified claims that have the potential to incite people to action … or cause widespread panic/social unrest may be considered a violation of our policies.” It cited this as an example of such now-banned posts: “the National Guard just announced that no more shipments of food will be arriving for two months — run to the grocery store ASAP and buy everything.”The company has been rolling out regular updates to its “acceptable speech” policies during the pandemic, steadily constraining ever further the kinds of thoughts and commentary it allows. Over the last few weeks alone, it has “broadened our definition of harm to address content that goes directly against guidance from authoritative sources of global and local public health information” and noted that “we may also apply the public interest notice in cases where world leaders violate the COVID-19 guidelines.” Similar to Facebook, it bans posts that “actively encourage people to not socially distance themselves” and adds that it also prohibits “denial of established scientific facts … or guidance from global and local health authorities.”What does all of this mean in practice and who does Twitter consider to be a source of authoritative “truth” when public health officials themselves have repeatedly gotten the most basic of details so wrong?The company declined to comment when asked whether tweets by news outlets about meat shortages and advising readers to rush to stores, or photos from ordinary users of widespread Tylenol shortages, thus encouraging people to buy before their own store runs out, would fall afoul of its “widespread panic” policy. Media coverage of pandemic-era shortages often cite analysts, anonymous company sources or reports from data firms that rarely are formally verified at the time, raising questions of how Twitter plans to arbitrate what counts as a “verified claim.”More troubling, Twitter has emerged as a go-to source for governments to spot emerging issues such as shortages and to understand “quarantine fatigue” responses among the public. If Twitter actively bans posts documenting shortages and other information that governments rely upon to make decisions, it could blind public officials to critical emerging changes.As for deciding whether a tweet “denies global or local health authority recommendations,” how does Twitter balance the fact that U.S. health officials have repeatedly been wrong in the assessments that formed their recommendations? For example, would tweets over the last four months urging Americans to wear face masks, in accordance with the recommendations of the international medical community, have been blocked by Twitter since they ran counter to the official stance of U.S. public health officials at the time?What about tweets pointing out the international consensus that asymptotic individuals were infectious even as U.S. officials repeatedly downplayed that conclusion? Given how much is still unknown about COVID-19 and how conflicting public health recommendations have been, how will Twitter decide what is “true” and what is “unverified”? And should a social media company really be making such momentous medical decisions in the first place?Asked all of these questions, a spokesperson said the company had no comment.Yet perhaps the most revealing commentary came when Twitter was asked why it believed it did not owe the public greater transparency regarding the censorship decisions it makes during a national medical emergency. Specifically, how does it create its rules? What experts does it turn to in crafting them? What is the review process to approve a new rule and why does the company not engage with the public more closely in formulating those rules?Twitter’s response: That it is transparent because it publishes periodic reports summarizing how often it enforces its rules. In other words, to Twitter, “transparency” means publicizing how often it acts on its rules, not greater visibility into how those rules come to be in the first place.In the end, the speed and scope with which social media platforms are redefining acceptable speech and allowable ideas, extending their reach into the physical world and arbitrating “truth,” remind us just how fragile democracy and free speech are as we cede an ever-greater portion of the public square to unaccountable private companies."
5290,The Viral Impact of Dirty Politics in Montana,13.0,38.67,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/27/the_viral_impact_of_dirty_politics_in_montana_143040.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-27,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"Coronavirus has infected the body politic just as it has infected hundreds of thousands of Americans. But whereas the virus takes advantage of average Americans to leave them weakened or dead, it is politicians who are taking advantage of the virus to try to damage or destroy their political opponents.We’ve seen that most obviously in the claims by Democrats that President Trump is responsible for the thousands of American deaths caused by the pandemic, but there have also been targeted attacks against other politicians. Most notably, a handful of senators were accused of enriching themselves by using “insider knowledge” to profit from stock trades involving companies impacted either positively or negatively by coronavirus. This would be laughable were it not so destructive. I have written at HeartlandDiaryUSA.com about the absurdity of thinking that you needed to be an “insider” to figure out that the virus which forced China to lock down Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, might be a threat to both the health and economic well-being of nations everywhere.Republican Sens. Richard Burr and Kelly Loeffler, among others, have been accused of making stock trades in mid-February that were supposedly informed by them getting closed-door briefings on the virus. The dubious idea is that they knew what was coming and no one else did, so they had some unfair advantage in trading. A quick look back at reporting from January disproves that notion. A story in the Daily Star linked by the Drudge Report on Jan. 22, for instance, noted that “billions could be at risk.” It’s not insider trading if it’s common knowledge.But that’s not the end of the story. Here in Montana, an even more far-fetched version of that specious accusation is playing out in the GOP primary election campaign for governor. The top candidate in the race is Rep. Greg Gianforte (pictured, at left), who is giving up his congressional seat for a second chance at moving into the governor’s mansion. (In 2016, he lost to Democrat Steve Bullock, who in the wake of a failure-to-launch presidential campaign is now challenging Republican Steve Daines for a Senate seat.)One of Gianforte’s two Republican opponents is Montana Attorney General Tim Fox (pictured, at center), who in a sign of desperation has taken a page out of the Democrats’ playbook and gone after Gianforte on trumped-up charges of insider trading. On April 9, Fox’s campaign manager, Jack Cutter, sent out a fundraising email claiming that “Greg is financing his gubernatorial campaign with profits derived from insider trading that capitalizes on the COVID-19 pandemic.”The irony, however, is that Fox’s complaint is actually that Gianforte made money off the virus crisis not with insider knowledge, but rather with knowledge that was in the public sphere. You can’t make this stuff up. Remember, the complaint against Burr was that he had made stock trades in mid-February that relied on his access to secret briefings available only to members of Congress. Yet the allegation against Gianforte, which originated with liberal Montana blogger Don Pogreba, is that the congressman “began his stock purchases on January 2, just days after the scope of the threat from the novel coronavirus started to become known.”Which is it? Was the danger of COVID-19 top secret until after mid-February? Or was it public knowledge on Jan. 2? You can’t have it both ways. Adding to the confusion is that the first human death from the virus wasn’t reported until Jan. 10. How could Gianforte have been profiteering a week before that even happened?It seems like the main complaint against both Burr and Gianforte is that they possibly made money while a lot of other investors lost money. But there is a huge difference between insider trading and wise investing. Just as I was smart enough in January to pull all my 401(k) retirement money out of equities and park it in a fund that invests in T-bills, so too I would hope that the people who lead our nation were smart enough to see the risks ahead. Losing money should not be a qualification for members of Congress, who after all are responsible for a budget of nearly $5 trillion.But that seems to be the point of this bogus allegation by Fox, who knows full well that Gianforte’s investments are all handled by an investment manager under a “blind investment agreement” that removes Gianforte from knowledge of investments till after the fact, when they are reported to the House of Representatives.That’s not good enough for Fox, who seems to be running more as a Marxist than a Republican. As the Helena Independent Record reported: “Fox’s campaign contends that the trades, regardless of who made them, could result in profit for Gianforte.”Whoa! A profit! How dare he! Even Pogreba, who originated the story that Gianforte had investments in companies that were doing work related to coronavirus, seemed shocked by Fox’s charge of “insider trading.”“It’s an incredible claim,” Pogreba wrote on his Montana Post website on April 10. “I’m not sure — and never suggested — that Gianforte is engaging in insider trading, which makes the Fox campaign claim all the more explosive. Do they have additional evidence that Gianforte has broken the law? Are they exaggerating his sins (which include greed and dishonesty, to be precise) for political effect? Is this just the last desperate swing of a campaign that has failed to convince Montana Republicans that Fox is conservative enough to win their favor?”The answers to those three questions are obvious. No, there isn’t any additional evidence. Yes, the charge was exaggerated for political effect, and for sure Fox is desperate. For the record, Gianforte didn’t receive a COVID-19 briefing as a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee until Feb. 26, nearly a month after President Trump restricted travel from China. Yet Gianforte’s investment manager was making the suspect stock purchases as early as Jan. 2. Under that timeline, it simply can’t be insider trading, and don’t forget that Gianforte is not allowed to consult with his broker at any time. Nor, in case you were wondering, is any member of Gianforte’s family or anyone acting on his behalf.Yet Cutter, who started the smear campaign on behalf of Fox by distorting Pogreba’s initial reporting into the phantom “insider trading” charge, was still pushing a fake narrative on April 15 when he told a reporter that “Congressman Gianforte has made no effort to stop the continued purchase of these profiteering stocks.”How ridiculous! If Gianforte could stop the purchase, or could in any way influence the direction of the investments, it wouldn’t be a “blind” investment agreement. As for profiteering, it should be noted that NV5 Global, which accounted for seven of the 13 stock purchases labeled as suspicious by Pogreba, plummeted in value during the time when Gianforte was supposed to be “profiteering.” According to Yahoo Finance on March 20, NV5 Global share price had “dived 51% in the last thirty days.”As for the fact that Gianforte was heavily invested in companies that had a footprint in matters related to coronavirus, that isn’t a red flag when you look more deeply. According to OpenSecrets.org, Gianforte had about $32 million in investments in 2018. Almost half of that was in communications and high-tech electronics. No surprise since Gianforte amassed his wealth as the founder of RightNow Technologies. But what is surprising, or at least highly revealing, is that nearly one-fourth of the remaining investments made in Gianforte’s name were in the health sector.Remember, this was in 2018, a full two years before the coronavirus crisis. Investing in companies like Pfizer, Roche Holdings, and Johnson & Johnson was typical of the investment strategy employed on behalf of Gianforte long before anyone had ever heard of COVID-19. There was no reason to expect that strategy to change after the virus had surfaced. And if you think about it, capital investments in such pharmaceutical companies is what makes it possible for them to engage in the vital work at hand — looking for tests, cures and vaccines to combat the “invisible enemy.”How can anyone interpret an investment in pharmaceuticals (especially through a blind investment agreement) as anything other than a vote of confidence in science and biotechnology? If Gianforte made a profit by supporting these companies, so too would all of America profit should their research prove successful at defeating the deadly scourge of coronavirus.For conservatives in Montana, it is disheartening to see Fox, the state’s top law enforcement official as attorney general, stoop to promoting stupid and self-negating allegations of wrongdoing against his primary opponent. If he were really concerned about integrity, Fox could have begun by firing his campaign manager for starting a malicious rumor that was intended to weaken his political opponent and could ultimately cost Republicans the governor’s mansion for the fifth election in a row.But since Cutter remains atop the Fox campaign, one has to assume that the attorney general endorses these tactics. If we hope to see a cure for dirty politics in Montana, it’s going to be up to the voters."
5291,China's Religious Persecution in the Time of Coronavirus,9.0,49.5,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/27/chinas_religious_persecution_in_the_time_of_coronavirus_143044.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-27,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"It’s a portrait of contrasts in the age of pandemic. In the United States, small but passionate protests have broken out in recent weeks as some workers and worshipers chafe at being quarantined -- even as most federal and state governments caution against full and abrupt re-openings.Meanwhile, in the People’s Republic of China, where the coronavirus originated, citizens live in abject fear over voicing the mildest of criticism about their government’s response to the outbreak and aftermath, including government actions designed to place ethnic and religious minorities in harm’s way.Among the abuses: Chinese authorities are continuing to operate some factories by forcing Uyghurs, Muslims from a Central Asian ethnic group, to fill in for workers sidelined by COVID-19. To groups monitoring religious freedom, this was merely the latest example of official persecution of the Uyghurs, predominantly Turkic-speaking Sunni Muslims who number more than 10 million and live in the northwest area of the country known as Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous region. Uyghurs consider Beijing as a colonizing power and have pushed for a separate homeland or, at least, greater autonomy for their region. In recent years, China has tightened its grip on the region, forcing at least 1 million Uyghurs into 85 identified detention camps.The pandemic has also increased levels of mistreatment against other groups. African residents of Guangzhou, a manufacturing hub, have been force-tested for the virus, evicted from their homes and hotels, and corralled into quarantined areas with few resources. Images on social media have showed groups of black residents sleeping on a sidewalk, visibly shaking from the cold and wearing surgical masks to protect themselves. Several African ambassadors wrote a letter to China’s foreign minister earlier this month complaining that these people were being mistreated and falsely blamed for the spread of the virus to China.“The Group of African Ambassadors in Beijing immediately demands the cessation of forceful testing, quarantine and other inhuman treatments meted out to Africans,” they wrote.Beijing has also used the pandemic as an excuse to crack down on churches that aren’t officially sanctioned by the government. In some regions, officials have removed crosses from Christian church rooftops on the pretext that religious symbols cannot be “higher” than the national flag. In December, as China’s began dealing with the coronavirus outbreak, church leaders reported that government officials told them the crosses were “too eye-catching” and would attract groups of people to gather, undermining the strict lockdowns in place.Pastor Jian Zhu, who was raised in China and now serves as the director of the China Institute at Lincoln Christian University in Illinois, said persecution against unsanctioned Christian churches in China is “now the worst” he has seen since the late 1970s. The systematic harassment, according to Zhu, has included asking neighbors to spy on one another as well as pressuring schoolteachers, professors and students to sign a statement denouncing their faith.“They are trying to eliminate Christianity from public life,” he told The Christian Post in mid-April. “Cameras are all over to watch church and Christians go to Sunday services. Families are threatened not to go to church or they will be punished or their relatives could be in trouble.”Since the reports about forcing Uyghurs into factories began leaking two months ago, China’s systematic efforts to cover up the origins of the coronavirus and sow disinformation about it have sparked international outrage. But neither that indignation, nor the stepped-up persecution of religious and ethnic minorities, stopped the United Nations’ Asia-Pacific group from selecting China to represent the region on the United Nations Human Rights Council Consultative Group. The consultative body consists of five member states tasked with screening applicants to become independent U.N. human rights experts.China’s selection on April 1 drew immediate condemnation from U.S. human rights advocates.“The Chinese government is one of the worst abusers of religious freedom and other human rights,” said Gary Bauer of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom, a bipartisan federal government entity that monitors international threats to religious freedom. In its 2019 annual report, USCIRF called on the Trump administration to impose targeted sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for severe religious freedom violations, especially Chen Quanguo, the current Communist Party secretary of Xinjiang region.Other Washington officials see the pandemic as a warning against the natural tendency by those with autocratic impulses to impose top-down, heavy-handed controls.Police in places as disparate as Kenya and India have beaten citizens avoiding curfew; nations such as Iran and North Korea are believed by health experts to have followed China’s example in vastly underreporting COVID-19 cases; and Philippines strongman Rodrigo Duterte has used the crisis to threaten declaring martial law.But the United States has not been immune from these impulses. Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer was widely criticized for a sweeping stay-at-home order that precluded residents from driving from one house to another and for closing off entire sections of large stores that sell gardening supplies, include plant seeds. And when President Trump said he had “absolute power” over states to determine how and when to re-open their governments, the backslash from both conservatives and liberals was fast and furious. The president quickly backtracked and has allowed governors to make their own decisions, even as Trump has publicly second-guessed Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp’s statewide re-opening of salons, gyms, and bowling alleys.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in early April warned that autocracies will use the crisis “to become more aggressive, deny people their rights,” and “lie more.” He said that “in the end, they do enormous harm to the people of their nation and put the rest of the world at risk as well.” In Washington, most of the fury at China so far has focused on the government’s delay and dissembling over the source and extent of the epidemic and its unseemly sway over the World Health Organization, which initially minimized the effects the outbreak. Former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, through her advocacy group Stand for America, last week launched a petition to Congress urging lawmakers to investigate Beijing for its role in the coronavirus crisis and pass measures to halt China’s influence in the U.S. and around the world.But China’s religious persecution amid the pandemic is also spurring congressional scrutiny.Sen. Ted Cruz, who has sought to shed a light on the China’s oppression of religious minorities and political dissidents throughout his career, said he planned to amplify the need for several bills he has written aimed at punishing China for the forced Uyghur labor, along with other measures addressing Beijing’s ongoing suppression of medical experts, journalists and political dissidents.“Those atrocities must be confronted, not just for their own sake but because, as we have now seen through the global spread of COVID-19, they are a direct threat to America’s national security and global public health,” Cruz spokeswoman Jessica Skaggs told RealClearPolitics. “Once we defeat this pandemic, Sen. Cruz will continue fighting to hold China accountable for its religious persecution of minorities and its broader repression on free expression and medical information.”Rep. Michael McCaul, the ranking GOP member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said China’s and the WHO’s handling of the coronavirus crisis enabled a regional epidemic to become a global pandemic  resulting in innumerous deaths in China and around the world. McCaul, along with 16 other House Republicans, sent a letter to the White House last week asking the president to condition future funding of the WHO on Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus’ resignation.“This malfeasance is another example of the CCP’s treatment of their own people and reminds us this is the same regime who puts millions of their own citizens in ‘concentration camps’ and uses them for forced labor,” he said.“The international community cannot let these appalling abuses go unpunished,” he told RCP. “We must work together to hold the CCP accountable for these egregious human rights violations, especially amid this public health emergency that they exacerbated.” This is not solely a Republican concern. Rep. James McGovern, who chairs the bipartisan Congressional-Executive Commission on China, is calling on the international community to investigate Beijing’s efforts to repress religious and ethnic minorities in the midst of a pandemic. McGovern in March sponsored a bill that would bar the U.S. from importing any goods made in the Xinjiang factories and has urged all American companies, including Amazon, Nike, Apple and Calvin Klein, to investigate their supply chains in China and cease operation if they cannot definitively rule out the use of forced labor. Republican Sen. Marco Rubio wrote a similar Senate bill.“Forcing Uyghurs and others to work in factories while the risk of infection is high, tearing down Christian symbols and crosses, or condoning discrimination against African migrants is completely unacceptable an should be roundly condemned by the administration and investigated by the international community,” the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement to RCP.“The virus exposed what we already knew: The Chinese government is all too willing to violate the human rights of the Chinese people, and its policies pose a real risk to the world’s health as well,” McGovern added."
5292,How the N.Y. Times Swung at Fox News -- and Missed,20.5,42.0,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/26/how_the_ny_times_swung_at_fox_news_--_and_missed_143039.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-26,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"Not content to accuse Donald Trump of killing Americans with his incompetence during the coronavirus pandemic, Democrats and their allies in the media have turned their fire on the president’s supporters as well. Those with “blood on their hands,” to use the smear du jour, range from Republican governors reluctant to issue quarantine orders to Michigan autoworkers protesting being locked out their jobs. And, of course, Fox News.The latest salvo came in the form of a New York Times column with a blaring headline: “A Beloved Bar Owner Was Skeptical About the Virus. Then He Took a Cruise.”Accompanied by a family photograph, the story recounts the sad fate of Joe Joyce, a popular 74-year-old family man and proprietor of a Brooklyn saloon who died on April 9 of COVID-19. So why did he and his wife travel to Spain on a cruise ship? According to the Times’ piece by Ginia Bellafante, they sailed to Barcelona because President Trump and Sean Hannity assured them it was safe:On March 1, Joe Joyce and his wife, Jane, set sail for Spain on a cruise, flying first to Florida. His adult children -- Kevin, Eddie and Kristen Mider -- suggested that the impending doom of the coronavirus made this a bad idea. Joe Joyce was 74, a nonsmoker, healthy; four years after he opened his bar he stopped drinking completely. He didn’t see the problem. “He watched Fox, and believed it was under control,’’ Kristen told me.Ginia Bellafante is friends with Eddie Joyce, which explains why she wrote in the first-person, and also why she is angry about this man’s death. She feels for his children. She is grieving his loss. Her feelings are genuine and should be honored, not censured. She is also a columnist, not a straight news reporter, and is allowed some latitude in tone. But not granted unlimited leeway -- and none at all with the facts.Her narrative included the Times’ obligatory virtue-signaling, complete with phrases such as “right wing hate,” along with a presumption that Republicans are less tolerant people than Democrats. Adhering to the old courthouse rule about not impeaching your own witness, however, she pointed out that Joe Joyce was the opposite of a racist. Joyce was also supportive of a gay patron of his bar who had AIDS, Times readers were told. And that’s not all: “He supported groups that raised money for food banks and organizations that helped battered women. He worked helping disabled children.”If it wasn’t for the headline, a reader might have thought this was going to be a column about how the liberal media unfairly stereotypes conservatives. No such luck. Joe Joyce is the protagonist because he’s the good man who died because he found Fox News more credible than his own children. But the evidence in support of that story line is thin. His children “suggested” the timing of the trip was problematic? That’s fairly weak tea. Also, as the column acknowledged, it’s unknown whether Joe Joyce contracted the virus on the cruise ship or in Barcelona -- or in New York. He returned to Brooklyn on March 14 and spent March 15 at his bar. New York’s lockdown went into effect at 8 p.m. Monday, March 16.Eleven days later, while at his weekend place in New Hampshire, Joyce was very sick. He died on April 9, the day before one his bartenders also succumbed to the virus. Searching for answers, his daughter focused on Trump and his favorite network.Joe Joyce's daughter believes Sean Hannity influenced her father to go on a cruise, but the Fox host's comment about COVID-19 came after the ship departed.AP Photo/Jeff Roberson, File“He watched Fox, and believed it was under control,’’ his daughter told The Times, citing as an example a complaint from Sean Hannity that the Americans were being “unnecessarily’’ frightened. She added, “If Trump had gone on TV with a mask on and said, ‘Hey this is serious,’ I don’t think he would have gone.”His daughter’s emotions are understandable, but the timeline is off. For one thing, Hannity made his observation the first week in March, after the Joyces’ cruise was at sea, so it had nothing to do with their decision to leave. Their ship left port in Fort Lauderdale on Sunday, March 1; Joe and Jane had flown to Florida over the weekend – the last weekend in February. So, yes, if Trump had given a national address wearing a mask in late February, that would have been impressive leadership. It also would have been at odds with what the nation’s top infectious disease experts -- not to mention leading Democrats in New York and elsewhere -- were advising. It wasn’t even what the New York Times, or Ginia Bellafante were saying.Here is a timeline for the week leading up to Joe Joyce’s ill-fated vacation:Feb. 24: Appearing in San Francisco’s Chinatown neighborhood to alleviate tourists’ fears, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stands at close quarters with city leaders and says, “To everyone: You should come to Chinatown! Precautions have been taken by our city. We know there’s a concern for tourism – throughout the world – but we think it’s very safe to be in Chinatown and hope that others will come.”Feb. 25: Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, raises the specter of cities and towns beginning to plan for social distancing measures such as “dividing school classes into smaller groups of students or closing schools altogether.” Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, adds that “these are the kinds of things you want to think of” – but not do just yet. “You need to do nothing different than you’re already doing,” he says.Feb. 26: Trump puts Vice President Mike Pence “in charge” of coordinating the administration’s coronavirus response (while claiming inaccurately that “we have quarantined those infected and those at risk”). In New York, Gov. Andrew Cuomo says, “I want to keep the perspective right. Yes, we’re preparing, but [it’s] not a situation that should cause undue fear.”The same day Mayor Bill de Blasio reassures the citizenry that hospital beds would be plentiful even if the epidemic hit New York. “We’ve got a long time to ramp up if we ever had anything like that,” he said. “So, the capacity we have right now is outstanding given the challenge we’re facing right now.”Feb. 27: De Blasio appears on “Morning Joe” to boast that New York City has “literally 1,200 hospital beds that we can turn on if we need to if it turns into something bigger,” adding, “I think this country is going to be good.” The same day, he appears with Billy Idol as part of a campaign against drivers who idle their engines in the city. At the event, the 1980s rocker worked the rope line, shaking hands.Feb. 28: Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer lambastes Trump for focusing more on political rallies than on seeking “solutions to combat the spread of coronavirus.” Schumer is responding to Trump’s claim during a South Carolina rally that Democrats are “politicizing” the epidemic – efforts he labels their “new hoax.” Some wags quickly reprise an earlier Schumer tweet characterizing Trump’s ban on flights from China as “just an excuse to further his ongoing war against immigrants.”Gov. Andrew Cuomo said in late February that the spread of coronavirus was ”not a situation that should cause undue fear.”Cuomo via APFeb. 29: Cuomo says trying to predict the impact of the coronavirus is “like looking at the weather map when they have different tracks for a hurricane [that] could hit Florida or could hit Washington or could hit New York or miss everybody and go out to sea.”March 1: First case of COVID-19 is confirmed in New York.Misdiagnosing the ThreatThat timeline is only a snapshot. The full picture is more complex. But if you lived in New York City in 2020 and paid attention to this burgeoning story you were subjected to a steady barrage of misinformation -- especially from your own mayor -- throughout January and February. Actually, Hizzoner sounded eerily like another blustery native New Yorker.“We have it totally under control,” President Trump assured his fellow Americans on Jan. 22. “We pretty much shut it down coming in from China,” he added on Feb. 2. “Looks like by April, you know, in theory, when it gets a little warmer, it miraculously goes away,” he said on Feb. 10. “I hope that’s true, but we’re great in our country.” The next day, Trump told Geraldo Rivera, “In our country, we have basically 132 cases and most of those people are recovering and some cases fully recovered. So, it’s actually less.” In Feb. 24, Trump tweeted, “The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health [Organization] have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me!”Yes, Trump often sounded foolish. But this not the fault of Fox News any more than MSNBC can be blamed for the cluelessness of Bill de Blasio and his administration during the same period. On Jan. 24, the mayor assured New Yorkers that they could be infected “only through prolonged exposure” to someone with the virus. On Feb. 2, he said it was “clear” that “you don’t get it from a surface.” That same day, his health commissioner tweeted, “As we gear up to celebrate the Lunar New Year in NYC, I want to assure New Yorkers that there is no reason for anyone to change their holiday plans, avoid the subway, or certain parts of the city because of coronavirus.” On Feb. 9, de Blasio attended the Lunar Festival, mingling among the crowd with other leading Democrats, including Schumer, with hardly a mask in sight. “We know in China, so many of our loved ones are facing the challenges of the coronavirus, but we stand together,” de Blasio said. On Feb. 13, in an appearance on “Morning Joe,” he said the virus “should not stop you from going about your life.” The mayor added, “It should not stop you from going to Chinatown and going out to eat. I am going to do that today myself.”This tenor didn’t really change on March 2, when de Blasio and Gov. Cuomo held a joint press conference to discuss the first confirmed case in New York. “In this situation, the facts defeat fear, because the reality is reassuring,” said Cuomo. “It is deep-breath time.”“We have a lot of information now, information that is actually showing us things that should give us more reason to stay calm and go about our lives,” added the mayor -- who then reiterated his idiosyncratic theories about the communicable nature of COVID-19. “This is not, so far, something that you get through casual contact,” he asserted. “There has to be some prolonged exposure. And I think it’s really important to get that information out to all New Yorkers.”New York Mayor Bill de Blasio played down worries about COVID-19 in early March, saying, ”Life is going on pretty normally right now. We want to encourage that.”AP Photo/Carlos OsorioFor some reason, De Blasio kept talking this way even into the second week of March, telling New Yorkers on March 9 “to go about your business,” and assuring them in another “Morning Joe” appearance, this one on March 10 -- as the Joyces’ cruise was nearing its end -- “For the vast majority of New Yorkers, life is going on pretty normally right now. We want to encourage that.” He added yet again that there was a “misperception” that the disease “hangs in the air waiting to catch you. No, it takes direct person-to-person contact.” As late as March 16, hours before gyms, bars, and restaurants closed, de Blasio worked out at his local YMCA.Let’s be fair: It’s easy to criticize in hindsight. Who knew in late February that within two months, the United States would be closing in on 900,000 confirmed cases of the virus, with nearly 50,000 Americans dead, and the U.S. economy in free fall during an unprecedented lockdown that closed everything from auto manufacturing to Major League Baseball? I certainly didn’t. But neither did the New York Times.As others have noted, the Times greeted the president’s order curtailing travel from China by publishing columns opining that travel bans do more harm than good. Skepticism that the threat was real extended to other established media outlets -- and to Ginia Bellafante herself. On Feb. 28, a day before Joe and Janet Joyce left for their cruise, the Times published a piece she wrote with a headline that predicted, accurately, that the virus was coming to New York and asking the question: “Should We Panic or Shrug?” That column was nuanced and thoughtful. Her tweet the night before was less prescient: “I fundamentally don’t understand the panic: incidence of the disease is declining in China. Virus is not deadly in the vast majority of cases. Production and so on will slow down and will obviously rebound.”It was the unearthing of that tweet that made Bellafante a target, her detractors’ point being that if Joe Joyce had listened to her, instead of Fox News, he still would have left on his cruise. It’s a fair criticism, but there are broader principles at play here.The first is that the “war on Fox News,” which is not new and was always troubling, has metastasized into something quite dangerous, which is a well-funded and highly organized effort at systematic censorship of conservative views. It was first launched in its present form after Barack Obama moved into the White House. You’d think that a freshman senator with no executive experience who won the presidency by 9 million votes would be more magnanimous to the lone major media outlet that didn’t fawn over him. But you would be wrong. Liberals ranging from Louis Menand of The New Yorker to Kirsten Powers (now with CNN) tried to give the new administration – and its fellow progressives – a remedial course in the beauty of the First Amendment. It didn’t take, and a decade later significant portions of the mainstream press are among the anti-free speech vigilantes. This is not merely incongruous, it’s a threat to free speech and to self-government itself.There is a second troubling aspect to the ongoing “war on Fox News,” and it’s this: The legacy media is so hostile to Donald Trump it has trouble getting the basic facts right, let alone paint a complete picture of his presidency. Some no longer even try. This failing, this open partisanship, is more to blame than Fox News for conservatives’ mistrust of what they read and hear from traditional news outlets. In his crude way at that South Carolina “hoax” rally, the president said what millions of Americans were thinking: They tried to get him on Russia. Then on Ukraine. Now they’re after him on this.We in the media have fed that cynicism. While there are many valid reasons for the press to judge this president harshly -- including for the uneven and self-indulgent way he’s handled the current crisis -- the “Resistance” brand of journalism veers into uncharted territory. By openly disparaging the 63 million Americans who voted for Trump, these news organizations are begging those people not to watch or read them. They are essentially writing them off as customers. They have embraced a different business model: In the parlance of politics, they are appealing “to their base.” It’s a model, ironically, borrowed from Fox News. Personally, I think it’s an odious way to cover the civic affairs of this country, unpatriotic even.Perhaps this approach makes fiduciary sense, but if that’s the way they choose to play it, news organizations should have the decency not to blame the customers they’ve deliberately alienated for their own deaths."
5293,"Trump: TikTok Will Be ""Out of Business In The U.S."" Unless China Sells It By September 15",8.17,45.83,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2020/08/03/trump_tiktok_will_be_out_of_business_in_the_us_without_china_selling_it.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-03,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"President Trump said Monday that the Chinese-owned social media app TikTok is ”too big and too invasive” to be owned by a rival country. Trump said it will be ”out of business in the United States” on September 15th unless it is sold to an American company, mentioning that he had spoken to Microsoft about the sale.Trump added that a ”very substantial portion of [the sale price] is going to have to come into the Treasury” because ”it is a great asset, but it is not a great asset in the United States” without his approval.”So, it will close down on Sept. 15 unless Microsoft or somebody else is able to buy it and work out a deal, an appropriate deal, so the Treasury of the United States gets a lot of money. A lot of money, OK?””Look, it can’t be controlled, for security reasons, by China. Too big, too invasive, and it can’t be. And here’s the deal, I don’t mind if, whether it’s Microsoft or somebody else (a big company a secure company, a very American company) buys it,” he said."
5294,Postal Justice Warriors Undermine Election Confidence,21.0,28.25,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/08/18/postal_justice_warriors_undermine_election_confidence_143985.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-08-18,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"If you want a barometer for where we are as a country, consider this: Rioters can topple statues of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson and odds are good local police will be ordered to stand down. Remove a neighborhood mailbox for ordinary reasons, and well, that’s such a potent symbol of supposed U.S. government tyranny that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will convene hearings about the “the sabotage of the Postal Service and members of Congress will openly suggest arresting the postmaster general.As usual, the current hysteria all started because Donald Trump Said Something. In an interview on Fox Business last Thursday, the president said he opposed $25 billion in emergency funding for the U.S. Postal Service. “They need that money in order to make the post office work, so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,” Trump said.The president has long maintained without much evidence that mail-in voting is easily susceptible to fraud, notwithstanding the fact that he’s voted by mail. Whether he meant his comment as some kind of threat, didn’t know what he was talking about, or was just idly bloviating is hard to parse. Later that day he told reporters if Democrats agree to a deal on coronavirus funding, “the money they need for the mail-in ballots would be taken care of. If we agree to it. That doesn’t mean we’re going to agree to it.”At least one journalist, liberal columnist Bill Scher, urged his colleagues to pump the brakes in response to Trump’s seemingly inflammatory statements. “We should be very precise with our language on this subject. Trump is saying here he opposes extra money in any stimulus bill to aid mail voting since he doesn't want universal mail voting,” Scher pointed out. “He is NOT copping to purposefully slowing mail delivery to prevent ballots from counting.”Last year, the post office delivered 471 million pieces of mail on an average day. Even if every one of the America’s 153 million registered voters cast their ballots by mail, the Postal Service wouldn’t miss a beat. Yet, the media, pundit class, and the highest levels of the Democratic Party responded to Trump by embracing a full-blown conspiracy theory about how he was deliberately sabotaging the post office.“I wonder if you're outside trying to hold down your mailboxes. They’re going around literally with tractor-trailers picking up mailboxes,” Joe Biden said Friday. “You oughta go online and check out what they're doing in Oregon. I mean, it's bizarre!”A grand total of 30 mailboxes have been removed in Portland and Eugene, Ore., in places where the post office says there were multiple mailboxes. The volume of mail has been declining for decades, and the USPS has been acting accordingly. In 2016, while Joe Biden was vice president, the agency announced it had removed 14,000 mailboxes around the country in the previous five years.Since removing thousands of mailboxes happened on Biden’s watch, by his logic the Obama administration was trying to impede elections.  As a conspiracy, that makes about as much sense as implying that Trump personally ordered the removal of 30 mailboxes in a state he lost by 11 percentage points in 2016 – a state, incidentally, in which every vote has been cast by mail for decades.If Trump had uttered a statement that nutty, it would be greeted by a chorus of eye-rolling, newspaper fact checks, and an online onslaught of hysteria. Because it was the Democrats’ nominee, on Friday the post office announced it is suspending the planned removal of superfluous mailboxes in 18 states, even though there’s zero reason to believe it would impact the election.The mailbox conspiracy has been augmented by another. The post office has also gotten rid of some of its big, expensive mail-sorting machines. This can only mean one thing. “We know Trump is trying to destroy USPS by having [Postmaster General Louis] DeJoy remove sorting machines, cut back hours and increase the cost of stamps for mail in ballots,” tweeted MSNBC contributor and journalism professor Jason Johnson.We know this? Since when? Johnson’s Chicken Little imitation represents the convergence of two conspiracy theories: One is that mail-sorting machines, like mailboxes, are being removed to help Trump in November; the other is that DeJoy, a GOP fundraiser, is Trump’s puppet. On the first point, Johnson simply has no idea what he’s talking about. Yes, it’s true that the post office has apparently removed or had plans to soon remove 19 mail sorting facilities from five processing facilities. The USPS has further plans to remove 502 additional machines out of nearly 5,000 currently in operation.However, Vice obtained a document showing “these changes were in the works before Louis DeJoy, a top Trump donor and Republican fundraiser, became postmaster general.” Again, removing mail sorting machines is hardly unprecedented. In 2000 USPS processed 103 billion pieces of first-class mail. By 2017, that figure was down to 54 billion. Aside from an uptick in package delivery, the overall volume of mail the post office is delivering is projected to decline well into the future.The fact that a presidential appointee is a political donor is hardly unprecedented. Nor is it evidence that he’s up to no good. DeJoy spent over 30 years as a top-level executive at logistics companies, so he seems more than qualified for the job. Evidence suggests he’s making necessary changes at an agency that needs to adapt to a world where email and private delivery services aren’t going away. Further, though coronavirus has presented unique challenges, the post office is supposed to raise its own revenue.Trump’s problematic comments are what they are, but what really lies behind the sudden emergence of millions of online Postal Justice Warriors raging at Trump is a deeper anxiety. The left, which prides itself on pushing for expanded ballot access, is choosing to believe there’s a conspiracy afoot rather than acknowledge the push to rapidly expand mail-in balloting has resulted in disastrous problems.One in five ballots were initially rejected in New York’s recent mail-in congressional elections and it took two months of counting votes to declare a winner. In 31 municipal elections New Jersey held in June, done entirely by mail, nearly 10% of all ballots were rejected – and four people were indicted for fraud, including an elected official in the state’s third largest city. (The Washington Post ran an almost comical article pretending this fraud in New Jersey was no big deal.) In June, Clark County, Nev., saw 223,000 mail-in ballots returned as undeliverable – only 305,000 total votes were cast in the election. These kinds of problems portend disastrous things for counting the vote in November.In 2016 it was Russia, and now in 2020 it’s the post office. Partisan, media-fueled conspiracies designed to delegitimize the results can’t be a feature of every election. Unfortunately, the theatrics of the upcoming congressional hearings over the U.S. Postal Service are sure to provoke even more sensational media coverage at a time when we most need a voice of reason."
5295,6 Biden Lies About Trump's COVID Response,24.0,31.33,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/10/6_biden_lies_about_trumps_covid_response.html,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-10,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"Joe Biden has struggled to remain relevant since he announced his presidential campaign in April 2019. That task became a lot more difficult since the outbreak of coronavirus.Before his campaign finally acknowledged the crisis, Team Biden was already limiting public appearances. From 10-minute campaign “rallies” to scripted television interviews, Biden was doing his best to run a campaign without appearing in public.When the establishment media was still working around the clock to save Biden’s campaign from Bernie Sanders, that plan was working. However, once 24/7 coverage transitioned to COVID-19, Biden remained stuck in his basement bunker, out of sight and out of mind.His solution to this problem? Attack President Trump’s response to coronavirus with no regard for the truth.Here are Joe Biden’s six most egregious COVID-19 lies:1. President Trump called coronavirus a hoaxEditing President Trump out of context is Democrats’ favorite way to exploit this national emergency for political purposes. Biden’s campaign took two separate statements made by the president at a rally to make it look like he said, “Coronavirus, this is their new hoax.” If you go through the transcript of the president’s statements that night, it is clear that it never happened. President Trump rightfully said the politicization of the crisis is a hoax, just like the Russia witch hunt and the impeachment charade. The Washington Post even awarded Biden four Pinocchios for manipulating the video. But President Trump never said, and never would say, the disease itself is a hoax.2. The Trump administration rejected WHO coronavirus test kits During the March 15 presidential debate, Biden asserted the Trump administration “refused to get coronavirus testing kits from the World Health Organization,” while attacking the president for his handling of the COVID-19 response. The truth? WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris said, “No discussion occurred between WHO and CDC about WHO providing COVID-19 tests to the United States.” How could President Trump reject something that was never offered?3. Trump eliminated entities responsible for global health security and biodefenseOn March 19, Biden tweeted, “The Obama-Biden Administration set up the White House National Security Council Directorate for Global Health Security and Biodefense to prepare for future pandemics like COVID-19. Donald Trump eliminated it.” This characterization, however, completely distorts what happened. After President Trump took office, the NSC established the counterproliferation and biodefense directorate, which included global health and biodefense. Tim Morrison, who ran the new directorate, claimed this change made America’s biodefense response even stronger.4. Trump made no effort to get medical professionals to China At the end of March, during an interview with Anderson Cooper, Biden said, “You should get into China and get our experts there. We have the best in the world. Get them in so we know what is actually happening. There was no effort to do that.” However, on January 6, the Trump administration began offering to send a CDC team to China, one week after China publicly acknowledged the virus. On January 7, the CDC set up its coronavirus incident management system before the first death was reported and while China was still claiming there was no evidence the virus could spread from human to human. And on January 8, CDC representatives visited Wuhan.5. Trump told governors they were on their own in getting medical equipmentDuring a CNN town hall, Joe Biden said President Trump told governors they were on their own in getting medical equipment. The problem? That’s not what the president said. Although many liberal news outlets ran with the first half of President Trump’s quote, “Respirators, ventilators, all of the equipment — try getting it yourselves,” the second half of the quote clearly said, “[The federal government] will be backing you, but try getting it yourselves. Point of sales, much better, much more direct if you can get it yourself.” Biden knew about the entire quote nine days before he repeated the lie on national television.6. Trump slashed the Centers for Disease Control budgetDuring an interview on ABC’s “This Week” in early March, Joe Biden asserted. “They’ve cut the — the Centers for Disease Control. They’ve cut the funding for — they’ve tried to cut the funding for NIH, the National Institute of Health.” He recently doubled down on his argument on Twitter. It’s important to note, however, that the Obama administration tried to cut the CDC’s budget five out of its eight years in the White House. In reality, the CDC’s budget is 7% larger now than under President Obama’s final years in office.History proves Joe Biden’s failed pandemic responses. While he likes to tout his leadership with handling the 2014 Ebola crisis for how he would lead the country through COVID-19, many former Obama officials have said Biden was not at the center of the Ebola response. Additionally, during the 2009 H1N1 crisis, administration officials repeatedly had to walk back false or misleading statements Biden gave about the virus. There is no good reason for Joe Biden to consistently lie to the American public. Perhaps it’s more of his senior moments that prove he has no concept of reality. Or maybe it’s just a failed attempt to stay visible during this crisis.No matter the rationale, Biden continues to remind voters every day that he is unfit to be president."
5296,Did Ron DeSantis Make the Right Call?,12.67,29.67,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/09/did_ron_desantis_make_the_right_call_142905.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-09,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"The COVID-19 pandemic has been accompanied by wrenching images, from previously healthy people hooked up to ventilators to photos of normally packed plazas and boulevards standing almost empty. But in the United States, perhaps none have been so widely shared – and derided -- as pictures of college students partying on then still-open beaches in Florida, celebrating spring break. As one partier infamously put it on March 18: “If I get corona, I get corona. At the end of the day, I’m not gonna let it stop me from partying.”All of this led to outrage on social media, along with loud demands that Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis close the beaches and put spring break effectively out of business. The governor refused. This has led to confident predictions that Florida had been seeded with coronavirus cases and was likely to emerge as the next hot spot.There’s more to be said about the dangers of overconfident predictions – among both professionals and pundits. We should also remember that the story of this pandemic is hardly written yet; we’re still in the opening chapters. But for now, the data don’t seem to support a spring break-fueled explosion in the Sunshine State. Even if it is too early to give a definitive answer, the answer to the question right now isn’t as clear as I had expected it would be three weeks ago.So what do we actually see in the data (which are admittedly imperfect, about which more below)? If spring break was really creating an epidemic in Florida, we should expect to see a “bending of the curve” – in the wrong direction – starting to emerge about five days after spring break. This curve-bending should also be more severe than what we see occurring in most other states, assuming that what Florida did was uniquely dangerous.I’ve taken the data from the indispensable Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering dashboard, which tracks outbreaks of the virus by nation, state and county. The data are current as of April 7, 2020. I’ve then traced the number of reported cases by state dating back to March 15, a few days before the spring break stories broke. This is useful because cases that were seeded by spring break partiers largely should have presented by now as well as many of the second-order transmissions.As you can see, New York and, to a lesser extent, New Jersey dominate the caseload in the United States. You may not be able to read the state names in the bottom right (click on the chart to enlarge it), but Florida is in the cluster well beneath New York and New Jersey. Whatever else we might say about Florida, it isn’t the next New York, at least not yet.We can see this better if we eliminate New York and New Jersey from the chart. We’ll also place the states outside of the cluster with Florida in the background.As you can see, Florida isn’t doing anything unusual here; it’s tracking other states in its cluster, including ones that aren’t being heavily criticized for their policies, such as Pennsylvania, Illinois and California. Things get a bit grainy on the left side of the chart – maybe Florida was actually well toward the bottom of state infections and then surged? No, not so much:This chart traces the ranking over time of the states. The states with the 10 most cases as of April 7 are highlighted. This allows us to see whether a state has surged relative to other states. As you can see, the data are pretty noisy as of mid-March, when small changes in the number of cases a state had could have a substantial impact on whether it had the 30th most cases or 40th most.Regardless, Florida’s relative position has been remarkably stable during this time period. It has fluctuated between having the fifth most cases (multiple times) and the ninth most cases (March 16, 25, and 28). Regardless, if you want to know what a spring break surge might look like, check out Louisiana (which goes from 41st in cases to fifth over this time period, possibly due to Mardi Gras) and Michigan (which goes from 43rd to third, for who knows what reason). So far, at least, the trend in Florida isn’t consistent with an exploding caseload.Even this might not be fair to Florida. It is, after all, the third most populous state in the nation. We’d expect it to have more cases than, say, Wyoming, even if it were doing a good job containing the virus. We can redo the above charts examining cases per million residents:On a per capita basis, we see a bit more separation. New York, New Jersey, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Connecticut and Michigan stand out as states with caseloads increasing at unusual rates. Florida, however, is buried in the middle of the pack. We can see this better by removing the preceding six states.Florida is wedged between Nevada and Mississippi, along with Idaho. Again, we’re not seeing the sort of exponential growth that we would expect to see had the media meltdown over spring break been fully justified. Finally, after fluctuating wildly early on (at a time where a fraction of a case per million could move a state more than 10 ranks), Florida has stabilized in the middle of the pack in terms of rank.Overall, Florida (so far) doesn’t seem to be showing the sort of unusual acceleration that we would expect if it were really en route to becoming the next New York.Having said that, this article is headlined with a question -- for a couple of reasons. First, this pandemic is not over. Florida could explode tomorrow. It’s probably too early to answer the question, but we should at least be willing to contemplate it.  Second, there are reasons to push back against the above analysis. We turn to those reasons now, but they illustrate a couple of broader points about the way we should think, and write, about the pandemic. For one thing, some critics suggest that these numbers mostly reflect a low level of testing in Florida. To put things in perspective, when South Korea was the envy of the world for its testing prowess, it was testing 10,000 people per day and had tested a total of around 250,000 people. That would translate to testing about 64,000 people per day in the United States (which has about 6½ times the population of South Korea) and a total of about 1.6 million Americans. As of today, according to the COVID tracking project, the United States has performed over 2 million tests and is testing around 137,000 people per day. Even this doesn’t tell the entire story as some states have had almost 80% of their tests performed in private labs.One can argue about these statistics, just as one can assert that the United States should still be doing better. But if your image of America is of a country flying blind with no testing, as was more or less the case for much of March, you’re in need of an update. Regardless, Florida’s data probably aren’t corrupted by a dearth of testing, as the differences among states in testing rates aren’t that great. The overall utility of this approach may be questionable, as states with higher levels of sickness would request more tests, but it’s the best we have. Here’s the percentage of the population tested in each state.Half of all states have tested between 0.45% and 0.86% of the population – a very narrow band. The overall range is just 1.5%. Florida’s hasn’t tested the most people in the country, but it hasn’t tested the fewest either. It’s tested a larger share than states generally recognized as doing a good job with the virus, such as Ohio and California. It’s tested more than states with large outbreaks, such as Michigan. Overall, it seems hard to explain away the fact that New York currently has 11 times as many cases per capita as Florida on the grounds that New York has tested three times as many people per capita as Florida. Nonetheless, a friend I know and trust (and who has taught me a lot about this outbreak) suggests that beachgoing college students have gone back home after spring break ended and have seeded their states with this nasty virus. This probably happened, at least to some extent, and my point isn’t that there were zero costs associated with letting spring break move forward. But it seems unlikely that the people who infected vacationers in Florida wouldn’t have also infected native Floridians and other locals on the beach, including bartenders, hotel staff, and so forth. That, after all, is the storyline about how spring break was supposed to create an explosion in Florida. Some of this probably occurred, but for whatever reason, it hasn’t yet led to a  Florida explosion.You can look at the locations where the virus is picking up in Florida and infer that the counties are also spring break hotspots -- though you would presumably have to explain the large number of cases in Sumter County (The Villages) via a different mechanism -- but these are also the more urbanized areas that typify viral spread in other states. We’d expect Miami-Dade to have an outsized number of cases even without spring break. These are also, incidentally, places where New Yorkers fleeing the city were landing, which makes it all the more surprising that Florida isn’t following New York’s trajectory (yet).  Regardless, the variation in cases among counties in Florida isn’t that large; no county yet has more than 10 cases per 10,000 residents, with most of the counties with at least one case clustered between two and five cases per 10,000 residents.  Incidentally, Volusia County, which includes Daytona Beach, is on the lower end of that range even though it didn’t close its beaches until Friday.There were also reasons from the start to be skeptical of the spring break explosion storyline: for example, that DeSantis had already banned gatherings in excess of 10 people. Most of the infamous pictures of crowded beaches were taken from far away, but if you look closely most of the clusters of people aren’t really that close. Perhaps most importantly, there’s evidence that heat slows the spread of the virus. If you had to have people not socially distancing, a hot, sunny beach without smooth surfaces and with lots of salt water is probably a good place to have it happen. Of course, part of the problem with spring break isn’t what happens on the beaches – indeed the worst social distancing violations probably happen off the beaches. But the point isn’t that there were zero transmissions during spring break.  It’s simply that we don’t see the out-of-control transmission some expected.Which brings me to my final point. In response to this information, a person might argue that even if Florida didn’t get a New York-style explosion in cases, it probably has more cases than if it had closed down the beaches and theme parks earlier. I’m inclined to agree. But I’m not sure that avoiding what seems to be at best a fairly marginal (for now) increase in cases beyond what the state would have suffered is clearly worth the damage it would have done to local businesses by cutting off spring break. In other words, DeSantis might have gotten the cost-benefit right.To be clear, I support most of the social distancing that has been imposed (I think the jury is still out on school closures). I don’t think the cure is worse the disease right now. Analogies to the flu are too flippant; left unchecked this virus seems certain to kill off at least one order of magnitude more people than seasonal flu. At the same time, the social distancing seems to have stopped a pretty nasty flu outbreak dead in its tracks. We could do this every winter and save tens of thousands of lives annually; over the course of my lifetime the failure to do this every winter probably will kill more Americans than unchecked COVID-19 spread would. We don’t do that, of course, but to be clear: We don’t do it because the social and economic costs of doing so would be too great.There’s a certain beauty and moral rightness in saying that every life counts, and that one life lost to this virus is one life too many. In reality, almost every one of us at some point solves the cold equations against life. There is more than ample room to conclude that DeSantis did it wrong here, but we should be honest with ourselves that we all have our limits as to what we will tolerate, and be willing to consider arguments to the contrary if things don’t change for the worse there."
5297,When Media Advertising Boycotts Backfire,16.67,33.0,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/10/when_media_advertising_boycotts_backfire_142918.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-10,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"Sleeping Giants is far from a household name, but the small organization has had an outsize impact in the Trump era. After being dismayed by the result of the 2016 election, Sleeping Giants was founded by two advertising industry veterans, Matt Rivitz and Nandini Jammi, to organize boycotts of conservative news organizations via social media campaigns.Though the group has a small social media following – 254,000 Twitter followers, which isn’t a lot in relative terms – it has succeeded in getting at least 20 major advertisers to abandon Tucker Carlson’s program on Fox News, and by some estimates it’s responsible for reducing the ad revenue at Breitbart.com by 90%. (In the interest of disclosure, my wife is a contributor to Fox News.)Now, however, it seems that Sleeping Giants’ boycott campaigns, and others like it, are resulting in an unintended – but predictable -- consequences. In the Internet era, advertisers have the luxury of being incredibly specific about what content they choose to advertise on. They do this by targeting content with “keywords” that identify news or content they want their ads to appear next to, or alternately identify content they don’t want to be associated with. And increasingly, advertisers are shying away from placement in any stories with controversial keywords, even when it means avoiding the biggest news of the day.   “As keyword blacklisting ‘coronavirus’ continues to decimate the news industry, I have had the sinking feeling that Sleeping Giants (a campaign which I co-run) has something to do with it,” Jammi wrote in the advertising industry newsletter Branded. “When Sleeping Giants started tweeting at companies asking them to take their ads off Breitbart, we thought we made it pretty clear why: Breitbart was a media outlet promoting hate speech and bigotry, and advertisers’ dollars were funding it. What we never imagined was that brands would turn off the tap on all ‘NEWS & CURRENT EVENTS’ too.”Aside from “coronavirus,” Jammi lists some other keywords and phrases advertisers are blacklisting: shootings, plane crashes, raising the minimum wage, Trump, lesbians, trans people, blood, and murder. According to an article in The Guardian earlier this year, advertiser “blacklists are ballooning in some cases to as many as 3,000 or 4,000 words, blocking ads from many different stories,” and extensive keyword blacklists cost publications in the U.K. over $210 million in ad revenue last year. Advertisers avoiding all controversial topics may well be devastating to journalism, an industry long beset by financial difficulties. What’s astonishing is that the co-founder of Sleeping Giants would be so clueless that she “never imagined” this would be the outcome of media boycotts.Over a year ago, I wrote about Sleeping Giants and concluded that “boycotts are bad for a culture of free speech, but the biggest problem might be that they establish a baseline where corporate policies define the terms of political debate.” And that point was obvious long before I made it.Sleeping Giants’ efforts at advertiser boycotts were successful not because corporate America endorsed the overtly progressive policing of discourse Sleeping Giants so often engages in. (Though it is safe to assume corporate boardrooms are more liberal than not these days.) Mostly, corporations are very risk-averse when it comes to advertising, a field where they have lots of options. A few hundred tweets from Sleeping Giants’ social media devotees is hardly representative of broadly shared outrage – but that’s all it took for major corporate brands to pull their ads off of Fox News.If anyone should have been aware that establishing a low tolerance for controversy for advertisers could backfire, it’s Sleeping Giants. But it seems that Jammi diagnosed the problem too late. “In response, the ad tech world decided that hate speech was ‘controversial,’” she writes. “If brands don’t want to be on controversial content, they reasoned, they wouldn’t want to be on a lot of other things, either. So they came up with an answer: brands should stay away from all hard news, negative news, breaking news — anything remotely ‘controversial.’” The obvious tell is in the first sentence. Arguing that corporations shouldn’t give money to support speech that is, in your opinion, harmful, is one thing. But when Jammi labels disagreeable content “hate speech,” she’s suggesting it has no right to be published in the first place – and such hyperbole makes opinions seem more controversial than they actually are. Sleeping Giants’ goal was never eliminating hate speech. It’s silencing conservative outlets such as Breitbart and Fox News and putting them out of business altogether.And not just those two. It’s also clear that not a single conservative news outlet meets Sleeping Giants’ approval when it comes to acceptable discourse. In response to the growing advertiser blacklists that Sleeping Giants now frets it is responsible for, Jammi has released a “whitelist” – a spreadsheet of 51 media outlets that it says are safe to advertise on. The list is mostly comprised of major newspapers and media organizations familiar to most Americans. Although liberal publications such as The Atlantic, Vox.com, and The New Yorker are on the list, not a single conservative media organization makes the cut. Even the Wall Street Journal, the largest circulating newspaper in the country, with a rigorous and independent news operation, was left off the whitelist – presumably because of the paper’s conservative editorial pages.By using such exclusionary tactics, Sleeping Giants and their progressive allies have inadvertently tapped into an Internet phenomenon known as “the Streisand effect” – essentially, attempts to censor end up further publicizing the person or information being censored. Republican voters have argued for decades, and with some merit, that the media and other institutions are biased against them. Things are now so polarized that liberal attacks on conservative news sources now practically serve as an endorsement.Further, whatever problems conservative media outlets such as Breitbart and Fox allegedly have, they are a small segment of the news market. They can also be judged against the major media outlets’ behavior in the Trump era – and there’s hardly a clear distinction over who is more politicized or irresponsible.The New Yorker is on Sleeping Giants’ whitelist, yet its reporting during Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s controversial confirmation process was deeply unethical. Why is Tucker Carlson persona non grata for advocating tougher immigration policies, while Rachel Maddow, who spent years turning her show into a clearinghouse for every wild and now debunked Trump-Russia allegation, gets the green light to have luxury car brands spend lots of money on her show?Conservative journalism has problems of its own, but given how overwhelmingly liberal the media is, it often serves as a useful outside corrective to dominant media narratives – and these days the media is more prone to politicized groupthink than ever. If you want an accurate representation of what’s happening in this country, you ignore voices like Fox’s media critic Howard Kurtz or the Wall Street Journal op-ed pages at your peril – both of which Sleeping Giants would probably like to see starved of advertising revenue.Instead, we’d be better off ignoring scolds and censors such as Sleeping Giants who, by their own admission, are wrecking the news business."
5298,National Security Dies in Sunshine,13.0,30.67,https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2020/04/13/national_security_dies_the_in_sunshine.html#2,https://adfontesmedia.com/real-clear-politics-bias-and-reliability/,2020-04-13,www.realclearpolitics.com,18,"Sometimes it feels like I’m the last journalist in America who cares about national security. Not studies it. Not writes about it. But actually cares about protecting the national security of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic.Of course, I know that’s not true, but too many journalists have granted themselves extraordinary, unregulated power to put the United States at risk by seeking out and publishing information that strengthens and emboldens our enemies. As evidence, I present the recent “exclusive” report from Newsweek titled “Inside the Military's Top Secret Plans if Coronavirus Cripples the Government.”  When I first read it, the immediate question in my mind was, “If it’s top secret, how and why is it being reported by Newsweek?” There have always been secrets in government, especially military secrets, but there has not always been a press that is unfettered by loyalty, patriotism and common sense in its pursuit of “the story.”Now, however, that is the standard. I myself will be labeled a traitor to my profession for questioning the “right” of Newsweek to publish sensitive material that could greatly diminish our national security. Readers, too, have been conditioned by decades of stories disclosing “top secret” information to casually accept leaks by anonymous sources as a necessity to keep a leash on our government Rather than blindly accept this premise, I want you to ask yourself three questions: Are you safer if military secrets remain secret or if they are made public?Who benefits by the work of the American media to expose military secrets?What should happen to those who betray the nation’s secrets?The answer to the first question, for many journalists, is that the republic is always safer with more transparency. “Democracy dies in darkness,” the Washington Post has famously proclaimed on its front page since early 2017. No doubt, an informed citizenry is vital to the healthy functioning of the democratic republic enshrined by the U.S. Constitution. It is important to know if our government is lying to us, for instance in the FISA abuse scandal, but that is not the end of the story. We must also acknowledge that an informed enemy is detrimental to the continued survival of any nation. All information, therefore, is not equal. That is the simple explanation why some information is classified and restricted.Yet in his March 18 Newsweek story, author William M. Arkin acts as though he has a perfect right on his own to declassify the most sensitive information about military preparedness during the coronavirus pandemic:“Above-Top Secret contingency plans already exist for what the military is supposed to do if all the Constitutional successors are incapacitated. Standby orders were issued more than three weeks ago to ready these plans, not just to protect Washington but also to prepare for the possibility of some form of martial law. “According to new documents and interviews with military experts, the various plans – codenamed Octagon, Freejack and Zodiac – are the underground laws to ensure government continuity. They are so secret that under these extraordinary plans, ‘devolution’ could circumvent the normal Constitutional provisions for government succession, and military commanders could be placed in control around America.” This is not just potentially embarrassing information, like some whistleblower data, but rather information about the very survival of our republic. If democracy is going to die in this case, it is much more likely to happen because Newsweek shined a light on secret plans to protect our national leadership than because those plans were top secret.Moreover, as the nation faced a crisis of unknown proportions with COVID-19 in early March, Arkin felt no compunction about revealing how the U.S. military was planning troop movements:“Mission essential in this regard applies to the maze of more than a dozen different secret assignments, most of them falling under three larger contingency plans: “CONPLAN 3400, or the military's plan for ‘homeland defense,’ if America itself is a battlefield.“CONPLAN 3500, ‘defense support of civil authorities,’ where the military assists in an emergency short of armed attack on the nation.“CONPLAN 3600, military operations in the National Capital Region and continuation of government, under which the most-secret plans to support continuity are nested.”Again, either these plans are secret, or they are not, and if they are secret, then why do we blithely accept the willingness of Newsweek to report on them? Arkin assures us that on Feb. 1, Defense Secretary Mark T. Esper “Secretly ... signed Warning Orders (the WARNORD as it's called) alerting NORTHCOM and a host of east coast units to ‘prepare to deploy’ in support of potential extraordinary missions. Seven secret plans -- some highly compartmented -- exist to prepare for these extraordinary missions.”Arkin describes the seven “secret” plans, not in detail but in specificity, and regarding the seventh plan that “lays out the playbook for extraordinary domestic missions that involve weapons of mass destruction,” he brags about the fact that he had previously “disclosed the existence of this plan in 2005, and its associated ‘national mission force’ -- a force that is on alert at all times, even in peacetime, to respond to a terrorist attack or threat with the nuclear weapon.”It is obvious that Arkin thinks he has the right to know about and to write about the secrets of the U.S. government and our military, and thus to take into his own hands the safety of our people. He has written a book called “American Coup,” which paints the contingency plans to ensure “continuity of government” during times of crisis as a threat to the Constitution.At the end of his Newsweek article, Arkin goes further:“The plans state that the government continues essential functions under all circumstances, even if that is with the devolved second string or under temporary military command. One of the ‘national essential functions,’ according to Federal Continuity Directive 1 is that the government ‘provid[e] leadership visible to the Nation and the world ... [while] maintaining the trust and confidence of the American people.’ The question is whether a faceless elite could ever provide that confidence, preserving government command but also adding to public panic. That could be a virus too.”That condescending tone -- calling the heroes who work to preserve our country in time of crisis a “faceless elite” -- says it very clearly. Arkin, and those who support him with their silence, are willing to forego an American future and are willing to sabotage efforts to ensure we will have one.Who benefits from this kind of reporting? Not the military. Not the president. Not the American people, who have entrusted their safety and security to the military and the president. The only winners are foreign nations that have a vested interest in having reporters do their dirty work for them. Why hire spies when you can just let the American media, under the protection of the First Amendment, solicit leaks from deep within the military and intelligence infrastructure and publish them to the world?  Somewhat incongruously, as a nation we have decided that it is illegal for government agents to distribute state secrets but not for reporters to receive them and then to publish them. Unfortunately, the federal government seems to be incapable of sealing the leaks that have become pandemic in their scope. But if we agree that there are legitimate reasons for information to be restricted in the first place, then we need to have the national will to root out and punish leakers. Based on the number of leaks published, there should be at least one leaker going to jail every day.Does that seem extreme? Then let’s have an open-source government and see how that works out. I’m sure that would suit Newsweek just fine — and our enemies, too."
5335,"If the Government Prohibits Bump Stocks, Do They Need to Compensate Owners?",4.33,42.33,https://www.cato.org/blog/government-prohibits-bump-stocks-do-they-need-compensate-owners,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-29,www.cato.org,18,"In 2018, Maryland Governor Lawrence Hogan signed into law Senate Bill 707, which prohibits a person from possessing any device that increases the rate at which a gun’s trigger is activated or the rate of fire increases. That includes bump stocks and other modifications. The new law bans the possession, sale, transfer, and purchase of such devices, and a violation could result in a hefty fine and up to three years in jail. Maryland Shall Issue, Inc.—a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to the preservation of gun owners’ rights—filed suit in federal court. MSI didn’t argue that the state lacked power to pass such law, but rather that just compensation is owed to the owners for the taking of their previously legal property. The Fifth Amendment says that private property cannot be taken except for a public use and with just compensation. If bump stock owners are essentially giving up their property for the “public good,” then shouldn’t they be owed compensation?The district court dismissed MSI’s Takings Clause claim because the law does not include a governmental confiscation of the guns nor a mandate that owners cede possession to the State. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals agreed. Now, MSI seeks review by the Supreme Court in order to affirm that the Takings Clause requires just compensation when the most fundamental property right, possession, is usurped by the government. Cato has filed a brief in support.This case is about whether the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects lawfully acquired and lawfully owned personal property that the state legislature subsequently decided to ban totally. In 2015, in Horne v. Department of Agriculture, the Court held that “direct appropriations of real and personal property” are treated “alike.” Cato argues that this remains true even if the regulation in question doesn’t require the owner to “turn over” the property to the government or a third party. Dispossession of property is the fundamental feature of Fifth Amendment takings, and the law here effectuates an ouster that actually and physically defeats the owner’s property rights.Cato urges the Court to grant the petition and use this case to clarify that personal and real property must be treated alike under the Takings Clause regardless of whether the given statute requires a “turn over” of the property to the government. For when all fundamental aspects of property ownership are gutted by the government, just compensation is owed."
5337,President Biden and Labor Unions,12.0,31.33,https://www.cato.org/blog/president-biden-labor-unions,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-29,www.cato.org,18,"Joe Biden is old. He has been in politics since 1970 and holds antiquated views. On the campaign trail, he used expressions such as “malarkey” and said that kids should listen to the “record player.”President Biden’s views on labor unions are similarly archaic. Unions appear to be central to his view of the economy, yet few private‐​sector workers are in unions today. This Biden campaign statement, which is ostensibly about clean energy, promotes labor unions 32 times. Biden wants to “create millions of good, union jobs rebuilding America’s crumbling infrastructure,” wants to “ensure these investments create good, union jobs that expand the middle class,” and so on. Spending on cars, energy, manufacturing, railroads, airports, broadband, and everything else in Biden’s plan is about union jobs, over and over ad nauseam.The focus is pathological. I say that because union members account for just 6 percent of private‐​sector employment today, yet Biden’s statement reads as if unions dominate the workforce, are the bulwark of the middle class, and are central to the economy. They are not and will not be going forward. The economy is too dynamic and competitive, and Americans have increasingly rejected unions in the private sector, as shown in the chart below.The Biden statement repeatedly stresses “choice.” Biden wants to “provide workers with the choice to join a union and bargain collectively.” But “collective bargaining” is a euphemism for monopoly unionism and the denial of choice. It violates freedom of association, as Charles Baird explains here. The frequent use of the word “choice” is an attempt to mask the reality of coercive labor unionism under current federal law.Even if collective bargaining was reasonable in theory, frequent corruption scandals reveal that labor union leaders abuse their special privileges. Most recently, theJustice Department reached a civil settlement with the United Auto Workers union, marking a major turning point in a multiyear corruption investigation that has sent several former labor leaders to prison. The sprawling probe, led by the U.S. attorney’s office in Detroit, has penetrated the UAW’s top ranks and exposed what federal prosecutors described as a culture of corruption among its leadership built around kickback schemes, embezzlement and other illicit activities.Why would any policymaker want to strengthen such organizations? Yet that is the direction of President Biden. His proposals would move backwards by reinforcing the coercive nature of federal labor union law, which is incompatible with personal freedom and the modern economy.The chart shows that private‐​sector union membership has fallen from 32 percent of the workforce in 1960 to just 6 percent today."
5338,"Biden, Section 230, and the Response to Political Extremism",2.67,45.67,https://www.cato.org/blog/biden-section-230-response-political-extremism,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-29,www.cato.org,18,"Last year, Biden called for Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act to be revoked. The law, which Biden voted for in 1996, protects interactive computer services from being held liable for the vast majority of third party content. In recent years, the law has become a popular target of conservative lawmakers, who allege that the largest social media companies implement content moderation policies that stifle conservative speech. Biden and some other members of the Democratic Party have different concerns.Biden cited online misinformation as motivating his call for Section 230 repeal, “There is no editorial impact at all on Facebook. None. None whatsoever. It’s irresponsible. It’s totally irresponsible.” Bruce Reed, Biden’s chief of staff from 2011 to 2013 and current deputy White House chief of staff, has expressed concerns about Section 230, noting that the law “hurts our kids and is doing possibly irreparable damage to our democracy.”Harris supported the most recent amendment to Section 230, The Stop Enabling Sex Traffickers Act (SESTA) and Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) package. SESTA/FOSTA added content associated with sex trafficking to the list of Section 230 exceptions. While no doubt well‐​intended, the law resulted in harmful unintended consequences.When considering Section 230 amendments as a means to address the harms associated with online speech White House officials and their allies in Congress should proceed with caution. Section 230 may look like a tempting target for amendment, but changes to Section 230 will not eliminate harmful content and may entrench market incumbents.The Capitol StormingConcerns about misinformation are bound to be more pronounced in the wake of the January 6, 2021 assault on the Capitol. During attempts by Trump supporters to disrupt Congress’ certification of the Electoral College vote members of the mob that broke into the Capitol shared images and video of the intrusion widely on social media. The shared content revealed that those who stormed the Capitol included believers in the QAnon conspiracy theory, white supremacists, and many others.Such content appears to vindicate the concerns from Reed and other Biden allies who believe that Section 230 is doing harm to American democracy. After all, online speech appears to be radicalizing millions of Americans, some of whom have demonstrated a willingness to engage in violence.Before determining whether Section 230 amendments are the best means to address such speech we should keep in mind that racist and conspiratorial content is protected by the First Amendment. Social media networks that cater to or are tolerant of such content are open to accusations of being socially irresponsible, but they are not running afoul of the First Amendment or Section 230.Many of the largest social media companies have faced criticism over their treatment of conspiratorial and political extremist content for years. Shortly after the Capitol storming Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube took steps to remove a wide range of content, including accounts run by former President Trump. For many, these content moderation decisions were too little too late.Section 230 and Extremist ContentLegislative attempts to condition Section 230 protections on tackling extremist speech will quickly run into a stubborn constitutional barrier. The First Amendment prevents the government from compelling a private company from favoring one category of legal speech over another. Accordingly, a Section 230 amendment that makes the law’s liability protection contingent on the moderation of legal but awful speech would be unlikely to survive a constitutional challenge.Social media firms are well within their right to remove extremist speech, and Section 230 prevents them from being sued when they choose to do so. In addition, social media firms can host conspiracy theories as well as extremist content. Not long after the attack on the Capitol, AWS severed ties with Parler, a social media site used by many of the Capitol insurgents. Apple and Google ceased hosting Parler on the Android and iOS app stores.Shortly after the Capitol attack the most popular social media firms took action against content associated with the incident and claim of election fraud. This content moderation and the action AWS, Google, and Apple took against Parler prompted encrypted chat services Signal and Telegram to experience a surge in new users.The move to encrypted services is not a surprise. Encrypted services allow for users to communicate with one another without the service or law enforcement being privy to the communications. These services are not ideal social media replacements. Social media platforms are designed such that users can express themselves to a wide audience. Encrypted services do allow for group chats, but they cannot replicate the social media experience of Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube.Unintended ConsequencesLawmakers could amend Section 230 in such a way that it would encourage social media platforms to be more aggressive when it comes to moderating content. As I have noted before, Boston University Law School’s Danielle Citron and the Brookings Institution’s Ben Wittes have suggested making Section 230 protections contingent on platforms taking “reasonable steps” to address unlawful uses of their services. In such an environment, social media firms would probably be willing to embrace false positives in an attempt to remain in compliance.But as I wrote not long after the attack on the Capitol:If such an amendment were enacted, interactive computer services would have an incentive to embrace false positives in order to ensure that they don’t run afoul of Section 230. Awful but lawful speech could be stifled because sites hosting third‐​party content would seek to avoid bankruptcy via a tsunami of lawsuits.Some might ask, “What’s wrong with services having an incentive to err on the side of caution when it comes to borderline illegal speech?” The answer is that such an environment is likely to be anti‐​competitive, with powerful market incumbents best positioned to adapt to how courts and lawmakers interpret “reasonable steps.” While concerns about online political extremism are likely to prompt lawmakers to seek carrots and sticks for social media companies, we should keep in mind that Section 230 amendments could ultimately entrench the companies so many are criticizing.Response to Extremist SpeechIt would be inappropriate for the president and lawmakers to look to Section 230 amendments when thinking about how to address the spread of misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extremist political content. Almost all of such content is legal under the First Amendment. The most popular social media sites have taken action to address harmful content. But even if these moderation efforts were 100 percent effective such content would find a home on encrypted services or social media sites designed with such content in mind.The rise of extremist political content is troubling, especially when it leads to violence. Amending Section 230 to address this content is likely to run into constitutional barriers or result in market incumbents improving their market positions."
5339,Algorithmic Bias Under the Biden Administration,2.67,46.67,https://www.cato.org/blog/algorithmic-bias-under-biden-administration,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-05,www.cato.org,18,"This is the third and final entry analyzing technology policy issues (the gig economy, online speech, and algorithmic bias) under the Biden administration.Algorithmic Bias in the Public and Private SectorPrivate companies, federal agencies, and law enforcement are increasingly using Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning to evaluate information. According to the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence, AI refers to the “ability of a computer system to solve problems and to perform tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence.” AI‐​powered systems may be faster and more accurate than humans but, as a result of flawed datasets and design, they can still discriminate and exhibit bias.AI consists of a series of algorithms, “instructions” for solving a problem. Algorithmic decision‐​making refers to the process of inputting data to generate a score, choice, or other output. The result is used to render a decision such as classification, prioritization, or sorting.Although algorithms are inherently methodical processes, a 2019 Microsoft research study demonstrated how they can still discriminate. After being trained with Google News articles, a natural language processing program was tasked to predict words in analogies. The program produced gender stereotypes to an alarming extent because it learned from flawed data. Although the technology did not contain prejudice, it mimicked human bias present in the training dataset.Algorithmic decision‐​making is used for a range of purposes, including hiring, personal finance, and policing. Thus, when algorithmic bias occurs, it can have significant effects on social and economic opportunities.This section focuses on the impact of algorithmic bias in both the private and public sector:In the private sector, AI‐​powered tools assist professionals in sorting and decision‐​making. Recruiters use automated processes to expedite applicant screening, interviewing, and selection. Algorithms are analogously used in financial services for credit risk assessment and underwriting.In the public sector, computerized facial recognition is used by police for identification. This technology confirms the identity of someone by detecting a human face in a photo or video and analyzing its physical attributes. Accuracy varies depending on the subject’s race and gender.In both applications, a complete and representative dataset is necessary to avoid algorithmic biases and inaccuracies. Policymakers are weighing the benefits and risks of algorithmic decision‐​making, while simultaneously addressing civil rights and privacy considerations.Biden‐​Harris AdministrationPresident Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris support greater regulations for AI‐​powered systems. In their view, algorithms can be conduits for racial prejudice and amplify inequalities. To that end, the Biden administration will be focused on eliminating racial disparities perpetuated by technology.During the campaign, President Biden promised to create a new public credit reporting and scoring division within the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to “minimize racial disparities.” According to the Biden‐​Harris campaign website, he plans to address “algorithms used for credit scoring [and their] discriminatory impact… by accepting non‐​traditional sources of data like rental history and utility bills to establish credit.”While serving as a U.S. senator, Vice President Harris was an outspoken critic of algorithmic bias. She co‐​sponsored the Justice in Policing Act and sent letters to several federal agencies about the dangers of facial recognition technology. The letters, sent to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Federal Trade Commission, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, asked officials to clarify how they were “addressing the potentially discriminatory impacts of facial analysis technologies.”In a 2019 speech, Vice President Harris cautioned that “there is a real need to be very concerned about [artificial intelligence and machine learning]… how being built into it is racial bias.” She also noted that “unlike the racial bias that all of us can pretty easily detect when you get stopped in a department store or while you’re driving, the bias that is built into technology will not be easy to detect.”On January 15th, President Biden appointed Alondra Nelson to be the deputy director for science and society at the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Nelson, a sociologist who has studied the social impact of emerging technologies, has stated that “we have a responsibility to work together to make sure that our science and technology reflects us.”Current State of RegulationFederal Trade Commission (FTC)While artificial intelligence and machine learning pose new challenges for existing regulatory frameworks, automated decision‐​making has existed for years. The FTC has enforced federal consumer protection laws, such as the Fair Credit Reporting Act (1970) and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (1974). Both laws regulate automated decision‐​making systems in the financial services industry.In recent years, the FTC has issued guidelines for businesses who use algorithmic systems, including a 2016 report and blog post last year.Congressional ProposalsSeveral bills have been proposed in recent years to ameliorate algorithmic bias. They include the following:Algorithmic Accountability Act (2019): The bill was introduced by Senators Cory Booker (D‑NJ), Ron Wyden (D‑OR), and Representative Yvette Clarke (D‑NY). According to Senator Wyden, the bill would have required “companies to study the algorithms they use, identify bias in these systems and fix any discrimination or bias they find.”Consumer Online Privacy Rights Act (2019): The bill, sponsored by Senator Maria Cantwell (D‑WA), would have established new requirements for companies that use algorithmic decision‐​making to process data.Justice in Policing Act (2020): The bill was sponsored by then‐​Senator Kamala Harris (D‑CA), Senator Cory Booker (D‑NJ), and Representatives Karen Bass (D‑CA) and Jerrold Nadler (D‑NY). It would have been the first federal restriction on facial recognition technology.Facial Recognition and Biometric Technology Moratorium Act (2020): Sponsored by Senator Edward Markey (D‑MA) and Jeff Merkley (D‑OR), along with Representatives Pramila Jayapal (D‑WA) and Ayanna Pressley (D‑MA). The bill would have established a five‐​year moratorium on police use of facial recognition technology. It is set to be reintroduced this year.State ProposalsLawmakers in Illinois, New Jersey, Washington, and California have also proposed bills to regulate algorithmic systems.In 2017, New York City passed Local Law 49, the first law in the United States to tackle algorithmic bias and discrimination. Local Law 49 established the Automated Decision Systems Task Force to monitor city use of algorithmic decision‐​making and provide recommendations. The twenty‐​member task force has faced criticism from legal experts due to its inability to fully define “automated decision system.” Members have also blamed the city officials for denying access to critical information needed to make recommendations. New York University professor Julia Stoyanovich told The Verge that she “would not have signed for this task force if [she] knew [it] was just a formal sort of exercise.”Jurisdictions across the country have banned government use of facial recognition. In Illinois, a 2008 law entitled the Biometric Information Privacy Act (BIPA) has been used to curtail facial recognition. Illinois residents sued Clearview AI under the BIPA for creating a facial recognition software from billions of social media photos scrapped without permission. The technology company subsequently canceled all contracts in the state and promised to exclusively work with government entities.Addressing Algorithmic BiasPolicymakers can take steps to help locate and mitigate algorithmic bias. Since the effects of such discrimination vary across sectors, ethical and regulatory considerations should consequently be proportionate to the impact.AI has the potential to positively impact personal finance and employment. At this juncture, companies are faced with competing legal obligations that make bias even harder to detect. Laws such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Equal Credit Opportunity Act incentivize companies to ignore protected class characteristics such as age, race, and sex— even though this information would improve the algorithm’s accuracy. Such requirements were written with human bias in mind and do not effectively attenuate algorithmic bias. To address discrimination in AI‐​powered tools, policymakers should reevaluate how existing regulations and enable companies to train their algorithms with full and complete information.Algorithmic bias in law enforcement facial recognition tools presents greater challenges. Facial recognition technology is trained with billions of photos and videos, often repurposed and used without consent. This technology is relatively underdeveloped, having emerged within the past few years as the software of choice for police despite major flaws. (Accuracy is dependent upon the quality of the image, in addition to the subject themselves.) Last year, three men were wrongfully arrested by police because a facial recognition software misidentified them. Given the significant risk posed by facial analysis tools, more transparency and oversight are needed to prevent abuse and civil liberties violations.The bias issues associated with facial recognition systems have prompted calls for police use of the technology to be banned. In a handful of jurisdictions lawmakers have implemented such bans. While the potential abuse and misuse of facial recognition does raise significant civil liberties concerns, outright bans of the technology are not the best policy.Rather than ban facial recognition, lawmakers should consider making the use of facial recognition contingent on a set of policies that allow for police to use facial recognition while also protecting civil liberties. Currently, there are no police departments in the United States that have implemented these policies, which include prohibitions on real‐​time capability, accuracy requirements, restrictions on what data can be queried. Although the vast majority of policing in the United States is handled at the state and local level, the federal government can nonetheless condition grants on best practices related to surveillance technology, including facial recognition systems."
5340,"GameStop, Payments for Order Flow, and High Frequency Trading",1.0,44.67,https://www.cato.org/blog/gamestop-payments-order-flow-high-frequency-trading,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-01,www.cato.org,18,"Speculative activity surrounding the stock of the video game retailer GameStop has been in the news. The Washington Post discussed how the trading platform Robinhood, used by many small investors purchasing GameStop stock, funds itself through payments for order flow rather than fees paid by those who buy or sell the stocks. That is, the orders submitted by the ordinary retail investors that make up Robinhood’s customer base are directed to Citadel, a maker of a trading market for stocks, for execution in return for payments to Robinhood.Why would Citadel pay for orders? Citadel learns about the supply of and demand for GameStop and then uses that knowledge to inform its automated high‐​speed trading.Payments for order flow are not new. This 2002 article in Regulation discussed the issue. It argued that payments for order flow are used by brokers to lower commissions, which customers can observe easily, while customers’ ability to ascertain whether the best possible price was obtained in the trade is impossible. Because of investors’ inability to monitor brokerage performance, brokers will compete for investors’ orders not on the basis of trade execution performance but on other dimensions that investors can, and do, form a judgment on, such as commission rates, which in the case of Robinhood are zero. Thus, as of 2002, payments for order flow were fine as long as there was competition among firms that execute stock trades.More recent scholarship views payments for order flow as an important component of the arms race among High Frequency Traders (HFT). No development in financial markets causes more discussion and disagreement than HFT.Forty years ago, the “making” of a market in equities was done by monopoly “specialists” who owned seats on exchanges. They were compensated by the “spread”— the difference between the price they offered sellers and charged buyers. Those differences were large enough to more than cover costs. The excess profits were capitalized in the prices that specialists paid for the right to trade on an exchange.Now liquidity is provided by traders using computers. Many commentators view this change positively because the costs of trading have been dramatically reduced along with the rents to specialists. Bid‐​ask spreads have decreased over time and revenues to market‐​makers have decreased from 1.46 percent of traded face value in 1980 to just 0.11 percent in 2006 and 0.03 percent in 2015. And HFT reduces stock price volatility. When the temporary ban on short sales of financial stocks existed in 2008, the financial stocks with the biggest decline in HFT had the biggest increase in volatility.But bid‐​ask spreads are larger than they could be because of the “arms race” among HFT participants to locate their servers closer and closer to the servers of electronic exchanges. This arms race exists because the transfer of buy and sell offers from any of the actual computerized exchanges to the National Market System (NMS) takes real‐​time. This creates the possibility of learning about prices at a computerized exchange and trading on that information through the NMS before the NMS posts the information. Traders have responded to these facts by paying to locate their servers in the same location as exchange servers, utilizing the speed of light to arbitrage price differences at the level of thousandths of a second (latency arbitrage).The arms race is the result of exchanges’ use of “continuous‐​limit‐​order‐​book” design (that is, orders are taken continuously and executed in the order of arrival). In a continuous auction market, someone is always first. In contrast, in a “frequent batch” auction (in which trades are executed, by auction, at stipulated times that can be as little as a fraction of a second apart), the advantage of incremental speed improvements disappears. In order to end the latency arbitrage “arms race,” exchanges should switch to batch auctions.What are the costs of the arms race? If multiple participants are engaged in a speed race, some will succeed and some will fail. A complete record of London Stock Exchange activity for all stocks in the FTSE 350 index for a 9‐​week period in Fall 2015 found that the “latency arbitrage tax,” defined as latency arbitrage profits divided by all trading volume, is about .5 basis points (.015%). The average bid ask spread (the effective charge for liquidity provision) in the data is just over 3 basis points. Thus, the latency arbitrage tax is about 17% (.5/3). If liquidity providers did not have to bear the adverse selection costs of losing races, the cost of trading would be reduced by 17%. This amounts to 60 million pounds annually on the London Exchange and an estimated $5 billion per year across all global equity markets.Will exchanges adopt batch trading? The conventional answer is no because they make most of their revenue from charges for the co‐​location of traders’ servers with the exchange servers to allow faster trades. But an important component of the explanation for the lack of adoption of batch trading by exchanges are SEC regulatory requirements.The main cost an exchange would face in adopting frequent batched auctions would be the cost of obtaining SEC approval. And once the SEC’s approval of a batch market is won, at some significant cost, other participants can free ride on that approval without incurring the legal cost by adopting the same structure themselves.In addition, the design of a batch auction cannot be patented. As a result, the only way for an exchange to make money through a batch design is a trade secret, but under SEC regulations, exchanges must disclose everything for public comment and subsequent SEC approval.Alternative Trading Systems (ATSs) are not exchanges and are subject to much less disclosure and regulation than exchanges. ATSs can change their rules more quickly and innovations can remain trade secrets. ATSs just file a form with no notice and comment period and responses.How important are the regulatory differences? When Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), the owner of the New York Stock Exchange purchased the Chicago Stock Exchange, CHX had trivial volume. ICE was purchasing “an exchange license” for $70 million, which suggests the costs of the formal SEC exchange application rules are quite substantial. When the ATS IEX applied to become a stock exchange in fall 2015 and conduct its trading with a batch design, its application was followed by months of disputes even though its proposed market structure was basically identical to its operation as an ATS. SEC approval took nine months. Two ATSs, OneChronos and IntelligentCross, have adopted batch trading while IEX has not had much success as an exchange."
5341,The House Could Vote on These 10 Immigration Bills in March,1.0,46.0,https://www.cato.org/blog/house-could-vote-these-10-immigration-bills-march,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-02,www.cato.org,18,"The rules of the House of Representatives normally require that legislation receive a committee hearing, markup, and vote before receiving a vote on the House floor. However, the rules adopted by the House in January waive this requirement until April 1 for bills that previously passed the House. This expedited process could encourage the House to act quickly on legislation it passed last Congress. The last votes scheduled on the House calendar before April 1 are on March 12—meaning that if the House uses this procedure, it would have just over a month to make it happen.There are a couple of important differences between this Congress and last Congress that could make it more difficult to pass these ten bills. First, Democrats have a slimmer majority (220 now v. 235 last year with 218 being the majority of the House). This means that the Democrats have less margin for error within their party. Second, the attack on the Capitol by some Republican voters, the attempt by 139 House Republicans to overturn the election, and the impeachment and trial of Donald Trump has created unusual obstacles to even small‐​scale bipartisan cooperation.The ten immigration bills that passed last Congress cover a wide range of topics, including legalization of certain Dreamers and farm workers, green card reforms for high skilled workers, standards and oversight of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), restrictions on presidential authority, and greater legal protections for people detained by DHS agencies. Overall, the bills fall far short of comprehensive reform, but they would nonetheless constitute significant and generally positive changes to the system.House‐​Passed Immigration Bills from the 116th CongressH.R. 6 — American Dream and Promise Act of 2019 (passed 237 – 187 on June 4, 2019)Every Democrat and seven Republicans (Fred Upton — MI, Chris Smith — NJ, Dan Newhouse — WA, Brian Fitzpatrick — PA, Mario Diaz‐​Balart — FL, Don Bacon — NE, and Will Hurd — TX) voted for this bill last Congress. Of the seven Republicans, only Hurd is gone, and a couple more Republicans who defeated Democrats in November may vote for this bill. The unanimous support from Democrats with some Republicans virtually guarantees that this bill will receive a vote by March 12.The bill provides the opportunity to receive legal permanent residence (green cards) to certain illegal immigrants who entered the United States at least four years ago as children before the age of 18 as well as those in the Temporary Protected Status program as of January 1, 2017—about 2.6 million people, according the Migration Policy Institute’s Julia Gelatt.H.R.1044 — Fairness for High‐​Skilled Immigrants Act (passed 365 – 65 on July 10, 2019)All but eight Democrats and 57 Republicans supported this bill. The lopsided vote is the second time that the House of Representatives has passed this bill with majorities of both parties voting in favor since 2011. This would seem to make it a lock to get fast‐​tracked this Congress, but unlike the other bills on this list, the Senate actually amended and passed this bill as well. Normally, this would be a positive development, but because the House disagreed with its changes, it may complicate its decision to bring the bill to the floor quickly. But the complication doesn’t rule out early action. The House may want to just kick it back to the Senate quickly to get the process going.The bill phases out the country limits for employment‐​based green cards over three years and raises the country caps from 15 percent for family‐​sponsored immigrants. Currently, no more than 7 percent of green cards in the employment‐ and family‐​based categories may go to immigrants from any single birthplace (unless they would otherwise be wasted), leading to exceptionally long waits for Indian immigrants. There are 1.2 million employment‐​based immigrants who would be affected by the bill. The Senate added several complex provisions, but the dealbreaker for the House appears to have been a limit on the number of H‑1B workers who can receive green cards and a ban on adjusting to legal permanent residence any Chinese national who was ever “affiliated” with the Chinese Communist Party.H.R.3239 — Humanitarian Standards for Individuals in Customs and Border Protection Custody Act (passed 233 — 195 on July 24, 2019)All Democrats joined by one Republican (Don Young — AK) voted for this bill. The unanimous support from Democrats and the high visibility of the issue makes this bill a plausible one for action early this year. On the other hand, circumstances have changed dramatically at the border since July 2019. Crossings are still down, and the new administration has promised to create its own standards. It is possible that House Democrats may want to allow that process to play out before imposing its own rules.The bill requires health screenings of detained immigrants at the border and sets timelines for those screenings. It requires the provision of interpreters, chaperones, and mental health treatment when necessary. It also mandates certain baseline standards for care of detainees.H.R.549 — Venezuela TPS Act of 2019 (passed 272 – 158 on July 25, 2019)Every Democrat and 39 Republicans voted for this bill. The strong bipartisan vote makes this legislation a strong contender for the fast‐​track treatment in 2021. However, the fact that President Biden could unilaterally make the bill’s changes could mean that the administration may pre‐​empt House action.The bill would designate Venezuela as a country whose nationals are eligible for Temporary Protected Status (TPS). TPS is a status provided in situations where it would be inhumane to force a person in temporary or illegal status back to their home country, such as during the socialist country’s economic and political crisis. The bill would designate Venezuela for an initial period of 18 months.H.R.2203 — Homeland Security Improvement Act (passed 230 – 194 on September 25, 2019)All but one Democrat voted for this bill with all Republicans opposing it. The lack of Republican support would make a vote this Congress tighter, but the near‐​unanimous Democratic support could allow this bill to see the floor this month.The bill would establish an independent, neutral, and standardized process to assist individuals in resolving complaints related to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a Border Oversight Panel, which shall make recommendations related to border enforcement policies, and a Border Community Liaison in each Border Patrol sector on the northern and southern borders, which shall consult with and receive feedback from border communities on ICE and CBP policies and activities.H.R.565 — AMIGOS Act (passed by voice vote on December 3, 2019)The bill passed by voice vote, meaning that no one in either party objected to its passage and requested a recorded vote. This means that leadership of both parties agreed to it, and none of the anti‐​immigrant members of the House cared enough to object (perhaps because it would pass so overwhelmingly).The bill would add Portugal to the list of countries whose nationals may participate in the E‑1 and E‑2 nonimmigrant visa programs for treaty traders and investors. The E‑1 program allows a nonimmigrant to enter “solely to engage in international trade on his or her own behalf” along with certain of their employees, and their spouses and minor children. The E‑2 program is for entrepreneurs who invest significantly in their businesses, certain of their employees, and their spouses and minor children.H.R.5038 — Farm Workforce Modernization Act of 2019 (passed 260 – 165 on December 12, 2019)All but four Democrats (Jared Golden — ME, Ben McAdams — UT, Bobby Scott — VA, Rashida Tlaib — MI) voted for this bill, and they were joined by 34 Republicans—nearly all of whom will return. Again, with bipartisan support and near unanimity among Democrats, this bill is a strong candidate to receive the fast‐​track treatment this coming month.The legislation would provide the opportunity for illegal immigrant farm workers and their families to receive legal permanent residence (green cards). It would also improve the H‑2A guest worker program’s minimum wage requirement and allow some year‐​round farmers to access the program. It also creates a pilot program whereby employers can hire H‑2A workers who switch from one employer to the other on the same basis as any other U.S. worker with only the requirement to pay the H‑2A minimum wage. The bipartisan compromise that led to nearly three dozen Republicans to back it was a mandate for farmers to use the flawed E‑Verify employment verification program.H.R.2877 — To add Ireland to the E‑3 nonimmigrant visa program (passed by voice vote on March 9, 2020)The bill passed by voice vote, meaning that no one in either party objected to its passage and requested a recorded vote. This means that leadership of both parties agreed to it, and none of the anti‐​immigrant members of the House cared enough to object (perhaps because it would pass so overwhelmingly). The bill previously passed the House on a voice vote in 2018 under GOP House leadership.The legislation adds Ireland to the E‑3 nonimmigrant visa program, which is effectively an H‑1B program solely for Australia with a cap of 10,500. The Irish would receive the same number of visas as Australians used in the prior year. Any company that hired the Irish E‑3s would be required to enroll in the flawed E‑Verify employment verification program.H.R.2214 — NO BAN Act (passed 233 – 183 on July 22, 2020)All Democrats and two Republicans (Will Hurd — TX and Brian Fitzpatrick — PA) voted to pass the NO BAN Act last Congress. The unanimous support may spur action again this Congress, but the unanimity was achieved when Donald Trump was president, President Biden has already used the power to ban immigrants very early in his term. On the other hand, Biden included the bill explicitly by name in his legislative proposal to Congress, so he almost certainly cannot publicly oppose any House action on it.The NO BAN Act restricts the authority of the president to ban immigrants or nonimmigrants by outlawing bans based on religion, race, sex, nationality, place of birth, or place of residence. It also requires that any ban by the president narrowly tailors the suspension using the least restrictive means to achieve a compelling government interest. It also creates a rebuttable presumption in favor of granting family‐​based and humanitarian waivers to the ban, and it explicitly authorizes anyone in the United States harmed by a ban standing to challenge to sue.H.R.5581 — Access to Counsel Act of 2020 (passed 231–184 on July 22, 2020)All Democrats voted for this bill, and all Republicans voted against it. The lack of Republican support would make a vote this Congress tighter, but the unanimous Democratic support could allow this bill to see the floor this month.The bill explicitly requires the Department of Homeland Security to allow access to immigration counsel for anyone subject to secondary or deferred inspection at U.S. ports of entry. No one can give up their legal permanent resident status without waiving in writing their right to confer with an attorney."
5342,Cultivating a Politics of Restraint,0.0,39.33,https://www.cato.org/blog/cultivating-politics-restraint,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-01-29,www.cato.org,18,"For the first time in a long time, American elites are having a thoroughgoing conversation over America’s role in the world. A broad spectrum of opinion — broader than usual, that is — informs the debate. To oversimplify, on one end of the spectrum are advocates of the status quo. They want America to maintain an expansive, expensive, and ambitious strategy for militarily dominating the international system. On the other end are advocates of restraint — a strategy that calls for trimming America’s global military commitments and relinquishing its global cop role while staying engaged through free trade, robust diplomacy, and active participation in international organizations, as well as a powerful military.In hopes of finding a politically viable middle ground, Georgetown University’s Charles Kupchan proposes a compromise that he suggests could guide the United States towards “judicious retrenchment” while also avoiding too radical a departure from, as he refers to it, “Pax Americana.”…The restrainers and liberal internationalists are both wrong. As the United States enters the post‐​Trump era, in which Americans will have neither the wherewithal to run the world nor the luxury of running away from it, the nation will need to find a middle way.The task for the United States in the years ahead will be to maintain its role as an anchor of geopolitical stability while at the same time avoiding overstretch.Leave aside the question of whether U.S. foreign policy can really be said to be “the anchor of stability.” Kupchan mischaracterizes the parameters of the debate. Aiming for the middle ground, he lands out of bounds.For Kupchan, the debate is not between advocates of restraint and advocates of the status quo; rather, it’s between the status quo and “isolationism,” a term he erroneously equates with restraint. There is little grounds for describing any serious trend in American politics, and certainly policymaking, as “isolationist.” President Trump was the closest we have come to a national figure advocating isolationism, and he was not an isolationist.The compromise Kupchan recommends is for the United States to “continue playing the role of great‐​power pacifier while abandoning its attempts to serve as the global policeman.” Even if policymakers could discern the difference between these two postures, it is unlikely to effectively curb U.S. activism.Its outsize power and position atop the international hierarchy since the end of WWII has led the United States to pursue expansive strategies that constantly tempt policymakers to intervene and become militarily entangled in the dangerous web of international politics to a much greater extent than necessary. There are no built‐​in mechanisms that reliably protect against the constant temptation to expand and intervene. If the premises of the strategy are broad enough, Washington will be sure to overshoot.Elected officials of both parties respond to this temptation. As my former colleague Emma Ashford explained, “both [Trump] and Barack Obama came into office promising to change America’s foreign policy, but when faced with crises, both yielded to pressure to intervene. This bias toward action is one of the biggest problems in American foreign policy. It produces poorly thought‐​out interventions and, sometimes, disastrous long‐​term consequences…”It is precisely because American elites have been socialized over generations into accepting special responsibilities in global security that a narrow strategy cautiously circumscribing this temptation to expand is what we most need. The idea is similar to what Thomas Jefferson said of the U.S. Constitution: “in questions of power then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind him down from mischief by the chains of the constitution.”Ultimately, a nation’s grand strategy is going to reflect its politics, and the political establishment still reflects the past 80 years of expanding our concept of the national interest to allow for constant military intervention, global order management, and much tragedy. The politics, however, show some signs of change.Lately it seems the American people by and large are attracted to politicians calling for the United States to bring its focus back home. Many who employ rhetoric about “ending endless wars” seem to get special attention from voters. For anyone who appreciates the recent excesses in U.S. foreign policy and believes in the need to rein it in, now is an exciting time to propose more prudent strategies. But given the sheer inertia of U.S. primacy and the fickleness of its politics, proposing strategies that merely snip at the edges of “Pax Americana” will do little cultivate what is most needed in U.S. foreign policy: restraint in the face of temptation."

Recent economic research has bolstered these criticisms, while demonstrating why any legitimate account of U.S.-China trade policy, the domestic manufacturing sector, and blue‐​collar jobs must acknowledge and evaluate current U.S. industrial policies before demanding new ones.In a July 2020 working paper, economists Alessandro Barattieri & Matteo Cacciatore examined the hundreds of U.S. antidumping measures (and less‐​frequent “countervailing duty” measures) imposed between 1994 and 2015 and found that duties (1) were concentrated in industrial inputs like primary metals and chemicals; (2) depressed employment in downstream U.S. industries (e.g., steel‐​users); but (3) provided no long‐​term benefit for jobs in the protected, upstream industries (e.g., steelmakers). Figure 5 below shows these employment effects. The authors attribute the downstream industries’ job‐​losses to declining competitiveness caused by higher input and finished goods prices. (Newsflash: water remains wet.)In a January 2021 paper, economists Chad Bown, Paola Conconi, Aksel Erbahar, and Lorenzo Trimarchi examined antidumping measures on Chinese imports imposed between 1988 and 2016 and found that these duties (1) increased substantially — in terms of duty rates, total import value, and number of measures — over the period examined, and particularly during the height of the “China Shock” in the 2000s (Figures 1, A‑1 and A‑2 below); (2) had large, negative effects on downstream industries in terms of increased production costs and decreased employment, wages, sales, and investment; but (3) had no significant effect on blue‐​collar jobs, wages, or sales in the protected industries (even though the duties decreased imports and increased foreign and domestic prices). They estimate that the antidumping measures cost approximately 1.85 million U.S. jobs between 1988 and 2016, primarily in blue‐​collar services industries (though 280,000 manufacturing jobs were also lost). They further provide evidence that duties were often politically motivated, with protection more likely when petitioning companies or workers are located in U.S. “swing states.”One can quibble with these authors’ exact figures, but the studies’ overall conclusions are consistent with past research showing that U.S. protectionism not only imposes significant economic costs for American companies, workers, and consumers, but also fails to create thriving domestic companies with expanding workforces. The papers also reiterate that any proper accounting of the costs and benefits of open markets generally, or of specific events like the “China Shock,” must consider jobs gained from imports (and lost from protectionism), as well as the longstanding inability of existing U.S. laws — far from “free‐​market fundamentalism” — to increase blue‐​collar manufacturing jobs.Such points are all‐​too‐​often missing."
5344,Biden Tells the State Department to Launch Private Refugee Sponsorship,5.0,44.33,https://www.cato.org/blog/biden-tells-state-department-launch-private-refugee-sponsorship,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-05,www.cato.org,18,"President Biden issued an executive order providing for a number of changes to the U.S. refugee program that President Trump had gutted during his four years in office. One important change follows a recommendation from Cato’s compilation of 30 executive actions to restore legal immigration (and many other times): private refugee sponsorship. The president states:To meet the challenges of restoring and expanding USRAP, the United States must innovate, including by effectively employing technology and capitalizing on community and private sponsorship of refugees, while continuing to partner with resettlement agencies for reception and placement.As I’ve explained before, private sponsorship has been highly successful in Canada for decades and following the United Nations’ call for more such programs at least seven other countries have created some version of private sponsorship since 2014. The president can implement a privately funded refugee program with his existing authority under the Refugee Act of 1980, which already requires him to consider available private funds before setting the refugee target.While this is an extremely positive development, the order provides no specifics on implementation. The State Department had previously committed to creating a private sponsorship program under the Obama administration in 2016, so hopefully the department already has some particulars worked out.I have outlined four models under which private individuals or community groups could select refugees for resettlement under a private sponsorship program. The Biden administration could implement all of them simultaneously.Allow the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) to recommend certain refugees referred for resettlement for private sponsorship.Allow private sponsors to choose from a pool of refugees referred for resettlement under the existing system.Expand existing Priority 3 (P‑3) family sponsorship to include more extended relatives as was done for Bosnians in the 1990s could expand sponsorship through an existing channel. Similarly, I proposed that the administration grant refugee status to any family who are refugees caught in the green card backlog. Family of Americans shouldn’t die abroad waiting for a green card.Allow sponsors to select any refugees that they want abroad. While more complicated to administer, the ability to select refugees of particular concern to the sponsor would create a powerful incentive to engage with the program.Another important element that must be a part of any private sponsorship program is the concept of “additionality.” Any privately sponsored refugee should come in addition to those resettled by the U.S. government. If private resettlement merely does what the government already committed to do, that vastly reduces the incentive to participate.However, because the president has not yet raised the refugee cap, we aren’t sure if private resettlement or “additionality” will be part of this year’s plan. If the president does raise the refugee limit to 125,000, it will come close to meeting another recommendation in our compilation of 30 ideas for the administration: that more resettlement is warranted due to increasing numbers of refugees worldwide. This would reverse a trend of the United States taking a decreasing share of the worldwide refugee population. "
5345,Marijuana Licensing Corruption,0.33,43.0,https://www.cato.org/blog/marijuana-licensing-corruption,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-04,www.cato.org,18,"Fifteen states have legalized recreational marijuana and 36 states have legalized medical marijuana. As we move toward legalization across the nation, state policymakers should be learning lessons from the reforms we’ve seen so far.One lesson is that ceding full control to local governments and allowing them to impose licensing in a discretionary and opaque manner is a recipe for corruption. The FBI issued a statement on the problem in 2019: “States require licenses to grow and sell the drug—opening the possibility for public officials to become susceptible to bribes in exchange for those licenses.” The problem is not commonplace licensing for health and safety, it is putting tight and arbitrary caps on the numbers of business licenses approved.California allows local governments to ban marijuana businesses completely or to impose caps on the numbers of licenses. Only about one‐​third of jurisdictions in the state allow marijuana‐​related businesses, such as growing, manufacturing, and dispensing. In these areas, approval processes are complex and license caps are low, and since demand is high licenses are a highly valued commodity.The Los Angeles Times describes some of the resulting problems:Since California voters legalized recreational cannabis four years ago, allegations of conflicts of interest, bribery and bias in the permitting process have plagued cities and counties as they try to regulate the fledgling industry. The accusations have led to a series of high‐​profile arrests and prosecutions of local government officials and pot operators.… A combination of factors has made the industry vulnerable to corruption.California voters legalized the possession and sale of recreational cannabis in 2016 but left it up to cities and counties to decide whether they would allow businesses in their jurisdictions to cultivate, manufacture, distribute or sell cannabis products.Most cities still prohibit cannabis businesses from operating within their borders, and those that do allow pot operations typically place strict limits on the number of licenses they issue as well as their locations. With permits limited, it is speculated that they could be worth millions of dollars, and competition for them can be fierce.Cannabis businesses are also cash‐​intensive. Because the drug is still illegal under federal law, the companies are forced to deal mainly in cash.Reason and Marijuana Business Daily have also reported on the connection between license caps and corruption, and I summarized a Politico investigation into the matter here. This story from San Bernadino captures some of the mess created by limited and discretionary license approvals.This piece in the Sacramento News & Review by a former police lieutenant hits the nail on the head:When Californians overwhelmingly voted to legalize adult‐​use cannabis in 2016, they also unintentionally instituted a dual licensing system for cannabis retail. Legal cannabis businesses must first obtain a permit from the city where they operate before the state will issue a license. This set‐​up, hailed as “local control,” empowers county supervisors and city council members throughout the state to decide if (or how many) cannabis retailers can operate within their jurisdiction.But rather than embrace the intent of Proposition 64 and match the level of voter support with the appropriate number of cannabis dispensaries and delivery services, local officials doing the opposite. Nearly 80% of cities and counties have banned cannabis retailers, and many others have set arbitrary limits on the number of licenses. As a result, legal cannabis—whether it is medical or recreational—has failed, and will continue to fail, to integrate into California’s legitimate economy.Currently, Sacramento, a city of 500,000 people, only allows 30 cannabis retail licenses … This number is not based on real demand. As a result of the city’s decision to restrict licenses to so few, they have become tremendously valuable commodities, essentially creating a legal license cartel. Only the most wealthy and well‐​connected business owners are able to obtain permits, whether by playing within the rules or by backroom deals. Small businesses have run California’s cannabis economy for decades. Shutting them out now is a slap in the face.… It is not the role of local government to create choke points in burgeoning industries, but rather to create sensible regulations that protect public health and safety. Arbitrary caps on cannabis business licenses inherently breed corruption and increased crime. When businesses are forced to break the law, some may be more willing to sell unregulated products, or to sell to minors.State and local policymakers should legalize marijuana and vastly liberalize licensing. Licensing for health and safety is reasonable, as are normal zoning rules for locating businesses in commercial zones. But imposing artificial license caps is asking for trouble. One marijuana industry leader got it right regarding license caps: “Competition belongs in the market, not in the license application process.”The license issue is one of many policy mistakes regarding the young legal industry. In Massachusetts, cities are unfairly shaking down marijuana entrepreneurs with “community impact fees” and “donations” to the government. In Canada, the legalized pot industry suffers under costly taxes and restrictive regulations, with the result that black markets still thrive. If stoner and goofball actor Seth Rogen can figure this out, why can’t the politicians?Virginia decriminalized recreational marijuana in 2020, and there is now a move to legalize. Unfortunately, legislators appear to be moving ahead with a plan that overregulates the industry and allows local license caps. As a resident, I favor legalization but fear the politicians will screw it up once again by micromanaging and stifling what should be a thriving and job‐​creating part of the state economy.Read the newest Cato study my colleague Jeffrey Miron conducted with Angela Dills, Sietse Goffard, and Eric Partin that analyzes the industry and its social and economic effects."
5346,Who Are “The People”?,-2.67,38.67,https://www.cato.org/blog/who-are-people,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-04,www.cato.org,18,"Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s social media posts have come in for a lot of scrutiny lately. I noticed something in a recent tweet that hasn’t gotten much notice, but which I think reflects an interesting and perhaps disturbing attitude. On January 30 she wrote that “the people of this country are absolutely 100% loyal to” President Trump.But of course “the people” of the United States are not all that enamored of the former president, either now or at any point. He got 45.9 percent of the vote in 2016, 46.8 percent in 2020. He got 3 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton and 7 million fewer than Joe Biden. He’s the first president ever whose approval rating in the Gallup Poll never reached 50 percent, and as he left office his average poll rating was 38 percent. So it doesn’t really seem that the American people are “absolutely 100% loyal” to him. Yet on Facebook, Twitter, and elsewhere you can find constant affirmations that the elites may not like Trump but “the people” support him. Who are these people?Claiming the mantle of “the people” is a common theme of populists, of course, from William Jennings Bryan, who asked “Shall the People Rule?” but lost three presidential races, to Hugo Chavez, who denounced his opponents as homosexual, Zionist, and tools of “the bourgeoisie” and the Americans. Political scientists Daniele Albertazzi and Duncan McDonnell described populism as an ideology that “pits a virtuous and homogeneous people against a set of elites and dangerous ‘others’ who are together depicted as depriving (or attempting to deprive) the sovereign people of their rights, values, prosperity, identity, and voice.” Populists typically claim to speak for “the people” against some set of elites and/​or against groups who are not elite but are in some way “other” — foreigners, immigrants, Jews, racial or sexual minorities, etc.In a 2019 Reason article on authoritarian populism, Tom G. Palmer emphasized this point:The Princeton political scientist Jan‐​Werner Müller proposes another characteristic: “In addition to being antielitist, populists are always antipluralist,” he argues in 2016’s What Is Populism? (University of Pennsylvania Press). “Populists claim that they, and they alone, represent the people.” In that formulation, the key to understanding populism is that “the people” does not include all the people. It excludes “the enemies of the people,” who may be specified in various ways: foreigners, the press, minorities, financiers, the “1 percent,” or others seen as not being “us.”Republicans like to point to a red‐​blue map of recent elections by county or precinct, in which a few blue dots are visible in a sea of Republican red. Those are “the people” — even if there are more cows than people in many of those vast red areas. They’re “the real America,” as Glenn Beck titled a book. Sarah Palin said the “the real America” was the small towns. Living in Virginia, I hear the same claims about “the real Virginia.” When former Sen. George Allen noticed his opponent’s “tracker,” a young Indian‐​American, filming his speech, he called out “Let’s give a welcome to Macaca, here. Welcome to America and the real world of Virginia.” In 2009, Republican candidate Ken Cuccinelli told Shenandoah County Republicans that they represented “the real Virginia.”And that, I think, is what Representative Greene and others mean when they say “the people” support Trump. They mean The People. The real people. Not those other people. Even if the other people turn out to be a majority."
5347,Few Immigrants Among Capitol Insurrectionists,-6.0,37.33,https://www.cato.org/blog/37-percent-capitol-insurrectionists-were-immigrants,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-03,www.cato.org,18,"As of February 1, 2021, a total of 217 people have been arrested or charged with participating in the January 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection. Many more people will be arrested and charged in the coming months, but it’s worth looking at the demographics of this group to better understand what happened. New research by professors Robert A. Pape and Keven Ruby present the age, employment status, and other demographic characteristics of the mob that attacked the Capitol. However, Pape and Ruby left out one key demographic variable: nativity. How many of the rioters were foreign‐​born?To fill this gap, my intern Devin Thompson and I have used Department of Justice information, District of Columbia arrest records, and numerous other sources to list the names of those arrested or charged so far and whether they are immigrants or native‐​born Americans. If those documents did not reveal the nativity, we looked at their social media accounts and news stories. Their names and the sources for each individual are available upon request.We recorded 217 people arrested or charged with the January 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection. Of those, 209 were native‐​born Americans and 8 were immigrants (Figure 1). In other words, native‐​born Americans comprised 96.3 percent of the attackers and immigrants were 3.7 percent. The few immigrants came from a wide range of countries. Two were from Moldova and one each were from Lebanon, Ethiopia, Georgia, Japan, Vietnam, and Brazil.Only 3.7 percent of the Capitol rioters were immigrants, which is lower than the nationwide foreign‐​born percentage of 13.7 percent. Indeed, 3.7 percent is below the national foreign‐​born percentage of the population at any point in American history since English settlers first landed in Virginia in 1607. The only time that comes close is the mid‐​1960s when the immigrant population fell to a low of 4.4 percent — and we all remember how politically calm the mid‐​to‐​late 1960s were.The most interesting argument against liberalizing immigration is that the immigrants, who are mainly from countries with less productive political and economic institutions, could overwhelm and degrade American political and economic institutions. As a result, they could kill the goose that lays the golden eggs. Benjamin Powell and I wrote a book on this topic that was published at the end of 2020 called Wretched Refuse? The Political Economy of Immigration and Institutions. We found no evidence that immigrants systematically degrade economic and political institutions in their new homes along with much evidence that they frequently improve them.The criminals who rioted in American cities in 2020 and those who perpetrated the 2021 Capitol insurrection were overwhelmingly native‐​born Americans intent on sowing chaos, fundamentally overturning our institutions, or just committing serious crimes. Regardless, the thesis that immigrants are somehow responsible for attacking American institutions has never seemed sillier. The low level of immigrant participation in the January 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection is further proof that immigrants are not the source of institutional degradation in the United States."

As Ian Austen of the New York Times noted:Canada formally designated the Proud Boys as a terrorist entity under its criminal law on Wednesday, a move that could lead to financial seizures and allow police to treat any crimes they commit as terrorist activity.That groups like the “Proud Boys” are repugnant politically and morally is, to my mind, not even a debatable question. But as the Supreme Court ruled in the landmark 1969 Brandenburg v Ohio case, repulsive speech is protected speech. What’s not protected speech is injuring or killing someone–but Canada, like the United States, already has laws to address violent behavior. Canada’s move is of course a sovereign decision, but for me the question is what kind of political and emotional signal does it send to the Biden administration and the now Democrat‐​controlled House and Senate? Will we see similar efforts in Congress to pass laws censoring speech the dominant political party finds offensive? Will there be an effort to pass a domestic terrorism law that mirrors, or perhaps even goes beyond, the infamous PATRIOT Act?In the wake of the January 6, 2021 Capitol insurrection by supporters of now former President Trump, many of the bedrock free speech and civil liberties principles that have guided us seem up for grabs. Giving into a misguided impulse to “do something” is exactly how we got the PATRIOT Act in the first place. In this case, Congress and the Administration should resist that impulse and not follow Canada’s lead."
5349,Modi Should Hold Firm against Farmers,4.33,35.33,https://www.cato.org/blog/modi-should-hold-firm-against-farmers,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-03,www.cato.org,18,"For over four months, agitating farmers have surrounded India’s capital, New Delhi, often blocking major roads and railway lines. They stormed Delhi’s fabled Red Fort on India’s Republic Day, January 26. The protesting farmers want the repeal of three farm reform laws enacted in September 2020, and all attempts at compromise have failed. The Supreme Court suggested resolution by a committee of experts but the farmers rejected the committee. The spectacle of thousands of farmers camping in tractors in the winter cold around Delhi for so long has drawn admiration and sympathy from many in India and abroad. Yet the farm reforms are actually overdue changes that will benefit Indian agriculture in the long run. The agitators represent the richest, most subsidized farmers rather than impoverished victims. Farmers in all democracies form powerful voting blocs that extract concessions from governments. India’s farmers are no exception.Many countries have price supports for farmers. India instituted Minimum Support Prices (MSPs) in the 1960s to persuade farmers to switch to the high‐​yielding varieties introduced by the Green Revolution. Absent MSPs, local gluts would have arisen, prices would have crashed, and farmers would have abandoned the new varieties. The Green Revolution started with wheat in the states of Punjab and Haryana, near Delhi, which have always boasted the highest yields. Their farmers were long hailed as heroes for transforming India from a starvation in the 1960s to self‐​sufficiency in the 1990s and later a net exporter.But this came at a cost. Using their voting clout, they created competition between political parties to provide ever cheaper inputs. They now get electricity and canal water free, and fertilizer and bank credit at highly subsidized rates. This has been environmentally disastrous. Free electricity ended incentives for energy‐​efficient pumps or controlled irrigation. For the summer crop, Punjab farmers switched from traditional maize to rice, a water‐​guzzling crop made very profitable by free water and electricity. Over‐​pumping has destroyed aquifers and lowered the water table dramatically. First, drinking water wells ran dry. Then the shallow borewells of smaller farmers ran dry. The richest farmers with the deepest borewells benefited most.Punjab and Haryana farmers harvest their rice crop in October to November and then burn the stubble to enable quick sowing of winter wheat. The resultant air pollution kills and maims thousands in Delhi and neighboring areas. Laws enacted to stop stubble burning are ignored with impunity.Economist Ashok Gulati reveals that Punjab farmers get annual power subsidies of $1.1 billion and fertilizer subsidies of $665 million, averaging $1,626 per family. This is close to India’s per capita income. In addition, farmers get subsidized credit, periodic loan waivers, and cash grants that vary from state to state. High real farm income in Punjab translates into high land prices of around $100,000 per acre, so even small farmers with five acres are among India’s wealthy.Of the three proposed reforms, one abolished compulsory sale by farmers in government‐​regulated markets within each state, freeing farmers to sell anywhere in India and avoid market taxes. The second amended old legislation that empowered state governments to block inter‐​state movement and place stock limits on what traders could hold. This latter clause made it impossible for modern private sector warehouses to come up. The new law will facilitate modern private sector warehouses. A third law created a legal basis for contract farming. All three measures have been recommended by agricultural experts for years.But Punjab farmers have interpreted the reforms—correctly—as the start of a process to end ever‐​rising government subsidies and support prices and move towards a more market‐​oriented system. They prefer the status quo, where they can use voter strength to extract ever more rents from the government. They will not be able to do the same in a free market system.Only 6% of Indian farmers benefit from government procurement of wheat and rice, but these are concentrated in Punjab and Haryana. Two major farmer associations in the states of Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh have welcomed the reforms, but the Punjab farmers are close to Delhi, have surrounded the capital, and claim to speak for all farmers.To end the agitation the Modi government has already promised too much—assured continuation of free electricity and procurement at minimum support prices. Yet the farmers will not budge an inch on demanding repeal of the three reforms.An authoritarian government like China’s would have quashed the agitation by force. That is not possible in democracies, where the farm lobby can use its voting clout to extract concessions unavailable to other forms of livelihood. This is a sort of blackmail. The government should hold firm against it. The storming of the Red Fort, and raising by some farmers of the blue flag associated with the Sikh secession movement in Punjab, have already cost the agitators some public support."

With a rapidly spreading virus, procedural bureaucracy or a failure to grease the wheels for vaccine rollouts will be found to have cost tens of thousands of lives in each advanced country, alongside incalculable damage to livelihoods.As I explain in my forthcoming book, Economics In One Virus, governments have certainly spent big on testing, tracing, and vaccines. But the sums are piddling in comparison to the amount allocated for economic relief.The latter is demanded by voters, but it would have been wiser to put more funds into paying over‐​the‐​odds to encourage vaccine manufacturing scale‐​up, to overcome bottlenecks, and to facilitate around‐​the‐​clock rollout as soon as vaccines were ready. This would have handsomely paid for itself in a more rapid economic normalisation, not to mention the lives saved. As economist Alex Tabarrok has written, this was the easiest cost‐​benefit analysis in the world for policymakers. When the inquiries begin, governments will lament their relative stinginess on spending where it mattered most.With a rapidly spreading virus, procedural bureaucracy or a failure to grease the wheels for vaccine rollouts will be found to have cost tens of thousands of lives in each advanced country, alongside incalculable damage to livelihoods.As of writing this on Monday, the UK’s vaccine rollout performance is improving still, of course, with nearly 600,000 jabs registered Saturday and England’s figures for Sunday up 45 per cent on the week. It might seem a bizarre time then to lament that we didn’t go quicker still. Yet two months after the first vaccine was approved, still only around 14 per cent of the public have received at least one dose. While the manufacturers and the NHS are (understandably and heroically) pulling every lever given where we are, we will surely regret in future not having had an Israeli‐​style mobilisation in place.That’s not to say the UK’s performance has not been *relatively* impressive. The dexterity of the MHRA in understanding the trade‐​offs associated with the approvals process puts the US to shame, as that country stalls on approving AstraZeneca’s vaccine despite tens of thousands of Americans dying per week. The UK government’s willingness to stump up more cash has exposed the false economy of the EU’s haggling over pennies in contracts too.For the costs of delay are exacerbated by the way this virus and the vaccines operate. An infection might take three to four weeks before it manifests as a death. Vaccines themselves take a couple of weeks before they are high efficacy. So now we see the consequence of the relative lack of acquired protection for many elderly people in mid‐​January. It is only in the next three to five weeks that we should start seeing the big vaccine‐​induced falls in mortality, if indeed vaccines really do have near the 100 percent touted effectiveness in preventing deaths.The Covid‐​19 Actuaries Group (CAG) believes that if the Government delivers on its eminently achievable target of vaccinating all over‐​70s, care home staff, frontline health and social care workers, and the clinically vulnerable, by mid‐​February, daily Covid‐​19 deaths will fall by two‐​thirds by the end of the month. By the tail end of March, deaths should be down 86 percent against a world without vaccines. So one can understand the angst inside the EU—their tardiness in getting vulnerable populations vaccinated will cost lives that will be all the more observable if British trends go as expected.How many extra deaths have we avoided through our speedier rollout? Calculating the exact magnitude is extraordinarily difficult. Lockdowns and tier restrictions perversely lower the immediate “lives saved from vaccines,” because without them more people would have been exposed. Working out how many lives the UK will save compared to the EU in the coming months is also muddied by not knowing the eventual speed of each country’s vaccination program or the underlying prevalence of the disease for the nations.But comparing the UK to France, Germany, Italy and Spain (the EU‑4) gives us an idea of magnitudes. These countries have only vaccinated between two and four percent of their populations respectively, and are currently vaccinating at a rate of 0.11 to 0.12 percent of their populations per day.The UK has vaccinated 14 percent of its population, and is currently vaccinating over 0.55 percent of its population per day. If extrapolated forwards, the UK would vaccinate its four priority groups once by mid‐​February. The EU‑4 would achieve the same proportion of population dose numbers by mid‐​to‐​late July. Indeed, even if the EU‑4 were suddenly able to up their daily vaccinations to UK rates from now, they would not hit the same number of doses as a proportion of the population as the UK’s February target until early March—three weeks behind.My calculations based on the Covid‐​19 Actuaries Group report suggests that, if the vaccine is 100 percent effective in eliminating death, the UK has already seen around 1,300 fewer deaths as a result of vaccines. Given the lags discussed between infections and deaths, as well as the time it takes for vaccine efficacy, this is almost certainly close to 1,300 more lives saved than would have been saved had we been as tardy as the EU.Projecting forwards to how many lives are being saved from the recent and current vaccinations is more difficult. We have to try to model what cases and deaths would have looked like absent a vaccine. We would also need to know how fast the EU vaccination program will become, something that I profess no knowledge of.But, for illustrative purposes, let’s assume that, absent a vaccine, deaths would otherwise have fallen through February and March as a pure reflection of how they rose in December and January. Under this scenario, the UK has already locked in 9,000 fewer deaths through mid‐​April than if it had moved at the EU‑4’s vaccination pace to date (saving 20,000 lives overall). And that’s assuming the EU‑4 countries wake up tomorrow and suddenly match the UK’s speed.Realistically, of course, some of the EU‑4 are not planning to widely vaccinate for a month or two, while they are sticking to the regimen of two doses sooner that will leave fewer people on the Continent protected in the near‐​term. So, it’s very safe to say the UK will have saved tens of thousands of additional lives relative to going at the EU‑4’s pace over the coming months, with the gap especially dramatic if the EU does not up its game in the very near future or if, as a result of vaccinations, the UK then relaxes its lockdown restrictions. The costs of delay in public health and economic terms are clearly enormous."
5351,1918: When the Feds Controlled the Conversation On A Pandemic,10.0,34.33,https://www.cato.org/blog/1918-when-feds-controlled-conversation-pandemic,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-02,www.cato.org,18,"Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the model of a marketplace of ideas in which strong arguments drive out the weak has sometimes taken a beating. Erroneous theories of the virus and how it spreads, bogus data interpretations, and ineffective therapeutic ideas have spread faster than sober correction could keep up. Although the federal government was itself the source of no small amount of misinformation and confusion — most notably, though not solely, in former President Trump’s rambling White House briefings on the virus — some progressive thinkers remain convinced that the most serious way to fight a pandemic is for Washington, D.C. to lay down a central messaging line based on the thinking of authentic experts. With that line set down, so the theory goes, the other institutions of civil society, from the media to professional groups to local officialdom, should fall in line and reinforce that messaging. (Today, members of the House Energy and Commerce Committee pressured Facebook, Google, and Twitter to do more to take down misinformation about Covid vaccines.)Trouble is, when governments have achieved serious control over conversation about pandemics in the past, they’ve been known to make things much worse. Front and center is America’s experience during the lethal flu pandemic of 1918, which occurred during the wartime presidency of Woodrow Wilson. John M. Barry, author of the magisterial The Great Influenza (as well as a religious studies scholar who has spoken on Cato programs) tells the story in a 2009 Nature piece:The U.S. government used the same strategy for communicating about the disease that it had developed to disseminate war news. The essence of that strategy was described by its main architect, writer Arthur Bullard: “Truth and falsehood are arbitrary terms … There is nothing in experience to tell us one is always preferable to the other … The force of an idea lies in its inspirational value. It matters very little if is true or false.” Fellow adviser Walter Lippmann, another architect of this strategy, sent President Woodrow Wilson a memo saying that most citizens were “mentally children” and advising that “self‐​determination” had to be subordinated to “order” and “prosperity”. In 1917, the day after receiving Lippmann’s memo, Wilson issued an executive order to control all government communication strategy during the war that was premised on keeping up morale.As a result, when the full‐​blown and lethal pandemic wave arrived in the United States in September 1918, Wilson never made a single statement about it, and lesser public figures provided only reassurance. US surgeon general Rupert Blue declared: “There is no cause for alarm if proper precautions are observed.” Local health officials echoed this message. Chicago’s director of public health, for instance, decided not to “interfere with the morale of the community”, explaining: “It is our job to keep people from fear. Worry kills more than the disease.”…Unfortunately, Philadelphia’s communication strategy [of inappropriate reassurance] was the rule, not the exception. Local officials and newspapers across the country were either deceptive or said nothing.And note well one consequence: rather than quieting the rumor mill and the popular spread of false ideas about the virus, the tight control of information did the reverse:Lies and silence cost authority figures credibility and trust. With no public official to believe in, people believed rumors and their most horrific imaginings. …Under that pressure, society first drifted, then threatened to fall apart.Yes, it’s messy and frustrating to have a so‐​called cacophony of voices, many of them flatly wrong, sounding at once. But it’s more dangerous to leave things to a single official voice."
5352,At‐​Home Self‐​Administered COVID Tests Without a Prescription May Finally Be Available–It Didn’t Have to Take This Long,2.0,41.67,https://www.cato.org/blog/home-self-administered-covid-tests-without-prescription-may-finally-be-available-it-didnt-have,https://adfontesmedia.com/cato-institute-bias-and-reliability/,2021-02-02,www.cato.org,18,"Yesterday the White House announced it was buying 8.4 million Ellume at‐​home, self‐​administered diagnostic tests it hopes to get to consumers across the country starting later this month. The at‐​home test is cheap and rapid and will enable people who have no COVID symptoms but are nonetheless infected and contagious, to test themselves for the disease. It has been a great challenge to stop the virus from being spread unwittingly by people who are asymptomatic carriers, who may make up 30 percent or more of people infected with the virus. This test should therefore be a great help in getting the pandemic under control. The Ellume at‐​home test received Emergency Use Authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in mid‐​December 2020.At‐​home self‐​administered tests have actually been available at least since last November, when the FDA granted Emergency Use Authorization to the Lucira at‐​home self‐​administered test. But incomprehensibly the FDA requires people to get a prescription from a health care practitioner in order to purchase the test to self‐​administer at home. And providers are instructed to give a prescription only to patients who are symptomatic. These requirements, of course, cancel out any advantages an at‐​home test provides controlling the pandemic.As we discussed last week at a Cato online policy forum, the FDA has a history of restricting the public from at‐​home tests that directly provide them with information about their health status—ranging from at‐​home pregnancy tests to at‐​home HIV tests to at‐​home salivary diagnostic genetic tests. The FDA is paternalistically concerned that autonomous adults may improperly apply the information they learn about themselves—an overly‐​broad interpretation of its responsibility to assure the “safety” and “efficacy” of newly developed tests.It is good that we will finally get to see at‐​home tests make their way to the general public. It is a shame that the public needlessly waited so long."

It has been viewed more than 9,000 times.The post’s caption reads: “An MP in Austria, demonstrated a glass of coke testing positive to Covid19, live in parliament. This is beyond farcical people, only you can stop it”.The video shows Michael Schnedlitz, member of the Freedom Party of Austria (FPÖ), applying Coca-Cola directly to a rapid antigen test in the Austrian National Council on December 10, 2020 in an effort to prove that the test is unreliable at detecting COVID-19.Austria has been using rapid antigen tests as part of a mass testing drive for the novel coronavirus, as noted inthisreport by AFP.A similar claim was shared in Facebook postshereandhere, as well as on Twitterhere.The claim is false.Professor Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and microbiologist at Canberra Hospital and the Australian National University, told AFP that conducting such a test incorrectly could yield invalid results.“If you don’t use any test according to the instructions you will get many more erroneous results, either false positive or negatives,""  he said in an email on December 23, 2020. ""So the Coca-Cola experiment doesn’t not surprise me re giving a false positive result. A lot of the more current rapid tests are very good with better than 90% sensitivity and specificity. Not as good as PCR testing but pretty good and rapid.""Collingnon went on to say that even if there was no reaction to the acid, Coca-Cola contains other chemicals that might change an indicator’s colour, producing false positives.“Bottom line: use a test that has good performance as judged by FDA etc and follow the manufacturer’s instructions to the letter (and I bet none have used Coca-Cola in their instructions!)” he said.In response to Schnedlitz’s misleading claim,Dialab, the manufacturer of the rapid antigen test, said the politician did not conduct the test correctly.The company posted a Facebookvideoon December 12, 2020 of a rapid antigen test for Coca-Cola which returned a negative result.“In a properly executed test, the sample is always swirled first in a liquid (buffer) that keeps the pH constant,” the accompanying post reads.“Such tests should always be carried out by hospital staff or by being carried out by trained individuals to avoid such results and representations,” the post reads.AFP Fact Check has debunked a similar misleading claim inGermanabout applesauce purportedly testing positive for Covid-19."
